1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
This here episode of Linux Unplugged is brought to you by Chris and Wes.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,480
These fine gentlemen have ganged together and bought me

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
the laptop that we'll be talking about in this episode.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,920
So, gentlemen, thank you.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,640
You're the kindest, sweetest people I know.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,440
You're very welcome.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,240
My name is Chris.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,120
My name is Wes.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,160
And my name is Brent.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,200
Hello, gentlemen.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,320
Well, coming up on this here show, yep, we finally gave Brent his Dev1 laptop.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,800
We'll tell you the horrible things Wes and I attempted to do before we gave it to him.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,360
Who us?

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,560
Then we'll get Brent's first hands-on review, his impressions,

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,240
and then my long-term observations because I've had the Dev1

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,880
as long as you can possibly have it.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,200
Plus, we've also got the boost, the pics, and a lot more.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
So before I go any further, let's bring in that virtual lug.

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Hello, Chris.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,280
Hello, Wes.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,080
And hello, Brent.

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,720
Hello.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,120
Hello.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,120
You know, the stamina that this Mumble Room represents right now.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,760
Yeah.

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,720
We are three hours and 36 minutes into live streaming right now as we record

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,120
because we're doing a double on this Sunday.

30
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,360
We're on the road to JPL.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,760
On the road again.

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,440
Very excited.

33
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,480
I have been reading JPL books.

34
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,720
I've been-

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,440
You're nerding out.

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,680
I like that.

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,760
Watching JPL documentaries.

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,040
I've learned a lot.

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,080
There's a lot to learn.

40
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,160
That new tattoo I'm not sure about.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,080
Yeah, it really itches.

42
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,200
And it's been weeks.

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
It's that weird location you chose.

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
They said it was normal.

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
It was their specialty.

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
I did find them on Craigslist though.

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,080
So I'm not so sure about that.

48
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,800
But we're so excited.

49
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,440
By the time you're listening to this, we're going to be well into California.

50
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,480
And Wes will be preparing to join us for the next live episode, which will be

51
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,520
recorded from the road.

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,080
Oh, I'm very excited about all of that.

53
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,200
So before we start the show, before we get into the new gear, let's say good

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
morning to TailScale.

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520
Hello, TailScale.

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Go try it for free up to 20 devices.

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,800
TailScale.com.

58
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,280
It's a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard.

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,000
We love it.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
It's going to change your game.

61
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
All three of us are users, right?

62
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,560
Sure are.

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,060
Yeah, wow.

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,200
I think just about everybody at JB is a TailScale user right now because the

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,560
last couple of holdouts, I ended up getting converted over because I'm just

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,720
sharing things with them through TailScale.

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
So they had to get it.

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,040
And now everybody's fine.

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,600
I think so.

70
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,520
I think it's so great.

71
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,040
TailScale.com.

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,920
Try it for free up to 20 devices and tell them the unplugged program.

73
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,080
Since it builds a mesh VPN around the WireGuard protocol.

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
Yeah, if you don't have a mesh VPN, I mean, what are you doing?

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,320
I hoard that which your kind covet.

76
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,760
And now it's time for the baller boost.

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,360
We don't usually do these at the top of the show, but we had a couple of

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
special boosts and one of them we want to expand on and just make it a

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
topic in the episode.

80
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,440
But our first baller boost came in from Nate King, who boosted in the

81
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,160
episode number plus one hundred thousand boosted in four hundred and

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,960
seventy seven thousand stats to the show.

83
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,880
And so happy episode for seventy seven.

84
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,840
Have fun at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,720
You know, Jerry, I'm not going to tell you that these will increase in

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,880
value or even hold their current value.

87
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,600
The truth is you bought them because you like them.

88
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,800
They have value to you.

89
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,680
That's what matters.

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,840
Now, what happened is Nate King stepped up and I did a challenge to say,

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,160
all right, see if somebody can boost in at the current episode number.

92
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,800
And he did it.

93
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,280
And I want to thank him because this does a couple of things.

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
When these stats come in to the show, we don't just sit on them and do

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,040
nothing with them.

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,480
We put them to work.

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
So the way the Lightning Network works is you secure channels between

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
nodes with stats.

99
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,080
You ensure there is a certain amount of liquidity to transfer value

100
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,440
across that network.

101
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,800
So when these boosts come in, we turn around and we reinvest those

102
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,520
stats into channels that build out the value for value network.

103
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,120
And we're building out channels between the podcast apps, between

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
Albie, Brent's node.

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
When Wes finally sets up a node, we'll set up a channel to him.

106
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,560
So we're putting these stats to work.

107
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,280
They're not just sitting in some wallet, not doing anything.

108
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,600
They're actually building out the Lightning Network.

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,520
And of course, if at some point, for some reason, we needed those stats,

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,320
we could close the channel and get the stats back.

111
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
But it gives us the ability to create something that's more robust,

112
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,640
that doesn't require my time to manage and monitor as much.

113
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,000
Listener Caspian, just today, this morning before the show started,

114
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,760
set up a million dollar stat channel between us and him to help route

115
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,720
the boost into the show.

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,520
That's incredible.

117
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,320
It really is.

118
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,280
And so, Nate, I'm going to put those stats to work.

119
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,240
So thank you very much.

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,880
I really appreciate that.

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,560
And we don't just sit there and don't do anything with them.

122
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,920
We make them work.

123
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,160
And so we get value from them today.

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,440
And then potentially down the road, one would hope they could be worth a lot more.

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,600
And then we could choose to invest them into the network to build out more capacity,

126
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
more content, more gear, more experiments, more research, whatever it is.

127
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,880
So your stats are working today, and ideally, they'll be working even harder years down the road.

128
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,520
So a big thank you to Nate for boosting it.

129
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,480
What Nate did is we said, Nate, can you boost in the next episode number and add 100,000 to it?

130
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,560
And while we were live, he did it.

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,600
It's absolutely awesome.

132
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
It's only like two hours ago, really.

133
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,400
That's amazing.

134
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,160
And to keep that rolling, Jason Y boosted in, our second baller who's kicking off a discussion

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
this week that I really want to get into with 252,087 sats.

136
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,960
He writes, I hate Android, iOS, iPadOS, et cetera.

137
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,320
OK, I think I get the idea.

138
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
He says, I backed the F-Tech Pro 1X.

139
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
It was supposed to come with Ubuntu Touch.

140
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,800
Instead, it shipped with Android.

141
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,280
Mom.

142
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,800
Man.

143
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
He says, I can install Ubuntu Touch on it.

144
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,400
But Ubuntu Touch just isn't able to connect to Verizon, which is the network he uses.

145
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,680
And additionally, the 4G LTE network doesn't work on Android anymore, as well,

146
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,200
Verizon is shutting it down.

147
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,920
And their regular 4G network is also shutting down soon.

148
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,920
So I soon won't be able to even use Android the way I use it.

149
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
What should I do?

150
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
Should I switch carriers?

151
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
Should I get a separate feature phone?

152
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,760
Should I use the Pro X with a SIM card?

153
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,840
What do I do?

154
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,680
I do I think Canada is keeping their 4G for a while.

155
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,960
So if you don't mind moving, is that for coverage reasons?

156
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,160
Yeah, we do have coverage challenges for sure.

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,960
I would imagine.

158
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,640
I think we just gave up.

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,200
I think we just gave up 2G at the start of the year, if I remember correctly.

160
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,320
So I think it's a bit of a shame.

161
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:10,320
I think keeping these lower bandwidth, lower frequency, or low data devices, you know,

162
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:10,960
things like that.

163
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,240
This is a tricky situation, Jason.

164
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,120
And what's been getting kicked around based on the boost and the emails that we've been

165
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,760
getting from the audience is some of us are thinking about trying out Graphene OS pretty

166
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,480
seriously.

167
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,360
I know, Wes, you're thinking about maybe putting on your Pixel 6.

168
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,560
It'd be fun to try.

169
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,440
It would.

170
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,720
And Graphene OS promises to be a private secure mobile OS that de-Google-ifies Android.

171
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm sure probably most of you listening probably know about this.

172
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,160
It's a big task, but it kind of checks all the boxes.

173
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,480
And I've been looking at devices that Graphene OS supports.

174
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,920
It's pretty much the Pixel devices.

175
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,600
But I got the Pixel 3 so I could give it a go in the future.

176
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,840
But I thought for Jason, I wonder if he's considered the KaiOS devices.

177
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
Are you guys familiar with this?

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,520
No.

179
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,120
KaiOS is a Linux-based OS that's meant for something that lives between a feature phone,

180
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,880
like a flip phone, kind of basic phone, and something that lives between Android.

181
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,840
And I'll put a link in the show notes.

182
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,920
There's a whole range of devices, from BlackBerry-looking devices, flip-looking devices,

183
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,600
to touchscreen devices.

184
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
I think I've seen these.

185
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,320
I looked maybe six months ago.

186
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,360
And are these the ones that, well, clearly they are.

187
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,120
They ship with the software on them.

188
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,600
And I think they're available in Europe, if I remember correctly.

189
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,200
I'm not sure if it's North American.

190
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,800
But they look really interesting.

191
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,760
Yeah, the one that seemed the most appealing to me was the Hammer 5 Smart.

192
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,640
So this is essentially a feature phone.

193
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,840
It's got a dial pad, like an actual dial pad.

194
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
I'm going to have to relearn T9.

195
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
Yep, actual answer and hang up buttons.

196
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,760
And it's IP68 certified, dust and water resistant.

197
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,120
And it's got like this super hardy housing.

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,320
It looks super rugged.

199
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,160
I think you can drive over this thing.

200
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
Like, it looks like a little tank.

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
And it runs this Kali OS.

202
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,200
I also have heard of Kali OS, which is a direct graphene alternative.

203
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,040
I'd be interested in hearing from the audience if they've tried it or not.

204
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
I've heard good things about it.

205
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,640
I don't think we hear about it quite as often as graphene OS.

206
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,040
But I am very curious about it.

207
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
So if anyone's tried it, please write us in.

208
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,920
And then one thing I just wanted to say to Jason kind of sincerely, because I know switching

209
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,400
carriers can be a real pain in the neck.

210
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,040
But if you have good GSM coverage in your area, which can be an if in the States, but

211
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,440
if you have good GSM coverage in your area, you might want to consider looking at like

212
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,280
your T-Mobile or something like that.

213
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,680
And then this Nokia 27060 flip, how cool does this thing look?

214
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
It's an old school flip phone with a modern OS.

215
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,840
It's got 512 megs of RAM.

216
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, well, things going to get you far.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
You could probably put Apache on it, you know?

218
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,240
Can and should.

219
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
Can and should.

220
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,440
Yeah, absolutely.

221
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
I mean, I hope you got SSH on it, too.

222
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Like a gentleman.

223
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,000
Now, can we get Tailscale on there?

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,360
I think you probably could.

225
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll put a link in the show notes, though, to the Nokia 2760, graphene OS, and the Kai

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,040
OS devices.

227
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,280
I think somewhere in there, there might be a solution.

228
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:31,600
I am really considering if it works out, the Pixel 6 and graphene OS, my biggest hesitation

229
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
would be the camera.

230
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,160
I'm not saying I'm going to do this, but one of the things that's in the back of my mind

231
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,720
is maybe I just switch to a point and shoot.

232
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,760
I don't know.

233
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,880
I don't know, because like, you know, I'm in the studio and I need to get a picture

234
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,440
or something.

235
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,920
Like, it's the convenience of the smartphone.

236
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,040
So, I need a camera that's good enough for like the day-to-day, like I just need to capture

237
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,600
this.

238
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
Something to become one of those folks.

239
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,280
You just got to kind of always dangle it on your neck.

240
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,320
Yeah, like my grandbeast.

241
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,360
You got your overalls on.

242
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,400
Pens and stuff, right?

243
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm going to have like a camera.

244
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,800
Send your pocket protectors.

245
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,080
Two different phones.

246
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,440
I think, though, Chris, if you can find a point and shoot that can handle something

247
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,680
like photo sync or something, you know, an easy way to get those photos off of that camera,

248
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,120
I think that's really where that would fall apart for you, because if, you know, to take

249
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
the card out and put it in a computer, I've seen you try to do that after a trip.

250
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
You know, it happens, but not always right away.

251
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
They got them Wi-Fi.

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
They do.

253
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,720
It's true.

254
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,040
With the auto transfers, you know what I'm saying?

255
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,400
You like that?

256
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
The auto transfer.

257
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
Geek Squad, you've sold me.

258
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,000
The auto transfer.

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,200
Who knows if it works, though, with Linux or like does it require a desktop client or

260
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,840
something like that?

261
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,040
So much exploring still to do, I have to say.

262
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:52,960
And then, amazingly, incredibly, for a fourth week in a row, by an absolute miracle, John

263
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,360
A is a baller booster with 50,000 SATs.

264
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,860
Wow.

265
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,640
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

266
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,920
For a fourth week in a row.

267
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,960
I think that's a record.

268
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,520
I think technically it was a mistake.

269
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,240
It's a mistake of absolute luck, though, right?

270
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,920
Because he happened to boost the same thing in twice.

271
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,760
They are different messages, but they are of the same thing.

272
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,240
I think he thought it failed to send, so he sent it again.

273
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,760
But the weird thing is, days in between, like four days.

274
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,960
Not like just immediately after.

275
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,460
No.

276
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:35,280
And due to this weird technical possible mistake, he was able to send the same thing in twice.

277
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:42,400
And by mistake, John A, for four episodes in a row, has been a baller booster.

278
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,160
And again, he says, thank you for doing a show about the reasons I love GNOME.

279
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,680
That's what we are, we're the GNOME show.

280
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,280
Close to the last message, but not actually the last message.

281
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
Amazingly so, right?

282
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,680
Are you pulling up the last message to compare them?

283
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,560
You should.

284
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,760
Just to verify that I am right, and I'm not making this up.

285
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,280
I hate when that's what I'm doing.

286
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,520
Actually, I joke, but John A, if you accidentally baller boosted twice,

287
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,640
and just somehow managed to get a four-episode streak.

288
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,560
Thank you for doing this show dedicated to all the reasons I love GNOME.

289
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,160
And for validating my preference.

290
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,080
It's slightly different, right?

291
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,160
John A, if you want a refund, you just let me know.

292
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,800
I will happily send you 50,000 sets back, because you've been such an awesome supporter.

293
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,520
But technically, right now, you have boosted, as a baller, four episodes in a row,

294
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,160
which is a new record. Congratulations, sir.

295
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,720
This didn't seem possible, because we're doing the two episodes back to back.

296
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,480
Perfect planning.

297
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
I am so impressed.

298
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
Miracles do happen, guys.

299
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,400
linode.com slash unplugged.

300
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,280
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account,

301
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,960
and it's a great way to support the show.

302
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,880
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

303
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,800
Burn it into your brain for when you need it.

304
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,960
Linode is the Linux Geeks Cloud.

305
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,760
You can feel it.

306
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,840
It permeates everything when you're using Linode in a great way.

307
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,600
Kind of smells like chocolate chips.

308
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
They got 11 data centers worldwide.

309
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
They've been hard at work for nearly 19 years,

310
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,600
creating the best experience to run applications on Linux.

311
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,320
The business has made it on building a great product.

312
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,480
And I have to say, if you like to build it yourself, or you know what?

313
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
If you like to just do the one click deploy thing, Linode has a lot of options for you

314
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
and great support if you ever get stuck.

315
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,040
Linode's architected in a way where they've actually

316
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,200
staffed out 365 human support that'll answer your question.

317
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,680
Tier one right there when you call in.

318
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,560
Nobody else can do that.

319
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
The hyperscalers aren't built to do that.

320
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
They're too busy selling books and, I don't know, desktop software.

321
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,080
And the great thing about Linode is it's always improving in its speed.

322
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,760
Its performance is already incredible.

323
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
That's why we choose to use it for everything we deploy.

324
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
But they've always been pumping out new MVME, new CPUs,

325
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,760
just better and better connectivity.

326
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
Years ago, they became their own ISP.

327
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,680
So that way they could be like, you know, absolute root mode on the internet.

328
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,400
It's pretty great.

329
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,720
And after you've used Linode for a minute,

330
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,480
you'll get what I'm talking about with all this stuff.

331
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,280
You'll start to feel it.

332
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,200
Then you'll start to take advantage of things like their API using the command line tool,

333
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,560
which is really slick.

334
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,840
And it's odd to say for a command line tool, but it's also well designed,

335
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,880
if you know what I mean.

336
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,800
And Linode's also just packed full of tutorials and guides.

337
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
So you can kind of just get your game up to the next level.

338
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,840
In fact, I will link in the show notes a free e-book, no strings attached.

339
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,760
You don't have to give them your email or anything like that,

340
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,800
to get the Docker Security Essentials e-book that they've partnered up to publish.

341
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,760
It's a decent little read and it focuses on securing the Docker platform on Linux,

342
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,040
making sure you have some fundamentals of the Docker CLI as well,

343
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,760
and some system defundamentals to make sure your system is protected.

344
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,640
They're just giving it away.

345
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,240
And obviously it's something you might want to do on your Linode as well,

346
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,040
but it's something you could do on your home systems, your on-prem as well.

347
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,240
That's Linode, the best customer support, super fast rigs and networking,

348
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,320
and a Linux culture that runs deep.

349
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,640
There's so many reasons to choose Linode,

350
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,960
but I think you should just go try it for yourself.

351
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,840
So let's put it over the top.

352
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,120
Go get that $100 in credit and support the show.

353
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,920
So you go to linode.com slash unplugged.

354
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Again, one more time, support the show at linode.com slash unplugged.

355
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Well, you're too late.

356
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,720
One of the meetups has already happened at least as we record this.

357
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,520
Maybe two.

358
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,080
I don't know.

359
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,720
Brent, do you know?

360
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,560
Schedules are hard at this point.

361
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,840
Dates are so hard.

362
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,840
And I went to go check the meetup page, but I got a 502 gateway.

363
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,240
No.

364
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,640
Yeah, meetups happen to doubt it.

365
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,080
Oh, no.

366
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,560
So later, we'll have robots for you to see if there's any meetups left to attend.

367
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,760
But hopefully, thanks for trying.

368
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
I have a question, actually, Chris.

369
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,840
Are we going to have the tracker up?

370
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,720
Like, can people still kind of last minute?

371
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,320
Oh, you had to bring it up.

372
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,040
Oh, no.

373
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,000
I didn't get the memo.

374
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,360
I was trying not to bring it up.

375
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,480
Well, you didn't say anything.

376
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,920
I want to flash that device to Graphene OS, but it'll break the track.

377
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,960
Maybe we can track Brent instead.

378
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,600
Yeah, there you go.

379
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,400
There you go.

380
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
Gosh, it hurts.

381
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
We will have some more meetups.

382
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,200
And the last meetup is actually Northern Oregon.

383
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,160
We do Southern Oregon, then we get down into Cali, and then on our way back up,

384
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,040
we're going to do Portland.

385
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,160
So, you know, meetup.com slash tubes broadcasting.

386
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,960
You still got time.

387
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,320
We always have links in the show notes.

388
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,600
Y'all know that.

389
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,560
Well, as you probably know, we've been waiting for just the right moment to give

390
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,640
Brent his new Dev 1, because we're just being awful.

391
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,600
Little teases about it.

392
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,320
And we wanted him to unbox it on the show, you know, for y'all to enjoy,

393
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,560
to capture the full experience.

394
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,160
But then, then we decided we'd rather try and prank Brent.

395
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,040
Okay, it's Sunday after Linux Unplugged 4.75.

396
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,440
We're out in the living room, and I'm about to unbox Brent's Dev 1.

397
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,760
I left it in the box all wrapped up because I wanted him to have the experience.

398
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,440
But if we're going to install GhostBSD on this thing, we got to even see if it'll boot.

399
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,880
I have no idea.

400
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,600
So what I have is I have an excessively large kitchen knife.

401
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,120
Right here. Extra sharp.

402
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,160
Yeah, really sharp.

403
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,240
Way, way, way too big, really for any job at all, let alone opening a box.

404
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,720
Maybe you're carving the Christmas roast.

405
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,200
I could be carving the Christmas tree with this knife, too.

406
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,760
All right, this is, it's a nice box.

407
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
Would you, would you like the honors?

408
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,400
I believe the front pops open.

409
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,680
It's like a magnetically.

410
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,880
Oh, this is fancy.

411
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,560
It is. Isn't that nice?

412
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,360
Even the box is nice.

413
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,560
Premium cardboard.

414
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:00,960
Yeah.

415
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,080
It's got a little, it's got a little, it's got a little, it's got a little,

416
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,640
yeah, it's got a little pull tab here.

417
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,520
It's all wrapped up.

418
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
And I'll pull out the power because it's been sitting for a bit.

419
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,760
We'll get this going and put in the USB, which you brought with you.

420
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,960
Premeditated USB.

421
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,880
Don't you carry those around?

422
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,480
So Brian, it was really nice to unbox.

423
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
We were, we thought maybe we could box it back up for you, but there's no way like

424
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
we're going to get this thing rewrapped in wax paper and cellophane or cellophane

425
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,160
or whatever it's called.

426
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,840
We don't have a studio shrink wrapper yet.

427
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,320
Maybe we could, we could put it in the food sealer.

428
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Now we felt like something really different would be fun for Brent just to kind of

429
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,760
really shock him, right?

430
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,720
And the idea of ghost BSD came to mind because it would be a totally unique beast.

431
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,400
But maybe it would support all that fancy brand new hardware in the dev one.

432
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,360
Oh, right.

433
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,400
It's going to have pop on it.

434
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,480
No, I don't think we bother with pop.

435
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,840
I mean, no disrespect to pop.

436
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,800
Yeah, get it in there and let's power it up.

437
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,840
It's been just in that box waiting for him, you know, he's been busy.

438
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,340
Yeah.

439
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,780
Yeah.

440
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,440
Come on now.

441
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,520
I guess I don't remember what key you put in there.

442
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,640
I guess I don't remember what key you pressed to get into the BIOS boot.

443
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,520
It's gotta be F12.

444
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, I did it.

445
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
I just pushed all of them.

446
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,200
That's my trick.

447
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,040
That's how you can tell you used to be a sys admin.

448
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,160
Push all the keys fast.

449
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,000
Hope it just airs out.

450
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,480
Okay, so F9 looks like is our boot key.

451
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,640
And we see the Patriot memory.

452
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,920
Yeah, that's right.

453
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,360
Supersonic Rage 2.

454
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,840
Legit, one of the fastest USB drives I've used.

455
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,520
I hope with a name like that, they better live up to it.

456
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,040
It's booting.

457
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,040
It's booting.

458
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,760
Oh my, oh, okay.

459
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,260
All right.

460
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,760
Okay.

461
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,040
So I probably, I probably just let it go to the default.

462
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,540
Okay.

463
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,080
That's already done that.

464
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,500
Okay.

465
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,040
This is good.

466
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,400
This is good.

467
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,480
The fact that it can show things on the screen.

468
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,800
I didn't know if BSD was going to be able to do that.

469
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,360
I really didn't.

470
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
You know, it's a new AMD, it really didn't.

471
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,720
It is a pretty new setup.

472
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,220
Yeah.

473
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,720
Yeah.

474
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,440
I mean, do they even submit drivers to the BSD kernel?

475
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
Do they waste their time with that?

476
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,960
Let's see if it gets to the desktop.

477
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,760
We're going to find out.

478
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,640
We seem to be just hanging out and the light's not flashing anymore.

479
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,440
No, it's not.

480
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,600
I mean, I can't blame the AMD devs for not, but it would have been great.

481
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,160
You know, what you hope for maybe is that a BSD dev ports some Linux stuff over,

482
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,000
so that way you can use some hardware.

483
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,960
It's just like a new laptop, you know, no bigs.

484
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,360
I'm going to try that again.

485
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,720
Let's try it again and let's see if there's any like a safe graphics mode.

486
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,600
Would that be legit?

487
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,360
That doesn't seem fair.

488
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,600
We might have to come up with a backup.

489
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,720
Ghost BSD might be out.

490
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
Gen 2 it is.

491
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,120
But we'd have to, oh no, we need another option.

492
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
No, we don't have time for that, Wes.

493
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,200
No, no, we don't have enough time to install Gen 2 or any of the other ideas that we had.

494
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,960
And you know, after that sort of heady prank energy faded a little bit, we kind of realized

495
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,600
that maybe, maybe Papa Wes would be weird enough for Brent, you know?

496
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000
I mean, he's been, he's been living that plasma lifestyle.

497
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been

498
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,480
that plasma lifestyle, he's been talking about some of the issues he's had and maybe reconsidering

499
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
life on the GNOME side of the fence.

500
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,320
It'd be kind of interesting to see what Brent thought of trying pop for a while.

501
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,800
Yeah, we realized because we had just recorded the episode, Brent's, you know, plasma bugs

502
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,600
or whatever, Brent's bug battle.

503
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
Our takeaway was, well, I'd like to see, see his thoughts on pop.

504
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,600
And then we started down the road of replacing pop and it was like, well, what are we doing

505
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,000
here?

506
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,320
There's very few new distros that are going to support hardware this advanced, so let's

507
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,200
just keep using pop.

508
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,880
And it is sort of the experience that, you know, you get, most users will get and it

509
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,200
has been, to some extent, curated together.

510
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,080
Totally, totally.

511
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
I was sort of excited about GhostBSD and never given it a try, so we'll have to try that

512
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,400
at some point.

513
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,840
We will have to come back to that, you know, now that it's been the punchline for a bit,

514
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,240
we got to do it with some respect and actually try it out.

515
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,560
I've had my dev one for just over three months.

516
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:43,120
We reviewed the dev one, my first impressions in episode 462 of Linux Unplugged, and we're

517
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,680
recording 477 right now, but we'll have a link in the show notes if you'd like to check

518
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,720
out my first impressions.

519
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,560
I was impressed enough at the end of that first review that we bought one for Brent

520
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,840
at the end of the review.

521
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,680
We wanted to replace his old trusty ThinkPad, which he had done a pretty good job of Frankensteining

522
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,560
together with Alex to make it remain usable.

523
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,640
But when we launched JupyterTube, we kind of just threw a new workload at it.

524
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,600
That H.264 encoding, that's hard for an old laptop, and we wanted a machine for Brent

525
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,360
that could handle the workload of recording the pod without kicking the fans up super

526
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,680
high.

527
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,920
Chris, you're actually, you're forgetting what we were doing at first, which is doing

528
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,840
video on the X240 that I had and then doing the audio on the X250 to spread the load out.

529
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,920
I was just summarizing, but yeah, you're right.

530
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,160
It was we tried to spread the workload out.

531
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,360
It still was too much.

532
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,160
It really was.

533
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,360
And so we realized, you know, one dev one could handle the work that these two laptops

534
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,840
were doing.

535
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,160
Yeah.

536
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
And so it seemed like a good choice.

537
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,560
You know, modern, fast hardware, native Linux support, all upstream drivers, a fair amount

538
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,120
of IO.

539
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,920
It's a good form factor for a traveling brand.

540
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,160
Yeah.

541
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,360
14 inch screen.

542
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,440
You know, you could it's got USB ports, which is nice for hooking up interfaces and

543
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,240
stuff.

544
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,600
Easily upgradable.

545
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,840
You can get to the RAM and the MVME and the Wi-Fi and stuff like that in like 30 seconds

546
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,040
if you got the right screwdriver.

547
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,160
That is key.

548
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,680
And it's a well-supported device and it's an interesting device.

549
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,600
You know, HP just came out of nowhere with this thing.

550
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,720
Yeah, really.

551
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,120
And they kind of managed to pull it off, at least I think so.

552
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm curious to know if you think so, Brent, because if anybody's going to find something

553
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,560
wrong with it, and I mean, this is a compliment.

554
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:30,960
Thank you.

555
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
It's going to be you.

556
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
So how many days have I had this thing now?

557
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,520
I guess the first day, was it?

558
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,760
No, it was on Tuesday, Tuesday, since Tuesday and Sunday to currently Sunday.

559
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,520
So it's early days.

560
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,480
I'll put that there.

561
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,440
But I think first impressions are actually really great.

562
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:53,200
I mean, I'm there's a bit of a hardware chasm that I'm jumping from the X250 to the Dev1,

563
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,800
which is welcomed.

564
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:02,240
And I want to say a huge thanks as well to Jeff, listener Jeff, who chipped in and even

565
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,760
sent to my cabin 64 gigs of RAM to throw in this thing, to just max it out.

566
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
Which Brent has installed.

567
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,720
Yeah, huge thank you.

568
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,800
We had to have many conversations back and forth because I guess RAM is hard to find

569
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,880
in Canada and shipping cross-border just doesn't make any financial sense.

570
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,560
So we got that.

571
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,920
Well, thank you, Jeff.

572
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
That is fantastic.

573
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,320
This thing specked out.

574
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,040
Yeah, he's got 64 gigs of RAM in the Dev1 now.

575
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,080
I don't even know what to do with it.

576
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm ready for Ken, exactly.

577
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
Also, yeah, totally.

578
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Also, just a shout out to listener Jeff, he's given us a really solid parking spot on the

579
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,520
road trip.

580
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,840
So that's he's installing power just for you.

581
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,640
I love you, Jeff.

582
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,360
That's so great.

583
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,640
So your initial, though, testing, you spend a day or two, at least with the stock 16 gigs

584
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,800
or whatever it comes with before you upgrade it.

585
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,440
Yeah, and I will say, we'll hit this later in the show.

586
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,040
We did some benchmarking and stuff with just the stock specs.

587
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,960
But as far as my personal experience goes, those first few days with the 16 gigs was

588
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,720
just great.

589
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,840
And I have to admit, unfortunately, at this point that I haven't noticed a difference

590
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,760
since upgrading to the 64 gigs.

591
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,720
I mean, it's capacity more than speed, and I'm not sure I've thrown enough maybe enough

592
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,280
VMs or whatnot at it just yet.

593
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,120
There will be time for that.

594
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,920
There will be time.

595
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,360
But it was out of the box running pretty amazingly for me.

596
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,480
I got to say, your day to day workload, you probably don't need 64.

597
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,480
I think there's room for some workloads I just haven't allowed myself.

598
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,880
There's some gaming stuff that will be very interesting.

599
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,560
And I think there's also something to be said for some future proofing.

600
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,240
You know, install it now.

601
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,760
Don't have to think about it for the next, you know, I've used my other laptops typically

602
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
for about five years or so at a time.

603
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,080
Right.

604
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,440
So there's something there.

605
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,160
Well, and that's kind of what I like about your perspective on this review is most people

606
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,320
aren't doing a podcast or, you know, talking out their ass about technology all the time.

607
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,960
Is that what we do?

608
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,240
Sure.

609
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,080
So, like, you don't really need to upgrade your laptop or you at least don't have the

610
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,560
excuse.

611
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:11,200
But when you make it, when you make a decision upgrade, you want to see a decent return on

612
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,920
that.

613
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,200
And so that was kind of the angle.

614
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,240
You should improve, right?

615
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,640
Right.

616
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,800
Easier time, you should get more stuff done.

617
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,520
Palatable.

618
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
Should be a palatable upgrade difference, right?

619
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,800
You should be able to taste and see the difference when using the computer.

620
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Otherwise, what are you spending all your hard earned money for?

621
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:24,960
Right.

622
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,640
Things are so expensive right now.

623
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,360
And that was the angle that Brent took on this review is he really looked at like, here's

624
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,000
what I did before.

625
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,960
Here's what I'm doing now.

626
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,160
Here's what the numbers say.

627
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,040
Can I really see a value difference here?

628
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,480
And so I'm curious to know your thoughts there, Brent, from just like sitting down using the

629
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,680
machine, launching the applications you use every day, browsing the web.

630
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,080
Does it feel palatably faster?

631
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
Can you taste the difference?

632
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,600
I think I have to separate out a little bit about the new interface for me.

633
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,480
So I'm trying to set that aside because I think the interface, you know, being new to

634
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,720
the GNOME paradigm, that is slowing me, the human down.

635
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,480
But as far as the machine and its responsiveness, I'd say it hasn't ever really been a problem

636
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,520
since I've been on this thing.

637
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,520
What I am noticing as one of the biggest differences is the heat that's coming.

638
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,280
That's coming off of it, which my cats love the heat from the old machine.

639
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,000
So there's that.

640
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,680
I'll have to have a conversation with them.

641
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,160
We can get you a separate cat blanket or something.

642
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Keep the old laptop around just for the cats.

643
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,500
Right.

644
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,720
But also the noise.

645
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,720
That's one thing that just kind of got to me after a while is this low, well, this constant

646
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,040
high pitch, high pitched fan noise.

647
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,920
And it's just like a very tiny hair blower going at all times.

648
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,400
You know, and if I was working on the website recently, actually doing a bunch of like building

649
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,360
of the Hugo website locally seemed to really push the laptop in ways that I wasn't used

650
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,520
to in the sense that builds.

651
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,320
Yeah, it was a lot of multitasking.

652
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,840
So having lots of browser windows open, you know, certainly listening to music at the

653
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,120
same time, having a, you know, a Docker build happening as well with like live updates going

654
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,760
on when I'm testing a bunch of the PRS that have come in from wonderful listeners who've

655
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,480
submitted some.

656
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,840
So that's what I found really started that.

657
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,760
And also doing our live podcast, of course, started tipping me into the territory of thinking

658
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,040
that that laptop, its time has just come to an end.

659
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,200
And so I'm noticing on this new hardware that the dev one just I haven't yet hit its boundaries

660
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,600
at all.

661
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,400
And I'm going to be curious what it will take for me to eventually hit that point because

662
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,760
I feel like there's way more room than I even realize is there for me.

663
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,320
I agree.

664
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,040
As somebody who's been using it for just over three months, the boundary I hit with it is

665
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,440
gaming.

666
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,480
It's when I have it hooked up to external monitors.

667
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,040
If I just set to like a 1080p or 720p resolution, there's basically no game that laptop can't

668
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,840
play.

669
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,800
And it doesn't have like a fancy dedicated GPU.

670
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,200
Now, and for somebody that's kind of casual like me, I hate to say that, but it is kind

671
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,600
of true.

672
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,000
It's busy.

673
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,960
It's incredible.

674
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,840
I hook up an Xbox controller and I launch the game and there's just about everything

675
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,320
I can play.

676
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,080
And that does push the machine to its max.

677
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,200
And I encouraged you, Brent, to kind of test gaming, even though I know you're not a big

678
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,520
gamer.

679
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,600
But in part, you're not a big gamer because you haven't been able to game.

680
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,960
That's exactly it.

681
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
Yeah, you encouraged me, thankfully.

682
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,520
Thanks, Chris.

683
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:38,560
To install Steam and a few other platforms and to game as a scientific research for this

684
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,360
here episode.

685
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,480
Very important research.

686
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:40,880
Thank you.

687
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,560
I spent many late nights doing that.

688
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:42,880
Thanks.

689
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,280
And really, the first thing is, A, I can game now, which I'm not a gamer because I don't

690
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:51,920
want to.

691
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,400
I am one because I haven't been able to.

692
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,760
And so to know that this laptop, which is the same physical size and everything as the

693
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,200
old laptop is, actually it's a little smaller, can do all of this is kind of a huge realization

694
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
that really I've been missing out all these years.

695
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,480
When I opened Steam, it told me that the last time I'd played Portal, which I guess was

696
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,960
the last game I played, was in 2014.

697
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,560
Oh, Brent.

698
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,120
I know.

699
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,960
And that just made my heart sink.

700
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,640
I was like, gee, what am I doing to myself?

701
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,400
I should allow myself some fun here.

702
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,200
You deserve that.

703
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,080
You work hard.

704
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,960
You deserve that.

705
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,800
So I need some recommendations on what I should be playing these days.

706
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,760
Oh, OK. All right.

707
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,360
You know, I'm going to bring the Steam Deck on the road trip.

708
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,920
Yeah.

709
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,160
So I haven't actually tried a game on it yet.

710
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,360
I only tried desktop mode.

711
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,360
We're totally going to play some Teenage Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge.

712
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,080
Bring it on.

713
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,560
Yeah.

714
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:42,960
Yeah.

715
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,240
You could play it on the laptop, too.

716
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,720
Yeah, it is great to have that option.

717
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,080
I mean, you're not going to buy it to game, but it's great to have that option.

718
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,600
I would describe it as it's a laptop you can bring with you on a trip where you can play

719
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
video games in the hotel room.

720
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,200
And I have wanted that laptop for so long.

721
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't do that anymore.

722
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,120
But when I was when I was staying in hotel rooms and stuff, that's why I don't want.

723
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
I always wanted to be able to play some video games.

724
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,880
And of course, I thought maybe the Steam Deck would be it.

725
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,000
But now I don't do that.

726
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,880
Well, let's talk about some of the physical attributes keyboard.

727
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,040
Right.

728
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,240
You're coming from a ThinkPad.

729
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,000
You're coming from the X250, which has a classic X250.

730
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,440
Well, and before that was an X220, which is pretty famous for its keyboard.

731
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,680
So you kind of have high standards.

732
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,240
In other words, how did the dev one live up to that?

733
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,800
It's true.

734
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,400
Um, I found some of the layout on the dev one is I'm still learning it.

735
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,800
There are on the right hand side.

736
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,760
Chris, if you remember, there's like a big row of keys there.

737
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
And of course, deletes in the place that you expect.

738
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,520
But then they have like page up and how does the article?

739
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,480
It's home page up, page down and then end.

740
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:48,800
OK.

741
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,960
And I am struggling with that one.

742
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,120
I'm really struggling with that one, which is interesting.

743
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,240
But the feel of the keyboard, so some of the layouts a little bit different.

744
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,320
And I think, you know, having spent 10 plus years on ThinkPads, of course,

745
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,840
I'm going to have to remap where I think control should be and such.

746
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,960
So I'm expecting that kind of warm up period.

747
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,560
So I'm trying not to be too hard on, you know, the keyboard for that.

748
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,280
It's not its fault.

749
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,920
It's my fault.

750
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:19,200
But as far as the physical aspects of the keyboard goes, it's been great.

751
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,560
My typing speed has been just as good.

752
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,520
The feel of it, I haven't really thought about.

753
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,680
And I was actually a little worried about that.

754
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,440
I know there's been a lot of talk recently about modern keyboards,

755
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,120
even some of the high end one like the Apple ones and such having issues.

756
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,320
So I was a little bit hesitant there, but it turns out it's actually great.

757
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,200
Well, when you first saw the keyboard, the first thing you asked me is,

758
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,920
well, what about that power button?

759
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,920
That power button is right by the backspace and the delete keys,

760
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,560
right in that like frequently tapped zone.

761
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,640
Has that been an issue for you?

762
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,520
I caught myself this morning trying to hit home in that position

763
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,360
because that's where it is on the ThinkPad.

764
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,840
Yeah.

765
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,760
But I did catch myself before I hit it.

766
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
And actually, I did test.

767
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,520
OK, well, what's the worst case scenario if I do hit this button?

768
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,880
So I did go through.

769
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,080
Pop OS has some options.

770
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,280
You know, you can set the button to do certain things as most OS's do.

771
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,120
And so I've set it to just suspend the laptop.

772
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,520
And that's I think with the speed at which the dev one sort of suspends

773
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,720
and comes back from suspend.

774
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,040
If I hit it by accident, it's actually not a huge big deal.

775
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,640
I have to enter my password or whatever.

776
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,920
It's not ideal, though, right?

777
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,880
It's sort of one of those things you're like, boy, I wish they hadn't put it there.

778
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,760
It's true.

779
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,560
You're right.

780
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,480
And that is a place for a button that can do other things because that button itself,

781
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,640
you can't assign a different keyboard action to which I tried to do, of course.

782
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,280
You know, they've got that for dogs that like sour spray.

783
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,240
We just kind of spray that that key for you.

784
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,480
Right.

785
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,880
And then if he puts his finger in his mouth, he'll learn a lesson.

786
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
Yeah, I have to say, I've never accidentally touched it.

787
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,360
But I have thought from the very moment I used it,

788
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,280
Brent, I thought, oh, this is a huge problem for me.

789
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,000
I think overall, the keyboard works pretty well as somebody who's been using it for a bit.

790
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,480
The arrow keys, I don't.

791
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,320
Yeah, I was going to say the one thing I got to be hard about is that are those arrow keys.

792
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,480
Especially I'm learning in Pop OS.

793
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,960
A lot of the keyboard navigation uses up and down with different function keys

794
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,200
to do workspaces and such, and I'm struggling with the ups and downs.

795
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,440
So is that because the up and down only take up like the width of one?

796
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,920
Yes.

797
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,640
And then you have the two fat left and right keys.

798
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,320
The way Apple used to do it on the MacBook keyboards that everybody hates

799
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,760
is the way it is here.

800
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,720
The keyboard feels a lot better than those butterfly keyboards.

801
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,480
But the design of the arrow keys is that same style.

802
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,480
And if it's the only keyboard you ever use, you can map your brain to it.

803
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,680
But when you use like a whole bunch of different kinds of keyboards,

804
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,680
and this is the only one that's like that, it's tricky to remember.

805
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,280
I think thankfully for me, this will likely be my primary machine, I would imagine.

806
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,280
So I think in time, perhaps I'll get a little more precise about that.

807
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,880
While we're talking about physical attributes,

808
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,360
I know you think the design is pretty good, maybe better than the ThinkPad.

809
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,600
The one thing that you said to me is that the speakers suck.

810
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,800
And I thought, wow, these are some of the best speakers I've heard on a laptop.

811
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,240
So where have you landed in that range from they totally suck to

812
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,960
these are some of the best speakers I've heard on a laptop,

813
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,920
obviously like high-end MacBooks excluded?

814
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,000
Well, you know, it's funny, Chris, I'm glad you brought that up.

815
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,440
Because as soon as I said that, I sort of caught myself because I then realized

816
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,240
that actually I just never, ever used the ThinkPad speakers.

817
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,760
I would always connect to a Bluetooth speaker that I have

818
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
or plug in some headphones or something.

819
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,280
So the fact that in the last few days I've actually used the speakers,

820
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
I think is actually a huge win.

821
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,440
Yeah, you've been playing music as you work, like all day.

822
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,600
Yeah, I've tried not to bother you, but I guess I have.

823
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
No, no, no, no, it's not bothering.

824
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,040
But I just noticed like, we have headphones, Brad.

825
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
I've never seen you do that with your laptop before.

826
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,520
But with the Dev1, you were just playing music.

827
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,160
Yeah, so I think my first impression was like, oh, these are going to be terrible.

828
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,760
And because every experience I've had with laptop speakers have been terrible.

829
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,960
And I think those old ThinkPads are quite bad.

830
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,920
However, the more I've been playing them, it's like, oh, actually,

831
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
this is super convenient.

832
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,400
And not having headphones in my ears at all times that I'm using my laptop

833
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,200
is actually really great.

834
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,720
So I'm going to take that statement right back and I'm going to say,

835
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,440
these are actually good enough and great to have as something that's convenient.

836
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,640
And OK, they might not be the best laptop speakers out there.

837
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,520
I know there's maybe one laptop that has a better, but they're great.

838
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,720
And so, or great enough, let's put it there.

839
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,840
I agree.

840
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,000
They're good enough that you'd be fine watching a movie with these speakers.

841
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,600
You'd be fine playing a video game.

842
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
You know, you can listen to music and it's going to work pretty good.

843
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
You're not going to get the full range of everything.

844
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,280
But you know, it sounds pretty good.

845
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
Like podcasts, I'm in the kitchen.

846
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
I set it on the table while I'm just doing some bread work.

847
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
Tots would be fine for a podcast.

848
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,840
Tots would be fine.

849
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,560
Yeah.

850
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,400
Now, you did throw a lot of punishment at this machine, Brad.

851
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,640
You and I had a lot of fun in the last few days.

852
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,240
We compared the Dev1 to a lot of different systems,

853
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,480
different ranges, including your previous machine.

854
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,440
In some cases, we even ran it up against a MacBook M1,

855
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,800
just to kind of see where it fits in there.

856
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,160
And then for fun, an iPhone.

857
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:18,560
Why not?

858
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,360
And an Android device.

859
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,400
Like, just kind of get the different range of stuff.

860
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
Where do you want to start with the benchmark?

861
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,640
Yeah, we tried a few different benchmarks.

862
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,560
I was not having really done benchmarking before.

863
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,280
I instantly went to the Ferronix suite.

864
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,360
You've used it before, Chris, to do reviews.

865
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,960
And I've talked highly of it.

866
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,360
And I know it's a tool that's well used and well loved.

867
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I do want to mention really quickly, I did struggle with it a little bit.

868
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,800
I installed it via the Docker, the official Docker image that's available.

869
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,000
Because what I wanted to do is compare the Dev1 to the X250,

870
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
just to see what size that chasm is that I'm jumping with this upgrade.

871
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,320
Sure.

872
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,880
Thanks to you both.

873
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
And I thought, well, I got Fedora on that X250.

874
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,400
And so I want to give it as equal a chance as possible.

875
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,280
And so abstract away maybe some of those package differences or such.

876
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,960
So I thought the Docker build would be a good way to go.

877
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,800
And you'll tell me if that was a good idea or not.

878
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,040
But I did find running it actually was a real struggle.

879
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,240
You and I struggle with this, Chris.

880
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,600
And it does some auto package installs.

881
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,160
But it totally misses a bunch of really essential ones.

882
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,800
Some things we were surprised about, actually.

883
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:35,760
So as a quick aside, I think probably the Fronix test suite can use some love.

884
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,320
And I hope some of our audience might get really interested in it.

885
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,400
Some of it I think would be really easy to fix.

886
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,360
Some of it I was able to just install some packages myself to solve most of the benchmarks

887
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,160
that we wanted to run.

888
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,080
So I think that would be a pretty easy change to the Fronix suite that we could help them with.

889
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,800
And so I think we've had such success on our website.

890
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,200
Maybe we can shift our attention there for a little bit.

891
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,320
We probably should have told Brent, too, like, oh, yeah, that installs a whole bunch of things.

892
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,640
Sometimes you got to tie the pieces together in a surprising way.

893
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,120
Yeah, there's so many tests that you can run.

894
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,280
And not all of them have seen love for many years.

895
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,000
Some of them haven't been updated for a couple of years.

896
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,520
And in there, there's just different dependencies.

897
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,560
The URLs change.

898
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,320
So you're doing a lot of attempt to run the benchmark, discover something's missing,

899
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:31,360
go figure out what that package is called in your distributions repository specifically,

900
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,000
install that specific dependency, run it again, see where it fails, repeat the process over again.

901
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,960
You know, I actually expected the Docker image to just have all this solved,

902
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,720
considering it's official.

903
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:42,960
Right.

904
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,680
You would hope.

905
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,120
You would think the Docker image would have it.

906
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,320
It does not.

907
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,600
And then so then you end up basically going in and creating you opening a shell into that

908
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,160
Docker container, working inside that Docker.

909
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,840
I learned a lot about installing stuff.

910
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,720
It's sort of like, well, OK.

911
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,560
And then ultimately, a Docker container doesn't necessarily have access to the hardware like

912
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,040
the locally installed application, especially when it comes to GPU benchmarking.

913
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,640
Anyways, these are all things you learned to say.

914
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,680
Ultimately, that you did run some comparisons between the two systems.

915
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:22,000
You did things like timing the Linux kernel build between the various boxes, 3D benchmarking.

916
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
I mean, you actually got pretty far in all of it.

917
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,360
Yeah, there was also a workstation suite test suite on OpenBenchmark.org that I thought,

918
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,360
well, the name sounds appropriate and does a whole bunch of tests for just to see if

919
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,840
the system's up to kind of a workstation standards.

920
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,920
And I thought, well, that's the best thing I'm going to run.

921
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,680
And it ran a lot of tests.

922
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,160
Yeah.

923
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,080
I think it took the dev one about 40 minutes to run them.

924
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:52,560
And it took the ThinkPad like about three and a half hours to get through them.

925
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,520
At one point, we thought maybe the ThinkPad had given up the ghost.

926
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,960
Oh, man, I thought something was wrong.

927
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
But no, we just left it overnight.

928
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,080
And it just kind of did its thing.

929
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,080
So we do have links to all of these tests where you can compare them side to side.

930
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,240
It's actually kind of fun to see just the difference that I'm getting.

931
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,920
Brent's OpenBenchmark results are available for you to compare against your system.

932
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,400
So you can actually compare how your box does to Brent's ThinkPad and to the dev one.

933
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,280
And when you visit the links in the show notes on the results page, it tells you the command

934
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,520
you need to run to compare this system to Brent's systems.

935
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,960
And so you can see how you fit in there.

936
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,600
Which is great.

937
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,480
I feel like OpenBenchmarking in that way has been really great.

938
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,200
We've been able to compare three, four, five systems at a time.

939
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,360
I think the real trick there, Chris, is changing the URL, right?

940
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:45,920
Yeah.

941
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,160
Well, the way it works is each result has, I guess, a unique ID.

942
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,440
And you can stack those unique IDs with commas in the URL.

943
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,280
And so you can compare multiple systems by dropping the result ID, comma, next result

944
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,120
ID, comma, next result ID.

945
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,560
So compare a few of your machines or compare it to some of ours.

946
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,000
Install it on a VPS somewhere.

947
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,160
I mean, really, you could take this Ferronix test suite, and you could install it on the

948
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,200
various VPSes.

949
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,480
And you could see how much ass Linode kicks in performance.

950
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,600
Because that's what I've done.

951
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,200
And you can see it in the numbers.

952
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,640
So one number that's interesting is the timed Linux kernel build that we did.

953
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,360
And I thought, OK, well, we all love Linux.

954
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,640
And that's a pretty simple test, actually, compared to that workstation suite that I

955
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,140
did.

956
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
And the numbers just tell the whole story, I think.

957
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,480
So it was a timed Linux kernel compilation of 518.

958
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:42,560
The dev one accomplished this in 143 seconds, by average.

959
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,840
The x250, Wes, do you have a guess on this one?

960
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,840
I mean, at least twice, right?

961
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,120
So twice is about 300-ish?

962
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,000
OK, yeah.

963
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,960
Chris, did you look at the number?

964
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,440
Or do you have a guess?

965
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,160
No, I don't want to spoil it.

966
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,640
Go ahead.

967
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,140
All right.

968
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,880
The x250, 716 seconds.

969
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,520
Right, because it's not just CPU.

970
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,280
Right, when you're making a big laptop upgrade like this, it's disk I.O.

971
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,520
It's the memory subsystem, yeah.

972
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,280
But that's the kind of difference between, like, I'm willing to build a custom kernel

973
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,120
or I'm kind of not, right?

974
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,720
Yeah, very true.

975
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,920
Well, and some of these tests actually recommended using a different scheduler to even up that

976
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,420
performance.

977
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,080
So I didn't bother with any of that.

978
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,080
Oh, that's a rabbit hole, Brent.

979
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,280
I knew it was.

980
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,360
I knew you've been there before, so I didn't want to.

981
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:34,080
But an actual real benchmark was how long these systems could build our Hugo website.

982
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,600
That's something I've been doing.

983
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,960
So Chris and I thought, OK, well, we're going to punish this with, like, sort of tests that

984
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,000
just push it to the edge.

985
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But what about real Brent tests that I've been struggling with on this laptop recently?

986
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,120
So recording a show today, we're using a lot of the same, you know, I've got Video Ninja,

987
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,120
one of the pieces of software that I typically use when I'm afar to do the podcast.

988
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,680
And I don't hear a laptop, do you?

989
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,120
No, we're using it in real world productions and it is not making a peep right now, is

990
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:03,620
it?

991
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,120
Nope.

992
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,320
Oh, that's so great.

993
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,160
That's ultimately what we wanted, isn't it?

994
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,640
It's true.

995
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,120
Yeah, yeah.

996
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,600
That was the real test that I think we passed.

997
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,800
That's a relief.

998
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,760
That's nice.

999
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,040
I mean, it's good overall, but that's really the thing we wanted.

1000
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,040
Yeah, but I think the other test that was good was building the Hugo website.

1001
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,960
And so, as you know, it's about 1900 pages on our website.

1002
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,960
I don't know how we've collected so many.

1003
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,600
And it looks like the dev one took about a minute forty seven to build the site.

1004
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:40,400
It was actually a thread in our GitHub issues for the website that tracks my attempting

1005
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,720
to get my local performance better.

1006
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,920
So you have results from a few months ago, right up to this morning where I did some

1007
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,800
new tests with the dev one, and you can you can check that out and build times.

1008
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,160
But the X two fifty this morning actually did all right at about three minutes or so.

1009
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,280
But some of that history got as bad as about five minutes.

1010
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,920
So every PR I want to test was like a five minute lag.

1011
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,440
So I drank a lot of tea.

1012
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:14,000
I just wanted to kind of wrap up with the dev one stuff with my observations on running

1013
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,720
Fedora and Nix on there, which I've run both now.

1014
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,360
At this point, and as you would expect, because everything's been upstreamed, if you're running

1015
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,080
a distribution with a pretty modern kernel, I think probably anything five eighteen, maybe

1016
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,520
even five fifteen or later, you can have just kind of everything built in you need.

1017
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,920
So if your distribution's got a newer kernel, you're good to go.

1018
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,280
And I think we've tried arch on there to possibly I feel like we've tried arch, but I can't

1019
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,280
specifically remember.

1020
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,440
It's all been really good.

1021
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:54,160
Ultimately, I've ended up extremely, extremely, extremely happy.

1022
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,520
That's three with Nix OS on the dev one.

1023
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:04,400
It has truly been one of the peak Linux experiences I've ever had.

1024
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,160
I've gone with the genome shell.

1025
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,320
You know, I get a modern genome shell experience.

1026
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,440
I have picked a handful of extensions, but I install them using Nix packages and they

1027
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,280
just get updated with everything else.

1028
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,040
And it's been really rock solid.

1029
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,160
I get my snapshots.

1030
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,360
I can revert back and the dev one just hums right along.

1031
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,160
In fact, I think it does even better with the newer kernel.

1032
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,640
I've noticed more reliable battery projections with five nineteen.

1033
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,520
And Brent, I don't know if you've noticed this, but with pop for me that shipped on

1034
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,840
there, I kind of saw battery estimations that were a little bit all over the place.

1035
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,400
Yeah, I saw it from eight hours all the way down to like 40 minutes.

1036
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,720
Right.

1037
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,400
Oh, and my co-host Michael Dominic on Coda Radio has also said he has noticed the same

1038
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,280
thing with pop OS.

1039
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,960
And I think it's not actually pop.

1040
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,440
I think it's that version of the kernel and just the AMD drivers or whatever, because

1041
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,720
as I've upgraded my kernel as time's gone on, that has gotten better or maybe whatever

1042
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,520
is doing the guessing just gets more data and gets more accurate.

1043
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,160
So that has been nice to see over time.

1044
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,320
But what I have gone with is the next OS base and then I flat pack things like steam and

1045
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,240
I've been able to play just about every damn game I want using steam as a flat pack.

1046
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,480
And it's just totally the way of the future right now.

1047
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,360
I am loving it.

1048
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,560
It's all Wayland on my end and it's working great.

1049
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,640
It's the smoothest Linux experience I've had in a very long time.

1050
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,200
The only thing I wish and maybe they'll have it in the dev to whatever they're going to

1051
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,520
call it is I'd love a hundred and twenty hertz.

1052
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,640
Oh, you give me upstream native AMD video drivers.

1053
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,960
You give me fully 3D composited Wayland.

1054
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,160
You give me GTK four with its Vulcan back end.

1055
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,040
And then you give me one hundred and twenty hertz screen.

1056
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,440
And I'm like at peak laptop, man.

1057
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,720
You just sold me a laptop.

1058
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,680
I'm just saying, Brent, you have any thoughts on pop OS?

1059
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,840
Just mentioning that before we just wrap up real quick.

1060
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,760
Some early observations.

1061
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,200
I think you'll probably have more time with it.

1062
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,600
Disclaimer there, but just quick observations.

1063
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,440
Well, those who have been listening carefully last week, I was using the Fedora GNOME

1064
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,160
implementation Fedora 36 is for about a week.

1065
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,680
I had some thoughts on that.

1066
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,520
I believe it was in the post show of last episode.

1067
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,360
And so I'm not brand brand new to GNOME, but pops implementation is different enough that

1068
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,560
I think it warrants its own sort of conversation.

1069
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:32,640
I think, again, it's super early days for me spending a week, a very busy week, trying

1070
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,920
to learn its workflow.

1071
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,160
I don't think is enough.

1072
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,200
And I also think just in this sort of sandboxed experience has been really challenging for

1073
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:43,440
me.

1074
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,080
I'm not used to the workflow at all.

1075
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,800
And that made me very inefficient.

1076
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,040
And I have even to the point where I'm starting to look up like tutorials, like how are people

1077
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,240
even using this and how are you being efficient with moving things around?

1078
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,280
So I can use some pointers, I think, on how to just navigate windows, you know, keep them

1079
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,720
in the right place where you need them.

1080
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,160
But often just multitasking a lot.

1081
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,440
I used to use, you know, Chris, you said workspaces do the four finger swipe.

1082
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,880
And I've heard that from a few people.

1083
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,400
Cheese gave me that advice.

1084
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,040
I got a few community members suggest that, too.

1085
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,680
And I didn't find that reliable, actually, for me, for whatever reason.

1086
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
And it's also a huge movement.

1087
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,640
So I did some hot corners, which is working a lot better.

1088
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,120
I think I might need to change some things.

1089
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,320
I'm going to keep going on it.

1090
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,800
I think at least for the duration of the trip.

1091
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
I don't want to change it too soon and not give it a chance.

1092
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,720
There are some super nice features.

1093
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,160
I got to say it's very smooth.

1094
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,440
And the auto tiling.

1095
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,720
Yes, I tried the auto tiling.

1096
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,880
It's kind of really great in certain situations.

1097
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,360
It's neat to turn off and on as you need it.

1098
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,720
So I think, I don't know, maybe we'll revisit revisit after three or four weeks.

1099
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,840
I got to say, you really sound like a plasma user right now, Brent.

1100
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,720
I really am.

1101
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,480
I'm trying not to rub that in.

1102
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,840
No, it's fair.

1103
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:04,800
I've really adopted the horizontal workspace layout on my laptop in the later versions

1104
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,520
of GNOME.

1105
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,800
I've really taken to it.

1106
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,680
And what they're doing with Pop!

1107
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,760
OS and ultimately Cosmic is kind of maintaining the vertical workspace layout.

1108
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,720
And I wonder if maybe that little difference, that spatial difference for you, is what's

1109
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,760
making it not work.

1110
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,800
Because GNOME Shell, I think if you look at how it was fundamentally implemented, considered

1111
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,520
and designed, it was pretty much meant for every major application gets its own workspace.

1112
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,440
And one of the things that underscores that idea is that by default, although most distros

1113
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,080
change this, by default, GNOME doesn't have a minimize or a maximize button.

1114
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,200
That's so crazy to me.

1115
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,480
You can turn it on, but it's not on by default.

1116
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,200
The idea is that every major application, every major window should get its own workspace.

1117
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,640
And then you switch between those workspaces elegantly and quickly.

1118
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,400
That's why they switched to the horizontal layout.

1119
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,160
That's why they implemented the four finger swipe.

1120
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,600
And one of the things I've done to kind of take it up to the next level in my GNOME setup

1121
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:10,720
is I have a extension that automatically opens windows on certain desktop environments.

1122
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,480
Because like a gentleman, I want certain applications on certain desktops.

1123
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,200
So things like-

1124
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,400
We won't ask too much about what those applications might be.

1125
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:18,960
Hey-oh.

1126
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,160
But certain applications like Telegram, Element, they go on desktop two or desktop three.

1127
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,360
Every single time.

1128
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,400
Chrome, Firefox, they always open up on desktop one.

1129
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,520
Every single time.

1130
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,800
I get a dropdown terminal because I want a terminal on every desktop.

1131
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,320
And that's just how I work.

1132
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:41,840
And I think with the kind of gray zone that you're in, you're kind of in this kind of

1133
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:47,920
in between zone where System76 is maintaining an older way GNOME manage these virtual desktops

1134
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,440
because a lot of people like that.

1135
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,160
But when you're on a single monitor on the dev one, I'm just not sure it works.

1136
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,120
I agree.

1137
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,200
Here's how I got GNOME to work for me.

1138
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,720
And I've said this before on the show.

1139
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,200
This is the third time I'll say it and I still say it.

1140
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,240
I still stand behind this.

1141
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:10,960
I challenged myself to adopt one aspect of the GNOME workflow per week for a month.

1142
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,800
So for four weeks, I took something that I never used in Plasma.

1143
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,400
I never did that way in Plasma.

1144
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,560
I figured out this is the way GNOME does it, either by talking to people or chatting in

1145
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,880
our Telegram group or looking it up online.

1146
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,960
And I figured out this is the GNOME way.

1147
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,280
And I challenged myself for one week to use GNOME in that way.

1148
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,680
And I just sort of built on that.

1149
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,560
And by the end of that month, I've been very happy in GNOME.

1150
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,560
I still really like Plasma.

1151
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,440
We have Plasma here.

1152
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,560
We have Plasma there.

1153
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,880
If you look at the frames for our video, they're Plasma.

1154
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,920
I really like Plasma.

1155
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,840
I think they're doing great work, but I wanted to use GNOME on the Dev 1.

1156
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,360
And so I needed to make it work for me.

1157
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,880
I've had to use GNOME before.

1158
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,800
This is the methodology that I've adopted to kind of get in the headspace because everything

1159
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,120
in GNOME is designed from an idea of how workflow should work.

1160
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:06,880
Like every decision is very intentional and it's much more organized.

1161
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,880
And so when you kind of come at it with that perspective and you try to get to the end

1162
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,400
of what they were going for, now you can decide if you like it or not.

1163
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,640
And oftentimes you can change the behavior with an extension.

1164
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,000
But if you start with trying to understand and wrap your head where they're coming from

1165
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,680
and then try to just take that on for a little bit, it'll result, I think, in sort of like,

1166
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,200
you know, kind of adopting some of those ideas and you'll find a workflow balance that I

1167
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,000
have.

1168
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,360
I know it's not easy.

1169
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,400
It takes time.

1170
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,960
It shouldn't really be done in the middle of doing a whole bunch of other stuff.

1171
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:35,520
Right.

1172
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,120
Like a road trip.

1173
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,600
Great.

1174
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,360
Why do we do this to ourselves?

1175
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,280
You might as well use, you know, learn a new keyboard layout too while you're at it.

1176
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,560
You've been wanting to learn Dvorak.

1177
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,360
Right.

1178
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,400
They say it's better.

1179
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,440
And that's kind of like in my world why I like what they're doing with Cosmic.

1180
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,280
I really, really like what the Ubuntu GNOME experience is.

1181
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,560
I think they do a really good job.

1182
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,120
They do.

1183
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,160
Yeah.

1184
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,120
But ultimately, I got to revert to the meme.

1185
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:10,800
And if I just use stock GNOME on Nix or Fedora and then I just decide where I draw the line

1186
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,760
and what works for me and I use an extension to accomplish what I need, it ends up ultimately

1187
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,240
working better in the long run because it's not an isolated experience, not a curated

1188
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,600
isolated experience by this one vendor using this one fork.

1189
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:29,680
It's just sort of that always marching upstream design and it's just kind of like you just

1190
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,440
kind of always got to embrace upstream and just make it work for you.

1191
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,480
You know what I'm saying, Wes.

1192
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,680
You laugh, but you know what I'm saying.

1193
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,320
No, I do.

1194
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:42,080
I just I like how excited you are about the new rolling setup that you have as you've

1195
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,440
embraced Nix more and just sort of played with getting back on GNOME.

1196
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:53,920
Well, it's that and it's using all of this stuff for forever since the late 90s.

1197
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,520
And like just kind of like, well, this is ultimately what really works and you got to

1198
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,880
be realistic about it.

1199
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,480
And I totally respect that everybody wants to put their spin on stuff, different distros

1200
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,280
and makers have to have their branding and their ideas.

1201
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,600
But if you take a 15, 20 year view at this thing, everything ultimately reverts to the

1202
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,040
mean and that's upstream.

1203
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,160
The mean is upstream.

1204
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,480
So I just like the idea that I can build myself a solid rolling machine that follows upstream

1205
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,360
that has fallbacks and has rollbacks built in.

1206
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,640
It's fundamental to the thing.

1207
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,920
And I can make alterations using extensions to deviate from their preferred experience

1208
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,120
when I have to.

1209
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,520
And, you know, sometimes those extensions go away, but I'm not a child.

1210
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,440
On, you know, on net, you're finding enough customization for you.

1211
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:39,940
Yeah.

1212
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,000
I think there are a few things, Chris, that we should do next.

1213
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,240
One of them is I think I'll pick your brain a little bit now.

1214
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,360
I've been avoiding this, but I think I'll pick your brain a little bit now on the extensions

1215
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:51,920
that you love.

1216
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,240
And I'll try, you know, we'll try building that into my ecosystem here and see how that

1217
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,040
changes things.

1218
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,880
I just want you to, I'm just waiting for you to say, can I have your config file?

1219
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,960
I'm waiting for the day.

1220
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,520
The second item I was going to mention is we should do some benchmarks with this exact

1221
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,800
same hardware between Nix and Pop.

1222
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,280
I'd be curious to see if there is much difference at all.

1223
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,360
It's going to be pretty minor, I would bet, if anything.

1224
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,320
I don't know.

1225
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:16,800
I don't know.

1226
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,320
You might be surprised.

1227
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:24,720
Oh, and the third thing is, Wes, how the heck do you manage things on GNOME?

1228
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,160
Are you a GNOME user at all?

1229
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,760
I think he's using Plasma right now, but he surely has tried GNOME.

1230
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah.

1231
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,240
I mean, I think I kind of fall fairly close to what Chris does.

1232
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:40,400
You know, it's stick with mostly stock and then minimal viable extensions to make things

1233
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,960
work.

1234
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,160
But yeah, I don't mind the stock GNOME workflow.

1235
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,160
Things change, so you can't get too invested in any one thing.

1236
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,880
You kind of do as Chris is describing, kind of be willing to ride with the flow as things

1237
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,520
come and go.

1238
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,960
New extensions let you do things.

1239
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,240
Sometimes they disappear.

1240
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:01,200
GNOME decides that you're going this direction one day, this direction the next, and that's

1241
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:01,520
fine.

1242
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,720
You get a new console.

1243
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,160
You get a new text editor.

1244
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:04,720
Yeah.

1245
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,920
You just kind of that's part of what you've signed up for, but you get a really curated

1246
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,280
experience in the most part.

1247
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,440
Well, as a closing statement, I think I just want to say that we did include some extra

1248
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,080
benchmarking.

1249
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,440
We did some Geekbench stuff that was very interesting.

1250
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,920
It was a little simpler to run as well, which was really nice.

1251
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,600
We didn't really run into any issues.

1252
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:32,400
And we did this really nice Unigine superposition GPU test, which the ThinkPad failed miserably

1253
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:32,880
at.

1254
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,400
It got an average of like two frames per second or something like that.

1255
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,880
But the Dev 1 did great.

1256
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,080
You know, I can't give away all the details yet.

1257
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:46,160
But what I can say with extreme confidence.

1258
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,360
Cone of silence moment here.

1259
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:47,920
OK.

1260
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:48,400
All right.

1261
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:48,880
You got it.

1262
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,080
The cone of silence.

1263
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:50,640
You're right.

1264
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:02,560
We had a really unique opportunity because we had a super powerful system in-house.

1265
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,920
It hasn't been released yet, so I can't give any details yet.

1266
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:14,960
So we were able to compare a super powerful system to the Dev 1 to the ThinkPad and kind

1267
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,320
of see like, where does the Dev 1 fit in the value range?

1268
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,120
Like if you could go all out and get the total baller system and you're upgrading from, you

1269
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,160
know, a laptop that you've had for seven years and you're making your next upgrade.

1270
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,440
From last century's laptop.

1271
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:29,920
Right.

1272
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,960
Like what would like what do you what do you miss out on by not spending all of them?

1273
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,640
Not spending all of the money.

1274
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,640
And like, I'm telling you, man.

1275
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:46,880
We got everything like power draw, thermals, like different driver race conditions that

1276
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,360
can like we went deep on this stuff.

1277
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,840
So like we have some really good data.

1278
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,200
We just can't share it yet.

1279
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,360
So you just got to go with this on this one.

1280
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:55,840
Let's go back.

1281
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,360
OK, I'm all just the cone of silence.

1282
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,880
You know, based on some testing that we were able to do, I think the Dev 1 fits in really

1283
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,480
squarely in the value range.

1284
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,720
Like it's not going to blow the doors off.

1285
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,880
You could go out and find a machine if you wanted to really spend top dollar, you could

1286
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,480
find a machine, especially in the next few months, that's going to be faster.

1287
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:23,840
However, this thing starts at like eleven hundred bucks and you get like seventy to

1288
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:29,360
eighty percent of some of that value with some very unique workloads set aside.

1289
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,040
But it really varies.

1290
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,640
I mean, the thing really represents and you can see what we're talking about because we

1291
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,440
do have some of the raw data you can compare against your own systems.

1292
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,360
But I think the value for around eleven hundred dollars is really easily there, especially

1293
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:49,040
when you can just simply get access to the storage and to the RAM.

1294
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,560
And it's already installed more RAM.

1295
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,480
Yeah, RAM and it's already installed more RAM, so it's clearly, yeah, it was very easy

1296
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,280
to do.

1297
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:01,360
Yeah, the trickiest part was us trying to find a T5 Torx, which Chris was like, I don't

1298
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:01,920
I don't have one of those.

1299
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,720
Why would I have one of those?

1300
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,040
Three days later, it turns out it was on the desk beside me.

1301
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,680
Right next to us, the entire time.

1302
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,680
Three minutes and it was a good change.

1303
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:16,800
So I will say for that eleven hundred dollars, you get some pretty amazing like case design.

1304
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:20,880
This thing is built amazingly well and I always, you know, stuck to thinkpads.

1305
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,160
And I think that was an old idea.

1306
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,160
It's like they're great because they're modular and they're, you know, you can buy parts for

1307
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:26,720
them all over.

1308
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,480
They're very, very, very common.

1309
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,480
So it's easy to switch stuff out.

1310
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,360
But to be honest, the build quality of the dev one is is way better, at least than my

1311
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,640
X250.

1312
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,880
But you gentlemen have had recent thinkpads.

1313
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,800
And I wonder how you feel about the difference there.

1314
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:47,680
My only knock is that it's a little heavy compared to my X1, but it's a better build

1315
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,720
than the X1.

1316
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,200
So and it's heavier materials as a result.

1317
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,720
Yeah, it feels very sturdy.

1318
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,800
Yeah, you feel in the bag a little bit more.

1319
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,080
But as a result, you get something that's, you know, it's a sturdy magnesium casing.

1320
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,960
Yeah, you know, and this isn't a paid review.

1321
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,080
They didn't pay us to talk about this.

1322
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,520
We bought this, Wes and I bought this machine.

1323
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,200
And then we sat around for months before we gave it to Brent.

1324
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,560
You know, Jeff sent that RAM to me in Canada, which was amazing.

1325
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,720
And I showed up, you know, in a few days, as you might expect.

1326
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,760
And then I brought it to Alex's when I went to Alex's because I thought I was going to

1327
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,160
send that RAM just in case, you know, I meant to you surprise me by shipping that thing

1328
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,280
because that was good.

1329
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:25,760
Good insight.

1330
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,720
That was my intention.

1331
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,320
And then we all got busy.

1332
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:28,960
Yeah, yeah.

1333
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,600
And this is just some value we wanted to bring to the audience because I've had an opportunity

1334
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,960
to use it for multiple months.

1335
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,560
Brent just get the first impression.

1336
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,080
And we worked really hard at like checking the thermals, checking the power use, checking

1337
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:44,400
this performance, comparing it against multiple systems in the entire spectrum.

1338
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,160
And this is our takeaway.

1339
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,360
And we just wanted to have it out there because sometimes you get reviews that are like they've

1340
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,880
had it for a week or three days.

1341
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,440
Right.

1342
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,320
And now you get a mix.

1343
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,720
You get the first impressions and you get the long time impressions.

1344
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,080
And we wanted to get an opportunity to talk about it because I think this might be my

1345
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,400
laptop for 2022.

1346
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,640
This is, I think, the Linux laptop for 2022.

1347
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,720
It's funny you say it's, you know, your laptop for the year.

1348
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,000
Typically, I keep mine for five.

1349
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,600
So this might be my five year laptop.

1350
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,720
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1351
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,200
Go there to get started for yourself or your business.

1352
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,440
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1353
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,200
It's just the best and easiest way for yourself or a business to store, share and sync sensitive

1354
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:25,600
data.

1355
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,680
Bitwarden is fully open source and is trusted by millions in the community and by a huge

1356
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,720
percentage of the J.B.

1357
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,600
audience as well.

1358
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:39,200
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords, our two factors, passphrases and all of that.

1359
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,400
It's also what I use to manage the business secrets, the things that, you know, you have

1360
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,680
to log into or credentials you need or passphrases or API keys, these things that when you run

1361
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,920
a business, there's hundreds of that stuff.

1362
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,760
It's ludicrous.

1363
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,920
And to try to keep all of that, like, I don't know, in a spreadsheet or something like that

1364
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,000
almost seems like business suicide.

1365
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,240
So Bitwarden is an essential tool for how we manage those types of secrets.

1366
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,920
But something I don't talk very often about is, well, how do we send that stuff back and

1367
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,080
forth between each other, especially now that just about all the time, except for during

1368
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,840
show days, we're all remote?

1369
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:15,840
Well, that's where Bitwarden Send comes in.

1370
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,920
Bitwarden Send is a handy tool that you can use to securely transmit information via end

1371
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,040
to end encryption.

1372
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:28,160
And only the person who is receiving that information can view that text.

1373
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,480
No one in between, no one else.

1374
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,360
So you can use Bitwarden Send to share a typed message, or you can attach a file, and you

1375
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,160
can even set it to auto-destruct or have an expiration date.

1376
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,720
So you can be certain that after the person got the information, it didn't stick around

1377
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,520
anywhere.

1378
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,320
And that is an element I love when it comes time to share some sensitive data.

1379
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,720
Just the other day, we had to move some API keys around for a third party service.

1380
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,840
I had them in my vault.

1381
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,520
Nobody else had them, right?

1382
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,600
That's where something like a Bitwarden Send tool can be so handy because it's a tool

1383
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,360
integrated that you can trust.

1384
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,120
Bitwarden also has the best mobile apps.

1385
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,320
I am such a fan of Bitwarden on iOS, and I've tried it on Android.

1386
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,200
In fact, Android has some really great features with Bitwarden.

1387
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:20,000
But man, the face ID integration with Bitwarden on the iPhone makes entering my passphrases

1388
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,240
feel like the fricking future.

1389
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,920
I love that integration.

1390
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,640
And it means that I can use secure passwords and passphrases on apps and websites, and

1391
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,920
I can move between my desktop and mobile really simple.

1392
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,160
If you're not doing that kind of stuff, you're just wasting time on things you shouldn't

1393
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,640
be.

1394
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,440
And if you know anybody out there who's not taking serious care of their passwords and

1395
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,680
their secrets, maybe point them in the direction of Bitwarden because it's probably the number

1396
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,600
one thing they can do to improve their security.

1397
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,640
You know it.

1398
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:49,680
You know it.

1399
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,640
Don't argue with Chris.

1400
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,680
You know it's true.

1401
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,720
So let's help him out.

1402
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,800
So let's help him out and help the show.

1403
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,640
Everybody now, bitwarden.com slash Linux one more time.

1404
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,480
Support the show at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1405
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,920
As always, we got some great feedback.

1406
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,040
Thank you, everyone.

1407
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,240
This week's feedback, I think, is really great.

1408
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,200
Sasha wrote in about some GNOME stability.

1409
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,200
Love 4.75.

1410
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,120
Brent mentioned encountering many bugs when using GNOME on Fedora.

1411
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,880
I've been running Fedora Silverblue on my 2016 Dell XPS 13 dev edition for many months

1412
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,040
and the experience has been totally seamless.

1413
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:35,280
I also run GNOME via Fedora Workstation on my HP Dev 1 work laptop, which does complain

1414
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,000
about kernel errors from time to time on boot.

1415
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,680
But I haven't noticed anything actually not working.

1416
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,240
So the hardware you use definitely matters.

1417
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:49,920
Yeah, I'm curious, Brent, as time goes on, if you will experience less issues.

1418
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,840
Well, I do have a list of four bugs that I found in Pop OS so far.

1419
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:01,840
And of course, they were lovely and they were like, OK, we've got a spot for you to submit

1420
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,000
those.

1421
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,920
So I think I'm going to work closely with them just to put some of these suggestions

1422
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,440
in and they're little things.

1423
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:09,920
Sure.

1424
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,600
Nothing crippling like I experienced last week on my workstation, just kind of black

1425
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,560
screens and such.

1426
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,480
But so far, so good.

1427
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:24,000
I am a firm believer that when you use all free software drivers for the majority of

1428
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,880
your hardware and when everything's upstream, you just inherently have a more stable Linux

1429
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,440
experience.

1430
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,280
I think the number one thing you can do to make a system stable is to use all upstream

1431
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:35,600
drivers.

1432
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,640
Do you agree, Wes?

1433
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,000
I mean, it's all tested.

1434
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,760
It can all be tested together, right?

1435
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,520
It's it complies with the same thing.

1436
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,720
You're not having to load in an external module after the fact.

1437
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,200
Yeah.

1438
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,000
It just makes sense.

1439
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,120
And you know how you get that external module is the vendor gets the kernel release after

1440
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:51,920
it's already out.

1441
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,760
They if you're lucky, then start doing testing somewhere around release time.

1442
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,840
And then they update their driver and publish it.

1443
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:03,280
And then the distro maker has to then package that or you have to go get it just doesn't

1444
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,160
make sense.

1445
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,920
I mean, it's not inherent maybe, but it does seem to be often the way that it works out.

1446
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,920
It's just if you follow the stuff that's built in at this point these days, which we're

1447
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,320
lucky enough to have, it just works.

1448
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,920
We did also get Nate from the point of his stick.

1449
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,640
He wrote in and said, Hey, I'd love to have a conversation about Brent's KD experiences

1450
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,000
and the team's KD experiences.

1451
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,920
So I think we will follow up on that in the future.

1452
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,640
I think likely we're pretty darn busy on this trip.

1453
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,800
We love Nate, though.

1454
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,560
So it's going to have a huge, amazing offer.

1455
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,200
So thank you.

1456
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:35,760
Yeah.

1457
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:41,360
You know, one thing I have found about the plasma team and the KD camp in general is

1458
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,280
they've always been really good about how they've handled feedback.

1459
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:50,160
Let's just say because unfortunately, you know, on the Internet, you don't always receive

1460
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:56,000
bug reports and criticism in the best method or mechanism doesn't always show up in a well

1461
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,880
written bug report and often from frustrated people.

1462
01:09:59,440 --> 01:09:59,920
Yeah.

1463
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,400
Yeah.

1464
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:00,560
Yeah.

1465
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,920
Because like something has crashed, right?

1466
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:07,280
And they have been historically really graceful about how they've handled that.

1467
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,880
I think that's something we've noticed here on the show.

1468
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,880
So we appreciate Nate reaching out Bo wrote in Brent.

1469
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,840
Love hearing your journey deeper into the open source ecosystem.

1470
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,520
The recent episode had a lot of great things to say about desktop environments,

1471
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,400
including plasma.

1472
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,960
I think you'd get a kick out of trying a Tyler if you haven't yet.

1473
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,760
I three is the de facto standard, but awesome.

1474
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,320
We spawn and others are great, too.

1475
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,360
The one I'm specifically thinking you'd find the most frustrating and enjoyable at the

1476
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,680
same time is DWM.

1477
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:43,360
The point about the discussion is that sometimes primitives are the way to go and you manage

1478
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,680
it yourself, so it won't randomly break, although you have plenty of opportunity to break it

1479
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:48,240
yourself.

1480
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,240
I do think it'll be a fun foray into a different world.

1481
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,360
I do like this idea.

1482
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,120
Brent goes deep with Thailand for a while.

1483
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,720
Just just to try it out.

1484
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,080
You know, I don't know.

1485
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,360
I saw him mess with the Italian, but I don't think it was really taken to it.

1486
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,400
I'll give it time.

1487
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,200
I'll give it time.

1488
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,080
I mean, it's a it's a lot of new paradigms all at once.

1489
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,320
This is like pushing you off into the deep end, right?

1490
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:08,800
Thanks, guys.

1491
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,160
I also think he might have been struggling with I don't know for sure, but it seemed

1492
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:17,280
like some of the newer GTK applications weren't loving some of the auto tiling suggestions.

1493
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,000
Like they didn't like the resizing that Brent was trying to do.

1494
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,480
Yeah, I did have an issue where the the tiling would only happen on the right hand side of

1495
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,840
the screen and the whole left side was open and blank and nothing wanted to auto tile

1496
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,400
over there.

1497
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,840
So it was an interesting experience.

1498
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,880
Yeah, I'll freeze out.

1499
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,840
Yeah, yeah, no tiling.

1500
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,560
Nice and clean.

1501
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,520
Yeah, yeah.

1502
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,480
Well, thank you, everybody.

1503
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,640
Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

1504
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,920
If you'd like to send in your emails, we do appreciate that.

1505
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,040
And now it is time for the boost.

1506
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:51,680
Blake Collin wrote in with one thousand ten sets coming in hot with the boost and it was

1507
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,520
sent in using boost CLI.

1508
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,640
Oh, OK.

1509
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,280
There you go.

1510
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:55,920
There you go.

1511
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,680
Ladies and gentlemen, nicely done.

1512
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,680
We have our true geek of the episode.

1513
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:02,480
The message simply says, install boost CLI.

1514
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,320
Yeah, there you go.

1515
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:04,800
There you go.

1516
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:05,360
That's all you need.

1517
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,080
If you can do that, that's like the ultimate level of nerdim because you're going to have

1518
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,720
to learn about nodes, you're going to have to learn command line apps, you're going to

1519
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,400
have to know how to get something off of GitHub.

1520
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,040
Like, you know, not everybody can do that.

1521
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,000
I understand.

1522
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,920
That's why there's new podcast apps dot com.

1523
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,840
But some of you, some of you, some of you, but only some.

1524
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,440
Gene Bean also wrote in with one thousand ten sets coming in hot with the boost CLI.

1525
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,560
Thank you, Gene Bean, again with thirteen thousand three hundred and seventy sets.

1526
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,520
OpenSUSE in the two thousand six timeframe had an awesome KD set up that I really wish

1527
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,240
had continued.

1528
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:49,200
Thirteen thousand three hundred and seventy is my attempt at ten times leet boosts for

1529
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:49,840
what it's worth.

1530
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,040
Nice, Gene Bean.

1531
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,400
Gene Bean also boosted in with a bunch of leet sets.

1532
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,480
Do the shows have to be boosted via fountain to show in the top boosted list?

1533
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,480
It seems that is true.

1534
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,040
Yes.

1535
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,600
OK.

1536
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,280
Fountain list is based on the fountain boosts.

1537
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,320
That's fine.

1538
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,280
You know, it's just a chart.

1539
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,160
We don't have to be on the chart.

1540
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,760
Oh, we're number four today.

1541
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:10,880
You know why?

1542
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,800
It's it's because of our ballers.

1543
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,440
That's why.

1544
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,320
Yeah, right there.

1545
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,280
So we're boom.

1546
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:20,160
We're number four again on Fountain and we always get more listeners when that happens.

1547
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,960
I don't if you you boost whatever you want.

1548
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,640
We are just happy that you're participating in the system.

1549
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,840
It doesn't have to be on Fountain.

1550
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:33,200
But yes, for it to show up on the charts in Fountain FM, you have to send that boost in

1551
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,640
with Fountain FM.

1552
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:39,440
Well, Al Carney boosts in with one thousand and twenty four cents.

1553
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:46,000
What could be a better hype song for the Golden Dragon show mascot than Gold by the Imagine

1554
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:46,720
Dragons?

1555
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,720
Have you guys heard Gold by the Imagine Dragons?

1556
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,440
Remind us.

1557
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,520
Are you familiar with this song?

1558
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,360
Are you familiar with this song and clip to clip?

1559
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,960
The question is, would it be appropriate for our mascot?

1560
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,240
Now, this is not our song.

1561
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,160
OK, keep in mind, this is the song for the Golden Dragon, for our mascot, the show mascot,

1562
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:21,760
the Golden Dragon.

1563
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,560
It's pretty good.

1564
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,440
It feels to me like I'm imagining, you know, World Wrestling Federation, you know, when

1565
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,200
they just come out and they're walking to the ring and they got their song or whatever.

1566
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,440
I feel like our mascot will walk out to that song.

1567
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,160
Yeah, it's a pump you up kind of song.

1568
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,520
Suitably epic, that's for sure.

1569
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:43,520
Well, Dark Year 1337 boosted in with a row of ducks.

1570
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,360
This old duck still got it.

1571
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,680
This is my first contribution to JB.

1572
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,560
I got these sent through Fountain FM.

1573
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,680
Heard about through JB.

1574
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,000
And I want to tell you guys about a handy way of cloning your operating system.

1575
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It's FS Archiver.

1576
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,000
You know, I hadn't heard about this one before, but it looks like a pretty handy application

1577
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,960
that's been around for a while.

1578
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:08,640
Yeah, it includes this a little like command, which perhaps we can save in a pastebin and

1579
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,560
put in the show notes where you can just copy essentially the SD card from one pie to another

1580
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,840
pie and use some compression so that way you're not using up a ton of space.

1581
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,280
And he gives some tips to make sure you get like the right compression so it's not too

1582
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:23,760
slow.

1583
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,240
Supports butter FS, I see here on the homepage.

1584
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,840
Well, how about that, Wes Payne?

1585
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,720
I've had it.

1586
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,280
All right, so the key there really in that boost is check out FS Archiver.

1587
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,560
That looks like a really.

1588
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,720
We could have made that a pick.

1589
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,640
We could have made that a pick, guys.

1590
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,680
Geez, guys.

1591
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,280
Oh, all right.

1592
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,920
Well, we got a great boost in from Green Eagle 3,333 SATs.

1593
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,600
B-O-O-S-T.

1594
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,280
I had some renovations to do, so I got fairly caught up on the show.

1595
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,600
I was also able to get some SATs into Albee and boost directly in Podverse.

1596
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,280
So Albee's the wallet.

1597
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,520
They're an open source project.

1598
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:00,720
I've talked to one of their co-founders.

1599
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,720
They seem like they really got their ass figured out.

1600
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,840
Podverse is a GPL podcast player, and you can connect to Albee so you don't have to

1601
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,440
create a whole new wallet, right?

1602
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,360
He says it was painless this time.

1603
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,280
So he had some issues the first time he tried it.

1604
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:13,920
Maybe it was a bug.

1605
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:14,480
He doesn't know.

1606
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,440
He says he still uses Breeze to actually move SATs around from Bitcoin chain to Lightning.

1607
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,680
But he's super excited to be able to boost from his podcast player.

1608
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,320
Welcome aboard, Green Eagle.

1609
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,720
Thanks for jumping through and getting things sorted out.

1610
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:36,400
We got just under the 2,000 SAT limit boosts from True Grids at 1,999 SATs.

1611
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,960
I'd also like to mention that I'm interested in y'all covering Ham Radio.

1612
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,280
However, it doesn't need to be more than a few episodes.

1613
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,400
Maybe it would be a good excuse to bring Noah back for a limited run.

1614
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,520
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.

1615
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,480
That would be fun.

1616
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,720
He says, I'd be interested in beginner hardware setups, licensing, etc.

1617
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:56,240
I agree, True Grids, but we need a Linux angle, right?

1618
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,520
We're a Linux podcast.

1619
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,600
We got to look at it from some Linux angles.

1620
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,800
So if anybody knows a good solid Linux angle for us to get in to sink our teeth into some Ham.

1621
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,000
It'd be fun to learn about that software-defined radio stuff, too.

1622
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,500
Right.

1623
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,800
That's what I'm thinking, Westpac.

1624
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,240
That's what I'm thinking.

1625
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,440
Neve boosted in while we were live.

1626
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,000
How about that?

1627
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,040
This is a hot boost.

1628
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,640
Coming in hot with the boost.

1629
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,480
3,381 SATs.

1630
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,400
It's a history boost because you said you'd miss them.

1631
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:23,620
True.

1632
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,920
Also, some number fun.

1633
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:31,200
1985 was the year we, the public, were graced by the GNU Emacs.

1634
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,240
DNS was born.

1635
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,240
We got the GNU Manifesto.

1636
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,440
Coca-Cola released New Coke.

1637
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,560
Blessed Bee that year.

1638
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,880
Studio Gilby.

1639
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,760
What's this, West?

1640
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,400
Ghibli.

1641
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:42,880
Ghibli.

1642
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,680
Ah, OK.

1643
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,320
Was founded.

1644
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,520
US Route 66 was decommissioned.

1645
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,020
Whoa.

1646
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,400
Man, 85 was crazy.

1647
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,400
And the world population was roughly 4.8 billion.

1648
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,520
How about that?

1649
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:02,320
Which is then divided by 3, one for each host, and then divided by 12, the number of the Mumble Room.

1650
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,320
Oh, OK.

1651
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,680
Are you listening live, Neve?

1652
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:06,960
Are you in there right now, Neve?

1653
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:07,920
Are you in there right now?

1654
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,480
I don't see you.

1655
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:09,680
OK.

1656
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,160
All right.

1657
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,880
This came in live, but I don't see him in there.

1658
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,640
But that's creepy, but also awesome.

1659
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:19,280
So he divides it by the number of people in the Mumble Room, which is, OK.

1660
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,000
All right, 12.

1661
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,720
All right, yeah.

1662
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,680
This has been a while.

1663
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,280
And then divide by 15, each mod and admin in the Matrix chat.

1664
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,600
And then he rounded up.

1665
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,920
That's how we got to 3,381 sats, guys.

1666
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,680
I don't think we can judge how you make up the satin amount.

1667
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,160
No, I mean, he really put some thought into that, you know?

1668
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:38,800
The algorithm.

1669
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,720
Yeah, you really got to think about it.

1670
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:41,680
We appreciate it, Neve.

1671
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,200
Thank you very much for boosting in.

1672
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,360
That's a good one.

1673
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:52,240
And then Mitch came in just under the wire with a Go Podcasting with 3,333 sats just

1674
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,560
a few minutes ago as we're recording this.

1675
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:55,840
Go Podcasting, indeed.

1676
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,200
You guys are so great.

1677
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:02,000
And also, a shout out to Famous Flame, who just started earning sats for the first time

1678
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,320
on Fountain and then sent 200 of them into the show.

1679
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,480
Also, Push Up, who sent 1,000 sats to wish us safe travels.

1680
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:08,960
Thank you.

1681
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,960
And thank you, everyone, who boosts in.

1682
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,000
We read all of them.

1683
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,440
We're curating which ones make it into the show, but we do read all of them.

1684
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,000
And they make us smile every single time they come in.

1685
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,520
Thank you, everybody.

1686
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,800
It keeps us motivated.

1687
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,480
NewPodcastApps.com.

1688
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,880
Now, we have a special pick this week.

1689
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:36,800
You know, maybe you need to integrate Rust at a lower level into your system.

1690
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,000
Perhaps user applications, not enough.

1691
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,880
And since you can't get it in your Linux kernel just yet, maybe we can stuff it somewhere

1692
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,680
else, Wes.

1693
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,480
Well, yeah, you still got to interface with the kernel to make changes.

1694
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:55,600
What if you had a Rust alternative to sysctl with a terminal user interface?

1695
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:58,960
This sounds pretty good.

1696
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,240
I mean, it's kind of everything I've always wanted.

1697
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,160
Yeah, I mean, if you got to go mess around and, you know, slash proc slash sys and kind

1698
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:10,320
of tune things, maybe a helper to have you not screw something up would be nice.

1699
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:14,240
Oh, so that's really what this is.

1700
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:20,720
It's really the, it kind of gives you like fish type auto completion for messing around

1701
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,680
with your kernel parameters.

1702
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,720
Well, and it shows you some documentation as well and kind of helps you change like

1703
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,880
just the, you know, change the value that you're having.

1704
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,920
So look at this.

1705
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,080
Interface, interfacing in a structured way.

1706
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,360
This is so great.

1707
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:36,080
So it's kind of almost end curses like, but it is not end curses, but it is end curses

1708
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,520
like you got a left pane and a right pane and the right pane has all the documentation

1709
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,280
explaining what you're screwing with.

1710
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:43,840
Exactly.

1711
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,960
It's just the kind of thing I needed to really mess my system up with.

1712
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,600
And sometimes these terminal user interfaces are like just, just enough interface.

1713
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,480
You don't need to do it all the time, but you know, for twiddling a few settings here

1714
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,920
and there, it's kind of perfect.

1715
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,680
This is really great.

1716
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,160
All right.

1717
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,240
So it's called Systroid.

1718
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:03,760
It's like, it's like on steroids, right?

1719
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,120
That's where they're getting the Systroid.

1720
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,800
It's cute, I guess.

1721
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,560
It kind of sounds like a hemorrhoid.

1722
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,320
Maybe it's an asteroid.

1723
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,720
Yeah, it also sounds like a hemorrhoid.

1724
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,000
Oh, gosh.

1725
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
So before we get hemorrhoids, we should probably wrap it up.

1726
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,520
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1727
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:22,800
In fact, links to everything we talked about, linuxunplug.com slash 477.

1728
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,680
Now we are live again next week from the road.

1729
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,800
We'd love to have you join the mumble room because we work real hard to make that work

1730
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,760
from the road.

1731
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,200
So show up, would you?

1732
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,480
Because we work hard for it.

1733
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,360
Tell you what.

1734
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:39,040
And of course, we will stream that attempt at jupyter.tube, Sunday at noon, Pacific,

1735
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,480
3 p.m. Eastern.

1736
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,440
Yeah, that's right.

1737
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,240
See you next week.

1738
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,360
Same bad time, same bad station.

1739
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,640
And the news, it don't rest.

1740
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,120
It keeps going on at linuxactionnews.com.

1741
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:53,680
So if you're in the tech industry, do not miss a single episode, linuxactionnews.com.

1742
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,360
Or if you just want to stay informed.

1743
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,520
But we'll be back right here at jupyter.tube.

1744
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:58,640
We hope you join us.

1745
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,120
And if you can't, we just love you subscribing, sharing the show, or becoming a member at

1746
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,840
unpluggedcore.com and keeping us going.

1747
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,240
Making sure the content stays independent.

1748
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:09,360
You couldn't do it without you.

1749
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,480
Nobody buys our opinion.

1750
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,600
In fact, like idiots, we spend money on this hardware when they'd probably just give it

1751
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,240
to us for free.

1752
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,920
But you know what?

1753
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,680
We like to stay honest and keep it real.

1754
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1755
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:37,280
We'll be real right back here next Sunday.

1756
01:22:52,880 --> 01:23:05,840
So, Brent, I kind of have like this sense that you're not going to fully move into

1757
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,400
the rig until you've decided if you're going to stick with Pop!

1758
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:08,960
OS or not.

1759
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,800
I still see you go into the ThinkPad every now and then for like a password.

1760
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,680
Well, you know what happened?

1761
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:20,880
One of the reasons I had to do that this morning is I moved over my Thunderbird profile.

1762
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,520
But because I was running it on Fedora.

1763
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,080
Yeah, I know.

1764
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,240
Yeah, this is what we're dealing with here.

1765
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:26,800
Just continue.

1766
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,280
I wasn't just, I was just learning.

1767
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,000
Processing.

1768
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,600
Just processing.

1769
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,560
I was just processing.

1770
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,600
I understand.

1771
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,040
Well, the great thing about the Thunderbird profiles and the Firefox profiles, if you're

1772
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,800
not using Sync, I know Sync exists.

1773
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:39,840
Thank you, everyone.

1774
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,080
Is you just drag them over to the new machine.

1775
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:42,320
Yeah.

1776
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,200
Just magically works.

1777
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:44,480
Yeah, yeah.

1778
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,000
Been doing that for decades, which.

1779
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,480
But the problem is I was running on Fedora on the X250, and so that was a much, much,

1780
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,640
much, much newer version of Thunderbird.

1781
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:53,200
Right.

1782
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,200
And they're typically not backwards compatible whenever they do like database updates.

1783
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,640
Oh, that drives me crazy.

1784
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,400
So I couldn't get it running on Pop, actually.

1785
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:09,040
And the PPAs that used to be available when Mozilla had Thunderbird are like 208 months

1786
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,520
old.

1787
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,000
That's fine.

1788
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:10,720
And haven't been updated.

1789
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:12,160
That was totally secure.

1790
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,000
So I actually just ran and had to run a flat pack.

1791
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,800
But that's the reason you caught me going to the back to the machine.

1792
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,840
That's what I was going to ask you.

1793
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,520
I was like, I was about to say, Brent, flat pack.

1794
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,320
Can't you just flat pack?

1795
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,240
Yeah, I did, and it actually worked great.

1796
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,040
OK, good.

1797
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:28,240
But I did catch myself having to go back to it.

1798
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:32,320
And I told myself a few days ago, I would not do that anymore, but I just had to get

1799
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,280
to an email quickly.

1800
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,080
I was like, oh, gosh.

1801
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,600
So you are doing the challenges thing.

1802
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,040
Yeah, because that is kind of a challenge.

1803
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:42,240
I challenge myself to just leave this X250 at the studio when we go on the trip.

1804
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,560
Whoa, that is choice.

1805
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,080
I have done that myself.

1806
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:49,120
Because I feel like if you're going to move over, just move over.

1807
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,120
Don't live the half and half life.

1808
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,520
Back up the stuff you need backed up, transfer the stuff you need operationally.

1809
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,360
I can't wait to see how this goes.

1810
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,720
This is going to be great.

1811
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,960
I'm going to get a front seat to this.

1812
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:07,360
Get your popcorn.
