1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Well, I found something I'm gonna be staring at

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,520
for a little while.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,340
It's a live tracker of Starlink satellites.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,560
Have you seen this, Wes?

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,360
Satellite map.space.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,840
Talk about a new distraction I did not need.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,240
And it's not only Starlink, there's OneWeb on here too.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,740
They're just flying all over the place.

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,440
They're above us right now.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,680
Like I'm looking at these two here and it,

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,360
wait a minute, are they about to, oh no!

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:36,400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,200
My name is Chris.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,280
My name is Wes.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,040
Hello, Wes.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
Brush off all that Starlink debris.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,000
We have a show to do, would you?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,240
This episode is brought to you by the all-new A Cloud Guru,

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,440
the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,760
and other modern tech skills.

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,320
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,840
Get certified.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,360
Get hired.

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,640
Get learning at acloudguru.com.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,560
Well, coming up on the show today,

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,600
can you self-host your own shells.com-like alternative?

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,760
Obviously, at a different scale, but is it possible

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,840
to take a desktop environment and put it in a container

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
and then access it remotely?

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, not only is it possible, thanks

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,440
to a really cool open source project,

32
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,760
but it really kicks the llama's ass.

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,160
In fact, you can do it with just about any modern web browser

34
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,960
and you'll probably be able to get it set up

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,320
in about 15 minutes or so.

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,520
We'll tell you all about our experiments

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,400
with Web Top on the show and how it's

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,440
going to solve a major problem during our Jupiter Colony

39
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,560
reunion road trip.

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
It's going to be like our hero tool, potentially.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,040
That is, if I can get the server up and running

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,800
for any continuous moment.

43
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,120
It's been crashing all morning, Wes, and I'm a mess right now.

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,400
This is going to be a bad show.

45
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,080
I'm just going to warn you.

46
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,960
Normally, I say it's going to be a great episode.

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,040
Got a real big show.

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,280
We have a terrible show today.

49
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
It's going to be awful because of me.

50
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,880
I'd like to point out that we didn't just do an Arch update.

51
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not to blame.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,680
No, you are not to blame.

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,440
It is, I think, the heat.

54
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,040
The server is locking up and it's

55
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,080
behaving very much in a hardware failure kind of way.

56
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,320
I got in this morning and I went to connect

57
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,880
to our beloved Arch server.

58
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,640
And my web dashboard for this thing

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,960
I'm working on for the road trip didn't load.

60
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,080
And the server has been so dang reliable,

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,760
I thought to myself, oh, it must be my workstation.

62
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,280
So let me check network manager.

63
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
It says I'm connected.

64
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
Let me see if I can ping other stuff.

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
Hmm.

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
Well, all right, I'll go to the console.

67
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,360
So I go down to the garage slash server room.

68
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,800
And I access the console.

69
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
And it's just dead.

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,360
No response, nothing.

71
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,200
I type in nothing, no blinking cursor, nothing, Wes.

72
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,440
Nothing on the console.

73
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,360
So this is not just a network problem.

74
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,280
It's not the NIC going out.

75
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,720
This thing's dead.

76
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,240
The server is so reliable that it did cross my mind that it

77
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,200
might actually be a bad keyboard.

78
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,480
So I swapped out the keyboard.

79
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,720
Because I thought, no way, the server's locked up.

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,000
It's never locked up.

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
The server has actually never crashed on us,

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,440
unless we screw up an update.

83
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,520
It's been a rock.

84
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,360
No, that's been it, yeah.

85
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,840
Sometimes we did stuff, and ZFS didn't build right,

86
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,480
and our root file system wouldn't mount.

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,920
But that was on us, not the server.

88
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,960
And honestly, every time we learned a lesson,

89
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,240
and it's been really solid.

90
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,760
And so I would swap out the keyboard, still not working.

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,360
I do a hard reset, power it off, power it back on.

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,320
And I'm watching the console output like a hawk

93
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,000
at this point.

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,880
Every BIOS post message, when grub loads, then system D.

95
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,840
Like, I'm watching every single thing.

96
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
The console loads up.

97
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,520
I type on it.

98
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,440
I get logged in.

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,760
I can ping stuff.

100
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,720
OK.

101
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,640
I go back to my desk.

102
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
The web dashboards load.

103
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
A few things need to be cleaned up.

104
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,800
A couple of the applications crapped themselves.

105
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
But I fix all that up.

106
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
Good to go.

107
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,680
So I come down to the studio.

108
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,400
I jump on the stream, and I'm kvetching

109
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
about how our server crashed this morning.

110
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400
But I think everything's OK.

111
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
And I go check on it, and it doesn't respond.

112
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
And again, I go out to the console,

113
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,240
and it's totally locked up.

114
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,280
And this is what, Wes?

115
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,880
Like 20 minutes ago, 15 minutes ago, maybe, at the most?

116
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,640
Yeah, pretty much, right before we get on the air.

117
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
My baby, Wes.

118
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,280
My baby.

119
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,400
And I think it's dying.

120
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,560
I think the heat here in the Pacific Northwest

121
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,040
has just crushed it.

122
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,600
It has been too much.

123
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,680
And the worst part is it's about to get hotter

124
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,840
over the next few days.

125
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,080
Right.

126
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,200
You won't be here to manage it.

127
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,680
And you do your best at the studio,

128
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,800
as I've seen trying to manage airflow, cool it off

129
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,120
when you can, which isn't always possible.

130
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,160
And then not only is this a valuable archival resource

131
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,120
for us at the studio, it's a back door into the studio

132
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,360
with WireGuard as our server there.

133
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,320
And I know it hosts a bunch of personal stuff

134
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,640
in some of your media collection, which you probably

135
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
want if you're about to go on the road.

136
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,840
Not only that, but it's going to be an environment where

137
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,320
I can run this web top application that we're

138
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,920
about to talk about and have a remotely accessible machine

139
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
on the studio LAN.

140
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,880
And that, to me, is going to be extremely valuable when

141
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
I am in limited compute and limited mobility with LTE

142
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,920
connectivity.

143
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,720
Having a rock solid always on workstation

144
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,760
that can do a lot of my heavy lifting

145
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,360
was going to be a key part of my on the road strategy.

146
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,200
I think now I'm going to move that off to Linode

147
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,880
because I just can't count on this local server.

148
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm just going to have to deploy this on Linode

149
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,560
and run it there.

150
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
And they're going to have plenty of compute

151
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,600
and plenty of networking.

152
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,800
But it's unfortunate it's going this way.

153
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
It's an old box, too.

154
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,600
We bought it from Unix Surplus used,

155
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,960
I think in 2017, 2018.

156
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
I can't remember exactly when.

157
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,560
So that means it's been through a couple of winters

158
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,280
and a couple of summers.

159
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,920
It's got an Intel Xeon L5640 24 core CPU.

160
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,360
So it's got quite a bit of cores for what we need.

161
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,840
And it's got 56 gigs of RAM.

162
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,800
I can't remember exactly how we got there.

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,520
But it's got 56 gigs of RAM in it.

164
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,700
And it's done a really great job for us.

165
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,120
But now it doesn't seem to be able to stay up more than 20,

166
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,680
25 minutes.

167
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,760
And I am legit going through an emotional process.

168
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,640
I am grieving the loss of our server right now,

169
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,260
especially because I'm six days out from the road trip.

170
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,920
So I can't even get anything to replace it,

171
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,440
even if I had the money to replace it right now.

172
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,840
There's just not the time to get it in place, no.

173
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,360
I mean, you really don't appreciate these things

174
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,280
and how reliable and how much you depend on them

175
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,760
until you start questioning it.

176
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,360
Yeah, when I realized what a rocket had been

177
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,320
and what it feels like now, it's like I'm

178
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,920
losing a friend.

179
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,880
But the road show goes on, in theory.

180
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,580
And our first meetup is scheduled for August 7,

181
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,160
which really is not that far away in Salt Lake City.

182
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,620
Our second meetup that is scheduled

183
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,040
is in Denver, August 20.

184
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Plus, we will have the micro meetup link available,

185
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,040
where you can submit a request to me with,

186
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,920
I just have a few questions in there for you.

187
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,840
And we'll have a route with a live tracker.

188
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,240
Our own tracks installation is still up and running,

189
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
because that's up on a Linode box.

190
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
And so we'll have the live map that will give you

191
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,440
my location as we go around.

192
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,480
But we have a lot to get into today,

193
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
despite the state of my server.

194
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,480
So before we go any further, we've

195
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,840
got to bring in our virtual lug.

196
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,560
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

197
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,060
Hello.

198
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,560
Hello.

199
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Hello.

200
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,280
Hello, Chris.

201
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
Hello, everybody.

202
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,200
About 22 of you on the Mumble server today.

203
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Linuxonplug.com slash Mumble, if you'd ever like to join us.

204
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,440
We have a quiet listening area and an on-air area.

205
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,880
It's a great way to just listen to the show in real time.

206
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,440
Talk about a low latency way to do it.

207
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
But the other thing that's just kind of cool

208
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,680
is it's all free software.

209
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,720
If you join like on a Linux box, or I suppose a PSD machine,

210
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,320
and run Mumble, we're running this entire stack

211
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,040
in the studio on Linux.

212
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,420
Mumble is free software.

213
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,200
So you can listen to the show in real time

214
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,680
with low latency, high quality Opus audio

215
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,160
when you connect in on Mumble.

216
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,780
And if you ever want to join us on air to jump in on something,

217
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,760
you can.

218
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,200
Like the Framework laptop, which is our first community news

219
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,880
item this week, we've all been waiting for the reviews

220
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,160
to land for this ultimate right to repair machine.

221
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,920
And it seems like overall, the reviews

222
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,320
have been a lot more positive than I think probably either

223
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,480
one of us expected.

224
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,560
Yeah, really.

225
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,560
I mean, the biggest negative that seems to have popped up,

226
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,660
and unfortunately, more than a few times at this point,

227
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,560
is the battery life.

228
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,660
But maybe we can take the Verge's review

229
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,040
as a bit of a case study.

230
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,880
They took a look at a model, came with let's see

231
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,360
the configuration here, display 13.5 inch 3-2 aspect ratio.

232
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,880
Yeah, 3 by 2 aspect ratio is kind of unique.

233
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,520
I like that.

234
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,360
It's your only option, but I like it.

235
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, 2256 by 1504, and not a touch screen before you ask.

236
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Comes with an Intel Core i5-1135G7,

237
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
and only 8 gigs of RAM on this model.

238
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,320
But don't worry, you can get more

239
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
if you're building this for yourself.

240
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,320
And that price, I think for configured,

241
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,680
as configured like that, is just under $1,000,

242
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
or basically $1,000 at $999.

243
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,320
But the notes about the battery struck me

244
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,860
as potentially solvable, because the whole idea

245
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,720
about the framework is that so many parts are replaceable,

246
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,880
swappable, and the battery is absolutely one of those.

247
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,680
And so if this thing was successful,

248
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,320
it'd be pretty easy for a third party

249
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,080
or for framework themselves to build a higher capacity

250
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,520
battery that you fit in there, assuming they could have

251
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,920
around the same form factor.

252
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,560
That's one of the weird things about talking

253
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
about this laptop is I think, especially at this point,

254
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,080
we're so used to just everything being soldered in

255
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,880
and having to optimize what am I buying right now,

256
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,760
because I can't change it and it has to last.

257
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,960
And it's a little bit of you have to unlearn that when

258
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,320
you're configuring this thing.

259
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,000
True.

260
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And ByteBitten, it looks like there

261
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,080
may be a touch screen in the future, possibly.

262
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes, so what some other channels showed

263
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,800
was there is on the motherboard a connector for touch screen.

264
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,240
So when you use it in the framework chassis,

265
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,040
because you can take out the motherboard

266
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,040
and create a small form factor design with it,

267
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,240
and you put then a touch screen on it, it's all possible.

268
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,400
Yeah, I'd love to see that kind of thing

269
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,720
take off where other people start building parts for it

270
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,160
too, but you'd really have to have some mass user adoption.

271
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
I think that's kind of the whole elephant

272
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,440
in the room about the framework laptop

273
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,520
is how it ends up playing out is going

274
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,920
to depend on how successful it is,

275
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,200
because they're not going to make

276
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,160
all of these additional modules, and there's not

277
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
going to be a bunch of upgrade components

278
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,680
and multiple iterations on the motherboard and CPU

279
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,080
that fit in the same chassis unless this thing sells

280
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,960
like crazy.

281
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,720
It seems like that's the other part of this

282
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
that has to be successful.

283
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,960
Yeah, I mean, I think, thankfully, it seems

284
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,440
like a decent laptop anyway.

285
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,160
So if it doesn't take off, it still

286
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,680
could be a fine machine to just get work done and run Linux on.

287
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,400
But you're right.

288
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,600
If it does take off, the value proposition

289
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
could really be a lot more.

290
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,320
You could easily get this thing repaired.

291
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,200
You could find spare parts.

292
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,680
You could swap things out, upgrade it as time went on,

293
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,880
change out the ports as things got fancier.

294
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,360
That would be pretty exciting.

295
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,320
If you look at the Venn diagram of customers

296
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,960
for the framework laptop, Linux user and write

297
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,600
to repair users, I think they overlap a lot in this diagram.

298
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,760
And depending on where you fall down on the write

299
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,320
to repair issue and how important to you

300
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,880
a machine like this is, I think pushes you over the edge

301
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,960
if you want to order this or not.

302
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,100
And it's been really interesting,

303
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,360
because I've gotten a lot of notes from people that

304
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,400
definitely fall into that.

305
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,360
I believe in write to repair.

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,600
And I want a system that can run Linux.

307
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
I like this idea.

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
And they're pulling the trigger.

309
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,880
And I know you've been on the fence, Wes.

310
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,720
And I think at the core of your indecision

311
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,760
is where you stand on write to repair.

312
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,680
And not so much as, of course, you want it to exist.

313
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,080
Everybody wants write to repair to be a thing.

314
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,080
But I'm curious how important you feel it is to you personally.

315
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,360
You know, that's a tough one.

316
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,780
I do think it's really important.

317
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,520
But I feel like I've been a little burned, skeptical,

318
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,760
just sort of, maybe it's just too pessimistic, honestly,

319
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,080
at the end of the day.

320
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,720
It's been hard to be able to engage

321
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,440
as a consumer who wants sort of the higher end of things.

322
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
You know, who really does care about computing,

323
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,280
likes nice computers, uses nice computers, not just for sport,

324
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,640
but for work and for getting stuff done.

325
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,440
And up until now, it's been hard.

326
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,880
You do have some of that stuff maybe in the ThinkPad line,

327
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,380
especially.

328
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,440
But basically, everywhere else, this

329
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,240
isn't really a choice you've gotten to make.

330
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,600
So unfortunately, it seems like there's

331
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,480
a bit of a barrier or an activation potential

332
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,920
for me emotionally to sort of be willing to believe

333
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
in this potential again, even though I really do want to.

334
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,760
Carl, it sounds like it does match up for you.

335
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,640
You ordered one.

336
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,280
Yes, sir.

337
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,400
I'm looking forward to getting it.

338
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm going to be in batch two, which

339
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,160
is supposed to ship in August.

340
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,440
I'm guessing you probably went with the DIY edition,

341
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,520
so it's OS free.

342
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,240
Absolutely.

343
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,840
Yeah, I didn't get any storage RAM or OS for it.

344
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
So I'll handle those whenever I get it.

345
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,100
In fact, I just placed a new egg order for RAM and storage

346
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,640
today, and I placed the pre-order for the laptop

347
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
a week or two ago.

348
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,720
I miss the idea of just ordering the components

349
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,360
I want for my laptop from Newegg.

350
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,120
That's what a concept.

351
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,160
That's crazy, Carl.

352
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,720
Like, you can do that?

353
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,840
Wow.

354
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,040
Yeah, it's exciting.

355
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,680
What's going to be tricky, though, is what Linux

356
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,240
you decide to put on there, because you're

357
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,560
going to need something with a pretty new kernel.

358
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,120
Seems like 5.11, maybe the bare minimum, ideally kernel 5.12.

359
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,200
And so Jim Salter had a hard time getting Ubuntu 20.04

360
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,760
working on it, obviously, because it

361
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
has such an older kernel.

362
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,320
And even 21.04 wasn't perfect.

363
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,800
And I think if I'm just remembering off the top of my

364
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,600
head, I think 21.04 ships with 5.11.

365
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,120
You'd want a distro that ships with 5.11 or 5.12.

366
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,520
I've been looking on the framework laptop form,

367
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,480
and they actually have a whole Linux section, which

368
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,720
I'll link to in the show notes for just getting

369
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,800
Linux on the DIY edition.

370
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,600
And I would say probably what seems

371
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
to be the most popular distro reading through there

372
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
is Fedora, although there's a poll that

373
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,800
was conducted just two days ago.

374
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,560
Or no, no longer than that, but the last vote was two days ago.

375
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,200
And Ubuntu was the largest in the poll,

376
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,360
so people are also probably doing Ubuntu then

377
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
maybe with the kernel PPA backport, possibly.

378
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,520
That might work.

379
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,020
But if I were going to get a framework,

380
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,320
I would probably try to run Fedora or an Arch-based distro

381
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,680
on there, just that way you get all that new kernel goodness.

382
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,440
Because not only is it an 11th gen Intel,

383
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,640
but there's also just a lot of new components in there.

384
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,760
It's a lot of USB 3.0 stuff.

385
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
I would go with a newer kernel.

386
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,200
Yes, I mean, this is just not in the category

387
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,040
of off-the-shelf laptop in any way yet.

388
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,920
So if you're interested in this, you

389
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,600
should probably be prepared to do some tinkering.

390
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,560
Should we talk a little BSD in our Linux podcast, Wes?

391
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,120
Oh, it's been too long, but our friends over at FreeBSD

392
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,160
are working on some interesting stuff,

393
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,560
including a new installer.

394
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,280
Although this one has a bit of a twist.

395
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,840
This new experimental installer is web-based,

396
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,680
with the interface running from a web browser

397
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,680
either locally on the machine you're installing FreeBSD on,

398
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,000
or it can actually run on a remote system.

399
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
What a cool idea.

400
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,360
And I don't think this is absolutely the first time

401
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,620
I've ever seen this executed.

402
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,840
I feel like an early Debian installer prototype

403
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,440
did this too.

404
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,440
But the idea that the whole installer is web-based,

405
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,680
and you either just do it in a web browser on a live session

406
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,640
on the box, or you do it on a remote system,

407
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,440
seems actually kind of like a compelling idea for FreeBSD,

408
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,280
especially since most of them, probably a lot of them,

409
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,040
are being deployed headless.

410
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,880
What do you think of a web-based installer?

411
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,360
OK, it seems really practical, but the troll in me

412
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,120
just wants to say, this is one step away from an Electron

413
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,160
installer, right?

414
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,240
I mean, yeah.

415
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,720
Like, why not ship it as an Electron app on the desktop?

416
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,080
What's the difference at that point?

417
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
I mean, I don't know, though.

418
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,520
It could probably be a pretty simple, well, maybe not.

419
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,080
It could be a monster of a web application.

420
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,240
That could be its Achilles heel, I suppose,

421
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,600
is to create a competent web installer.

422
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,200
It may have to be an absolute monster,

423
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,620
especially because you're probably

424
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,960
going to want some abstraction in there at various levels.

425
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,420
And that's probably going to be tricky to even wrap your head

426
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,200
around.

427
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,620
They're also working on improvements

428
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,480
to their Linux compatibility layer, which I think

429
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,720
is based on Linux 5.7 right now.

430
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,120
And it looks like they're focusing a lot on AMD Radeon

431
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
and newer Intel GPU support to get those fancied up.

432
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,720
Also nice to see is that the Hello System project,

433
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,800
which we talked about a little bit ago on the show,

434
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,120
the freeBSD-powered desktop OS, well, that's

435
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,160
been steadily progressing.

436
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,760
They had a recent release, and they're making great progress

437
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,960
towards their next one.

438
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,040
Wes, that's the project being worked on by the App Image

439
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,720
founder, right?

440
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
Indeed it is.

441
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,040
Hello System is one to keep your eye on.

442
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,920
It's not for those of you who are offended by things that

443
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,720
try to look like Mac OS, because they're just

444
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,600
leaning hard into that whole UI paradigm and workflow

445
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,920
and just trying to create a BSD-based system.

446
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,160
Michael Larbel, though, has a pretty good write-up over

447
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,200
at Ferronix from the freeBSD community, so go check that out

448
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,520
if you like yourself the BSD news.

449
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:31,200
But we wanted to sneak in just a real quick deck update.

450
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,160
There's some interesting technical details

451
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,400
that we learned about the Steam Deck's Linux implementation.

452
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
Not only will the Steam Deck be using Wayland,

453
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,840
but it seems like once again they've

454
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,960
decided to take on the hard problem of building

455
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,160
their own compositor.

456
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,920
Building their own compositor, yes, that's right.

457
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,200
It appears Valve's Pierre-Lou Graffé has developed GameScope

458
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,120
as a follow-up to the Steam Comp Manager, which was previously

459
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,760
used for this role, on the original Debian-based Steam OS.

460
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,280
He tweeted a short video of a game

461
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,280
being played on the Deck, and it had a crosshair cursor,

462
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,680
which people noticed and then asked him about.

463
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
Nerds.

464
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,280
Yeah, exactly, right?

465
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,160
He replied, yes, this is Steam OS on the Deck,

466
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,000
and it uses GameScope.

467
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,200
The cursor is drawn by xWayland.

468
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,040
Huh.

469
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,960
GameScope is the new compositor, eh?

470
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,320
GameScope is the new compositor, and there's

471
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,520
some bits in there, too, that suggests maybe Steam OS 3.0 is

472
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,680
powered by Vulkan.

473
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,160
That wouldn't surprise me at all.

474
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,240
I think it would require Vulkan just for Proton

475
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,000
to work completely.

476
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,080
I noticed that Neil, who's not here today,

477
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,240
has submitted a proposal to create a spin of Fedora

478
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,280
targeted at the Steam Deck that would be Fedora for game

479
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,080
developers and players.

480
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,520
And you wonder, what would the advantage of that be?

481
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,960
But one advantage would be that then it

482
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,240
could be essentially a meta package of sorts

483
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,640
that you could DNF install and get all of that stuff

484
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
you need to create and develop games on Linux.

485
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,000
So that actually could be a pretty slick solution.

486
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,880
But right now, we're just going to wait and see.

487
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,240
We haven't seen the release of Steam OS 3.0,

488
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,360
and we're getting a trickle feed of information.

489
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm hoping I'd love for one day to be

490
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,480
able to chat with somebody at Valve about the Linux

491
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,000
implementation, because we just love to geek out

492
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,320
about that kind of stuff.

493
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,040
We'll see.

494
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,880
Maybe one day.

495
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,360
If you're listening at Valve, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

496
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,040
Let us know.

497
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,400
We can come to you.

498
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,080
No problem.

499
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,000
That's right.

500
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,560
All right, well, one more community news item before we

501
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,040
go.

502
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,240
We deployed a matrix server.

503
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,480
It continues to grow.

504
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,920
The information is at linuxunplug.com.

505
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
And it's a project that we watch with a lot of interest.

506
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,160
And it seems that Element, the creators of the Element chat

507
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,800
client, and they also work on the core matrix protocol,

508
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,880
just raised a significant chunk of money.

509
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,040
Yeah, they've just raised $30 million of Series B funding

510
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,480
in order to further accelerate matrix development

511
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,440
and improve Element, the chat client.

512
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,040
It's a little confusing, because Element's

513
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,320
both the name of the client and the name of the startup.

514
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,440
Yeah, I wasn't really sure how to explain that.

515
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,280
You're right.

516
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,160
And they also work on the core matrix protocol as well.

517
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
They're like some of the core contributors.

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,720
The people that are throwing in the money this time

519
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,640
is led by Protocol Labs and MetaPlanet.

520
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,240
That's a fund that was established

521
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,480
by the co-founder of Skype and Kazaa.

522
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,520
And both Protocol Labs and MetaPlanet are big fans

523
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,400
and have publicly supported decentralized communication

524
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
in the past.

525
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,240
So it does seem likely that this is a great source of funding

526
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,040
that their visions of how they want to see communications

527
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,880
and where Element is taking things line up.

528
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,520
Because when you see funding like this,

529
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,840
you wonder, OK, well, what's their agenda?

530
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,640
But it seems, early days here, but it seems

531
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,520
like things are lining up.

532
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,040
It has led some folks to wonder that since Protocol Labs is

533
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,960
involved, might there be some overlap between IPFS

534
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
and matrix?

535
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,040
And at least in this initial announcement,

536
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,600
it sounds like, yeah, where the tech makes sense anyway,

537
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,280
the teams are looking to work more closely together.

538
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

539
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,840
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on a new account,

540
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,000
and you support the show by going to linode.com slash

541
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,680
unplugged.

542
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,560
Linode is our hosting provider for everything

543
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
that we've built in the last couple of years,

544
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,800
and we just doubled down when we went independent.

545
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,960
I was using them for about two years

546
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,920
before we made the switch for the JB infrastructure.

547
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
When we got the keys back to the kingdom,

548
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,720
when we went independent again, we went this direction,

549
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,040
and we've just gone all in.

550
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,760
Their infrastructure is super solid.

551
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,240
It's flexible, and it's fast.

552
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,600
You can focus on your project and not your infrastructure.

553
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,800
And while I'm here right now dealing with a server

554
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,680
outage on our LAN, my first thought

555
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,400
is there's no way I can get a replacement server in six days

556
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,080
before I leave or get one set up.

557
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,440
I'm going to look through the services we're

558
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,320
running on our local host here, and I'm

559
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,640
going to spin them up on Linode.

560
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,680
And that's just going to be the quickest and most reliable

561
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,120
solution for a lot of this stuff.

562
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
They have 11 data centers to choose from,

563
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,680
so I'll probably pick something centralized

564
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,320
for where I'll be traveling.

565
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,680
Every service level they have is backed by the best customer

566
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,000
support in the business, and when that matters,

567
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,240
it really, really matters.

568
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,080
And what Linode has done is they have honed and crafted

569
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,520
a fine product.

570
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,600
They've been doing this for 18 years,

571
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,040
and they've really focused on just making it better

572
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,480
over all of those years, and they have remained independent

573
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,320
the entire time.

574
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,120
Wow.

575
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,680
I have so much respect for that.

576
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,520
Imagine the headwinds they were facing

577
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,320
when some of the larger hyperscalers launched,

578
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,200
like when AWS came around.

579
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,680
And then when VC funded competitors

580
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,880
came that could basically just burn money

581
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,800
and they just brought on another VC anytime

582
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,480
they needed more money.

583
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,960
They had to remain competitive, and they

584
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,600
had to make their product more appealing than people

585
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,360
that essentially had endless money on either side of them.

586
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,640
And they did it.

587
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,480
They made their product more competitive,

588
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,160
and I watched them do it.

589
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,040
I watched them, and they won me over.

590
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,760
I didn't have to choose Linode.

591
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,280
I chose to come over to Linode after watching

592
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
them respond to the market and build something better,

593
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
but stay true to their original vision

594
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,040
about making cloud computing accessible and affordable

595
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,760
for just darn near everybody.

596
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,160
Their prices are 30% to 50% less than other providers,

597
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,840
and their systems are just screamers.

598
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,960
They continually invest in the hardware.

599
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,320
They know what they have to do to remain competitive,

600
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,520
and they're all about it.

601
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,480
It's not like one of the many businesses that they run,

602
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,800
or it's not like one of the very, very many businesses

603
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,400
that their VC is funding.

604
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,160
It's not part of their business.

605
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
This is what they do.

606
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,240
It is totally all about the best experience

607
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,720
of running stuff on Linux.

608
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,000
And they got a ton of distros for you to choose from.

609
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,600
They've got bare metal machines in the works right now.

610
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,760
I just recently set up a box to just hold some data for me

611
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,140
up in the cloud, and I have a system here

612
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,040
where I select what datasets I want to go up,

613
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,040
and it uploads it up to a Linode box.

614
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,320
On the back end, I have my file system mounted

615
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,200
to their object storage, so it just expands as I need it.

616
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
It's so flexible, so powerful,

617
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,640
and now I am really appreciating how reliable it is.

618
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,980
But I'd love you to try it out.

619
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,880
Maybe it's part of a multi-cloud strategy.

620
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,560
Maybe you want to performance test your system,

621
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,460
or maybe you need a backup server like I do.

622
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,280
So go to linode.com slash unplug.

623
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,520
Get that $100 for your new account,

624
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,040
and just try this stuff out.

625
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,600
Go build something, or maybe learn something,

626
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,380
and you support the show while you're doing it.

627
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,900
There are a lot of ways and a lot of companies

628
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,440
that let you host stuff.

629
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,980
I mean, there's just an unbelievable amount now.

630
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,480
But none of them, none of them check all the boxes

631
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,300
like Linode.

632
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,460
When it comes to the performance,

633
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,840
when it comes to the customer support,

634
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,260
when it comes to the reliability, the clean dashboard,

635
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,300
the API, which I don't talk about enough,

636
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,400
the command line client, which I also don't talk about,

637
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,020
the whole picture with Linode.

638
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,040
And it's just one of those things

639
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,060
you have to experience for yourself.

640
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,420
Linode.com slash unplugged.

641
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,180
During our upcoming Jupiter Colony reunion road trip,

642
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,580
I suspect there will definitely be some moments

643
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,540
when bandwidth and resources are a little constrained.

644
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,780
But that can't stop the shows.

645
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,380
They must go on.

646
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,820
That's what led us on our quest

647
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,940
to build a powerful workstation in the cloud.

648
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,540
That could be our steady state, a system to rely on,

649
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,300
a system we can jump back onto anytime we need a lot

650
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,140
of compute, a lot of bandwidth, need

651
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,260
to download a lot of resources, and we don't want to use

652
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,840
maybe a constrained mobile connection

653
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,500
or whatever sketchy coffee shop Wi-Fi we can find at the time.

654
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,740
But we needed a way to do that, and ideally,

655
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,020
a full graphical workstation because some of our tools,

656
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,340
we might be rendering audio, we might be streaming something.

657
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,540
We don't want to be constrained just by a console.

658
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,840
And so we decided to give WebTop a try.

659
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,980
We had heard this lets you do this,

660
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,900
and we thought maybe eventually we

661
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,260
could turn this into like a remote rendering system.

662
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,120
Because when Wes and I do Linux action news on Sunday,

663
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,420
it's gotten to the point now where the export of our audio

664
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,480
is one to one almost with the length of the audio

665
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,780
because we're doing a new workflow where we're

666
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,700
doing the effects in a new way.

667
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,740
And it's a super cool learning experience,

668
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,580
and it's both really impressed Wes and I, I think,

669
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,060
with what you can do on Linux now with audio,

670
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,380
even when it requires like a Windows plug-in or something

671
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,100
like that.

672
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,340
But it also has cost us a lot in render time.

673
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,020
And so we thought after the road trip,

674
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,460
this is probably something we'd keep around.

675
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,780
I initially was thinking we could use the NAS here

676
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,300
in the studio because it has 24 cores we could use for rendering.

677
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,060
But then later, like 20 minutes ago, 15 minutes ago,

678
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,820
I started thinking maybe we want to do this

679
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,100
on like a big old powerful Linode.

680
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,300
And I know, Wes, you jumped in there last night

681
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,180
and tried to mess around with Reaper

682
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,260
and try to get it running.

683
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,580
Before we get into WebTop and all of that,

684
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,940
I'm just curious how far you're able to push it as a desktop.

685
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,180
I mean, pretty far.

686
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,100
I ultimately ran into some issues

687
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,980
getting some of the weirder wine apps to run.

688
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,520
But I suspect some of those issues

689
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,540
might have been the host system that I happened to pick.

690
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,660
I picked one of our servers running on Linode

691
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,740
to try this out.

692
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,940
Probably should have spun up at something dedicated,

693
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,820
but trying to be quick here.

694
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,260
And that was a pretty old kernel.

695
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,740
So I think some of the issues might have been related.

696
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,340
But besides the few kind of out there wine applications,

697
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,460
everything was working surprisingly well.

698
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,780
I mean, I got Reaper up and running.

699
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,940
I even re-streamed the Koda Radio live stream

700
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,000
yesterday with OBS running in WebTop on this server,

701
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,300
doing a video capture out of the browser.

702
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,660
And it worked.

703
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,620
That's impressive.

704
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,800
So the technology here is WebTop.

705
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,700
You get an Alpine or Ubuntu-based container

706
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,060
that has a full desktop environment.

707
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,340
And you access it using RDP.

708
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,340
They bundle it with Guacamole, which

709
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,820
is a XRDP web-embedded client.

710
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,020
So the end product, the way you consume it, is at a URL.

711
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,540
It just spins up a URL.

712
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,260
I think it's like port 3000.

713
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,420
You get a login prompt.

714
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,580
You provide the user credentials,

715
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,020
which is like ABC by default. And you're in.

716
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,340
You get a desktop, and you pick which kind you want.

717
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,020
I think by default, it's Alpine with Ubuntu

718
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,660
if you don't specify a tag.

719
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,180
But if you specify the tag, like we did,

720
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,260
you can get Ubuntu with Plasma.

721
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,220
And their version is based on Ubuntu 20.04,

722
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,380
which is pretty reasonable.

723
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,500
That's the LTS, makes a pretty good workstation.

724
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,180
But it is a little funky, like Wes just hinted at,

725
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,940
because it's a container.

726
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,380
It's not a VM.

727
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,200
It seems like a simple concept to wrap your noggin around

728
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,420
when I say it.

729
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,340
But when you're using it, you immediately forget

730
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,620
you're inside a container.

731
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,420
You really do.

732
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,460
You really do.

733
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,400
Yeah, and you just don't have any clue,

734
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,020
until you do a uname.

735
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,180
And you see some weird kernel version

736
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
that doesn't ship in 20.04.

737
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,980
And that's when it all dawned on me.

738
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,480
Oh, yeah, right.

739
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,460
There's a host system under this.

740
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,840
So that would be a tip of mine.

741
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,260
And I think Wes's, it sounds like,

742
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,200
is maybe deploy this with a host OS that

743
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,340
has a more modern kernel.

744
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,560
So that way, any applications you

745
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,360
might need in the container that take advantage

746
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,860
of modern kernel features have that,

747
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,460
because we did run into that.

748
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,260
Yeah, it's like an upside and a downside,

749
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,960
I think, of easy containerization, right?

750
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,740
And this is one area where virtualization

751
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,140
and containerization can go hand in hand, really.

752
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,260
The whole setup process is really pretty straightforward

753
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,980
if you're using Docker Compose, right?

754
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,480
Oh, yeah.

755
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,820
I mean, this is a great release from Linux Server I.O.

756
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,740
Because they've just thought of a lot of stuff.

757
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,700
And they hit on it here.

758
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,620
They admit it kind of goes against the Docker grain,

759
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,540
because you're running a whole bunch of services

760
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,980
in a single container.

761
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,360
And as it's set up by default, you

762
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,820
should be aware that it's a weird kind of hodgepodge

763
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,780
in between the way a lot of the Docker tooling is meant to work.

764
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,300
But it's not really a VM.

765
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,700
But it's somewhere in the middle.

766
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,840
So by default, I think it's set up so everything in your home

767
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,580
directory stays.

768
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,180
But if you blow the container away and spin it back up,

769
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,500
well, you're going to have to reconfigure the operating

770
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,140
system.

771
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,380
The performance is surprisingly good.

772
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,020
Because like I mentioned, it's not using VNC or Spice.

773
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,620
It's using RDP.

774
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,380
And the XRDP project has actually

775
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,180
gotten some love in the last few years.

776
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,640
So it's stayed pretty performant.

777
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,060
And I experienced a totally usable session of Plasma.

778
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,500
I did turn the effects to instant

779
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
just because I wanted to, to make it maybe feel

780
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,200
a little faster.

781
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,020
We're trying to be generous here.

782
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,980
Yeah, and why waste the bandwidth

783
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,780
trying to transmit and render a fade-in and fade-out

784
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,380
of a menu when it can just be an instant pop-up?

785
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,820
So that was my thinking.

786
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,420
But I was able to use that kind of configuration of Plasma

787
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,180
on an iPad over LTE.

788
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,700
That was like my ultimate edge case,

789
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,880
is could I turn an iPad into a Linux desktop that

790
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,580
has its own dedicated connection so I'm not

791
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,780
stealing from my limited LAN bandwidth when I'm on the road.

792
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,740
And it worked.

793
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,560
It freaking worked.

794
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,220
And it was totally usable.

795
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,860
And they have this nice little menu that expands out

796
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,940
from the left-hand side.

797
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,820
They have a little arrow, and you tap that arrow or click it.

798
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,480
And a little drawer slides out.

799
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,700
And in there, they have the ability

800
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,060
to kick off a keyboard overlay if you need it.

801
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,820
They have a clipboard, so you can copy and paste

802
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,860
contents between your remote desktop and your local desktop.

803
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,980
Super handy.

804
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,940
So there, you can kind of copy out

805
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,300
whatever is in the clipboard.

806
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,060
And if you paste something in, that

807
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,660
becomes the new clipboard contents in the container.

808
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,500
That's so great.

809
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,300
And I needed that almost immediately.

810
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:18,820
So.

811
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,900
Yeah, exactly.

812
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,620
I was like, how do I?

813
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,180
Oh, my gosh.

814
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,900
I don't want to.

815
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,140
OK, honestly, the first time I just

816
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,820
used Netcat to get some data in there,

817
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,260
that was before I discovered the handy clipboard support.

818
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,020
Amazing.

819
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,500
Amazing.

820
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,220
And I love how you're playing like it was Netcat when you

821
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,980
and I both know it was Magic Wormhole.

822
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,700
I used both.

823
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,860
OK, I just got tired of having to hop onto the host

824
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,780
system to use Netcat.

825
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,740
So yeah, OK, Magic Wormhole's handy too.

826
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,900
Yeah, they're both good.

827
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,500
But it's just, there is something really

828
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,260
that sparks my fancy about this, because in my old IT days,

829
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,060
I deployed a lot of thin clients and terminal services.

830
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,880
I did Linux terminal services and Windows terminal services.

831
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,940
And you could just use this to really kind of accomplish

832
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,460
the same dang thing.

833
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,080
I mean, I think if I was going to use it

834
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,580
for a really extended period of time,

835
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,420
there's a few modifications I might like to make to it.

836
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,740
The whole thing right now is kind of based around the ABC

837
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,940
user.

838
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,660
And I think things get a little hairy

839
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,700
if you want to change that.

840
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,860
And I do not like that.

841
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,020
So that's something I'd want to spelunk into a little bit.

842
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,580
What are your thoughts on changing the username?

843
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,980
Because it looks like by their docs, they don't recommend it.

844
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,120
Yeah, they do mention that.

845
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,380
But they do have some decent docs

846
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,100
in here about for developers if you

847
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,380
want to build your own image.

848
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,780
So I think it's possible with a little consideration.

849
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,940
It is, ABC is not the best username.

850
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,540
And it would be nice to be able to customize this.

851
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,100
I think maybe, too, we might want a version based on Arch,

852
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,060
perhaps.

853
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,220
Maybe that would be kind of cool.

854
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,020
I could make 2004 work for a while, though.

855
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,300
It's not the end of the world.

856
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,020
As long as it's Plasma, that's the main thing.

857
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,500
Really, the whole idea is to have this system that's

858
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,620
running that you can reconnect to and disconnect.

859
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,460
And it has all the tools up and ready to go.

860
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,420
It's an always-on state.

861
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,100
And we experimented with this.

862
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,340
You can join and reattach to sessions

863
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,020
and leave things running from different web browsers,

864
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,900
from different IP addresses.

865
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,940
It's all based around the user credentials.

866
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,180
So that means that we can leave things.

867
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,740
Wes could stage something for me.

868
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,380
I could leave something staged for Wes.

869
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,420
He can pop in and finish it.

870
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,860
That kind of back-and-forth collaboration ability

871
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,700
while we're remote and on the go and with limited connectivity,

872
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,460
jeez, man, this is just going to be a lifesaver.

873
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,780
It's not as flexible as something like shells.com

874
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,540
that lets you run a whole bunch of different distros

875
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,700
and all that kind of stuff.

876
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,260
It's one distro, one desktop environment,

877
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,840
really meant for one user.

878
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,180
The way Wes and I are going to use it, it's really for two users.

879
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,540
And it's not really meant for a whole suite of users

880
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,780
and stuff like that.

881
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,580
But if you need something for yourself,

882
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,380
if you want a full desktop environment that

883
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,420
runs in your web browser with really good support

884
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,900
and pixel-perfect resolution rendering,

885
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,220
if you resize your web browser, your desktop environment

886
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,700
sees that as a screen resize and adjusts to accommodate it

887
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,540
pretty quickly.

888
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,740
Yeah, it really is impressive.

889
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,620
And I've got to just have a lot of respect

890
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,700
for the work, the folks behind this implementation.

891
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,000
It's relying on a lot of different open-source software.

892
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,420
But I think the Linux server folks

893
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,060
have really done a good job of taking it to the next level

894
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,620
and combining all of those pieces in a thoughtful way that

895
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,420
just works really nicely.

896
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,220
By default, one of the example compose files they have,

897
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,340
it actually even mounts the Docker socket in there.

898
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,660
Now, security-wise, you should be careful with this,

899
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,180
of course.

900
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,940
But if you're doing this in a controlled environment

901
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,940
where you want to use this as an admin machine

902
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,340
for the whole VM, now in your remote desktop,

903
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,700
you can launch up other containers on that server.

904
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,580
It's really cool the amount of possibilities that you have

905
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,020
and sort of serverizes and deploys

906
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,820
the power of the Linux desktop in a way that

907
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,460
might be a lot more difficult with a proprietary desktop.

908
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,780
But for us, it's just install Plasma in a Docker container.

909
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,500
Go for it.

910
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,140
Yep.

911
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,700
Yeah, that's such a great point.

912
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,900
ByteBit, and it sounds like you were thinking about doing this

913
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,980
with a Raspberry Pi.

914
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,500
Yeah, so I like working with a graphical user interface.

915
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,620
But with the Raspberry Pi, you want

916
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,620
to save as much resources as possible.

917
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,140
So I install the headless version, install Docker,

918
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,180
install WebTop.

919
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,060
And when I need a desktop, I launch WebTop.

920
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,420
When I'm done, I shut the container down

921
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,140
and put it up when I need it.

922
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,700
But I have the resources available to me

923
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,460
without a full desktop.

924
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,060
Yeah, and all of the packages it would

925
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,500
require to be installed on the host system

926
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,100
to support the desktop, even when you're not running it.

927
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,700
Oh, good point.

928
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,380
Yeah.

929
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,980
Nice little optimization right there.

930
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,220
Yeah, that's something I might want to try in the future.

931
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,700
I think that's the part that's nice about this,

932
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,580
is some of the extra flexibility, too.

933
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,300
One of the things we were highlighting

934
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,540
is running it on Linode, which is great because they

935
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,860
have super fast bandwidth.

936
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,620
And we can get fast processing and fast disk and connection

937
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,820
wherever we need.

938
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,140
But you might also want it, like you

939
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,740
were mentioning, on a server somewhere that's super beefy

940
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,300
or has local access to some data that you might need

941
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,580
to run experiments on or to do analysis on

942
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,740
or just to have a really powerful server

943
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,300
to offload some rendering to.

944
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:54,900
Yep, yep.

945
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,220
And something else you and I were talking about off air

946
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,700
for our use case, we have a system here

947
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,500
in the studio that records our shows.

948
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,020
And it also does tons of really great Jack audio routing

949
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,340
for remote hosts and guests and the Mumble Room

950
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,620
and brings it all together independently, digitally,

951
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,380
into our specific tracks in Reaper for us.

952
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,780
And it's just such an awesome machine.

953
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,180
I hate to even touch it, but it is old.

954
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,780
It's got eight gigs of RAM.

955
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,940
It's got super old processors, old disks.

956
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,180
It's in a bad way.

957
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,700
And I do want to replace it, but I

958
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,100
don't want to replace it with a $5,000 system, which

959
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,460
is what we would need to get enough CPU cores and memory

960
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,220
to do the rendering we want in a reasonable time.

961
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,140
And so my thought was is perhaps this

962
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,340
is an opportunity to offload this work to a server.

963
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,820
We do the core recording on this machine.

964
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,220
We stage everything.

965
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,780
We export the project out, load it up in this web top instance

966
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,260
up on Linode with a dedicated CPU machine,

967
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,460
and then we just let it go to town for a while.

968
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,540
And then we only have to deal with it just as a recorder.

969
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,380
And it keeps our costs down.

970
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,820
It keeps the noise of the machine

971
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,300
down here in the studio.

972
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,620
So that might be something we do,

973
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
or I may end up now having to replace

974
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,260
the server in the garage.

975
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,820
And maybe there we go with something

976
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,320
that has a lot of extra horsepower.

977
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,020
And we offload some of the processing job using web top.

978
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,180
We move the project file over.

979
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,780
We log into web top, fire up Reaper,

980
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,260
and begin rendering the project.

981
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,060
And what's so neat too is you've got both sides of it

982
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,300
in that if it's something you need to go in and futz with

983
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,780
in the UI, you have a graphical UI.

984
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,880
But in the same sense, it's just a Linux install.

985
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,060
So you can have SSH in there if you need,

986
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,800
or whatever back to our access to go in,

987
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,620
kick off the script that way or with automation,

988
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,020
and then check on it visually.

989
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,740
Yep, and like everything the Linux server IO guys put out,

990
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,920
it's really, really well done.

991
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,140
The Docker compose file is easy to read.

992
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,280
It's easy to understand.

993
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,060
And then they have some great documentation

994
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,340
that explains it all,

995
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,700
that we will have linked in the show notes

996
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,460
at linuxunplug.com slash 416.

997
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,280
Go check it out.

998
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,380
I think they've done a fantastic job.

999
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,220
And I'd love to know other ways

1000
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,100
you particularly solve this problem.

1001
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,580
Let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1002
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,580
Linux.entropy.works, use promo code LUP13 and save 15%.

1003
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,740
This is a member of our community

1004
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,420
and I love watching them go.

1005
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,860
They're an industry leading mobile

1006
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,020
and web development studio based in the UK.

1007
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,220
And Entropy has global clients,

1008
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,180
including Mars Wrigley, Walmart, Mediacom,

1009
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,520
the Financial Times.

1010
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,420
They're trusted by some of the biggest names

1011
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,680
in media content, but it's not just about the big names.

1012
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,620
No, they wanna work with everybody.

1013
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,720
They love working with smaller companies, startups,

1014
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,420
people that are just getting into it.

1015
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,000
They just love building mobile desktop

1016
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,860
and web applications.

1017
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,140
And because they're on our show,

1018
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,360
probably not a huge surprise to you,

1019
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,740
but I love seeing this,

1020
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,880
Entropy runs on Linux.

1021
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,580
They are open source hounds.

1022
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,020
They have a team of distro hoppers

1023
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,900
and Linux hardware nerds

1024
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,140
and everything they do really goes back

1025
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,780
to their love for the Linux community.

1026
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,980
They're listeners of the show

1027
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,540
and they thought, you know what,

1028
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,100
like I preach often, let's spend locally.

1029
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,140
And I think that's a great way to go.

1030
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,460
And some of their key tools involve Ruby on Rails,

1031
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,900
of course, that's huge,

1032
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,940
but they're really moving into Flutter.

1033
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,580
Flutter for mobile and desktop

1034
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,900
and Flutter for the Linux desktop.

1035
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,300
They've pioneered some of the most complex

1036
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,260
Flutter apps ever built

1037
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,240
with full machine learning integration.

1038
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,420
They can rapidly build apps for iOS,

1039
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,660
Android, Windows, Mac OS, and yes,

1040
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,500
Linux, of course.

1041
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,800
In fact, they can pretty much do it in no time.

1042
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,640
That's how they've become

1043
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,100
one of the global leaders in Flutter development

1044
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,820
with dozens of deployments in the last year alone.

1045
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,280
So if you're thinking about taking the plunge

1046
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,780
into Flutter for the Linux desktop

1047
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,820
or maybe another platform,

1048
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,780
or maybe you're a small or large business,

1049
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,780
maybe you're just an independent dude

1050
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,500
or dudette trying to get into the app game,

1051
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,380
well, Entropy is always ready to chat.

1052
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,740
They'd love to discuss your ideas

1053
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,380
and give you some opinions, some thoughts, some input,

1054
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,540
regardless if you wanna move forward or not,

1055
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,980
they just love to chat.

1056
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,700
So get in touch, chat mobile, chat Flutter,

1057
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,500
or discuss your favorite Linux podcasts

1058
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,780
to help you get started

1059
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,500
and to help incentivize you a little bit.

1060
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,220
They're offering Linux Unplugged listeners

1061
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,560
15% off their first project.

1062
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,520
Mobile app, web app, maybe a Linux app.

1063
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,460
If I could vote, build a Linux app

1064
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,280
that makes recording PipeWire sources super easy

1065
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,340
and build it around Flutter.

1066
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,720
Go talk to Entropy about that.

1067
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,640
I'd buy it.

1068
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,360
So go to linux.entropy.works,

1069
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,660
fill out their contact form, use promo code LUP13,

1070
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,780
they'll get in touch, get you started.

1071
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,160
There's never any pressure.

1072
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,260
They're always happy just to chat

1073
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,460
and discuss your project and help any way they can.

1074
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,740
So that's linux.entropy.works and use promo code LUP13.

1075
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,660
Well, I think it's time for some feedback.

1076
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,660
What do you say, Chris?

1077
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,060
Indeed, Mr. Payne, you wanna read us Nicholas's email?

1078
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,660
Cause he's got something that,

1079
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,020
well, it's one of those elephants in the room.

1080
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,580
Hey guys, huge fan of the show.

1081
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,360
I've been waiting the last couple of episodes

1082
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,100
to hear what you think of this.

1083
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,620
It's a tablet built for Linux.

1084
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,900
Not sure if you've heard about it

1085
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,760
or maybe you've had some skepticism,

1086
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,860
but I hope you guys keep doing what you do either way.

1087
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,980
And he's talking about here, the JingOS tablet.

1088
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,900
Uh-huh, yeah, we haven't talked about this, have we?

1089
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,040
No, it's been out there.

1090
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,760
I mean, I think a lot of our audience out there

1091
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,240
has probably seen it on Twitter

1092
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,300
or been written about in some of the Linux news out there.

1093
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,100
Nicholas tries to sweeten the pot a bit,

1094
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,780
noting that the developer says it's not locked to JingOS,

1095
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,500
the actual hardware he means.

1096
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,660
You're supposed to be able to boot

1097
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,420
any ARM Linux on the device.

1098
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,420
Although of course, the hardware is coming with JingOS,

1099
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,580
which is designed for the tablet experience.

1100
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,700
I don't know though, the note about skepticism in here

1101
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,900
rang true for me.

1102
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,700
I mean, not just about Linux tablets,

1103
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,940
but kind of non-iPad tablets at all, if I'm honest.

1104
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,740
Yeah, that must be part of it.

1105
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,540
I know the reason why we haven't talked about it

1106
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,420
is because Wes and I are becoming

1107
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,260
so skeptical about all of these types of things.

1108
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,380
And this one seems particularly tricky

1109
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,340
because you've got the JingPad, which is a hardware device,

1110
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,760
and then you've got JingOS.

1111
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,940
And the ask here from the Jing folks

1112
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,960
is for us to believe that both of those things, the OS

1113
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,380
and the hardware, will be in some kind of production state

1114
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,820
that it's worth dropping $600 on.

1115
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,020
And it's a great price when you consider it $600

1116
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,540
and that includes the keyboard, which Apple charges like $300

1117
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,220
just for the keyboard.

1118
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,220
And then the tablet's like $1,000 on top of that.

1119
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,980
Right.

1120
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,780
But you're right.

1121
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,300
It's not only are we just skeptical of these kinds

1122
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,900
of devices now.

1123
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,580
I was on late night Linux this week,

1124
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,180
and we talked about grifters and open source and free software.

1125
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,780
And we've just seen so many grifters now

1126
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,900
that it is hard to believe anything's

1127
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,300
going to actually succeed.

1128
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,500
And so part of us just sits here and goes, well,

1129
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,820
when you ship, we'll believe you.

1130
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,940
Like the framework laptop.

1131
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,660
I think that same skepticism was applied

1132
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,700
to the framework laptop.

1133
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,460
Yeah, really.

1134
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,740
However, the downside to that is sometimes

1135
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,980
we miss cool things really early in the stage.

1136
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,340
It's like we've gotten old and bitter.

1137
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,500
We're missing the new stuff.

1138
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,180
We don't want to be that cynical, right?

1139
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,340
We should still have hope.

1140
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,380
I think that's essential.

1141
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,580
And we want to support projects that have a reasonable chance

1142
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,300
of working out.

1143
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,580
Right, right.

1144
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,660
However, I have seen some videos of the Jing Pad running Jing

1145
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,560
OS.

1146
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,900
And it's early days still, but it looks surprisingly good.

1147
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,340
To say it's been heavily inspired by iPad OS

1148
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,020
would be an understatement.

1149
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,820
But it has taken a lot of the elements

1150
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,340
that work well in iPad OS and applied them

1151
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,020
to a Linux environment.

1152
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,520
And this is once again offering that idea

1153
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,060
that you could have something that works in a tablet mode

1154
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,220
and also can be switched to a desktop mode

1155
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,460
for greater productivity.

1156
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,740
Convergence.

1157
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,660
Yeah, convergence.

1158
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,040
I've never heard that one before.

1159
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,180
And these kinds of things, they just check a skepticism box.

1160
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,820
So something that looks like iPad OS but isn't

1161
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,160
means that it's never going to quite be as good as the thing

1162
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,620
it's attempting to emulate.

1163
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,900
Something that offers convergence but so new

1164
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,220
and doesn't have super high-end hardware leaves me skeptical.

1165
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,100
I think you're hitting on it right there,

1166
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,140
is that it's not that they're not saying the right things.

1167
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,980
It's not that these aren't good goals.

1168
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,400
But we've seen so many folks have these goals.

1169
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,980
And then it's not even that they didn't get part of the way.

1170
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,340
But the claim and the competition on the market

1171
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,220
is executed on such a level and with the amount of polish

1172
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,060
that when you just sort of casually imply

1173
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,820
that's what you're building to, and then it doesn't hold up,

1174
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,500
you really start doubting, like, does our community even

1175
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,700
get why people like these other proprietary solutions?

1176
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,020
Yep, well said.

1177
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,100
Now, it seems conceivable, Wes, that as time goes on,

1178
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,380
technology improves, software projects

1179
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:38,180
continue to get iterated on, hardware gets better and better,

1180
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,660
display technology and CPUs in particular

1181
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,340
have just really just gotten better and better.

1182
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,660
I mean, maybe at some point, those things

1183
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:48,820
converge in a way that makes it possible for a promise

1184
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,340
like this to actually be met.

1185
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:53,100
And we'll be over here on the skepticism sidelines,

1186
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,940
thinking it's never going to happen.

1187
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:58,220
And we've missed this convergence of timing and hardware

1188
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,240
and software.

1189
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,820
And something great does come from it.

1190
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,220
But what we try to do is we try to talk about things

1191
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,180
on the show that we know are likely going to produce.

1192
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,980
And they're going to result in something.

1193
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,780
And if we talk about it and you go spend your money,

1194
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,380
you're not going to get scammed.

1195
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,860
Because I'm still waiting on my damn Atari VCS.

1196
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,580
And it was a lot of those types of things back in that era

1197
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,160
that just sort of burned me out on this.

1198
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,980
And now I want to see proof.

1199
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,220
I want to see a product.

1200
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,420
And I want to see it really starting to ship, at least

1201
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,260
to reviewers, before we really go in on it.

1202
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,860
But it's not to say we're not at least keeping our eye on it.

1203
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,020
And I do wonder if maybe we missed the boat on this.

1204
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,280
And maybe we should have talked about it earlier or not.

1205
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,240
But I still stand by that core principle of,

1206
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
I don't want the audience getting scammed.

1207
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,740
That's one area maybe where some of the Pine stuff

1208
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,300
has been a little more successful.

1209
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,500
Or at least, they've had an approach

1210
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,820
of not setting expectations too high.

1211
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,900
That's where it really gets dangerous to my mind.

1212
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,620
Right, is setting those expectations too high

1213
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,740
and then being unable to ever really achieve

1214
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,740
the initial promise.

1215
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,260
Yeah.

1216
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,220
Because I want us to play.

1217
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,380
I want us to try these things.

1218
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,020
But we just need to be honest if we're still

1219
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,420
working out a lot of the kinks.

1220
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,620
I like their progress.

1221
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,500
I'm happy to see this landing in reviewers' hands.

1222
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,900
And I think it's time to start taking it more seriously.

1223
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,060
And I may end up having to re-evaluate my stance

1224
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,500
on these types of projects.

1225
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
If both the framework laptop and the JingPad

1226
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,660
end up actually being really solid products that deliver

1227
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,340
on their promises, well, then that

1228
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,460
means it's time for Chris to reconsider this line

1229
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:26,220
and figure out where that line should lie, I suspect.

1230
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,100
Well, watch.

1231
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,860
I actually do really hope that I have reason

1232
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,860
to re-evaluate the skepticism that has brewed inside me.

1233
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,780
We'll see.

1234
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,620
Also, I'd like to make a call out on the podcast.

1235
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,340
We're looking to chat with someone at Bedrock Linux.

1236
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,820
Please email me, chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1237
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,100
It's on our minds, and we'd like to chat with you.

1238
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,900
Well, like I mentioned, I was on Late Night Linux this week.

1239
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,940
Go check out Late Night Linux for that.

1240
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,800
We chatted about SyncThing, which my SyncThing install just

1241
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,020
recently hit the two-year mark.

1242
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,780
It's been running really solid.

1243
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,380
And the guys had me on to chat about that,

1244
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,020
grifters in the open source community,

1245
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,980
and a little fedora silver blue.

1246
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,860
So that was Late Night Linux episode 135,

1247
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,580
where I joined the boys.

1248
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,500
It was a good time.

1249
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,820
Go check that out.

1250
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,460
We'd love to have you join our Telegram group.

1251
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,260
I posted the most adorable picture of Levi

1252
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,180
in there this morning.

1253
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,540
I don't do it often.

1254
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,460
But every now and then, the really good ones,

1255
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,340
I drop them in there at jupiterbroadcasting.com

1256
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,640
slash Telegram.

1257
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,020
And if you join while this podcast is out,

1258
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,100
it's probably not too far back in there.

1259
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,180
Or you could just look at all the photos, I suppose.

1260
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,900
You can do that.

1261
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,180
So jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

1262
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,100
And maybe as a bonus, there's a little bit of Linux chat

1263
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,580
sometimes, but mostly dog pics.

1264
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,100
That's not, it's mostly Linux chat.

1265
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,660
It is, but I mean, you saw the picture.

1266
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,820
It's very cute.

1267
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:49,140
It was adorable.

1268
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,020
Meetup.com slash jupiterbroadcasting,

1269
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,020
and last but not least, we'd love to hear from you.

1270
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,060
Linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1271
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,260
That goes into an inbox that both Wes and I can check

1272
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,700
and read, and we try to read every single one of them.

1273
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,380
Even if we don't respond, and they don't all

1274
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,940
make it into the show, we try to read every email every week.

1275
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,300
That's linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1276
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,060
I imagine I'll be worse at that practice

1277
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,880
while I'm on the road, but when I get back,

1278
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,220
I'll try to get that back in.

1279
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,080
It's something I, it's a goal of mine recently

1280
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,780
because I ask you to send the email in.

1281
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,080
The least I could do is read it.

1282
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,180
So it is actually a personal goal of mine

1283
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,480
to read each one of them that comes in.

1284
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,160
It may be a little sketchy while I'm on the road,

1285
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,180
but we do try.

1286
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,820
And last but absolutely not least, actually,

1287
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,340
I need to mention the Luplug.

1288
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,500
They get together every Sunday noon Pacific

1289
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,300
in our Mumble Room at linuxunplug.com slash Mumble.

1290
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,660
You can get the details, and then you join,

1291
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,500
and you're good to go.

1292
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,740
You hang out and chat with some like-minded folks.

1293
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,500
Get the info, linuxunplug.com slash Mumble.

1294
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,420
When we were fooling around with our cloud Linux desktop,

1295
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,020
you came across a pretty neat trick.

1296
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,180
Yeah, this is by a gentleman named Scotty Hardy on GitHub.

1297
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:58,480
It's called Docker Wine, and it's a Docker image

1298
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,260
that includes wine and wine tricks.

1299
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,240
But not only that, it's pre-configured

1300
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,020
with a handy little helper script

1301
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:07,660
that's ready to set things up locally with X11 forwarding.

1302
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,300
If you've got an X server running and just wanna run the app

1303
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,180
in the container, or it's got RDP built in

1304
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:16,540
if you wanna run this wine app on a remote server.

1305
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,980
Which means it also supports audio redirection.

1306
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,860
It'll play sounds through Pulse Audio on your Linux box

1307
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,080
using this whole setup.

1308
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,620
So Windows applications in a container

1309
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,060
that you're connecting to over RDP with sound support.

1310
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,480
And the name is cleverly Docker Wine.

1311
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,980
We'll have a link to this in the show notes.

1312
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,820
This is great.

1313
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,340
This is so neat because you sometimes need to crap up

1314
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,820
your system to get all of this wine stuff working.

1315
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,940
Yeah, no one wants to install all these weird,

1316
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,580
janky Windows programs, right?

1317
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,900
That's the perfect use case for a container.

1318
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,740
It really is.

1319
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,580
Like, just go crap up a container,

1320
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,820
and then when you're done with it, you throw it away.

1321
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,300
And what's so nice about this project

1322
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,620
is that as somebody who does weird things

1323
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,780
with containers and plates with it,

1324
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,220
there can be some arcane tricks between user permissions,

1325
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,300
between mounting all the right Pulse and X11 stuff,

1326
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,780
let alone configuring the RDP connection to be easy.

1327
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,580
So it's just nice that a lot of that knowledge and trickery

1328
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:10,020
is distilled in one handy little script you can run.

1329
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,580
Well, I'm gonna check on the server.

1330
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,180
It looks like it's still up, Wes.

1331
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,700
Huh, I wonder why it would have crashed so soon

1332
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,060
after last time, and this time it's remained up.

1333
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,180
What's the difference, right?

1334
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,860
Something tells me we're gonna stop pinging it

1335
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,540
and stop paying attention to it after the show,

1336
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,940
and then it's gonna crash immediately.

1337
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,060
Oh boy, we gotta get this fixed.

1338
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,420
This is gonna, I think job one really is while it's up,

1339
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,780
offload as much config as I can, right?

1340
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,820
That's job one.

1341
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,260
Because the data's okay, I would rather honestly

1342
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,580
have some hardware component on the motherboard

1343
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,820
or the CPU fail than any of the disks fail.

1344
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,980
Even though we've got them in a ZFS RAID,

1345
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,780
at least all of the disks are fine.

1346
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,300
We can ultimately move those.

1347
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,660
Time to check our backups.

1348
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,660
No kidding.

1349
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,500
In the meantime, go follow the show on Twitter

1350
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,140
for news announcements or schedule changes,

1351
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,540
which I don't expect there will be,

1352
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,820
or other kinds of things like that.

1353
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,860
At Linux Unplugged, the whole network is at Jupiter Signal

1354
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,660
because yes, there are an entire network,

1355
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,740
a fantastic podcast, including the self-hosted podcasts,

1356
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,100
Encoder Radio, and of course, the companion to this show,

1357
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,020
Linux Action News, every Monday morning,

1358
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,220
Wes and I break down everything that mattered

1359
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:16,020
in the week of Linux and open source.

1360
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,380
And you gotta catch that.

1361
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,260
If you're not catching Linux Action News,

1362
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,500
you're like missing half of this show practically,

1363
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,060
but it's just the news segment,

1364
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,700
just the news you need to know.

1365
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,140
It's great too if you're in the industry.

1366
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,180
In fact, if you know anybody in the industry

1367
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,940
that should stay up to date on this stuff

1368
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,940
as part of their job, send them a link

1369
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,900
to your favorite episode of Linux Action News.

1370
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,180
It's a great way for people in the industry to stay informed.

1371
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,780
As for us, one more show in the studio before we head out.

1372
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,900
It's literally the last thing I do before I hit the road.

1373
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,660
So join us for that.

1374
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,580
It'll be the last Linux Unplugged from the studio

1375
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:53,220
for a while next Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1376
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,500
See you next week.

1377
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,140
Same bat time, same bat station.

1378
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:00,380
Indeed, links to everything we talked about today,

1379
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,780
how to contact, how to join the Mumble Room,

1380
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,700
the matrix server, all of it.

1381
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,140
What we've done is put it all together

1382
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,460
on a webpage at linuxunplugged.com.

1383
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,140
I'd like you to check it out.

1384
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,540
Also there, you'll find links to everything

1385
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,340
we've talked about for previous episodes,

1386
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,100
the entire bat catalog.

1387
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,180
It's incredible.

1388
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,500
We're still working on a Gopher version though.

1389
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,340
It'll happen.

1390
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:24,220
And maybe a Usenet version as well.

1391
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,640
Great way to download the show.

1392
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,440
Anyways, as for us, thanks for joining us

1393
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,620
on this week's episode.

1394
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,420
We'll see you back here next Tuesday!

1395
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,620
Right!

1396
00:51:33,620 --> 00:52:02,740
And we'll see you next week.

1397
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:11,380
Alright, go vote JBtitles.com.

1398
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,980
We got through it.

1399
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,260
It was rough.

1400
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,460
I am off my game, you know, because I was already getting a little rough.

1401
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:21,660
One of my data plans just got canceled on me, which has kind of sent me into a panic

1402
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,100
about the road trip.

1403
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,460
And then to have this server failure happening right now.

1404
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:36,580
I think you're a one-legged stool right now.
