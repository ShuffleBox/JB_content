WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
So I wasn't even going to share this with you guys.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.240
I'd seen this on the web, and we were

00:05.240 --> 00:08.320
talking about pre-show material.

00:08.320 --> 00:12.600
But the most interesting part about this new TCP bug

00:12.600 --> 00:16.240
is the fact that Netflix discovered it.

00:16.240 --> 00:19.280
Yeah, I wasn't really too into it, except for that part.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.640
That is kind of, I guess I'm just sort of getting exhausted

00:21.640 --> 00:22.400
on these.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.180
But it's sort of like a new version of The Ping of Death.

00:26.180 --> 00:26.760
Yeah, kind of.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.240
I mean, you get some misconfigured TCP packets sent

00:30.240 --> 00:34.840
your way, and in just the right case on an unpatched kernel,

00:34.840 --> 00:37.240
well, you might actually have a full blown kernel panic.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.120
So those are always unfortunate.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.200
Obviously, that can lead to a denial of service attack

00:41.200 --> 00:43.000
when all your boxes are crashed.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.240
Yeah, and that's not great.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.000
I think the impact has been a bit lessened

00:47.000 --> 00:49.760
because most serious boxes in production out there

00:49.760 --> 00:52.160
are behind various types of load balancers or other gateways.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.000
And many of those, typically this is not a protocol flaw.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.760
This is a flaw in Linux's implementation of the TCP stack.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.520
And FreeBSD is also affected.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.160
There's several other variants that aren't panics.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.080
They're just slowdowns.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.280
Did you guys catch its name?

01:05.280 --> 01:06.000
Sack Panic.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.240
Sack Panic.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.640
I like it.

01:10.640 --> 01:15.440
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 306 for June 18, 2019.

01:15.440 --> 01:28.520
Hello there, and welcome to Linux Unplugged,

01:28.520 --> 01:32.000
your weekly Linux talk show that's getting its way

01:32.000 --> 01:33.320
into the 300s.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.520
Feels weird, Wes.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.440
It sure does.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.240
Feels weird.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.280
Like, this show can't be 300 episodes long.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.240
We're just hanging out.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.720
We must be doing something right.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.760
I don't know about that.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.040
Or very, very wrong.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.240
We're just very persistent.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.480
We're just very persistent.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.160
Well, coming up on this week's episode,

01:48.160 --> 01:50.440
we have some community news.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.160
But we decided to do something you should never do this week.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.680
We decided to live swap out a FreeNAS

01:56.680 --> 01:59.400
system to Fedora, which we're calling

01:59.400 --> 02:03.080
from FreeNAS to Fedora our journey of live swapping

02:03.080 --> 02:05.720
a production system with a failed disk.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.400
We went out into the Jupyter broadcasting server room,

02:08.400 --> 02:11.240
brought our recording equipment, and documented our journey.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.440
Not only that, we changed the whole darn network

02:13.440 --> 02:14.240
here at the studio.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.000
It's amazing we're here at all.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.120
Yeah, we really did.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.080
We ripped out the whole network, re-IPed everything,

02:21.080 --> 02:23.320
and still managed to put a show together.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.760
We actually had a lot of fun doing it.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.520
We'll tell you about that in a little bit.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.680
But before we go any further, got to say hello to Cheesy.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.320
Hey, Chees.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.440
Hey, what's going on?

02:30.440 --> 02:32.320
Oh, you know, doing a podcast, hanging out.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.680
Yeah, you guys have been hard at work

02:33.680 --> 02:35.960
with that stuff for the last couple of days, too.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.080
Yep, we got everything back up and on just in time

02:38.080 --> 02:41.120
to say time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

02:41.120 --> 02:41.840
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:41.840 --> 02:42.400
Good morning.

02:42.400 --> 02:42.900
Hello.

02:42.900 --> 02:43.400
Hello.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.440
Good morning.

02:44.440 --> 02:44.940
Hello.

02:44.940 --> 02:45.440
Hello.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.200
Hello, Brent, and Bruce, and Byte, and Neil, and MiniMech,

02:48.200 --> 02:49.240
and Sean, and TechMav.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.120
It's nice to have you all there as we go along.

02:52.120 --> 02:56.120
And we start out with some community news.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.040
And the big item that caught my attention,

02:58.040 --> 02:59.320
there's many things we could talk about.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.600
This has been another one of those weeks

03:00.600 --> 03:02.800
where it's sort of like what we didn't put in the show

03:02.800 --> 03:05.040
is almost as important as what we put in the show.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.880
And I just thought, let's start with talking

03:06.880 --> 03:10.360
about initial benchmarks of Microsoft's new WSL 2.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.960
We're already starting to see it shipped

03:11.960 --> 03:13.960
for the people that are subscribed to the Insiders

03:13.960 --> 03:16.040
build if you really want to play with it.

03:16.040 --> 03:16.720
Yeah.

03:16.720 --> 03:19.600
And under some benchmarks, this is, of course,

03:19.600 --> 03:22.560
according to Michael Eberle over at Ferronix,

03:22.560 --> 03:24.000
he's been testing the subsystem.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.160
And in not all instances is it actually faster.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.760
It is in some, like with I-O.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.240
Yeah, right.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.840
So it has improved I-O. And that was

03:30.840 --> 03:33.960
one of the big justifications for this whole re-architecture

03:33.960 --> 03:35.280
of the subsystem.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.900
It just wasn't cutting it before.

03:36.900 --> 03:40.920
But unfortunately, in some other areas, we're not so lucky.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.720
Yeah, looking at the benchmarks here,

03:42.720 --> 03:45.920
there is certain kinds of workloads

03:45.920 --> 03:49.840
where it's significantly even slower than WSL 1

03:49.840 --> 03:52.480
and obviously slower than bare metal.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.700
He compared it to 1804 bare metal and clear Linux bare metal.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.580
And all of the benchmarks, as he always has,

03:57.580 --> 04:00.640
are linked over on his site if you want to check them out.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.360
I think it just means it's not the Linux killer

04:03.360 --> 04:04.520
that everybody worries about.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.880
It's just a practical tool to get your work done.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.680
And there are already some interesting use cases for it,

04:10.680 --> 04:13.960
Docker just posted a massive write-up

04:13.960 --> 04:15.440
that we read so you don't have to.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.980
And they write, Microsoft gave us an early build of the WSL 2

04:18.980 --> 04:21.220
so that we could evaluate the technology

04:21.220 --> 04:22.820
and see how it fit with our product.

04:22.820 --> 04:25.400
And then we could give them our feedback about what's missing

04:25.400 --> 04:26.360
or even broken.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.360
We started prototyping different approaches.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.080
And we're now ready to share a little bit

04:30.080 --> 04:32.320
about what's coming in the next few months.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.400
Docker Desktop Future.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.240
Yeah, that's the title of this section.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.260
OK, so before they had a Hyper-V based VM,

04:40.260 --> 04:42.560
and that's going to be replaced by what they're calling

04:42.560 --> 04:45.520
a WSL 2 integration package.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.560
Which is still based on Hyper-V VM,

04:47.560 --> 04:50.720
but it's like a different, more optimized new version.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.360
Yeah, exactly.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.860
So it provides all the same features

04:52.860 --> 04:54.720
as the current Docker desktop VM.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.420
So you can do Kubernetes, you can do proxy configuration,

04:57.420 --> 04:59.640
you can access the Docker daemon from Windows,

04:59.640 --> 05:02.120
and all sorts of bind mounts, all the usual Docker

05:02.120 --> 05:04.020
sort of stuff.

05:04.020 --> 05:05.280
In the past, that was it.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.800
You couldn't really mess with the underlying VM.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.000
You couldn't run additional stuff in the Linux OS

05:10.000 --> 05:12.080
that was running inside of it.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.320
With the WSL 2 integration, you'll

05:14.320 --> 05:16.800
still experience all the niceties you have from Windows.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.680
But you can run additional Linux programs inside,

05:19.680 --> 05:21.740
and they can also talk to Docker.

05:21.740 --> 05:25.160
So you can have the same Docker API running from a daemon,

05:25.160 --> 05:30.240
running on a Hyper-V VM, using WSL 2, all unified together.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.600
And they write, and a good example, a use case for this

05:32.600 --> 05:35.000
is, a lot of your scripts that you've written on the Linux

05:35.000 --> 05:38.400
side can just now be used, or on the Windows side

05:38.400 --> 05:40.560
can be used to manage the Linux boxes, vice versa.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.600
They also have a nice example of using Visual Studio Code

05:43.600 --> 05:45.480
with that remote connector setup.

05:45.480 --> 05:49.480
So you can go remote into WSL 2, and then use the Docker daemon

05:49.480 --> 05:51.600
inside, build Docker containers, run them,

05:51.600 --> 05:53.560
and then still manage it all from Windows.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.600
That's nice and tidy for those Windows developers that never

05:56.600 --> 05:58.780
want to be bothered with dirtying themselves,

05:58.780 --> 06:00.040
actually installing real Linux.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.200
Now they can use the days of having to manually configure

06:03.200 --> 06:07.080
VirtualBox with NFS shares over the net.

06:07.080 --> 06:11.320
Now they'll just use a Visual Studio Code remote to WSL.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.960
Then package all up in a Docker container.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.480
Good to go.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.320
Microsoft loves Linux, don't you, though?

06:16.320 --> 06:17.040
Good to go.

06:17.040 --> 06:17.560
Good to go.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.080
Never had to actually touch real Linux at all.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.200
That's crazy.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.840
It hurts so much.

06:24.840 --> 06:25.880
I don't know.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.480
I don't know.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.920
It's all about making Linux a bit of a runtime.

06:28.920 --> 06:29.920
I'm all for it.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.720
So while we're talking about Docker containers

06:31.720 --> 06:33.220
and universally running applications,

06:33.220 --> 06:36.040
just a quick update from our friends at Canonical

06:36.040 --> 06:37.480
that work on snaps.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.000
First of all, they have new distro-branded landing pages.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.480
So that way, if you're on Mint, or you're on Arch, or Fedora,

06:43.480 --> 06:44.740
whatever it might be, they'll now

06:44.740 --> 06:46.120
have specific instructions on how

06:46.120 --> 06:48.720
to get up and going with some copy pasta

06:48.720 --> 06:51.720
if you choose, which looks pretty nice, pretty simple.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.200
I thought it was a little strange to me

06:54.200 --> 06:57.200
the way they sort of branched it out per package, you know?

06:57.200 --> 06:57.700
Yeah.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.040
Because most of the time, there's

06:59.040 --> 07:00.000
not that much different, right?

07:00.000 --> 07:01.920
You kind of, once you've got everything bootstrapped.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.000
Now I get it when you want to land,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.680
like maybe you're trying to install your first snap,

07:04.680 --> 07:06.800
and so everything's there, right there on that page

07:06.800 --> 07:08.080
for the application that brought you there.

07:08.080 --> 07:08.560
True.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.920
But it just kind of felt weird.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.880
It's like, well, how do you install that?

07:10.880 --> 07:13.440
Like, don't I just use the snap command line wherever I am?

07:13.440 --> 07:13.940
Yeah.

07:13.940 --> 07:16.320
Yeah, once you've got that part done, yeah, you're right.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.280
We'll have to ask.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.760
Maybe there's somebody who might know.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.160
Maybe we'll have to ask him.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.080
Now, while we're talking about snaps,

07:22.080 --> 07:23.600
there's another part to the story

07:23.600 --> 07:26.320
that I think is a good heads up for those of you that

07:26.320 --> 07:28.200
are Ubuntu desktop users.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.880
In 1910 right now, in testing, they're

07:30.880 --> 07:34.660
calling for some feedback on shipping the Chromium browser

07:34.660 --> 07:35.420
as a snap.

07:35.420 --> 07:39.440
They're transitioning from a deb to a snap for the browser.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.320
And they're working on migrating your profile,

07:43.320 --> 07:45.100
the Chrome driver stuff, so that way

07:45.100 --> 07:46.480
they can have video acceleration.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.040
There's several elements to this that

07:48.040 --> 07:50.040
need to be banged on by end users,

07:50.040 --> 07:52.840
including just general desktop browser integration.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.640
Sounds great, though.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.240
I mean, I think it's a good fit.

07:55.240 --> 07:55.960
You think so?

07:55.960 --> 07:58.200
I mean, I already run, like when I run Firefox,

07:58.200 --> 08:01.320
I install it manually under my home directory.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.520
Browsers move fast.

08:02.520 --> 08:03.040
Yeah.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.600
Plus, sandboxing is not a bad idea.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.000
The browser is a dangerous environment.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.800
Chrome already has its own sandboxing.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.560
It does.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.280
But you're right.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.760
I do agree that the browser is a good candidate for software

08:11.760 --> 08:13.800
that you can update sort of independently

08:13.800 --> 08:15.080
from the operating system.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.780
And when you look at like an LTS,

08:16.780 --> 08:18.360
it makes even more sense potentially.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.240
And they don't have that many capabilities, right?

08:20.240 --> 08:22.920
Like they don't need to reach super far into your file system

08:22.920 --> 08:23.880
and go crazy places.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.840
So I think it would mesh well with the abilities

08:25.840 --> 08:28.360
that SnapD already has to give access when needed.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.520
Here's what we've got to do.

08:29.520 --> 08:29.920
You know what we've got to do?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.720
We've got to phone a friend, like millionaire style

08:32.720 --> 08:33.560
right now.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.640
We'll call up a friend who might know about Snap packages,

08:36.640 --> 08:38.640
and we'll ask Wes's question.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.120
So, Popey, are you there?

08:41.120 --> 08:41.960
Oh, hello.

08:41.960 --> 08:42.760
Hi.

08:42.760 --> 08:43.400
Go ahead, Wes.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.400
You have 20 seconds.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.240
What was the motivation between the structure

08:48.240 --> 08:51.480
of the distro-specific pages on the Snap,

08:51.480 --> 08:55.720
not one per OS at the top level, but for every package?

08:55.720 --> 08:56.240
Very good.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.200
You got it.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.280
Because the goal is that a normal person who's

09:02.280 --> 09:04.680
looking to install Spotify doesn't

09:04.680 --> 09:06.000
want to know lots of stuff.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.520
They want to know, how do I get Spotify on the distro

09:08.520 --> 09:09.360
that I'm on?

09:09.360 --> 09:12.360
And the focus for those pages is tell them

09:12.360 --> 09:14.280
exactly what they need to know to get

09:14.280 --> 09:16.840
that application on the distro that they've chosen,

09:16.840 --> 09:17.920
and nothing more.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.240
Maybe a little bit extra if they scroll down the bottom.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.440
But the distro-specific stuff is really

09:22.440 --> 09:24.720
catering to those people who like

09:24.720 --> 09:29.320
to follow blog posts that say, how to do this one thing?

09:29.320 --> 09:31.200
And it tells them how to do that one thing,

09:31.200 --> 09:32.200
and then they get out of there.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.360
That's all self-contained.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.120
So the first experience they land on, they got everything.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.320
That makes sense.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.080
Mr. Wimper, it's nice to see you here this evening.

09:39.080 --> 09:39.600
Hello, sir.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.120
Good evening.

09:40.120 --> 09:40.680
Hi, Wimpy.

09:40.680 --> 09:41.640
How are you?

09:41.640 --> 09:42.480
Very well.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.080
Surprisingly, still jet lagged.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.360
But other than that, fine.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.120
I'm not surprised.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.480
With as much traveling as you've done,

09:47.480 --> 09:48.800
it's got to catch up.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.400
Eventually, it's going to catch up to you, right?

09:50.400 --> 09:50.920
Yeah.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.760
This is the week it catches up, apparently.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.720
So the Atari VCS is going on sale for pre-order right now

09:57.720 --> 09:59.680
for $250.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.800
It's going to be a AMD Ryzen R1000 SoC design.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.000
And this is coming out of details at E3 this week.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.640
What do we think, Wimpy?

10:09.640 --> 10:12.160
Are you skeptical of this box?

10:12.160 --> 10:17.320
Or is it not a waste of my IndieGoGo money?

10:17.320 --> 10:18.600
I'm very skeptical.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.040
I'm sorry you've wasted your money.

10:20.040 --> 10:20.920
You think so?

10:20.920 --> 10:23.560
I'm kind of excited it's going to be a Ryzen box, because I'm

10:23.560 --> 10:24.680
such a fanboy these days.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.600
Yeah.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.760
Is this past due yet?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.960
Is it on time, or is it delayed?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.120
It is delayed, yes.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.120
It was delayed.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.440
They delayed it a little bit ago because they

10:34.440 --> 10:37.200
said they're going to move to the AMD A1 CPU and a Ryzen

10:37.200 --> 10:38.760
processor.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.880
And so that added delay to the process.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.520
But that seems like it might be worth it.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.520
Yeah, I don't know.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.440
It seems like a lot of money for what it is.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.280
Yeah, yeah.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.980
Well, $250 isn't bad for the base price.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.800
But to get something good that'll do 4K or something

10:50.800 --> 10:52.800
like that, you start getting close to $800.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.360
Plus, you get the look of the thing.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.280
Ooh, black walnut.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.040
Yeah, that's true.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.080
It's got that nice retro look.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.240
I do kind of like it.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.920
Well, I just wanted to give everybody

11:00.920 --> 11:02.980
an update that they are now taking pre-orders,

11:02.980 --> 11:05.020
and they're talking about it at E3.

11:05.020 --> 11:08.520
And they're saying, well, they're not really

11:08.520 --> 11:10.280
saying specifically when it's going to ship,

11:10.280 --> 11:12.340
but it looks like it will be this year.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.000
If they're taking pre-orders, does that

11:14.000 --> 11:18.520
mean they're fulfilling backers' pledges at the moment?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.240
That's a great question, Wimpy.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.240
That's a great question.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.400
Ponzi.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.440
Wow.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.160
Wow.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.600
Have they shown any footage of any of the games

11:27.600 --> 11:29.560
on the console yet?

11:29.560 --> 11:30.720
There may be some from E3.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.760
I haven't really gone spelunking.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.280
Poby, I'm curious.

11:34.280 --> 11:39.320
If you were going to bet on one, the Librem 5 or the Atari VCS,

11:39.320 --> 11:40.240
you had to pick one.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.240
Which one would you put your money on right now?

11:42.240 --> 11:42.760
Oh, man.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.280
Atari VCS.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.720
Why would you do that to me?

11:48.440 --> 11:51.320
Well, so the price point of the Atari VCS

11:51.320 --> 11:53.360
is not remotely attractive to me.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.640
I think I could probably go and dig

11:55.640 --> 11:58.440
in the deserts of California and find

11:58.440 --> 12:00.680
all the necessary Atari VCS cartridges

12:00.680 --> 12:04.080
I want to for less than $250.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.600
But I'd say the Atari VCS.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.160
All right.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.360
What about you, Wes?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.040
I got to agree.

12:10.040 --> 12:10.720
I mean.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.680
OK.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.960
All right, well, obviously I've put my money on the VCS.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.760
It just seems like an easier target to hit.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.280
Yeah.

12:16.280 --> 12:16.800
Yeah.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.480
Plus, you can load other OSes on there,

12:18.480 --> 12:20.200
including they even say Windows now.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.000
And if I could put Kodi on there,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.560
it's only a little bit more than I paid for the Nvidia Shield.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.480
So it's not great.

12:28.480 --> 12:29.480
We'll see.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.160
Do you still use your Nvidia Shield?

12:31.160 --> 12:31.880
The heck out of it.

12:31.880 --> 12:32.880
Yeah, I have two of them.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.840
Still use them every day.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.920
Oh, I have three of them.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.340
Have you hooked up Steam?

12:37.340 --> 12:40.480
I have done the GeForce streaming,

12:40.480 --> 12:43.680
but I have not done any Steam streaming.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.520
What's that like?

12:44.520 --> 12:49.400
So this weekend, because I've only ever played the Android

12:49.400 --> 12:52.040
games, because that's all my daughter's been interested in.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.080
But I was going to go back and relook at GeForce now.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.760
And then I noticed that a bunch of the games you see in there

12:58.760 --> 13:01.640
all have Steam written underneath.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.520
And the very first time you click on that,

13:03.520 --> 13:08.960
it stands up a Steam on Windows install on their grid

13:08.960 --> 13:10.560
computing platform.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.240
And you sign in with your Steam credentials,

13:13.240 --> 13:16.120
and it then installs the game that you've just selected.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.360
And you run that over the Shield.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.280
So that has become my new most favorite thing.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.080
That's incredible.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.040
And how would you say the performance and latency

13:25.040 --> 13:26.960
and responsiveness and all that is?

13:26.960 --> 13:28.560
Well, I'm fortunate in that I've got

13:28.560 --> 13:30.280
a reasonable amount of bandwidth.

13:30.280 --> 13:35.680
And I've always been impressed by the lack of apparent latency

13:35.680 --> 13:39.360
that exists on the Shield over that whole GeForce

13:39.360 --> 13:40.600
now streaming solution.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.920
So for me, it's great.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.640
I mean, the screen I have in the front room is very old.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.120
So it's a 720p screen.

13:51.120 --> 13:54.240
So it's not very high resolution.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.680
And for that resolution, it's fantastic.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.200
It's a lot of fun.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.000
I'll have to look into that.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.040
That sounds really neat.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.920
Are you streaming that over wired or wireless connection?

14:05.920 --> 14:06.560
Wired.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.880
So in the front room, that's got a direct line

14:09.880 --> 14:11.640
to the router, which is in the same room.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.480
And then that goes out over the fiber.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.440
Good setup.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.200
Yeah, I have the one in the studio living room wired too

14:18.200 --> 14:19.160
for that very reason.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.960
Who needs a stadium when you've already got that set up?

14:20.960 --> 14:21.800
No kidding.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.320
No kidding.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.040
I've pre-ordered Stadia as well though.

14:24.040 --> 14:24.880
Yeah, did you?

14:24.880 --> 14:25.920
Did you do the founders?

14:25.920 --> 14:26.420
Yep.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.040
Yeah.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.120
I did it as well because first, I

14:29.120 --> 14:31.600
want to be able to talk about it here on the show, number one.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.000
But number two is it could give me

14:34.000 --> 14:38.320
the ability to run a fully open source stack and have gaming.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.920
All Intel graphics, for example, but still have gaming.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.640
Yeah, absolutely.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.440
And if that makes my workstation more stable,

14:43.440 --> 14:45.160
I'd actually pay a monthly fee for that.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.000
Yeah, I've been impressed with what

14:48.000 --> 14:49.960
the Shield has been able to offer me.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.160
And I was interested to see, well,

14:53.160 --> 14:56.080
what can Google do in this space?

14:56.080 --> 14:58.200
I'm not buying into the platform necessarily,

14:58.200 --> 15:01.400
but the only way I'll know for sure is by finding out.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.560
And so I've pre-ordered, and I should

15:04.560 --> 15:06.800
be looking forward to trying it out later in the year.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.000
Yeah, if it sucks, I'll say it.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.400
So I don't have any reason to.

15:09.400 --> 15:09.900
Absolutely.

15:09.900 --> 15:10.840
I don't have any reason to.

15:10.840 --> 15:11.040
Nope.

15:11.040 --> 15:11.440
Yeah.

15:11.440 --> 15:12.520
No, I'm just going to try it out.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.020
And it does seem like if anybody would

15:14.020 --> 15:16.240
need the technological background

15:16.240 --> 15:18.640
and infrastructure to pull this off,

15:18.640 --> 15:20.200
it would probably be Google.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.720
They've got the scale.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.480
And they've got motivation too.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.080
So let's talk about something that I'd say

15:28.080 --> 15:31.080
was probably the number one submitted, quote, unquote,

15:31.080 --> 15:32.280
story to the show this week.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.360
People are like, hey, did you see this Chris Christie?

15:34.360 --> 15:35.560
And I appreciate that.

15:35.560 --> 15:38.320
I actually kind of like to know what people are tracking.

15:38.320 --> 15:42.880
And this was Linus Tech Tips' video on the System76 Thalia,

15:42.880 --> 15:45.520
which they titled, A Really Weird PC,

15:45.520 --> 15:48.640
The System76 Thalia Review.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.720
It is currently, as we record this episode,

15:50.720 --> 15:54.960
trending at number 44 on all of YouTube.

15:54.960 --> 15:58.200
It has over a million views.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.840
That's a big deal.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.080
That sort of makes Emma's weight in customs

16:03.080 --> 16:04.400
when she was hand delivering this.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.520
That was quite a journey for her.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.480
Yeah, she told that story on the show if you've missed it.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.840
She's been out.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.760
Rumor has it she got hurt.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.120
We'll have to talk to her about that when she comes back.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.880
We miss you Emma, we miss you.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.640
Now let's talk about their review.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.040
So Linus Tech Tips, we'll link to the entire video.

16:18.040 --> 16:18.980
It's an 11 minute video.

16:18.980 --> 16:21.040
We're just gonna play a couple of clips for you.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.600
And it starts with the unboxing as many YouTube videos do.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.960
So let's take a closer look at the box.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.660
Once you get it out of the shockingly nerdy packaging,

16:29.660 --> 16:31.920
the most striking features of the Thalia

16:31.920 --> 16:33.560
are its wood green finish

16:33.560 --> 16:36.300
and it's tantalizing silver power button

16:36.300 --> 16:38.320
and accompanying white LED ring.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.360
There's no sign of any front IO

16:40.360 --> 16:43.240
to disrupt the clean design language they've gone with,

16:43.240 --> 16:45.320
which means it's beautiful,

16:45.320 --> 16:47.900
but also means unfortunately that we're stuck

16:47.900 --> 16:49.680
with what we've got on the rear.

16:49.680 --> 16:52.720
And back here is interesting.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.120
So more of that clean at any cost approach.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.760
The IO is cut directly out of the chassis.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.780
That means no simple motherboard upgrade.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.520
Although again, it does make for an uninterrupted

17:05.520 --> 17:08.640
premium look that really screams Apple.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.000
Even though when we pop the hood with these thumb screws,

17:11.000 --> 17:12.600
we can see that this is clearly

17:12.600 --> 17:15.480
a standard PC motherboard on the inside.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.480
That power button is very legit.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.300
It's just great.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.800
Yeah, I want to push it right now.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.640
I have a fun story.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.680
So when we went and toured the factory,

17:22.680 --> 17:26.160
I didn't say anything and nobody prompted me.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.560
I just walked up and I started pushing the power button

17:28.560 --> 17:29.800
of the demo unit that was unplugged.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.760
So it was, you know, it wasn't hurting it.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.960
And I just had this, I made this very satisfying, like nice.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.560
And Carl, you know, the CEO, he was listening.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.720
He was perched, wanted to see my reaction

17:40.720 --> 17:43.040
because that power button is a particular point of pride

17:43.040 --> 17:43.880
for them.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.400
And so I liked that they honed in on that.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.560
They do mention that the back plate is fixed,

17:47.560 --> 17:48.960
although I think a motivated person

17:48.960 --> 17:52.520
probably cut it open, but that's, you know, overall,

17:52.520 --> 17:54.240
like it starts like kind of positive.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.520
You're like, wow, this is pretty balanced so far.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.000
As a non Linux user,

17:59.000 --> 18:02.080
I want to poke around Pop OS a little bit.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.880
Oh, now here we go to Pop OS.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.320
How are they going to do this?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.520
You first boot, it is super easy to encrypt your data.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.860
Just enter a password and reboot.

18:12.860 --> 18:14.440
That is pretty neat.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.640
Then when you come back,

18:15.640 --> 18:18.160
you're given the opportunity to set up your online accounts

18:18.160 --> 18:19.880
for integration into the OS,

18:19.880 --> 18:22.560
including access to your Google Drive cloud storage

18:22.560 --> 18:23.800
right in the file manager.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.960
Now we've actually seen Pop OS before

18:25.960 --> 18:28.240
in our gaming on Linux update video.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.280
And they continue,

18:29.280 --> 18:30.600
and then we're gonna talk a little more about Pop OS,

18:30.600 --> 18:31.680
but they continue.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.920
One of its major departures from its parent Ubuntu

18:34.920 --> 18:39.440
is Pop Shop, a ridiculously easy to use app store.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.280
So it's actually ported over from elementary OS,

18:42.280 --> 18:44.760
but with one key value add.

18:44.760 --> 18:48.260
System 76 curates their own packages.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.680
So if you ever need something basic,

18:50.680 --> 18:54.480
like Steam for gaming or the latest Nvidia drivers,

18:54.480 --> 18:56.040
it's just a click away.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.080
Actually, for your graphics drivers,

18:58.080 --> 19:00.840
it's easier than updating them on Windows.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.920
Now, a couple of things strike me about this video,

19:04.920 --> 19:07.200
because there's even more talking about Pop OS,

19:07.200 --> 19:10.920
is Pop OS isn't going anywhere.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.440
It's not going away.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.920
It's here now for the long haul.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.760
And I'm curious to hear what your reaction, Poby,

19:16.760 --> 19:19.680
that is to that comparison of the parent operating system,

19:19.680 --> 19:20.520
I believe as they put it, right?

19:20.520 --> 19:22.400
The parent project or something like that.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.740
What's your reaction?

19:23.740 --> 19:25.060
I don't know what to say.

19:25.060 --> 19:28.880
I mean, every derivative of Ubuntu,

19:28.880 --> 19:32.880
which Pop OS is, has something that stands themselves apart

19:32.880 --> 19:34.120
from Ubuntu.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.360
Otherwise, there will be no point installing it, right?

19:36.360 --> 19:41.240
And so their USP for Pop OS is the design language

19:41.240 --> 19:42.600
they've used on the desktop

19:42.600 --> 19:44.840
and simplicity of installing applications.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.120
And we can learn from that.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.920
And certainly you'll have noticed very recently,

19:48.920 --> 19:52.140
we've talked about how it will be integrating

19:52.140 --> 19:56.860
the Nvidia driver installer directly during the install.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.840
So we've certainly learned

19:58.840 --> 20:01.360
that that's a thing people really, really want,

20:01.360 --> 20:02.640
and we should probably do that.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.840
So, you know, we've learned something there.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.000
That's great.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.680
Wimby, when I heard that,

20:07.680 --> 20:09.780
when they were talking specifically about the Pop Shop,

20:09.780 --> 20:11.680
the thing that crossed my mind is,

20:11.680 --> 20:13.000
I wonder what their reaction would be

20:13.000 --> 20:14.280
to something like the software boutique

20:14.280 --> 20:16.160
that Ubuntu MATE has that comes up

20:16.160 --> 20:19.060
and has an extensive list of curated software.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.400
What are your thoughts when you hear that?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.880
It seems like you guys really hit on something

20:23.880 --> 20:27.120
pretty important to users a while ago now.

20:27.120 --> 20:30.200
Yeah, I'm really proud of what we did

20:30.200 --> 20:32.520
with the software boutique.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.640
I think we switched things up a little bit,

20:35.640 --> 20:40.140
but I'm not sure what someone like Linux Tech Tips

20:40.140 --> 20:41.840
would make of that,

20:41.840 --> 20:44.400
because they're kind of accustomed to it, right?

20:44.400 --> 20:48.660
If you go into any of the stores,

20:48.660 --> 20:52.400
you have a full catalog of software in front of you.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.160
You know, that's not been a problem.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.880
In recent years, you know, you've got the Windows Store,

20:55.880 --> 20:56.800
you've got the Mac OS Store,

20:56.800 --> 21:00.240
you've got the equivalents on mobile.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.360
It's novel to us on Linux

21:02.360 --> 21:05.200
because we didn't used to have that ease of installation,

21:05.200 --> 21:06.280
and we do now.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.640
So I don't know how much that would resonate really.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.740
Okay, fair enough actually, good point.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.960
I suppose it is sort of become just expected.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.560
You'd notice it more if it wasn't there.

21:17.560 --> 21:18.640
Yeah, maybe.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.080
I still really appreciate it.

21:20.080 --> 21:23.560
They did touch on the open nature of the hardware as well.

21:23.560 --> 21:26.560
The case and all of its accompanying bits and pieces,

21:26.560 --> 21:29.400
open source, just like the operating system.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.240
So there's literally a GitHub page

21:32.240 --> 21:35.000
with the CAD files for everything that you see here,

21:35.000 --> 21:36.720
and for its bigger brothers,

21:36.720 --> 21:39.300
the Thelio Major and Thelio Massive.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.560
But what impresses me overall about their entire coverage

21:41.560 --> 21:44.040
is, again, it's really well shot,

21:44.040 --> 21:44.960
it's really well written,

21:44.960 --> 21:46.560
you should watch the entire video,

21:46.560 --> 21:48.880
but they seem fairly balanced.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.160
They also point out, you know,

21:50.160 --> 21:51.700
the entire thing is an open source.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.560
Now, that's not to say that every component

21:53.560 --> 21:55.340
in the system is open source.

21:55.340 --> 21:58.980
The motherboard, CPU, RAM, video card, storage devices,

21:58.980 --> 22:02.180
and power supply are all proprietary in design

22:02.180 --> 22:04.600
with the IP owned by the individual companies

22:04.600 --> 22:05.440
that made them.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.680
As it is, I mean, that's just how it works.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.140
System76 will open a source as much as they can.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.920
And they touched on something

22:13.920 --> 22:17.480
that we've been trying to figure out internally,

22:17.480 --> 22:20.240
because Wes is co-host on Coda Radio,

22:20.240 --> 22:23.320
Michael Dominic picked up a Thelio station,

22:23.320 --> 22:26.400
and was unable to use it for podcasting

22:26.400 --> 22:27.240
because of fan noise.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.060
And it's something-

22:28.060 --> 22:28.900
We noticed it right away.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.220
He's been experimenting with,

22:30.220 --> 22:34.080
and they may have come onto something that Linus Tech Tips.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.320
What we can also see in here

22:35.320 --> 22:36.680
is they've done a pretty bang up job

22:36.680 --> 22:37.920
with the cable management,

22:37.920 --> 22:40.400
helped significantly by the generous real estate

22:40.400 --> 22:42.480
provided under the main fascia,

22:42.480 --> 22:44.940
which doesn't attempt to seal the computer

22:44.940 --> 22:47.340
so much as it conceals.

22:47.340 --> 22:49.400
There is a bit of concern from our end

22:49.400 --> 22:52.080
about dust accumulation through the side panels

22:52.080 --> 22:54.920
and the potential for noise to sneak out

22:54.920 --> 22:58.760
from under the chassis using the air gap as an echo chamber.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.640
Unfortunately, sure enough,

23:00.640 --> 23:02.220
it does get a little loud

23:02.220 --> 23:04.040
when the fans are running full tilt,

23:04.040 --> 23:07.280
and it's not just whooshing air noise,

23:07.280 --> 23:09.520
something that we generally don't complain about.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.400
Rather, it's a kind of droning whine

23:12.400 --> 23:15.160
that's a little bit harder to tune out.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.560
Honestly, I think a Noctua or a Be Quiet fan swap

23:18.560 --> 23:19.960
would help tremendously here.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.360
That's a particularly challenging problem, though,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.280
if that is just down to the case design,

23:24.280 --> 23:26.640
if it's kind of making sound channels on the side,

23:26.640 --> 23:27.880
because it's such a gorgeous case.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.200
It's gonna take them a while to iterate on that.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.560
So that could be why they've struggled

23:31.560 --> 23:33.880
to have a super great response to the fan noise issue,

23:33.880 --> 23:35.800
in my opinion, that's of course just my opinion.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.040
Yeah, it is so pretty, it'd be such a shame

23:37.040 --> 23:38.840
to have to go stick it in the closet somewhere

23:38.840 --> 23:40.280
and not get to admire it on your desk.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.020
Yeah, and so they also get to the price,

23:43.020 --> 23:46.120
because you could build yourself a cheaper system,

23:46.120 --> 23:48.640
or you could go buy a mass produced system that's cheaper,

23:48.640 --> 23:51.840
and I think they did a decent job on honing in

23:51.840 --> 23:54.400
on what kind of makes them special.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.040
While the operating system itself may be free,

23:57.040 --> 23:59.640
System76 does have paid staff

23:59.640 --> 24:01.840
that actively develop their OS,

24:01.840 --> 24:04.520
and that's to say nothing of the user support commitments

24:04.520 --> 24:06.120
that come along with that.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.640
Perhaps most crucially, though,

24:07.640 --> 24:10.920
the Thelio chassis manufacturer and final assembly

24:10.920 --> 24:14.640
are both done in Colorado by a team that's about our size,

24:14.640 --> 24:16.800
so no mass production.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.840
System76 says they want to improve

24:18.840 --> 24:20.460
the situation in the future,

24:20.460 --> 24:23.760
but for now, it means that the costs add up really quickly.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.000
The team that's about our size,

24:26.000 --> 24:27.800
which is kind of, that's poignant.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.600
And then last but not least, they wrap it up.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.480
You're paying for the case, US manufacturer,

24:32.480 --> 24:33.960
operating system development,

24:33.960 --> 24:36.920
and support from a small team of enthusiasts.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.400
Now, whether the design and concept

24:39.400 --> 24:41.240
of a well-integrated Linux desktop

24:41.240 --> 24:43.120
is enough to make you pay the extra,

24:43.120 --> 24:44.940
that's a choice I'll leave to you.

24:44.940 --> 24:47.700
But overall, we think it's really cool

24:47.700 --> 24:49.760
and a huge step in the right direction.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.760
It's pretty good coverage for System76,

24:52.760 --> 24:55.440
and it's good coverage for Pop!OS, too.

24:55.440 --> 24:59.600
So we have ourselves another major desktop container.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.440
I mean, they'll get there.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.860
They're not there yet, but they're gonna get there.

25:01.860 --> 25:03.100
It does make me feel a little bit better

25:03.100 --> 25:04.440
about Mike's situation,

25:04.440 --> 25:07.280
because he was having a heck of a time trying to fix it.

25:07.280 --> 25:08.480
It's nice to know, you know,

25:08.480 --> 25:10.080
it's unfortunately a common problem.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.200
Maybe run it with the case off.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.200
I don't know.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.240
But good for them.

25:14.240 --> 25:17.320
But weren't they also raving about Pop!OS

25:17.320 --> 25:19.320
in one of their videos just recently,

25:19.320 --> 25:21.520
where they were talking about gaming and stuff?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.800
Yeah, it's a lot of coverage for Pop!OS.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.760
And I appreciate it.

25:27.760 --> 25:31.700
I think I initially was very, very critical of Pop!OS.

25:33.600 --> 25:36.100
I still, I would love, what I would love,

25:36.100 --> 25:41.100
is if Pop!OS was just a series of scripts or repositories

25:41.100 --> 25:44.000
that you would add to a vanilla install of Ubuntu

25:44.000 --> 25:45.040
that would make it pop,

25:45.040 --> 25:47.600
and that would add a couple of things or whatever.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.440
I feel like we already have too many distros,

25:49.440 --> 25:51.080
but of course, you know what, I'm an old fart.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.260
So of course I feel like that,

25:52.260 --> 25:53.920
because I've seen, in my time,

25:53.920 --> 25:56.160
I've seen so many distros come and go.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.520
However, there is apparently

25:59.520 --> 26:02.000
a pretty, an interested market in this distribution,

26:02.000 --> 26:04.720
and I give them credit for cultivating that

26:04.720 --> 26:06.680
and for adding some value to the OS,

26:06.680 --> 26:08.700
like you hear people constantly talk about the install

26:08.700 --> 26:10.680
or the encryption, the pop store,

26:10.680 --> 26:13.240
the theme, these are all things that matter.

26:13.240 --> 26:16.720
And credit to System76 for nailing those things.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.800
And truth be told, they're just getting started, really.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.340
So I feel, even though I started

26:22.340 --> 26:23.520
fairly critical of the distribution,

26:23.520 --> 26:26.360
and I still don't really see myself running anytime soon,

26:26.360 --> 26:28.440
but I could, I could see myself in the future

26:28.440 --> 26:29.280
if I went back to GNOME.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.200
I'd probably give it a try.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.640
It is interesting to see them actually,

26:31.640 --> 26:33.240
I think there was some wonder

26:33.240 --> 26:34.880
about how far they were gonna take this.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.360
Was it gonna just be sort of glorified,

26:36.360 --> 26:39.440
a few scripts on top, a custom theme?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.420
But it seems like as they've had time

26:41.420 --> 26:44.560
to develop it more out, they're actively working on it.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.440
So it will be a long time project.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.640
We're gonna see more updates,

26:48.640 --> 26:50.320
and they're gonna continue to ship it.

26:50.320 --> 26:53.200
She was stuck all day, Emma, in customs,

26:53.200 --> 26:55.160
trying to get that machine to them.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.880
She hand delivered that machine,

26:58.760 --> 27:01.040
and then just had to walk away

27:01.040 --> 27:04.120
and hope that the review went well.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.320
And that was weeks ago, that was back during Linux Fest

27:08.320 --> 27:09.160
that she did that.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.040
She did that during Linux Fest and did that.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.840
And now here we are quite a while later,

27:13.840 --> 27:15.040
and that just got posted.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.940
That kind of shows you their time window there,

27:16.940 --> 27:19.960
but that's a lot of weeks of her sitting around wondering,

27:19.960 --> 27:20.880
was it worth it?

27:20.880 --> 27:24.280
Or did I just screw up?

27:24.280 --> 27:25.120
And I think it was.

27:25.120 --> 27:25.960
I think it was, yeah.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.400
It's number 44 on all of YouTube right now.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.880
That's a significant thing.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.480
A tiny little Linux shop.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.560
Yeah, I hope they get some sales out of it.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.400
Absolutely.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.640
All right, you know what we need to do?

27:35.640 --> 27:38.680
We gotta do that housekeeping.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.640
We gotta clean it up in here.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.800
Yeah, we gotta clean up a little bit.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.960
There's a few things to touch on this week.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.960
First of all, first of all, I should mention,

27:45.960 --> 27:47.500
we don't say this often enough,

27:47.500 --> 27:50.880
but Linux Academy is hiring for remote positions right now,

27:50.880 --> 27:53.360
including a Linux training architect,

27:53.360 --> 27:55.000
a machine learning training architect,

27:55.000 --> 27:57.160
a Python development training architect,

27:57.160 --> 27:58.920
but also an Angular developer,

27:58.920 --> 28:01.640
a full stack Node.js developer,

28:01.640 --> 28:03.520
and Ruby on Rails developers,

28:03.520 --> 28:05.680
multiple Ruby on Rails developers.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.140
Those are full-time remote positions,

28:07.140 --> 28:09.440
full benefits, everything.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.960
There's also a position open in the lab platform.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.040
There's a few things happening there

28:14.040 --> 28:15.580
that are pretty interesting.

28:15.580 --> 28:17.120
So if you haven't gone to linuxacademy.com

28:17.120 --> 28:18.320
slash careers in a while,

28:18.320 --> 28:19.480
I really suggest you do it

28:19.480 --> 28:22.200
because there is some great positions open right now.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.240
And I want to pass that along to you

28:23.240 --> 28:26.120
because if you're in our audience,

28:26.120 --> 28:28.080
you kind of have like a leg up in the process.

28:28.080 --> 28:31.240
If you tell them I heard about it on Linux Unplugged,

28:31.240 --> 28:32.920
that's gonna probably move you to the top of the stack.

28:32.920 --> 28:33.740
Oh!

28:33.740 --> 28:34.580
Yeah, that's a big deal

28:34.580 --> 28:36.840
because that means you're actually interested in this stuff.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.760
I want to also mention the Friday stream this week.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.440
We played Who Wants to be a Millionaire?

28:41.440 --> 28:43.800
It was Wes versus Ange.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.640
I don't want to give it away, but it was tense.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.840
She's a tough competition right there.

28:48.840 --> 28:49.680
Tough competition.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.240
Fridaystream.com slash seven.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.080
It's a really good one.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.280
That was a really fun one.

28:54.280 --> 28:57.900
And then last but not least here in the old housekeeping,

28:57.900 --> 29:02.360
we have a big batch of study group videos

29:02.360 --> 29:04.020
that just got posted.

29:04.020 --> 29:04.860
In the show notes,

29:04.860 --> 29:07.720
I have a link to the playlist on YouTube.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.020
This is Linux Permissions 101.

29:10.020 --> 29:14.480
I think it is seven videos, I think, or six videos.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.320
Yeah, we've got it down

29:15.320 --> 29:17.460
to just sort of bite-sized components you can handle.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.720
And it's really everything you've ever wanted to know

29:19.720 --> 29:20.640
about Linux Permissions.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.480
So nice.

29:21.480 --> 29:24.040
It starts at the very basics and then works its way up.

29:24.040 --> 29:26.700
And then by the end, you're doing really cool stuff

29:26.700 --> 29:30.760
with ACLs and with UMass and set UIDs.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.920
It's a good series of videos, six parts.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.200
Each is consumable.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.080
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.160
Just something we do to give back.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.360
We have a lot of great opportunities.

29:40.360 --> 29:42.460
We talk not only with training architects at Linux Academy,

29:42.460 --> 29:45.280
but Elle is a networking machine.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.400
And she goes out to events all the time.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.400
And she meets people who are great presenters

29:49.400 --> 29:51.200
who want to share their knowledge with our community,

29:51.200 --> 29:52.700
their listeners often.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.500
And so that's where a lot of this has come from,

29:54.500 --> 29:56.140
is people that Elle has met.

29:56.140 --> 29:57.080
She's our ambassador.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.860
Yeah, she goes down, connects with these people,

29:58.860 --> 30:01.800
and then brings them on to do a seminar or a webinar really.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.480
And then we release it for free.

30:03.480 --> 30:04.680
Because we're all about it.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.600
We're all about it.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.320
So check that out.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.680
We'll have a link, linuxunplug.com slash, what is this, 306?

30:09.680 --> 30:10.600
306.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.160
linuxunplug.com slash 306.

30:13.160 --> 30:18.360
All right, Mr. Payne, that abbreviated housekeeping

30:18.360 --> 30:20.200
this week.

30:20.200 --> 30:23.120
So we're going to talk about something you should never do.

30:23.120 --> 30:23.800
Don't do it.

30:23.800 --> 30:24.800
We just wanted to have something that

30:24.800 --> 30:25.840
was more familiar to us.

30:25.840 --> 30:27.280
We had a problem to solve.

30:27.280 --> 30:33.200
And truthfully, we felt a little inadequate with the BSD.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.840
And we had work to get done.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.520
So Wes and I headed out to the Jupyter broadcasting server

30:38.520 --> 30:39.080
room.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.960
We're out here in the studio server room, AKA the garage,

30:41.960 --> 30:44.120
to do something that you should never do.

30:44.120 --> 30:46.000
Don't do what we're about to do.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.920
We're going to take our perfectly functional, totally

30:49.920 --> 30:52.520
fine, FreeNAS server, and we're going

30:52.520 --> 30:55.520
to rip out the FreeNAS part and put Fedora 30 server in.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.160
Yeah, you heard that right, Fedora 30.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.280
Then we're going to try to import ZFS pools that Alan

31:01.280 --> 31:04.680
created under FreeNAS into Fedora

31:04.680 --> 31:07.680
after we get the ZFS support installed.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.920
I know this sounds ridiculous.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.480
Non-standard, maybe?

31:10.480 --> 31:13.120
There's a couple of motivating factors, if you will.

31:13.120 --> 31:17.160
Number one, this is a killer super micro server

31:17.160 --> 31:21.760
with two six-core Xeon processors and 64 gigs of RAM.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.920
And it's just sitting here doing nothing but FreeNAS.

31:23.920 --> 31:24.400
Right.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.800
Right now, it's just storage.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.800
And I mean, that's great and arguably probably

31:27.800 --> 31:29.680
the way you should do it.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.800
But why are we going to let this server go to waste?

31:31.800 --> 31:33.440
It's just if you're using that much power

31:33.440 --> 31:36.240
and you've got to make all this noise, let's put it to work.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.920
So there is one other consideration.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.920
We've also run into an issue where a couple of times

31:43.920 --> 31:45.960
we need to do some repairs.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.080
And Wes and I are just not FreeBSD guys.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.000
Surprise, surprise.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.280
We're Linux guys.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.640
And so we have a disk issue.

31:52.640 --> 31:56.040
We need to swap out a disk and get a new disk online.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.400
And quite frankly, we're just more comfortable

31:58.400 --> 31:59.760
with the Linux command line.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.720
And I think this is actually kind of an important thing.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.360
When you put something in production,

32:03.360 --> 32:06.440
you need to know how to use it, not maybe be so dependent

32:06.440 --> 32:09.320
on, say, Alan Jude.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.320
All right, we're rebooting.

32:10.320 --> 32:13.000
We've just maybe completed installation.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.960
Yeah, you're going to pop out the thumb drive.

32:14.960 --> 32:19.200
So we use the Fedora server image, which is pretty nice.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.240
Network install.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.120
Yeah, the net install server image.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.480
So it pulls down the packages from the repository

32:24.480 --> 32:26.080
and gives you some options.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.840
In fact, it might be the way I install Fedora from now on.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.480
I mean, honestly, what?

32:28.480 --> 32:30.920
That took all of 15 minutes once we got it set up and going?

32:30.920 --> 32:33.120
It was a tiny image, well, 600 megabytes.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.480
And then you could choose all of the desktops

32:35.480 --> 32:38.400
if you want, from Zubuntu to Cinnamon,

32:38.400 --> 32:39.680
or just the minimal installs.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.120
It gives you an option.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.560
And then it's off to the races.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.340
So we'll boot up.

32:43.340 --> 32:48.000
And then I think mission one is make sure our Fedora install

32:48.000 --> 32:50.520
is sane and then get ZFS support installed.

32:50.520 --> 32:53.080
And then we've got to go see about importing this pool.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.520
All right, well, it's our first boot.

32:55.520 --> 32:56.840
We'll be back in a moment.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.800
I don't know why, but I just haven't

32:58.800 --> 33:04.560
used a net install version of a distro ISO in, like, 10 years.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.760
I mean, it just feels like it's been forever.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.640
That's the only way I'm doing it from now on.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.400
Seriously, it was so great.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.900
First of all, way quicker to download.

33:11.900 --> 33:12.840
Oh, yeah, very nice.

33:12.840 --> 33:16.000
And Anaconda has this screen that you don't normally

33:16.000 --> 33:18.080
see when you get the live desktop version

33:18.080 --> 33:19.480
or when you get a specific spin.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.080
You don't see this screen that comes up.

33:21.080 --> 33:22.920
And the screen that comes up is the choice

33:22.920 --> 33:25.440
you can install any of the spins of the desktops

33:25.440 --> 33:27.640
right there from Anaconda.

33:27.640 --> 33:30.880
So you can use this as a base ISO for a Fedora server,

33:30.880 --> 33:32.120
for a Fedora desktop.

33:32.120 --> 33:33.360
Yeah, I think we were both pretty impressed.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.240
It was a surprisingly smooth installation.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.760
I was.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.520
I'm not normally an Anaconda fan.

33:38.520 --> 33:42.520
No, and I'm normally not impressed by Grub.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.040
I was impressed at Grub.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.920
So Grub just came up on the first boot.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.660
And one of the things I immediately noticed

33:47.660 --> 33:49.520
is we're already on kernel 5.1, which

33:49.520 --> 33:51.240
does confirm that the net install pulls down

33:51.240 --> 33:52.680
the latest packages.

33:52.680 --> 33:53.600
That's also nice.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.840
Fresh Linux.

33:55.840 --> 33:59.360
And one of the sort of interesting little side

33:59.360 --> 34:02.280
anecdotes about this setup is we're connected to.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.840
It's kind of a rickety setup.

34:03.840 --> 34:07.560
The keyboard is a old Mac mechanical keyboard

34:07.560 --> 34:09.640
because it's just the only one I had laying around

34:09.640 --> 34:10.160
that I'm not using.

34:10.160 --> 34:10.960
It's actually not that bad.

34:10.960 --> 34:11.400
No, it's not.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.880
Certainly better than modern Mac keyboards.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.840
It's just the control and alt and stuff

34:14.840 --> 34:16.280
is a little different.

34:16.280 --> 34:19.480
And then it's connected to the very first LCD screen

34:19.480 --> 34:22.160
I ever bought back in like 2000, 2001,

34:22.160 --> 34:23.760
which I've just held onto all this time.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.740
But there we are.

34:24.740 --> 34:25.440
And look at that.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.440
It does say web console.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.000
So this does.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.040
Cockpit is already up and running.

34:29.040 --> 34:29.920
All right, I'm going to give it a log in.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.240
You ready?

34:32.240 --> 34:34.040
All right.

34:34.040 --> 34:34.720
Yeah, there we go.

34:34.720 --> 34:35.360
We're in.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.680
All right, well, let's root around.

34:37.680 --> 34:39.360
Oh, look at all them disks.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.440
So it does see the disk.

34:40.440 --> 34:40.920
Yep, OK.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.000
Yeah, we're off to the races.

34:42.000 --> 34:42.240
Good.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.320
So now what we need to do is we need

34:43.320 --> 34:45.240
to get kernel development packages installed.

34:45.240 --> 34:48.760
And then we have to get the ZFS on Linux official GPG

34:48.760 --> 34:51.720
key installed and the repository installed.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.160
And then we can get this going.

34:53.160 --> 34:54.440
So why don't we take a few minutes?

34:54.440 --> 34:55.680
We'll do that, and then we'll come back.

34:55.680 --> 34:59.600
I wasn't sure, like, would it be in this weird, funky state

34:59.600 --> 35:01.120
because we had a bad disk.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.960
I was sort of like, OK, great.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.200
Yeah, we got Fedora installed.

35:05.200 --> 35:05.480
Great.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.620
Yeah, it can physically see the hard drives.

35:07.620 --> 35:08.120
Who cares?

35:08.120 --> 35:09.720
We've got to get ZFS working.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.200
Well, it turns out we'll have links in the show notes.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.640
That's pretty easy to do.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.280
The ZFS on Linux upstream project

35:16.280 --> 35:18.960
makes it all possible by putting a repo up,

35:18.960 --> 35:21.280
by putting keys up, and then by putting documentation up

35:21.280 --> 35:21.840
on how to do it.

35:21.840 --> 35:22.440
No time at all.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.920
Yeah, it was really, it was one of the fastest

35:24.920 --> 35:26.380
parts of the whole setup was actually

35:26.380 --> 35:27.760
getting ZFS working on Fedora.

35:27.760 --> 35:29.400
It was completely painless.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.360
But I wanted to know if we were going to actually

35:31.360 --> 35:34.200
be able to import that pool since it was created

35:34.200 --> 35:36.240
with an entirely different operating system using

35:36.240 --> 35:39.480
a entirely different fork, or at least much older fork,

35:39.480 --> 35:40.960
of ZFS.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.640
And of course, we had that degraded disk as well,

35:43.640 --> 35:44.840
or that dead disk.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.360
We had a degraded pool as well.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.920
We just got done installing all of the ZFS packages

35:48.920 --> 35:51.880
from the ZFS on Linux project.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.680
You've done the import command.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.280
How has it gone?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.220
What's happened?

35:56.220 --> 35:57.440
We've got our data.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.240
Now, there is one issue we're going

35:59.240 --> 36:01.200
to have to solve right off the bat, and that's

36:01.200 --> 36:03.760
setting the mount point because it's

36:03.760 --> 36:06.320
defaulting to just the name of the pool

36:06.320 --> 36:07.760
right under the root directory.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.880
Previously, it had been under mount.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.800
So we're going to have to tweak that a little bit

36:11.800 --> 36:13.300
as we set up the rest of the stuff,

36:13.300 --> 36:15.280
get things like NFS or SMB set up.

36:15.280 --> 36:18.040
But otherwise, I mean, it imported with no errors.

36:18.040 --> 36:18.600
That's pretty great.

36:18.600 --> 36:23.000
So we went from a up-to-date FreeNAS install

36:23.000 --> 36:26.800
and replaced that with Fedora 30 server, installed the ZFS

36:26.800 --> 36:29.480
modules, and we're just picking right up where we left off.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.120
One command in, and here we are.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.120
And I would imagine that, I don't know for sure,

36:33.120 --> 36:35.760
but I would figure that Fedora 30 could likely

36:35.760 --> 36:38.920
be using a newer version of ZFS since we just

36:38.920 --> 36:41.360
got the repository from the project directly.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.760
I bet you're right.

36:42.760 --> 36:43.640
And it's still fine.

36:43.640 --> 36:44.360
It still worked.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.040
Well, we'll solve that mount issue,

36:46.040 --> 36:48.640
and then it's just a matter of standing up all the services

36:48.640 --> 36:49.360
again.

36:49.360 --> 36:52.080
So there was, I guess, a polite way

36:52.080 --> 36:55.760
to say this is a unique heritage of this FreeNAS box.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.560
You have to appreciate some background

36:57.560 --> 36:59.280
before we continue here.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.040
Blessed soul Alan Jude was out for Linux Fest Northwest

37:02.040 --> 37:04.400
and, like a Canadian gentleman, went out there

37:04.400 --> 37:07.480
and completely set up this killer box.

37:07.480 --> 37:12.200
It's got two Intel Xeons that are six cores each that

37:12.200 --> 37:14.440
supports all of the virtualization stuff

37:14.440 --> 37:15.560
that you'd want.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.800
And then it's got, what, 13 disks in it maybe?

37:18.800 --> 37:19.600
Yeah, I think so.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.440
Something like that, a mix of different sizes,

37:22.440 --> 37:24.540
probably the smallest being six terabytes.

37:24.540 --> 37:28.080
And then it has 64 gigabytes of RAM, some contributed by Alan,

37:28.080 --> 37:30.480
some contributed by a TechSnap listener.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.280
And it's just this monster of a system

37:32.280 --> 37:33.920
we're not doing anything with.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.920
And I looked at this and I thought, gosh,

37:36.920 --> 37:39.120
if this was running Linux, I would be more comfortable

37:39.120 --> 37:42.040
with actually deploying containers on this thing

37:42.040 --> 37:44.920
and running other pieces of software on this.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.680
But when Alan set it up, he had set it up really

37:47.680 --> 37:49.880
to only ever be a back-end storage

37:49.880 --> 37:53.720
box with a fairly complicated ZFS layout.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.000
As you would imagine, he sub-volumed everything.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.080
And there's also kind of a funky, like, swap partition

38:01.080 --> 38:03.280
that went across all the disks for the FreeNAS itself.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.920
So there's, like, some weird space allocated to that.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.320
And then we had this mount issue.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.320
Yeah, I mean, we just had to get it configured.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.380
And FreeNAS had a sort of non-standard setup.

38:11.380 --> 38:13.680
And it had been a mix of Alan administering things

38:13.680 --> 38:16.480
on the FreeBSD command line and some of the FreeNAS defaults,

38:16.480 --> 38:18.120
especially because this had actually

38:18.120 --> 38:20.820
been a regular FreeNAS from IX Systems

38:20.820 --> 38:23.000
that we then ported over to this new box.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.520
So it was something of a hybrid monster.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.060
Yeah, it had gone from a FreeNAS mini

38:28.060 --> 38:31.920
into a super microchassis, which then Alan reconfigured it

38:31.920 --> 38:32.720
from there.

38:32.720 --> 38:36.640
And then we, from there, have converted it into a Fedora box.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.080
But in the process, we sort of redid some things

38:39.080 --> 38:42.480
to sort of align to how we kind of do things now,

38:42.480 --> 38:45.560
including how we sort of set up the way the disk is set up

38:45.560 --> 38:46.800
for the OS and whatnot.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.960
So we had to do some stuff, tweak some of the mount point

38:48.960 --> 38:50.480
settings and play with that.

38:50.480 --> 38:53.940
There was also one other gotcha that we ran into that took us

38:53.940 --> 38:55.720
a little bit to figure out.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.680
I'll tell you about that after this part, though.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.320
Fast forward a few more hours.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.800
We have a pretty happy Fedora server right now.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.200
And it's come down to the task of replacing that failed disk.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.480
This is actually what started the entire process.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.600
Yeah, this was the whole point.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.440
This is the reason we started mucking around

39:10.440 --> 39:12.000
with the FreeNAS system at all.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.400
I mean, formerly FreeNAS system, of course.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.080
Yeah, yeah.

39:15.080 --> 39:15.960
Now it's FakeNAS.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.720
That's what we're calling it.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.880
So what step are you about to take right now?

39:19.880 --> 39:22.960
All right, we've already removed and replaced physically

39:22.960 --> 39:25.600
the failed disk with our new replacement desk.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.200
And we've applied the same partitioning structure

39:28.200 --> 39:30.480
that was on the previous desk.

39:30.480 --> 39:33.240
Now we actually just need to replace it in the pool.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.360
Right now, it's configured in a mirror setup.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.040
So really, we're just going to put it in.

39:37.040 --> 39:40.720
And CFS gets to copy all the data from the one existing

39:40.720 --> 39:45.000
drive, and we will have two back in parity.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.600
All right, let's fire it off.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.840
This is the moment.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.840
Oh, I love watching all the disk light up.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.400
That's my favorite part.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.920
It's like a Christmas tree.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.600
It's done.

39:57.600 --> 40:01.160
Well, at least it's returned us the command line.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.680
Resilver in progress.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.200
Ah.

40:04.200 --> 40:04.880
Isn't that great?

40:04.880 --> 40:07.560
I just love the ZFS management commands.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.840
ZPool status just shows you always

40:09.840 --> 40:11.320
exactly what you want to know.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.520
Yeah, you can see the state is currently unavailable,

40:13.520 --> 40:15.000
but it's working.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.200
It tells you what it was.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.520
And then I guess we'll have to go in

40:17.520 --> 40:19.440
and we'll have to pull that one that's labeled as degraded

40:19.440 --> 40:20.760
once we have this finished.

40:20.760 --> 40:21.400
No, this will do it.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.280
So that's going to replace it, and then it

40:23.280 --> 40:25.840
should be healthfully online as soon

40:25.840 --> 40:27.280
as that replacement's finished.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.220
Well, let's toss to future us and see what happened.

40:30.220 --> 40:33.940
Of course, this bad disk was the reason we even started.

40:33.940 --> 40:35.280
So where is it at now?

40:35.280 --> 40:36.280
Is it still resilvering?

40:36.280 --> 40:37.120
It takes forever.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.040
Yes, it is.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.680
We're getting there 98% done, so it'll be done hopefully today.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.680
Yeah, that particular disk is a Western Digital Red,

40:44.680 --> 40:46.200
so it's not super fast.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.560
And it's 6 terabytes, so it's going

40:47.560 --> 40:49.320
to take a while to resilver.

40:49.320 --> 40:55.640
There was two curveballs we hit that I was not expecting.

40:55.640 --> 40:58.000
The first one is not too surprising, really,

40:58.000 --> 40:59.320
in retrospect.

40:59.320 --> 41:04.920
That is, we were installing to a USB device that sits on a USB

41:04.920 --> 41:06.000
header inside the case.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.360
This is something IX Systems does,

41:07.360 --> 41:10.080
your OS is on a solid state.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.160
I think it was, what, 16 gigabytes?

41:12.160 --> 41:14.400
No, that one was four.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.520
That was one of the difficulties of our initial replacement

41:17.520 --> 41:18.020
technique.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.360
I didn't realize we were, oh, jeez, yeah.

41:19.360 --> 41:21.400
So we tried to get Fedora Server, which we actually

41:21.400 --> 41:21.600
still got.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.640
Totally worked just fine.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.880
We got it within the four gigs on this little solid state USB

41:25.880 --> 41:26.680
device.

41:26.680 --> 41:30.800
The problem was, A, we were really low on space

41:30.800 --> 41:32.580
after we started installing a few packages,

41:32.580 --> 41:38.520
and B, it got like two megs a second write performance.

41:38.520 --> 41:39.240
Ouch.

41:39.240 --> 41:40.380
It was really bad.

41:40.380 --> 41:43.760
So checking the key signatures on packages

41:43.760 --> 41:46.000
would just take forever.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.280
So we started just digging around the studio.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.500
Because we have some equipment around here,

41:49.500 --> 41:52.040
we thought, we must have an SSD somewhere.

41:52.040 --> 41:53.520
So we dig around here and actually

41:53.520 --> 41:55.760
could not find a spare SSD anywhere in the studio.

41:55.760 --> 41:56.880
I guess that's good.

41:56.880 --> 41:57.880
Means we're not wasting it.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.640
Yeah, we don't have utilization here.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.680
But I remembered we had an old Hackintosh

42:01.680 --> 42:04.080
that towards the very end of its production line,

42:04.080 --> 42:08.680
we put a 10,000 RPM, 320 gigabyte drive in it.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.880
And then it only ran for like a couple of months,

42:10.880 --> 42:12.520
and then we shut the system down.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.520
And we converted off of it.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.240
So I went in, I tore that machine open,

42:16.240 --> 42:19.080
grabbed that disk out of the old Hackintosh,

42:19.080 --> 42:22.160
and we kind of MacGyvered it into the FreeNAS box.

42:22.160 --> 42:27.000
And so now we gave Fedora a 320 gigabyte, 10,000 RPM spinning

42:27.000 --> 42:28.120
disk to work with.

42:28.120 --> 42:31.120
But the system's really set up, and the data's

42:31.120 --> 42:33.160
all across the RAID or the array.

42:33.160 --> 42:36.200
So if the OS drive were to pop at some point in the future,

42:36.200 --> 42:39.000
we'd have to reload it, but we wouldn't lose any data.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.520
So we had that problem, took a little bit of MacGyvering

42:41.520 --> 42:44.100
to solve that, because we needed some Molex power adapters

42:44.100 --> 42:45.040
to convert to SATA.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.800
And that wasn't so bad.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.120
The one that really threw me for a twist

42:49.120 --> 42:51.400
was we ran into essentially this issue.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.720
And this is, again, I don't fully understand it.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.440
So if you do, please feel free to write in

42:56.440 --> 42:59.080
at linuxunplug.com slash contact and correct me.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.840
But I couldn't use traditional NFS

43:01.840 --> 43:05.480
to share out the ZFS volumes.

43:05.480 --> 43:08.520
It would essentially stop at a mount point.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.400
If you had sub-volumes that were mounted,

43:10.400 --> 43:12.600
it would essentially stop at that mount point.

43:12.600 --> 43:14.840
And it took us a little while to kind of root around.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.360
And it even turns out that ZFS itself

43:17.360 --> 43:20.240
has some NFS provisions built in.

43:20.240 --> 43:23.360
And I was completely lost when it came to this aspect.

43:23.360 --> 43:25.600
Yeah, so we ended up using the ZFS stuff.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.960
You can just sort of set a property on your data set,

43:28.960 --> 43:31.120
and then you may have to remount it.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.600
I'm not clear on that exact particular.

43:33.600 --> 43:36.760
But after that's done, it just shows up as an export list,

43:36.760 --> 43:37.560
and you can mount it.

43:37.560 --> 43:39.840
So we've got not everything's restored yet.

43:39.840 --> 43:41.960
But I mean, we just need a few more commands,

43:41.960 --> 43:43.240
and we'll have all your shares back.

43:43.240 --> 43:43.840
Yeah, yeah.

43:43.840 --> 43:48.040
So that was kind of funny, because the way it works

43:48.040 --> 43:51.720
is I would mount the NFS share, and the directory structure

43:51.720 --> 43:52.520
would be there.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.240
But then I would get to the bottom level

43:54.240 --> 43:56.340
where it was actually going into a sub-volume,

43:56.340 --> 43:57.680
and it would just be empty, which

43:57.680 --> 44:00.200
is where all the shows would be, or all the pictures would be.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.280
So I'd have the directory structure,

44:01.280 --> 44:02.080
but none of the data.

44:02.080 --> 44:02.880
It's like, what happened?

44:02.880 --> 44:03.600
Such a tease.

44:03.600 --> 44:04.800
Did we lose it?

44:04.800 --> 44:06.080
But we got it going.

44:06.080 --> 44:08.400
We got it going, and it seems to be working pretty well.

44:08.400 --> 44:12.640
And now, what we're going to do with this rig

44:12.640 --> 44:15.520
is just have it run some local services.

44:15.520 --> 44:19.080
We're in the process of finally replacing Dropbox,

44:19.080 --> 44:22.640
and we're going to run some virtual machines on this.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.880
And all of the main applications will run inside a container.

44:25.880 --> 44:30.360
So the host operating system will be fairly unhinged

44:30.360 --> 44:31.880
from future upgrades and stuff.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.920
It'll be unimpeded, or whatever I'm trying to say.

44:33.920 --> 44:34.560
What am I trying to say?

44:34.560 --> 44:35.760
We just wanted to worry about it.

44:35.760 --> 44:36.160
Yeah, we're not.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.720
Most of our stuff will be running in containers.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.120
This is not a bunch of apps and packages

44:39.120 --> 44:39.640
we're going to have to worry about.

44:39.640 --> 44:40.440
It's going to be a pretty clean base.

44:40.440 --> 44:41.480
It's not that much data.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.000
Yeah.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.240
Not impaired.

44:43.240 --> 44:44.960
Yeah, not impaired, whatever.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.600
Not entangled, I don't know.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.600
Not in long-term software commitments.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.040
And then we're also going to set up WireGuard on that sucker,

44:53.040 --> 44:56.000
so the host can get remote WireGuard services in

44:56.000 --> 44:58.680
if they want to remotely control the mixer, things like that.

44:58.680 --> 45:00.320
So that'll be on there.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.120
It's already pretty nice.

45:02.120 --> 45:04.040
Just got NetData installed before the show,

45:04.040 --> 45:06.200
so I can watch as all the data is shuffling around

45:06.200 --> 45:08.440
as it's resilvering, which is great.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.800
It's pretty nice to have.

45:10.800 --> 45:15.440
It feels like what I was, I'm such a nerd.

45:15.440 --> 45:19.080
God, I was laying in bed talking to Hadea about the server.

45:19.080 --> 45:20.240
I can't even believe I just.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.400
Something tells me she's used to this.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.800
And I was like, babe, you know, it's like I went out there

45:23.800 --> 45:25.760
and found out we had a sports car in the garage.

45:25.760 --> 45:28.360
And I thought it was like this little four-cylinder commuter.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.640
Because we kind of forgot about the only, like, I mean,

45:30.640 --> 45:32.400
I think you logged in for some reason

45:32.400 --> 45:34.520
and happened to see the little blinking red light

45:34.520 --> 45:36.040
on the Freenaz console, right?

45:36.040 --> 45:37.200
Telling us like there might have been.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.520
Otherwise, we just didn't think about it.

45:38.520 --> 45:39.400
Sat there and ran.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.640
It did its purpose really well.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.920
I am kind of a believer in overbuilding your storage,

45:43.920 --> 45:45.120
so that's what I did there.

45:45.120 --> 45:48.120
But looking back at it, 64 gigs of RAM,

45:48.120 --> 45:50.680
two six-core Xeon processors.

45:50.680 --> 45:53.080
The thing's just begging to do more.

45:53.080 --> 45:56.920
And not that I couldn't do it with FreeBSD or Freenaz.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.000
Absolutely, we could have.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.560
But I know how to do it with Linux.

45:59.560 --> 46:00.600
It's just faster.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.120
And we don't, I mean, we're not touching the system every day.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.960
So it's nice to have something that's easy

46:04.960 --> 46:07.640
and we don't have to relook up a bunch of man pages every time.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.160
Yeah.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.800
So we'll probably, well, eventually, I

46:09.800 --> 46:12.920
imagine we'll spin up whatever our sync solution is

46:12.920 --> 46:13.760
in a container.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.960
We'll spin up a couple of other items

46:15.960 --> 46:18.280
that I use internally for like processing news

46:18.280 --> 46:19.640
and whatnot in containers.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.360
And I'll move some of the things that I

46:21.360 --> 46:24.200
have on the workstations in the studio now onto that server.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.920
So that's what sort of the, and I'll just

46:25.920 --> 46:27.960
do that gradually over time, probably

46:27.960 --> 46:29.380
with some of the more urgent stuff.

46:29.380 --> 46:31.320
And then I'll, like the syncing thing.

46:31.320 --> 46:32.920
Because this new Dropbox has got to go.

46:32.920 --> 46:34.400
This is just the final straw.

46:34.400 --> 46:37.540
Dropbox has just crossed the line with this Electron stuff.

46:37.540 --> 46:42.840
I will say it really did cement just why CFS is a great choice.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.160
We could just port operating systems

46:45.160 --> 46:47.800
and hardly had to think about it.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.760
It's not that many other ways that we could have done this

46:49.760 --> 46:51.320
and get all the other benefits.

46:51.320 --> 46:54.520
It's a pretty dramatic switch.

46:54.520 --> 46:59.160
We went from FreeBSD base with an old version of ZFS

46:59.160 --> 47:02.560
to Fedora 30 with the absolute most recent version

47:02.560 --> 47:04.920
on the most absolute recent Linux kernel.

47:04.920 --> 47:07.320
Some would call us crazy.

47:07.320 --> 47:09.880
Yeah, I've just really been enjoying Fedora 30.

47:09.880 --> 47:10.840
You know, it's.

47:10.840 --> 47:13.640
I would say, I mean, it honestly did feel vindicated.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.920
It's hard to explain, but I feel like the whole process

47:15.920 --> 47:19.400
was surprisingly pleasant because we run into several other issues.

47:19.400 --> 47:22.800
All the stuff relating to Fedora and Fedora 30 server was great.

47:22.800 --> 47:23.800
And that cockpit was up.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.320
We've already done a bunch through that,

47:25.320 --> 47:28.000
which was lovely as we were still trying to get everything set up

47:28.000 --> 47:29.880
and only had console access.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.200
It's just been a dream.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.480
Really, I couldn't really ask for any more.

47:33.480 --> 47:36.560
And it's funny because I've been running Fedora on the base

47:36.560 --> 47:39.280
and then like Ubuntu in the containers and in the VMs.

47:39.280 --> 47:40.720
That's just been my setup recently.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.640
It's just been working really well for me.

47:42.640 --> 47:44.600
And other people, different setups work.

47:44.600 --> 47:46.640
But it reminded me of, I think it was right

47:46.640 --> 47:49.040
when I first started listening to Jupiter broadcasting.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.560
And it was before I'd ever used Fedora on the desktop.

47:51.560 --> 47:56.280
I had, I think it was a Fedora 14, 15 on the server.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.800
And it was one of my first and favorite Linux servers.

47:58.800 --> 47:59.960
So it's nice to come home.

47:59.960 --> 48:00.640
Yeah.

48:00.640 --> 48:01.960
All right, Neil, I'm curious what you think.

48:01.960 --> 48:05.320
I know you work a lot in the Red Hat space with ZFS.

48:05.320 --> 48:06.480
Are we crazy?

48:06.480 --> 48:09.080
Well, first of all, I thought that was really cool what you just said.

48:09.080 --> 48:11.600
You were slightly crazy, but it was the good kind of crazy.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.040
So I was OK with it.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.880
I told Wes, I said, Wes, you know, I think we're officially

48:15.880 --> 48:19.200
top gearing this thing right now.

48:19.200 --> 48:21.880
I don't know, that other one was a pretty top gear event, too.

48:21.880 --> 48:26.280
But with ZFS on Linux specifically, I think,

48:26.280 --> 48:29.640
I'm not completely certain on this, that the kernel can't

48:29.640 --> 48:30.680
see all the subvolumes.

48:30.680 --> 48:33.560
So when it tries to evaluate all the things

48:33.560 --> 48:37.440
that it exports through NFS, they won't work properly.

48:37.440 --> 48:41.760
So that's why you need to use the ZFS built-in.

48:41.760 --> 48:45.880
NFS share NFS feature on Linux.

48:45.880 --> 48:48.360
In FreeBSD and other places, I think

48:48.360 --> 48:52.000
it's all more tightly integrated so they can just do it normally.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.720
And that makes sense, because when we switched over to that,

48:53.720 --> 48:54.560
it did start working.

48:54.560 --> 48:55.480
It just worked, yeah.

48:55.480 --> 49:00.120
So now, it's not like ZFS has like their own implementation of NFS.

49:00.120 --> 49:03.120
They're working with the kernel, right?

49:03.120 --> 49:05.360
I can't answer that question confidently,

49:05.360 --> 49:07.520
because it's been a long time since I've looked at that code.

49:07.520 --> 49:08.560
That's just crazy to me.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.400
That ZFS is huge.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.400
That's massive.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.800
And the fact that ZFS works the same way everywhere

49:13.800 --> 49:17.320
is more of a testament to how much of an outsider file system

49:17.320 --> 49:19.440
it is in most operating systems.

49:19.440 --> 49:22.560
So it's developed very independently.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.080
Right.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.480
It comes with a bunch of extra stuff

49:24.480 --> 49:27.180
so that it doesn't have to rely on what may or may not be there.

49:27.180 --> 49:27.680
Right.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.840
So a lot of these kinds of things have also

49:30.840 --> 49:32.720
been relevant in macOS, for example,

49:32.720 --> 49:36.640
because you can't really poke all the things the same way

49:36.640 --> 49:38.680
that you can in FreeBSD and whatnot.

49:38.680 --> 49:40.000
Yeah, it gave me a confidence.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.480
It made me feel like, well, in the future,

49:41.480 --> 49:44.480
if Fedora doesn't work out and we want to go to Ubuntu LTS,

49:44.480 --> 49:46.480
I'm not going to have any problem getting my data.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.880
It's just going to connect and import just fine.

49:48.880 --> 49:51.800
It gave me a good sense of my data is safe.

49:51.800 --> 49:52.360
Yeah.

49:52.360 --> 49:56.320
And in respect to ZOL and all of these things,

49:56.320 --> 49:59.400
Fedora and, of course, CentOS and RHEL

49:59.400 --> 50:04.120
are first class test targets for ZFS on Linux.

50:04.120 --> 50:09.080
So if it doesn't work in Fedora, it is pretty much a blocker,

50:09.080 --> 50:10.240
because that is a problem.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.920
Yeah, it was dead easy to set up, too.

50:11.920 --> 50:13.200
It really couldn't have been easier.

50:13.200 --> 50:16.520
Yeah, so making sure it works in CentOS and RHEL,

50:16.520 --> 50:19.600
because, of course, enterprise people who want to use ZFS,

50:19.600 --> 50:20.240
that matters.

50:20.240 --> 50:23.200
But also using it in Fedora, that matters quite a fair bit,

50:23.200 --> 50:25.280
especially since Fedora is very close to upstream

50:25.280 --> 50:27.160
and the upstream kernels and stuff like that.

50:27.160 --> 50:29.680
So it's a very big important point for that.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.920
And to be clear, we went with Extended 4

50:31.920 --> 50:33.520
on the root partition for the OS.

50:33.520 --> 50:36.240
So the Fedora install is running on Extended 4,

50:36.240 --> 50:40.080
and it is using a DKMS module to get ZFS working.

50:40.080 --> 50:42.160
Yeah, well, I would have called you actually insane

50:42.160 --> 50:44.200
if you had put ZFS on a root file system.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.360
Yeah, we had some limit, some limit.

50:46.360 --> 50:47.840
Don't think we didn't think about it.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.160
I mean, it was a listed option.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.320
We just didn't choose it.

50:50.320 --> 50:51.200
Don't do it.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.320
Don't do it.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.280
I'm just going to say this right now.

50:54.280 --> 50:56.200
I have done it enough times.

50:56.200 --> 50:56.880
Don't do it.

50:56.880 --> 50:59.200
Unless you are running on CentOS where

50:59.200 --> 51:02.520
you can use a precompiled kernel module that

51:02.520 --> 51:06.040
works against the kernel API, it gets really unsafe very

51:06.040 --> 51:06.760
easily.

51:06.760 --> 51:07.280
Yeah.

51:07.280 --> 51:10.560
Well, I'm just thrilled myself because I just

51:10.560 --> 51:12.800
feel like I got a new tool to get work done.

51:12.800 --> 51:14.640
Not that it wasn't always there, and I couldn't have done it,

51:14.640 --> 51:16.080
but now I'm actually going to use it.

51:16.080 --> 51:16.440
Yes, right.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.040
And we were running some stuff on a personal workstation

51:19.040 --> 51:20.240
of yours or other random machines,

51:20.240 --> 51:21.960
so it's nice to have a proper place for it.

51:21.960 --> 51:22.800
Yes, exactly.

51:22.800 --> 51:25.080
So let me know if you think I'm crazy,

51:25.080 --> 51:26.720
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.160
But before we get out of here, I want

51:28.160 --> 51:30.040
to do just a couple of picks.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.840
Right off the top, I got a couple command line

51:32.840 --> 51:34.240
applications I love this week.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.280
Speaking of command line love, speaking

51:36.280 --> 51:38.840
of command line love, you should check out the Ubuntu podcast.

51:38.840 --> 51:39.320
Do it.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.640
And send them your ideas for command line applications.

51:41.640 --> 51:44.600
Add Ubuntu podcast on the Twitters.

51:44.600 --> 51:45.640
Here's a couple, guys.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.280
You know what?

51:46.280 --> 51:48.160
You are welcome to share these.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.520
I share these with the Ubuntu podcast if you want them.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.000
Because these are so good, everybody's

51:52.000 --> 51:53.360
going to want these ones.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.560
RGA is our first one.

51:55.560 --> 52:01.080
It's like grep, but for PDFs, e-books, office documents,

52:01.080 --> 52:04.000
zip files, tar.gz, et cetera.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.320
You can grep even docx files, SQLite files, MKV files,

52:09.320 --> 52:11.080
MP4 files.

52:11.080 --> 52:12.480
Oh, yeah, all the things.

52:12.480 --> 52:15.680
It's rip grep for everything or anything, something like that.

52:15.680 --> 52:18.080
It's based off rip grep, which if you haven't used,

52:18.080 --> 52:18.880
you really should.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.280
Ah, OK, rip grep for everything.

52:20.280 --> 52:22.720
Yeah, it's like a Rust implemented alternative grep

52:22.720 --> 52:24.120
that's just super fast.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.120
They've wrapped this here.

52:25.120 --> 52:26.120
Wait, wait, wait, did you say rust?

52:26.120 --> 52:27.520
Oh, yeah, of course, of course it is.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.040
Of course.

52:28.040 --> 52:30.920
Actually, I mean, the burnt sushi, the author

52:30.920 --> 52:33.600
is a fascinating human with some really interesting stuff,

52:33.600 --> 52:35.680
particularly about the implementation of how

52:35.680 --> 52:38.800
the search engine algorithms work in something like grep.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.480
So if you want to learn more, it's

52:40.480 --> 52:43.080
not only a great implementation, it's a good learning

52:43.080 --> 52:44.200
opportunity as well.

52:44.200 --> 52:48.080
So this wraps that and lets it search in stuff like PDFs,

52:48.080 --> 52:50.680
SQLite, all the things that you've been missing.

52:50.680 --> 52:52.880
That could be really nice, to tell you the truth.

52:52.880 --> 52:56.320
All right, so maybe searching things isn't your thing.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.480
And since they're Rust, they're just each a little binary

52:58.480 --> 53:00.200
you have to download, so no worries

53:00.200 --> 53:01.920
about a complicated text.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.600
Is there a way we could put that in a snap?

53:04.600 --> 53:07.040
Yep.

53:07.040 --> 53:07.720
All right.

53:07.720 --> 53:10.400
Now, I love the fish shell, talk about it all the time.

53:10.400 --> 53:12.360
I always encourage people to check it out.

53:12.360 --> 53:13.800
The thing I love about the fish shell

53:13.800 --> 53:17.240
is it does autocompletion for frequent commands.

53:17.240 --> 53:18.960
But it's not perfect, because sometimes you

53:18.960 --> 53:20.720
have different variations on commands,

53:20.720 --> 53:22.120
or sometimes you have just commands

53:22.120 --> 53:24.160
you only use very infrequently.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.840
Wouldn't it be nice if you could bookmark commands

53:26.840 --> 53:28.320
like you do URLs?

53:28.320 --> 53:31.720
Well, friends, that's where Marker comes in.

53:31.720 --> 53:35.360
It is a nice little application for your terminal

53:35.360 --> 53:39.320
that lets you bookmark commands or entire command templates.

53:39.320 --> 53:40.960
And here's the best part.

53:40.960 --> 53:46.040
It lets you easily retrieve them with a real-time fuzzy language

53:46.040 --> 53:46.520
matcher.

53:46.520 --> 53:48.120
So you kind of just get in the ballpark

53:48.120 --> 53:49.440
of what you're looking for.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.640
It has a nice UI on the command line, again.

53:52.640 --> 53:56.000
But it gives you a UI to select easily which command you wanted,

53:56.000 --> 53:57.520
and then it'll execute it for you.

53:57.520 --> 53:59.200
I could see this being really nice, too.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.280
Maybe you have a team of sys admins,

54:01.280 --> 54:03.960
and you have a shared toolkit for working with applications.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.480
Oh, totally.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.880
That's a great.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.120
That would be a great use.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.320
This is something I'm going to have to play with.

54:09.320 --> 54:11.620
Yeah, you just need Python, like a semi-recent version

54:11.620 --> 54:14.600
of Python, and Bash or Zshell.

54:14.600 --> 54:17.520
And it'll work on Linux or Mac OS.

54:17.520 --> 54:18.280
So there you go.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.000
It's called Marker.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.160
We'll have a link in the show notes for that, too,

54:21.160 --> 54:24.840
which I feel like that'd be pretty handy for somebody

54:24.840 --> 54:26.920
like me to have something like that on the server

54:26.920 --> 54:27.640
that we just set up.

54:27.640 --> 54:28.360
That's actually what I was saying.

54:28.360 --> 54:30.360
I was like, oh, man, I could make you some defaults

54:30.360 --> 54:32.320
for maybe a complicated little command or Python.

54:32.320 --> 54:33.960
Something I do like once every six months.

54:33.960 --> 54:34.480
Yeah, exactly.

54:34.480 --> 54:37.320
You know, when the server has to have something done to it

54:37.320 --> 54:38.400
or whatnot.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.080
So anyways, check those out.

54:40.080 --> 54:41.560
When we say the show notes, of course,

54:41.560 --> 54:44.720
we mean in your podcast player or over at linuxunplug.com

54:44.720 --> 54:46.240
slash 306.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.160
Each episode is just slash right there.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.600
Easy to find, easy to get to.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.460
Mr. Payne, is there anything else

54:52.460 --> 54:54.000
we need to mention before we get out of here?

54:54.000 --> 54:54.920
No, I don't think so.

54:54.920 --> 54:55.400
All right.

54:55.400 --> 54:55.880
OK.

54:55.880 --> 54:56.520
Easy peasy.

54:56.520 --> 54:56.760
All right.

54:56.760 --> 54:59.160
Cheesy, is there anything we need to cover before we leave?

54:59.160 --> 55:00.280
You got anything for us?

55:00.280 --> 55:01.840
Check out the new Telegram sticker pack.

55:01.840 --> 55:02.360
Yeah.

55:02.360 --> 55:03.520
Oh, it's so good.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.000
Yep.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.960
Or if you're not in the Telegram group, why not?

55:05.960 --> 55:07.920
You go to broadcasting.com slash telegram.

55:07.920 --> 55:08.280
That's right.

55:08.280 --> 55:08.960
You should be.

55:08.960 --> 55:09.520
You should be.

55:09.520 --> 55:09.720
All right.

55:09.720 --> 55:10.560
Very good.

55:10.560 --> 55:11.680
Thank you, Mr. Bacon.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.720
Now, I also want to thank all of you for listening.

55:13.720 --> 55:15.520

55:16.520 --> 55:17.800
No offense, Jase, but they are.

55:17.800 --> 55:18.480
They are.

55:18.480 --> 55:19.760
All of you.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.840
This show has done so well over the years.

55:21.840 --> 55:24.360
We really just are so thankful for every single one of you

55:24.360 --> 55:24.960

56:22.920 --> 56:28.000
the best audience it's incredible it really is and that's what's been so like

56:28.000 --> 56:31.400
this has been the season of events where we've been traveling a lot in fact we're

56:31.400 --> 56:36.540
about to travel again and just really the best freaking audience ever like

56:36.540 --> 56:40.800
friends for life a number of incredible people at me and just continue to me

56:40.800 --> 56:44.200
yeah it is wild it's great it's the best part of the job so thank you everybody

56:44.200 --> 56:47.680
JBtoddles, JBtoddles, thank you to that Mumble Room for making it too really good to

56:47.680 --> 56:50.920
have all you guys here jeez what are you talking about what's the matter no I'm

56:50.920 --> 56:53.520
just saying I'm just saying after we get off the show I think I might hang

56:53.520 --> 56:59.960
around on the jump on the old mums oh yeah oh yeah oh I got you so I got you

56:59.960 --> 57:07.600
doing posts a little post hang up look plug mmm I like it yeah right you're

57:07.600 --> 57:11.200
already suited up you got your microphone on yeah oh yeah you know it

57:11.200 --> 57:18.360
all right JBtoddles.com let's go grab our title otherwise we'll all take your

57:18.360 --> 57:23.400
voting rights away mmm so poppy how's the old feedback been on the distro

57:23.400 --> 57:29.800
specific snap pages yeah other than getting for incorrectly using the

57:29.800 --> 57:35.680
fedora go oh oh I noticed I was trying not to be mean about it or anything I

57:35.680 --> 57:39.760
just said hey can you fix it please you know what I think it's a good idea I

57:39.760 --> 57:43.840
like it I like it too you know but jeez you know you can't please the entire

57:43.840 --> 57:47.680
in a poppy if you did it'd be a miracle worker hey I thought it was good I

57:47.680 --> 57:57.680
didn't say anything awful about it that sentence is it's pretty solid I like

57:57.680 --> 58:01.800
that has my audio gone funny again every now and then I think it's just packet

58:01.800 --> 58:07.120
loss weird I mean from my side it's been everyone's been kind of cutting out a

58:07.120 --> 58:10.400
little bit which has been odd because that doesn't normally happen

58:10.400 --> 58:16.120
Leonard oh man that poor guy dude I'm not even talking to you from my Linux

58:16.120 --> 58:19.240
machine right now because I'm hiding in a conference room are you are you

58:19.240 --> 58:23.000
permitted to say that I think I think you have to like get clearance or

58:23.000 --> 58:28.800
something poppy already knows this from the times that I've met him at various

58:28.800 --> 58:35.000
events mainly snap sprints but I was in one OS I was gonna say I've never

58:35.000 --> 58:47.480
actually seen him run Linux oh no no no at the the rally two years ago I think

58:47.480 --> 58:54.480
the one in New York the whole time I brought my Linux laptop with me Noah

58:54.480 --> 58:58.560
saw it and so did a couple of other people I have witnesses now hold on now

58:58.560 --> 59:03.440
we're not we're not we're not come on we don't we don't we don't know a shame we

59:03.440 --> 59:06.800
got a call for an end of this the tribalism you know like I feel like I

59:06.800 --> 59:09.920
should walk around be like my name is Chris I'm a Linux user and I also have

59:09.920 --> 59:13.880
an iPad you know like I have to just come I have to come holding your iPad so

59:13.880 --> 59:17.520
they'll see I have to come clean about it I don't know no more down with the

59:17.520 --> 59:23.840
tribal you see at home I have a MacBook I have I have numerous Linux machines

59:23.840 --> 59:27.080
running all many different distros here's where I think it has validity

59:27.080 --> 59:31.880
though like I think if you work in free software and open source or in that

59:31.880 --> 59:35.680
space like then that should be your primary stack that should be your main

59:35.680 --> 59:38.960
stack because that's your area but it would be ignorant not to ever try a

59:38.960 --> 59:43.400
Windows or Mac because then you would have zero insights into how very popular

59:43.400 --> 59:47.880
very commercial very successful commercial operating systems yeah you

59:47.880 --> 01:00:02.120
have to what you have to do that
