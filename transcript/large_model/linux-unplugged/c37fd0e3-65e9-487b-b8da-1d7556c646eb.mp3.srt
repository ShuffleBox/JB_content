1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
Oh hey, Mumble Room, before we get started, this is going to be an official thing we do

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,220
in the show, but I just wanted to introduce you all to L, who has just joined the Jupiter

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,220
broadcasting team.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,220
Hey, L.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,220
Hey, everyone.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,220
Hey, everyone.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,220
Hey, L.

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,220
Hey.

9
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,220
Hello.

10
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,220
And what will L be doing?

11
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:33,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 286, for January 29th, 2019.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that actually isn't having too much

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
caffeine.

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
I don't know what's going on.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
My name is Chris.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,440
My name is Wes, and I'm plenty caffeinated.

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Don't you worry.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
Good, good.

19
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,340
We're just like fired up today.

20
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,500
It's been a really good day.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,720
We did some live streaming, and today on the show, I have an opportunity to introduce a

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,900
new member of our team who's been working on a super secret project for about the last

23
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,760
month that we get to announce on the show today.

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,580
So I'm pretty, pretty amped.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,180
But on top of that, we have some fantastic community news for you Firefox users.

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,120
Pretty significant update on the Librem 5 and the PureOS Store.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,280
We have some details, a new Kodi, a little details in the canonical corner we'll get

28
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680
to later on.

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,660
And then we'll do that introduction with our new team member, tell you about what we're

30
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,080
going to be working on, what's coming down and the new study groups that we're launching,

31
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
which are going to be awesome.

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,420
And they'll be right after Linux Unplugged starting next week, involving our virtual

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,100
lug and taking questions directly from the training architects that make the course material.

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
We tell you more about that.

35
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,100
I'm just very excited.

36
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,800
It's going to be something, just a little thing we're doing and it's going to be just

37
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,640
something totally free, not even part of the show, just something we do for the community.

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,280
It's pretty exciting to get to do that kind of stuff, but I'll tell you more about that.

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm very excited.

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,440
So before we get going, before I spoil everything, let's bring in our virtual lug.

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:03,960
Time, appropriate greetings, mumble room, hello, hello.

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,640
This is a show and we've got Brent is in there.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Bruce is in there.

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,400
Bruce is back, El's in there, ooh, iBitten, Eric, MiniMech, Sean and Mr. Wimpris returns.

45
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
It is good to see you again, Wimpy.

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Hello, sir.

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
How have you been?

48
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Yeah, I've been very well.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,960
You know, busy, you know, Christmas, New Year and then off to South Africa and back.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,400
So I haven't been around much recently.

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Well, I'm glad to have you back.

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,360
It's good to hear your voice and Mr. Payne, what do you say we kick things off with some

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Firefox news, version 65.null is out and sort of great timing with the messaging on this

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
one.

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,400
One of the headline features enhanced tracking protection and improved performance and web

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,640
compatibility, including the WebP image format.

57
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,000
But I want to talk about stack smashing here for a second, because this is the big headline

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
for us Linux users.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,120
Enhanced security for macOS, Linux and Android users via stronger stack smashing protection,

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,380
which is now enabled by default on these platforms.

61
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,640
What stack smashing, Wes?

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
What is this?

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, so really, really, it's just been compiled now.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,400
We've got some new defaults on Firefox so that, well, stack is a region of memory that

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,640
programs can use to write to that's sort of pre allocated.

66
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,040
And there's various techniques that you can have bad assumptions made or just, you know,

67
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,180
common errors in programs, especially low level programs like you might find in a browser.

68
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,240
These compiled time protections make sure that it's a lot harder for people trying to

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,200
trigger on your untrusted input, triggering bad actions that might harm all your precious

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
files.

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I knew you'd have the answer.

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I knew you'd know.

73
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,000
There's a few other new features as well, aren't there?

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, yeah.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Easier performance management.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,040
They've got a revamped task manager pane.

77
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,640
That's just over at about performance.

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,080
If you want to go take a look and an improved pop up blocker to prevent multiple pop up

79
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,840
windows from being opened at the same time, which, you know, that doesn't happen to me

80
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,400
very often, but I imagine I would be very annoyed.

81
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,740
And it's worth noting for you enterprise users that are deploying Firefox.

82
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,660
There's now 32 bit and 64 bit MSI installers for easier enterprise deployment.

83
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,300
And I've been in the chat room is pointing out that the Android and iOS versions of this

84
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,760
will be released on January 30th as we record.

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,440
Only the desktop versions were released today.

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Thanks, Benton.

87
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,200
That's a good clarification.

88
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,160
So version 65.0 of the little browser that still can and hopefully still will for a very

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,560
long time, there was a scathing article recently suggesting that Mozilla should just dump Gecko

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,600
and switch over to Blink and just stop fighting the tide, stop fighting that wave of change

91
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:52,480
from WebKit over to WebKit and instead embrace it and attempt to impact its development.

92
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,200
And their core argument, I'm curious what your thoughts are on this, Wes.

93
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,160
Their core argument really was that the web is becoming more like a runtime now.

94
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,840
It's more of an applications platform.

95
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,960
And the applications can be much, much better if they can be built assuming you're using

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,780
one rendering engine.

97
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,480
And he argues that it's not like Internet Explorer because unlike Internet Explorer,

98
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,520
it's all open source and people can participate in the development of it.

99
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,120
They can have their own forks of it, et cetera.

100
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,400
What do you think of that argument?

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,540
There's certainly true things in that argument.

102
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,020
There's lots about that.

103
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,560
And you also see that particular platform often having stuff first or implementing test

104
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,000
APIs that end up getting supported.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,380
You and I sometimes use some stuff that requires Chrome in order to function properly.

106
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,320
And so you can sometimes build some really rich experiences.

107
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,360
And they're right that, yes, it's open source.

108
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,360
It's not.

109
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
It is not.

110
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,040
It's fundamentally different than Internet Explorer.

111
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,700
But I think we need multiple implementations and we should be coding against a standard

112
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,560
and not just what becomes ossified in the default implementation of the web.

113
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Right.

114
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Right.

115
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Yeah.

116
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Otherwise, what's the point of standards?

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Yeah.

118
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,100
Otherwise, it's just whatever this one project does is all we have as an option.

119
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,660
And I think the thing that was frustrating me about the core of the argument is it's

120
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,440
an interesting idea except for we've been there, done that, and it was horrible and

121
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,160
the web stagnated badly when Internet Explorer 6 and et cetera were dominant.

122
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,820
And it, I think, set the web back many years.

123
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,780
And it wasn't until we started to see that monopoly over the web get cracked by Chrome

124
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,960
and Firefox that the web started to get better.

125
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,760
It's still crap, but it got a lot better.

126
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,480
And so it's sort of a failing to learn from past mistakes kind of argument, I think.

127
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,120
I have actually even more pragmatic view on this.

128
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:55,440
So yes, Internet Explorer did meant that we stalled innovation until we got some competition.

129
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,680
But I don't want to have a meltdown of the browser or a specter of the browser.

130
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,240
And it's just more likely if you all is using the same.

131
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,540
I mean, even Microsoft's browser is going to be using Chrome as a base.

132
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,720
So yeah, we kind of have enough Chrome around.

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
It's everybody, really.

134
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,400
Let's have one that is not.

135
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,520
Yeah, please.

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,160
Speaking of maybe not learning from past mistakes, but we just don't know yet.

137
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,800
We have some firm details from Purism on the Librem 5's hardware.

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,320
And this is pretty nice because they haven't given details on some of these things.

139
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,120
And some of these things we've known for a long time.

140
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,040
And it's looking like it's going to have a pretty competitive feature set.

141
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,200
It will have 802.11 BG and end Wi-Fi.

142
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,160
The display will be 720 by 1440 with a high DPI screen that's glossy.

143
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,960
Three gigs of RAM could subject to change.

144
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,160
Micro SD card slot, a loudspeaker as they put it, a headphone jack,

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,840
one SIM card slot, a camera front and back, replaceable battery, tools required,

146
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,080
and a smart card reader that is OpenPGP compatible.

147
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:10,720
And the key detail is the CPU, the NXP-IMX8M quad or quad mini CPU.

148
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,400
Now, I saw some feedback that came into Linux Action News, I believe it was,

149
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,000
where we were looking at an image of the development board.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,040
And we noticed that the developer of Post Market OS had

151
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,640
rigged a way to get a fan over the CPU to cool it.

152
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,400
Now, he wrote in and

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,920
clarified a little bit that the CPU does run extremely hot right now,

154
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,760
even using the standard tools.

155
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,840
And so that's an area that likely is going to be tweaked over time or

156
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,440
hopefully be tweaked over time.

157
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,360
That's a little concerning.

158
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,320
Yeah, and he says different people with different dev kits have rigged different

159
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,600
ways to cool that CPU.

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,600
He just rigged up some stiff wire and got like a little tiny like 20 millimeter fan

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,000
or whatever, just even smaller than that, just one of those real noisy suckers

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,760
right over the CPU to try to keep it cool like when doing software builds and stuff.

163
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,160
It's early days though, right?

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,320
I mean, that could probably get fixed.

165
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,760
I feel like out of the group here, Wimpy probably has some of the most experience

166
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,800
with this.

167
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,320
Have you seen this picture, Wimpy, and

168
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,840
are you following any of the Librem 5 news?

169
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,960
I did look at this picture weeks ago when it was first out.

170
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,800
And I'm following along with Librem stuff when podcasts cover it, but

171
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,080
I've not followed any of the blogs myself.

172
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
I think you know my position.

173
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm very skeptical that they'll ship a device this year.

174
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,440
They feel like they're a long, long way off and perhaps we'll see this in 2020.

175
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,840
Yeah, I follow it with some interest mostly because I still see the Librem 5

176
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:47,760
mentioned almost on a daily basis online as a possible solution to all of our woes.

177
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,720
There's a lot of hopes and promises that are being pinned on this.

178
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,960
And I think Purism is pretty aware of that.

179
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,760
And they're trying to message, they're trying to keep that interest up.

180
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
They're trying to actively communicate.

181
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,880
And one of the things they've been talking about is the Pure OS store.

182
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,920
So of course, if you're going to create your own phone operating system,

183
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,200
you then also need to create your own store.

184
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,080
And they're giving us details on that.

185
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,480
It's going to be based around flat packs.

186
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,920
Yeah, so they announced the Pure OS store, you gotta have your own store.

187
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,960
That's just, you're right, that's how it has to work.

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,160
But there's no other way to do it.

189
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
At least they're going to use some sort of the underlying technology

190
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
we're all becoming more familiar with.

191
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,560
Now they've already got a very first application and that's going to be Lollipop.

192
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,680
The Lollipop application is of course a GNOME music player.

193
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Yeah, that's not a bad first choice, I suppose.

194
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,600
And I can see why Flatpaks makes a good choice for them

195
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,920
because they can have a self-hosted repository that they manage and curate

196
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,840
and have like that can be the backend to their own store.

197
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,080
It seems like a, I don't know, it seems like maybe not a format

198
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,320
that was specifically designed for this kind of use.

199
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,960
But if you're going to be so GNOME heavy as they seem to be, it kind of makes sense.

200
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,840
I mean, it might be an interesting thing to reflect on, right?

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,480
We'll see how well this goes and how well Flatpak meets that need.

202
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,240
Yeah, and it may be a great highlight of some of some GNOME apps

203
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,000
that do really good at refactoring their screen sizes

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,840
or their application window sizes and whatnot.

205
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,160
So yeah, there you go. There's a little Librem 5 update.

206
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,760
I know there's a lot of interest out there, so I wanted to cover it.

207
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,080
Still not backing it myself.

208
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,840
But if they do get a shipping sellable product that I can buy, yeah, I think I will.

209
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,880
Now, something that I'm all in on, though, is Kodi.

210
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,680
Love it. Love it, especially since they released an Android version

211
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,960
that runs on Android TV set-top boxes like the NVIDIA Shield.

212
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,120
Just such a great open source media center.

213
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,200
And after another long development period,

214
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,600
this week the team has released Kodi 18.

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,000
Immediately available on all of the supported platforms.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,840
Approaching nearly 10,000 commits.

217
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,280
Nearly half a million lines of new code

218
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
and nearly the same amount removed from the project.

219
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,880
36 open source contributors.

220
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,200
Many, many, they say quite literally many cases of beer and wine.

221
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,280
Well, I mean, that's pretty much just what it takes, right?

222
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Especially when you're developing an open source project.

223
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Quite literally.

224
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,280
Now, OK, one thing I was really curious to see,

225
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,440
and it is a pretty big feature release.

226
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,880
They've now got support for gaming emulators,

227
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,160
ROMs and controllers to go along with those games.

228
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,520
Yeah, like retro game playing built right in.

229
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,440
Right from the same interface that you're already using for your media center.

230
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Mm hmm.

231
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,120
One of the more controversial things they've added is support

232
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,880
for digital rights management decryption.

233
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,280
Which that's, you know, that is that's a real contentious topic

234
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,080
with our audience and one that I have very many mixed feelings around.

235
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,480
But it seems like in the set top TV market.

236
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,920
You have to because every other single application on that device supports it,

237
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,280
so you would literally be the only video playing app that doesn't.

238
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,440
And that's just a really tough position to be in. Right.

239
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
And when you when you're in when you're making something

240
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,320
that then just can't play content that a lot of people want,

241
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,720
it doesn't look good.

242
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,080
Speaking of Android TV, Cody can now show its library contents on the main screen.

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,920
And this is kind of a neat feature that Netflix and Plex and other apps

244
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,040
take advantage of its you get these ribbons of content

245
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,960
and and it's a great way to quickly restart a show.

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,040
So I watch Deep Space Nine quite a bit and it's always right there.

247
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,200
The next episode is always right there on the front of the Android TV screen.

248
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,360
So I don't even have to launch the app.

249
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,000
I just click it.

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,480
It launches the connected app and starts playing that episode.

251
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,600
So not only are they introducing that support,

252
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,680
but they're also introducing full voice functionality.

253
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,720
This is a big aspect of these things is the Google assistant is baked in

254
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,240
and you can use that now to search for content like whatever you want

255
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,360
or to fill in the on screen keyboard and it will search encoding and play it.

256
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,280
Pretty, pretty nice.

257
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,440
And I also notice they have some updates in here for improved RTMP stream support.

258
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,920
Yeah, right. That's one thing about Cody is it doesn't matter what you're trying to play.

259
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,200
They probably already have support or a plug in to support it.

260
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,120
So you just throw whatever media you want at it and you can watch it.

261
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,760
Yep. Yeah. And I think that is I think that is looking like a very solid update.

262
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm going to make sure I have that updated version as soon as I get home.

263
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,520
Let's head over to the canonical corner for a moment.

264
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,800
I just can't quit 1904.

265
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,440
I've been running the daily now for weeks since after Christmas.

266
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,240
And I mostly wanted to just soak in the new Gnome and see how it handled

267
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,680
my multi monitor set up on my ThinkPad versus Plasma,

268
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,320
which was causing significant performance issues on my vertical 27 inch screens

269
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:04,040
and moved over to Ubuntu 1904 Disco Dingo and installed the Gnome desktop.

270
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,040
And oh, man, oh, man, have those have those they were butter smooth.

271
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,480
And I've only I've only been able to use it a little bit because I'm in Texas right now.

272
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,200
But man, has it been good. And so I haven't been able to quit it.

273
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,520
I thought I would actually Nuke and Pave and put Fedora on there

274
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,480
and give the Fedora implementation a spin and maybe try out Pantheon

275
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,080
because I've been told by Neil that if you're on Fedora Rawhide,

276
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,360
you can install Pantheon on Fedora.

277
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,560
And I thought that might be fun, but I can't quit.

278
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:43,280
I can't quit 1904. So I feel like just a super, super quick take.

279
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,480
I feel like I'm right back where I was ages ago when I used Ubuntu

280
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,640
and one of the things that kind of made me move to Arch.

281
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,320
And I'm so frustrated and yet happy to have goodies.

282
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,320
And the issue simply is that Canonical is back to making each point release compelling.

283
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:09,000
And makes me want to jump off of an LTS, off of a beautifully well-supported LTS

284
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,400
onto the latest release that has, you know, much less support cycle

285
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,640
simply because the new goodies are irresistible.

286
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah, that does keep happening, right?

287
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,560
Because for a while, the LTS is still so fresh and it does have that nice taste of stability.

288
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,920
You're back in the mode of trying to just get work done and it's perfect.

289
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,880
And then suddenly the grass really does grow greener.

290
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,680
And you want the shiny new thing.

291
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,880
That's the problem. The grass is greener. It is actually greener grass.

292
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,600
And I like green grass. Wimpy, you're asking if the fractional scaling has landed yet.

293
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,400
I don't actually have high DPI on the T480.

294
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,680
I opted to just avoid that problem for a while and went 1080p.

295
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,960
But I'm wondering how 1904 is shaping up from an Ubuntu Monte perspective.

296
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,480
If it's a very radical change for you guys, if it's business as usual, that kind of stuff.

297
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,440
Well, for Ubuntu Monte, it's business as usual.

298
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:11,480
Hopefully, the new version of Monte desktop upstream will land in time that we can ship that.

299
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,760
So I'm just looking at that at the moment, building the interim development snapshots.

300
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,280
So that will be the main change should it all come together.

301
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,040
But most of my focus is on Debian at the moment because Debian Buster is just around the corner

302
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,000
and I'm helping the Monte guys in Debian get a new version stitched together there.

303
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,120
But yeah, I was talking to Will a couple of weeks ago.

304
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,160
And in GNOME for 1904, you'll find fractional scaling,

305
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,880
but also fractional scaling in Xorg as well as Wayland Sessions.

306
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,080
And also being able to scale monitors independently of one another,

307
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,560
regardless of whether you're running Wayland or Xorg that will work in both display servers now.

308
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,880
Oh, my goodness.

309
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Did we suddenly hit the future? What's happening?

310
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,600
That is fantastic.

311
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
I literally thought that would never come to X11.

312
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,840
I had just given up hope.

313
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,560
Yeah, so I know that Marco has been working on that and that's all submitted upstream and is in review.

314
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:22,000
But I believe that we're going to be carrying that as vendor patches in 1904 if it doesn't land upstream in time.

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,080
Right. That would be very interesting.

316
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,360
I've been following it.

317
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
I may still try Fedora out for a bit.

318
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,920
I want to give the rawhide experience a go.

319
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,360
But like Wes said, it's like the issue has been is now I got it set up.

320
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:42,280
I'm getting work done and I still have all my machines except for this one on Plasma.

321
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,280
However, I really have not had very many troubles.

322
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,960
But I never really do on an all Intel setup where everything's Intel and I don't have a whole bunch of crap installed.

323
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,040
I just have my basic work tools installed.

324
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,800
I haven't tried to make it into a mobile audio production mixing workhouse yet.

325
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,360
Right. It's usually when I start going off into these edge cases that it starts falling apart for me.

326
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,040
So if I just kind of keep it simple and just using the Intel stuff, it's been fantastic.

327
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,480
So we'll see what happens when I hook it up to the NVIDIA dock.

328
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,960
Maybe that's the key to a long term gnome for you, Chris, is we just got to have one system that you use for nothing else but light work.

329
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:33,080
Maybe, maybe. Speaking of upgrading to new Ubuntu releases, some news on the 25th of this week that Ubuntu users can now keep PPAs and third party repositories enabled when upgrading to newer versions.

330
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,440
Oh, yeah. I mean, so it's kind of there's a couple of things here.

331
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,960
One change in particular, make sure that third party repositories support the release to what you're actually trying to upgrade to.

332
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,080
And then optionally, if it doesn't, disabling the repository if it doesn't support the version that you're about to be at.

333
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:01,520
Now, there's another option that just sort of allow keeping PPAs and third party repositories installed instead of the old way where they would just disappear.

334
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:11,840
So it's basically Ubuntu growing a little smarter at doing this, trying to hit the right balance between not wanting to break your upgrade, which can be something of a dangerous process,

335
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,560
but not confusing end users who suddenly find that they no longer get updates or just don't have access to a whole bunch of software they'd already installed.

336
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:27,840
It's kind of nice to see them giving it a go and it's already going to be available for Ubuntu 18.10 users that go to 19.04.

337
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,080
That's kind of cool. And it looks like they're also proposing it for 18.04 to 18.10.

338
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,680
Not landed yet, but it is in the proposed repository.

339
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,080
Expect to see it on OS near you.

340
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:47,920
Yeah. And then right before we get out of the canonical corner, why don't we talk just about why everybody needs to update their rigs this week if you're on Ubuntu.

341
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:58,080
There's several security issues that were discovered in the Linux kernel and on 18.04 by Onyx Beaver affecting all of the derivatives based on 18.04, too.

342
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,640
It's quite a bit. You want to break some of these down for us, Mr. Payne?

343
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,320
Yeah, right. OK, so eleven total.

344
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:17,040
They range from just like a use after free and sort of standard buffer overflow to some kind of more dangerous out of bound rights that could allow attackers to maybe execute arbitrary code or just crash your system and cause a denial of service.

345
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:24,120
A lot of these involve problems over in our favorite ext4 file system.

346
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,040
Yeah, that's the thing, isn't that? Like, that's the vector here.

347
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:36,720
You know, some of these are kind of interesting. So if you are, one, make sure you do update, but two, you know, just go see kind of the day to day fixes that have to go happen to keep the kernel secure.

348
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,520
Like there was a race condition in the VSOC address family implementation, which could also cause use after free condition.

349
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,320
So they're all just little things. There's also some updates over in the over in KVM, which that's good. We want KVM to be secure.

350
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,960
Yeah, Mr. Wu's name is on a lot of these bugs. He's been he's been really cracking. He's a Chrome developer.

351
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:06,000
And Jan Horn of Google's Project Zero also discovered an issue in the kernel's ProcFS file system implementation.

352
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,920
And so that's also in this fix. Like these aren't necessarily Ubuntu specific bugs, but these are bugs that will impact anyone on 1804.

353
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,560
And these are the fixes that Canonical is shipping for now.

354
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:27,800
And I think it's it's probably worth pointing this out from time to time because I just had somebody write into the show and argue the case for the studio systems never being updated.

355
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,600
And they just basically said, install them, install all the software once, never install updates.

356
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,800
And it was, you know, they tried to make a compelling case for it. And I just I can't wrap my head around that.

357
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,080
I feel like if you if your operating system can't handle these important updates and there's something wrong, I'm not saying that is the case with with our studio systems.

358
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,840
But like this just right here shows you why you need to stay up to date.

359
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:53,400
And I mean, if you're you know, if you're using the LTS, you don't have to update kernels that often.

360
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,680
You know, you're not doing this every other day. So you could have a little it's OK to reboot your system now and again.

361
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,720
And actually, you should just test that it's going to power on again.

362
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,600
Yeah, that's a good validation test right there.

363
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:13,280
So links to that stuff, if you want to know more, if you got to manage some boxes in the show notes, nothing too unusual there.

364
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:21,040
So why don't we do a bit of housekeeping? The cone of silence.

365
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,560
All right, this is obviously stuff we don't want anybody to know.

366
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,440
We're only telling you guys super secretly, we should probably whisper while we're doing this.

367
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,840
I know. Well, we're in the corner silence. We don't need to. Oh, perfect. Let's yell.

368
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, that's why that's the way to go. That's why that's why the cone of silence is so great.

369
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,160
So just a really quick mention, we are going to be at scale 17 X, March 7th through the 10th.

370
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:49,200
And there's some great talks going on, including one that we're going to tell you about from one of our own team members here in a few minutes,

371
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,880
as well as our buddy Stuart Langridge will be giving a talk called privacy could be the next big thing.

372
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,840
And the whole bad voltage crew, at least some of them, if not all of them, will be doing a bad voltage live.

373
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,200
And we have links to all of that stuff linked in the show notes if you want to go check that out.

374
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,840
And I'll be there unless I think you're going to go to. Yes. Heck, yeah. Yeah.

375
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,200
So come say hi to Wes and I will be down there.

376
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,160
We'll talk more about what we're doing at scale when we bring on our new team member.

377
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,360
But I'm pretty excited about that. So, yeah, check that out.

378
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,560
And then also just a little public service announcement here.

379
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,800
Two things to know about that are coming down the pipe.

380
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:35,400
Number one is over the next. I don't know who knows what these things could be a month or more.

381
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,680
We're going to start rolling out artwork updates for the shows like the album art.

382
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,200
Not really going to impact anything else. It's just the look of the album art and stuff like that.

383
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,480
And that's because we're part of a larger organization now and they have a design team.

384
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,600
So we can go to them and say, hey, can you create us something really cool?

385
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,240
And they're working on it right now.

386
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,760
And, you know, we're going for something that's clean and easy to read and something bold and classy.

387
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Not over the top so far. That's kind of like the general direction.

388
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,640
And it feels like a small thing and in some ways maybe it is.

389
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,000
But I think also to us it's kind of a big thing because we put in a lot of hard work trying to make other aspects of the show.

390
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,360
And for a long time this wasn't one that we had easy direct control over.

391
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,000
So it's nice to be able to put some shine on it.

392
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Especially when you don't have a lot of extra capital to spend on hiring designers.

393
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,880
So, and to get it right, it's got to be designed.

394
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,560
And we're finally there as part of Linux Academy and it's exciting to have them work on that.

395
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,400
So I just want to make you aware of it.

396
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,400
That way you can prepare yourself because there is one universal truth about new logos.

397
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
Nobody likes them.

398
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,440
Nobody likes them. Nobody, nobody likes them. Nobody does.

399
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,840
And then they grow on you and over time they just become normal and then you learn to love them.

400
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,040
In some cases, I mean I shouldn't say nobody, in some cases of course they click with people.

401
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,720
But it's very, it's very, very common for people to have a strong negative reaction.

402
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,360
And so I wanted to prepare you for that.

403
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,760
So when it does roll out, you're not shocked.

404
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:09,360
And then last but not least, if you've got time next Tuesday, February 5th, after Linux Unplugged, almost immediately after Linux Unplugged,

405
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,000
we're going to hold a study group with our virtual lug.

406
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,120
We will stream the visuals on jblive.tv. People in the virtual lug in the mumble room can ask questions and participate with us.

407
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,680
And I wanted you to know about it now. We're going to talk about it again here in just a moment.

408
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,640
But I felt like it was important while we're in the housekeeping section to tell you about that.

409
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,880
So that's what's going on in the near term.

410
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,920
The scale coming up soon. Some friends that are giving talks will have links in the show notes.

411
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,000
If you're going to scale, a couple of recommendations for you to check out.

412
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Our new artwork is coming down the pipe and the study group, February 5th, that will be streamed after Linux Unplugged.

413
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,960
And maybe that's where we should start now.

414
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:56,480
So let's talk about something pretty exciting that's going on that has been in the works for about a month now.

415
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,840
And I haven't really been able to talk about it because I didn't I didn't even know.

416
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,680
How the hell any of this was going to be possible because there's so much going on

417
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,880
and I already have quite a bit that I'm responsible for.

418
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,240
And it required it required somebody who knew how to dig through the company,

419
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,160
ask the right people the right questions, get information that we needed,

420
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:27,240
and then just take action and come up with ideas of of theming it and integrating it.

421
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,640
And it was just all stuff that I just didn't have the mental CPU cycles for.

422
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,880
But it's been something since I joined the company I've wanted to do.

423
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,480
And that is release some of the Linux Academy content for free to the community.

424
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,520
Stuff that's behind a paywall now.

425
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,040
Take a look at some of that stuff and release it free.

426
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:55,920
But I hadn't clicked with how I was going to actually physically pull that off until a new member joined our team.

427
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,040
So I want to take a moment and introduce you to L. Marquez.

428
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:05,840
I've been dropping hints for weeks because I'm really excited about a new team member who's joined the community department.

429
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,360
That's what Jupiter Broadcasting is within Linux Academies.

430
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,640
We are the community department and we do things for the community.

431
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:18,080
And there's someone inside the company that I think if she had been hired after we had a community department,

432
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,240
she would have come directly here.

433
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,760
But she gave her a chance to do a bunch of other great things in the company,

434
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,640
which I'll let her tell you about in just a moment.

435
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,560
But I'm super excited to officially welcome L to the team.

436
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,800
L Marquez, welcome to Linux Unplugged and welcome to Jupiter Broadcasting.

437
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,560
Thanks so much.

438
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,120
I'm excited to finally be something more than that other team member that you keep referring to in the last couple of weeks.

439
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,880
I've been slipping it in. I have.

440
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,320
You've actually been super busy, though.

441
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,200
So it we were going to kick things off kind of at the beginning of the year,

442
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,640
but we started a few other projects and you were wrapping up a course that's actually launching this week at Linux Academy,

443
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
which is the Docker Quick Start, right?

444
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Yep. I don't know how it happened, but somehow I just got a little bit obsessed with the container world

445
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,600
and was lucky enough to get involved with Docker specifically.

446
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,200
So I got to do Terry's course.

447
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,960
If anybody's done the Linux Academy courses before, Terry is one of the most famous course authors.

448
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,760
And he gave me a chance to redo his Docker Quick Start course.

449
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:27,520
But like I was saying, L is really perfect for this role because she travels more than I do, which that's really saying something.

450
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,400
You're going to events all the time.

451
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,520
What are the next couple of community events you're going to in just like the next few months?

452
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,240
So I get to hang out with you guys at scale.

453
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,680
And after that, I have talks out to both the OpenStack or now it's the Open Infrastructure Summit and DockerCon.

454
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,120
So that's going to be a really hard choice.

455
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,640
Yeah, so that's going to be pretty great because we're trying to up our game at events and stuff.

456
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,760
L is pushing all of us to have like go and give talks at these events.

457
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:03,400
So we're setting up a Jupyter Broadcasting Linux Fest Northwest track where like several of us now are including L.

458
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,480
L is giving like three talks.

459
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,440
I'm giving like one talk.

460
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,560
Wes is giving a talk.

461
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,480
Alan is going to give a ZFS talk, of course.

462
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,400
And same at scale, like L, you're giving a talk at scale, too.

463
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,160
Yeah, I get to talk at the Container Days portion of scale and teach people what containers are.

464
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,920
Like not anything specific, just open source technology and container basics.

465
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:31,560
So I want to talk a little bit about one of the things that you and I have been working on that's kept you busy before we've gotten on air together.

466
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:39,120
And that is releasing new courses and some really great beginner courses for free at Linux Academy.

467
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,840
Now, I want to back up here for a moment.

468
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,920
This isn't a plug.

469
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,320
Nobody's asked us to talk about this.

470
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,000
L and I have this is something that we've just been working on that we wanted to share with you guys.

471
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:01,120
And it's pretty exciting because we are now the community department inside Linux Academy are taking charge of releasing content for free on a regular basis.

472
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:13,120
And we're refreshing some of the courses that will remain free and introducing some new ones, some courses that I am personally really excited about because I've taken them and I know they're really good.

473
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,440
It's not an advertisement.

474
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,840
It's just something that we've been working on that we think is a great opportunity for Linux Academy to give back to the community.

475
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:32,040
So with all of that sort of preface, whatever preface, whatever it is I wanted to get out of the way, I want to tell you about what we're doing and what you can expect.

476
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,160
We are adding a series of free cloud training and Linux Essentials training and many more.

477
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,280
We'll tell you about them here in a moment to Linux Academy's free community edition.

478
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,840
Each month, additionally, we'll be kicking out new content for the community.

479
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,120
And this is all L's idea, but I love it.

480
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,560
We are going to do a study group after Linux Unplugged.

481
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,240
Initially, we're going to start with YAML Essentials.

482
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,400
What happens if you're working on YAML and you've broken something?

483
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:58,920
How do you fix it?

484
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,720
That kind of stuff.

485
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,480
We'll be bringing on the training architect who's volunteering their time.

486
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,360
They're volunteering their time.

487
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,280
They'll come on after Linux Unplugged.

488
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,640
It's not part of the show.

489
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,120
We're not at least currently planning to release it, but they'll join the Mumble Room

490
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,680
and they'll hang out with our virtual lug and they'll teach a subject.

491
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,760
We're going to start with YAML Essentials just because YAML powers like so many things.

492
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,680
It's like the config language for so, so many things.

493
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,040
And it's just getting more and more popular.

494
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,040
And the data at Linux Academy shows us people like that course too.

495
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,200
So we're starting with that one as our study group.

496
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,120
But then after that, we're going to open it up for vote.

497
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,000
We'll have a link in the show notes this week where you can vote on what you would like to have a study group on.

498
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,360
And if we get enough votes, we'll do another study group and we'll connect with that training architect

499
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,160
and ask them to come on and chat with us a bit.

500
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:51,360
But Ellie, you came up with a really great formula of like different types of content for beginners

501
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,640
and intermediary and experts that we're going to be releasing.

502
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,800
Plus, we've got some of the stuff that's always going to be free.

503
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,640
Why don't you talk a little bit about your formula that you came up with?

504
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,040
So one of my ideas was, you know, the big message that I always have is that it's OK to be new,

505
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,240
that it's OK to tackle new technologies.

506
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,800
However, people see that as someone who is just new to the tech sector, perhaps new to Linux.

507
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:19,000
But we can have somebody who's had, you know, like me, five years worth of Linux experience or even more,

508
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,440
who has never tried AWS or who's never even attempted containers.

509
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,240
So in that sense, they're new to that technology.

510
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,120
And I thought that if we broached a bunch of different subjects, we talked about AWS, we had some Azure training,

511
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,160
we had container and we had Linux fundamentals, we could reach a broader community than what we might be doing otherwise.

512
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,560
Yeah, and some of this stuff is just great for people that want to have a basic understanding.

513
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,360
They don't even need a full fledged membership yet, but they want to learn some essentials.

514
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:54,160
Like getting started with Git is going to be one of the courses that comes out, an Ansible quick start guide.

515
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,320
But I want to take a moment and Ellie, you just talked, you just touched on it here.

516
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:06,840
The Linux operating system fundamentals that Kenny did is kind of special because it goes into the history of operating systems

517
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,440
and it goes into the history of the Canoe user land.

518
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,640
And you could even you could show it to somebody who doesn't know what an operating system is,

519
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,920
like they're not familiar with the concept.

520
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,680
And by the end of it, they'll understand Richard Stallman's contribution to Linux,

521
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,000
will understand what the Linux kernel is versus the rest of the stack.

522
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,080
And and the other the other Unix's and Unix eyes that existed before Linux was the dominant one.

523
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,000
And it's like it's like an hour and a half course or something like that.

524
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I mean, it's just it's a gem for anybody who is self-taught like I was where I miss certain gaps.

525
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,840
And this filled in a lot of things, even things I kind of know, but it was good to hear again.

526
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,440
And it's going to be free. And this is the kind of stuff that we're going to be working on to keep like these kinds of courses

527
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,520
we're going to be watching for and trying to release them to the community as much as we can.

528
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,960
You know, one of the things that I really loved about that course being free is I have so many people that don't understand what I do,

529
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,760
whether that be family members or people that I went to school with.

530
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,080
So I think I'm just going to be sending them links and going, watch this.

531
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,640
This is what Linux is. And that's what I do for a living.

532
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:17,280
Yeah, right. The other one that's coming out for February is one that has been super popular and it just launched.

533
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,720
And I'm really impressed that we got this in there because, you know, I mean,

534
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,600
they just got done investing all of the time and money to build this whole course out and we're releasing it for free.

535
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,800
And it's subnetting fundamentals. And I thought, OK, you know, it's kind of a dry topic, you know, learning network subnetting.

536
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,240
But it's it's again, it's a pretty short course.

537
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,640
And the early data and feedback from students has been like, this is super crazy, great, valuable.

538
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,000
And so we looked at that and we thought, well, let's put that one out there, too.

539
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,400
People, you know, you've got to deal with networking of all kinds of circumstances.

540
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,680
If you're working with Linux and computers or trying to set up a home network, it's why not understand the basics?

541
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,240
That's great. And then there's a couple other classics in there, like a Jenkins quick start, Vim, a Vim guide.

542
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,600
If you want to learn Vim or LXD, there's a whole bunch.

543
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:10,480
We we will have a blog post linked in the show notes that outlines all of the courses that are coming out because there's a bunch.

544
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,000
I mean, I think it is. Is it 20 almost now?

545
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,200
I think we've gone over 20. We just keep giving things away.

546
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,600
And it's going to be our job now is we're going to watch this kind of stuff.

547
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,160
And anyways, again, I know it sounds like an advertisement.

548
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,200
It's not. This is just something that Elle and I are really passionate about.

549
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,560
My story, I don't know, I want to ask you yours.

550
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:36,480
I want to talk about that a little bit. But my story is I took a really meandering path to get where I'm at today.

551
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,960
I started working at a school district in education.

552
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,440
Doing I.T. and I liked that work because I felt like and I thought about it frequently, even when I was young, just out of high school.

553
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:59,920
I thought about how when I fix a computer lab, like I enable classes full of students to learn and like I make a direct impact by by knowing computers.

554
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,280
I can improve lives. And that felt really good.

555
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:11,800
The problem was is that it was horrible pay and it was grinding bureaucracy and it was all the things that just drove all the other characteristics of my personality absolutely crazy.

556
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,440
And I bailed and I went into the private sector.

557
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:23,800
And then over time, I became a podcaster, but I still talked about Linux, like it was still Linux that I was in the schools or when it was in the private sector.

558
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,480
Or when I became a podcaster, it was all about Linux and open source.

559
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:36,360
But when I and in podcasting, I thought to myself, well, I'm kind of making a difference in people's lives by spreading the word and information about open source.

560
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,520
Maybe maybe I'm getting people excited to try this stuff.

561
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,120
Yeah, maybe that can change lives a little bit.

562
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,520
And we've gotten emails that people say, yeah, you know, you got me excited in Linux and I got it.

563
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,920
I got it as to a career, but it wasn't enough, really.

564
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:57,240
Like it just wasn't quite that same direct connection that I had when I was working for a school district and I could fix a student's computer and that student was enabled to learn.

565
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:09,960
And somehow now I've ended up back in this role here at Linux Academy, where I can do things like work with L to release content for free to people and make shows about these things that are free for people.

566
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,640
Like it's all it's a whole new way to combine the two areas of interest that I've had my entire life, really.

567
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,840
What about you? How does you seem super passionate about this, too?

568
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,160
I'd like to know that story. So not to go too far down the rabbit hole with my origin story.

569
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:31,240
But I think one of the reasons I started working at Linux Academy was the mission value or the goal that we change students lives.

570
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,480
When I found out about Linux, I went through a program called Linux for Ladies.

571
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,040
And at the time, I was in a place where I didn't have a job.

572
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,600
I had a degree that I couldn't use and I was about to lose my home, leaving myself and my kids living out of our van.

573
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:54,720
And through Linux and being able to become a Linux system administrator, I completely turned our lives around.

574
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,880
And, you know, in that I was able to start mentoring other moms who were looking for career changes.

575
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,400
And eventually it just became mentoring people as a whole.

576
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:14,280
And so when I talk to my mentees and they start telling me how they went from making seven dollars an hour to now making six figures in one or two years, it's just astonishing.

577
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,920
You know, you really can change not just someone's life, but a whole family's future.

578
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,160
Yeah, that that is pretty powerful and pretty motivating.

579
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,040
There we go. There is a we got deep here on the unplug program for a little bit.

580
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,800
But I'm again, I'm just I'm really excited because not only are you and I going to work on this stuff, but you're going to be joining us on the shows from time to time.

581
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,320
Because like like else, like I just said, she's got a background in this stuff and she's active.

582
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:46,160
She's very active in the community, so she's going to join Joe and the gang on user air this week.

583
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,840
And I think that's going to be on Friday.

584
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,280
I think that comes out. So I don't know what you guys are going to talk about, but I always love user air.

585
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,360
So that's going to be really good. You're going to be at events.

586
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,080
A lot of you and I will be a lot of the same events, which will be cool.

587
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,000
I have a travel buddy and you'll get to come hang out with L and I at Linux Fest Northwest or scale.

588
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,880
But even more immediately, next week, February 5th, immediately following well immediately ish following Linux unplugged.

589
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,800
We're going to hold a study group on YAML Essentials.

590
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,400
We're going to kick off that first study group.

591
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,960
They're going to get two L's for the price of one there at that at the study house.

592
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,600
I get joined by L Prime.

593
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,200
Yeah, the YAML Essentials course author, right?

594
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:27,120
So, yeah, immediately following Linux unplugged both L's and hopefully myself, although I'm remote and Mr.

595
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,040
Payne will be joining whoever from the virtual lug wants to join us next week.

596
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,800
So come for the show or come after the show and you can just hang around and we'll have I think what we're going to do is we'll have a little classroom section.

597
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,400
In the mumble, so just get mumble installed, get your audio set up and join us.

598
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,480
You can hang out for Linux unplugged next week and stick around and learn YAML Essentials and then go over to the show notes for this week's episode.

599
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,960
You can do it right now. You don't even have to wait for next week.

600
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,520
Just go to this week's episode and go vote for what you'd like to see us do.

601
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,480
Future study groups on Linux unplugged dot com slash two eight six for that.

602
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,560
We have the link in there. I also just dropped it in the IRC chat room.

603
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,000
And, you know, one thing we didn't talk about was how you are currently doing.

604
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,720
I think you're still currently doing the elementary OS challenge that Jason Evangelo has been running.

605
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,200
And I'm curious, how is that going for you so far?

606
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:26,680
It's been an adventure. I think I maybe veered from the challenge because I did cheat and start using the command line.

607
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,240
It's kind of my saying it's not Linux if I can't actually install things through the command line, right?

608
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:38,760
Fair enough. I actually completely 100 percent agree. I mean, I'll all I'll do credit to App Center, which is fantastic.

609
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,960
I just something about seeing the packages that I'm updating and whatnot on the command line.

610
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,240
It makes me feel better about the whole about the whole process.

611
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:54,880
So Jason has launched a new podcast with Joe Resington called Choose Linux.

612
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:03,320
And I saw you and he were tweeting back and forth about the next challenge, which is going to be OpenSUSE.

613
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,520
I know you've ran OpenSUSE plenty before. Are you going to take that challenge?

614
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,440
So I'm still not convinced you didn't have a part in this.

615
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,760
OpenSUSE was what I was running right before I moved over to elementary OS.

616
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,120
And I took the challenge because I managed to kernel panic OpenSUSE twice.

617
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,640
And that's twice within a one week period.

618
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:28,640
Now, were you doing something I mean, were you doing something like with a virtual machine or crazy with the graphics?

619
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,720
Like what causes OpenSUSE to the kernel? I haven't seen a kernel panic.

620
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,520
I can't remember. I mean, it may have been many years now.

621
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:44,000
So I actually wrote a blog post about it that I'm sure we can share where I took a picture of the screen because I'm still not convinced I did anything to cause it.

622
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,440
But that's everyone who causes a kernel panic.

623
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,600
I think I got just a little bit too curious with installing different package managers.

624
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,280
And I think I may have you know what? I don't know.

625
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,200
I think I may have installed packages that may be contradicted one another.

626
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,520
But I guess I'll get to learn when I re-kicked OpenSUSE again in a few days.

627
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:13,840
Well, there you go. You know, one thing I know sometimes that got me in the past was I just ate up a lot of disk space with all of the snapshots that happens when you install packages and stuff.

628
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,520
Oh, that's a cheap shot right there. Taking some of their best features there.

629
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,080
No, no. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying you got to plan for it.

630
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,000
Like you got to go in making sure you got the space for it. That's all I'm saying.

631
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,600
Yeah, prune in your old snapshots. Yeah, of course. That's true.

632
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:33,400
Yeah. Well, I'm really looking forward to the three of us getting to hang out at scale.

633
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,960
That's going to be a ton of fun. And then Elle's going to fly up here for Linux Fest Northwest.

634
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,840
Up here. I say up here as if I'm in Washington.

635
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,280
I mean, you're honorary. Yeah, it's fine.

636
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,600
Yeah, that's where my heart is, Wes. That's where my heart is now that I got a fish tank in the studio.

637
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,440
By the way, everybody, I got a fish tank in the studio. It's pretty great.

638
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,480
It's a little boy. It's just a little tiny little fish tank, little little sucker, just a little one.

639
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,200
But it's it's pretty cool because it's it sort of floats on a stand.

640
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,160
And anyways, it looks neat, right? I mean, I'm not just tooting my own horn here.

641
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,600
A mini ocean oasis. Yeah, it's got some nice lights in there, too.

642
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,800
So just kind of a quiet, calm, collected focus point.

643
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,040
I got to dress it up now, you know, because because I don't want Elle coming over and seeing the studio without a fish tank.

644
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,360
That'd be embarrassing. So I had to dress it up a little bit.

645
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:23,840
So I got a fish tank. I figured that would make up for the eight year old carpet and the horrible state of everything else.

646
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,640
Elle, you're already making us set higher standards for ourselves here.

647
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,880
So thank you. I'm classing up the joint. I like that. That's true.

648
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,120
I mean, you kind of are, though, like we've always kind of known in the back of our minds that, you know,

649
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,840
maybe we should be a little more active at these conferences we go to, like maybe we should give some talks.

650
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:48,440
And I have been going to Linux Fest Northwest for, I think.

651
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:56,240
I think 19, 19 years or so, maybe 20 years, I may have gone all 20 years, but I know I've definitely solidly in the 17 year.

652
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:04,280
And the reason why I know that is because when I first started going, I went with my high school teacher who was Jim Bassett,

653
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,520
just a great guy, great teacher and a great computer teacher and a software developer as well.

654
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,640
And he was in the Linux and I was one of the kids at the school that was in the Linux.

655
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,560
And so we were like, well, let's let's go to Linux Fest.

656
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,840
And that's how I started when I was still in high school. I started going to Linux Fest.

657
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,680
So it must have been it must have been towards the end of my my last few years high school,

658
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,840
considering how long I've been out and this is their 20th anniversary.

659
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,360
So it's going to be a hell of a party. So Elle's flying in.

660
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:37,480
I am I am hoping and praying that Wimpy and Popey make it. Signs seem to be yes, Mr.

661
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,600
Wimperis, it seems like things are trending in that direction.

662
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:51,640
We're working on it. So Ubuntu became lanyard sponsors this week and somebody's got to mule the lanyards to Linux Fest Northwest.

663
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:59,480
And we've Popey and I have both submitted talk and workshop proposals. So we'll see how that goes.

664
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,840
You, by the way, are welcome if you want to.

665
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,320
We're thinking about having a room and we have a track already.

666
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,120
And if you want to be in our room, you're welcome.

667
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,240
And you can just switch. You can put yourself on that track if you like.

668
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,800
You don't have to. OK, but if you would like the luxury of the Jupiter broadcasting arrangements, you are welcome to.

669
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:23,000
Is it big enough for all of the all of the crowds we're going to attract?

670
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Well, I suppose they will determine the size of the room based on the amount of talks.

671
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,280
I think I think it could be a good setup, too, because we will have enough people to man the booth from time to time.

672
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:35,160
And they can be sending people over to the room to tell them where we're at.

673
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,040
And the room can be sending people to the booth to get like swag and stuff.

674
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,600
And I think we might we might keep some one or two exclusive swag items in the room, too.

675
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,960
And then we'll just have a day a day, a day long of talks, basically, I think.

676
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,840
I don't know. It's all still kind of for me, but that's sort of what we're thinking about going all out this year.

677
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,880
And we wouldn't be doing any of that if it wasn't for L.

678
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,080
I mean, we've wanted to do it. We might, you know, we might try to up our game a little bit just because it's it's a big year for us.

679
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:09,960
But the but doing all of the talks and stuff, if it wasn't for L showing up, I'll submit three talks right now, which totally set the bar for everybody else.

680
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,280
So thank you, L. That's been something we've needed to do for a long time.

681
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,760
Now, I love it. And I mean, we're at a point now where I'm trying to get us to organize our own conferences.

682
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,280
This is going to be great. Yeah, that could be. Yeah, we'll we'll talk more about that.

683
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,680
And one last little plug for the study group. You just need mumble if you want to talk.

684
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,080
But if you don't want to participate, if you just want to watch and learn, you just go to JBLive.TV.

685
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:39,160
We will be streaming it. There will be a visual component on the JBLive TV stream, which will also be simulcasted on the other places that we stream.

686
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:50,920
And you can join the Mumble Room, be part of the virtual lug, and you can ask questions to the L's directly about YAML, which is a very, very useful skill set to have these days.

687
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,080
So check that out. And, L, welcome again. It's great to have you aboard.

688
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,400
And thank you so much for all of your hard work so far on freeing that content.

689
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:09,240
And don't forget, we have a blog post, too, linked in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com slash 286 that outlines the over 20 courses now that we've been able to free, including.

690
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:17,960
Oh, man, I can't believe I almost didn't mention this, including that Linux Essentials course that I've talked about before that just teaches you the history of Linux.

691
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,400
Go check that out. Go, go, go check that out. It's so good.

692
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,320
And Kenny's an awesome dude, and I believe he's going to be at Linux Fest Northwest, too. Boom.

693
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,080
So we're going to we're going to have a heck of a party.

694
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,920
God, I'm just so excited about this. This is something I've been working on since I started here.

695
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:42,160
And one of those things that isn't really about making a podcast isn't so it's not like something that is audience facing.

696
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,200
So it's just one of those things that we tool away at that nobody really knows about until it's here. And so I had to have had to take a moment talk about it.

697
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:58,160
And with that, before we go, it is way, way, way past time for us to do some pics.

698
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:05,240
I've never installed GNU slash Linux. Yeah. Well, if you do install GNU slash Linux, you need to install some apps.

699
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,880
You know, you want some stuff. You want some stuff on that Linux box.

700
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,800
And in the spirit of Westpain fixing our jblive.fm stream, fixing it up real good, too.

701
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,160
I'll say this real, real top, top grade work there, Mr. Westpain.

702
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,120
Tell the folks now what's so about the auto transitions and the high quality streams.

703
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,960
Just tell them a little bit. Oh, yeah. I mean, so before it was pretty slow when it did work.

704
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,560
It was pulling off something that had already been restreamed several times, then transcoded, then sent over to an ice cast server.

705
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:42,360
Now it's just a lot shittier. It's a lot faster. So it's got it's got push whenever anyone updates anything, whether we're streaming here on the studio,

706
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:48,120
maybe we're doing a live show from a conference somewhere or Alan's doing one of those crazy BSD now streams.

707
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,920
Doesn't matter. You can always find it or some reruns at jblive.fm.

708
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,440
Yeah. And so that plays right into our first pic. It's called Shortwave.

709
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:09,080
And it is a remake of a online radio stream player for the gnome desktop that is written in rust because got to rust all the things these days.

710
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,320
And you need you need your streaming player to be rock solid.

711
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:18,320
So you can pop jblive.fm in there. And yeah, they look at this.

712
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:24,320
They talk about this is what I'm talking about here, like right here in their FAQ for shortwave.

713
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:30,080
The question will shortwave be compatible with the Librem 5? Yes, exclamation mark.

714
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,720
You see what I'm saying? Like it's everywhere. It really is a buzz, man.

715
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:39,760
They have managed peak hype with that. I'm impressed. I don't think you could really expect more this day and age.

716
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:46,520
And now now something that may have felt a little bit like a hole in Firefox's heart.

717
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:52,200
The one thing that Chrome makes stupid easy. And if you've ever bought a Chromecast, you know what I'm about to say.

718
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:58,560
It's sending things to your television from Chrome. And it is more times than I'd like you.

719
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:04,600
Very, very useful. And it's one of the reasons I've kept Chrome installed on my machine.

720
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:09,200
That was until one of us can remember now who might have been me.

721
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,360
It was both of us. Was it that happens very frequently, you know?

722
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:19,720
And that's good. We have good coverage. And every now and then, very frequently, Wes will find things that I didn't find and I'll find things he didn't find.

723
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,360
And it's great. And this one is one that everybody should know about. It's called FX cast.

724
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,240
It's Chromecast for Firefox. It enables Chromecast support.

725
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,600
And you can cast things like Netflix or the BBC iPlayer, HTML5 video.

726
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,960
There's just one little thing you got to know. It's it's it's like a two parter.

727
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,080
It's an extension that connects to a software bridge that you have to install.

728
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:50,200
Now, they do make an RPM and a deb available, and it's all open source.

729
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:56,080
So you could probably build it. Oh, it's available for Macos, Macus.

730
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,800
That's one of those proprietary operating systems. I'm not sure if you're familiar.

731
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:03,400
And then, no, you cannot use it for Windows, which I don't know.

732
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:07,080
You can't. How can you run anything on Windows that goes in your house?

733
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,200
Yeah, OK. So they got it for Macos. Oh, geez, I did not mean to download that.

734
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,080
And they got it for Linux as a deb and RPM. And this is just a thing of beauty.

735
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,080
This is this has been a hole in my Firefox usage.

736
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,920
One of the things that's kept me going to Chrome from time to time.

737
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,000
And now it's here. And it's kind of nice. Did you have a chance to try it, Mr. West?

738
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,960
Oh, yeah, I tried it right after I first saw it, because I'm in the same position as I don't Chrome's fine.

739
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:38,360
I do use it for some things, but I love Firefox and I do and I use Firefox for most of my browsing.

740
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:43,240
But I watch a lot of content on the Chromecast just because I mean, like everything interrupts with it these days.

741
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,280
They've been around for so long. Most of my friends and family have Chromecast.

742
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,960
So it's just kind of ubiquitous. Unfortunately, FX cast and you should know this.

743
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:56,400
There's no public release yet. It's all just sort of pre-release beta version and is definitely a little buggy.

744
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,480
So I've only got it to work a couple of times. It's not it's not quite reliable.

745
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:09,320
It can find that their back end program, but the connections up to Firefox and getting it to work on on all the variety of sites that you might actually want to use it on.

746
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:15,440
Not quite there. So your mileage may vary, but that doesn't surprise me at all that it's still very early.

747
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:23,240
This is like their very first release. It's it's got a little while and there's probably some finessing to make that work pretty good.

748
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,000
But they're they're doing they're doing good work over there and it's really nice to see it.

749
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,600
Oh, yeah. And it's exciting. And, you know, as with so many of these projects, give it a little time to bake and soon you'll be relying on it.

750
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:40,800
Yeah, that's exactly how it works. OK. And then, you know, we all we're here we here at the Linux Unplugged program.

751
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,480
I'm just going to make this claim. We say it's OK to use the terminal.

752
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:53,240
The terminal doesn't have to be scary, especially when you can make a little more user friendly with things like the fish shell or nano.

753
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,840
Not Vim, but nano, which is the best text editor on Linux.

754
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,120
I mean, I'm just going to go with that. Don't don't even argue.

755
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:06,520
But what about what about what your face holes looking at? Wouldn't it be nice if you could make that a little more fun?

756
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,720
We've talked about this app once before and they just had a great release after a nice long while for many months.

757
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:21,000
Cool retro term one dot one dot one is out and it's combining two years of upstream Qt widget work.

758
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:30,040
So like things that just make the terminal look nicer and resize nicer, big performance improvements, lower resource consumption.

759
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,160
New shiny frame, literally a new shiny frame.

760
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:42,360
And they now support your system fonts and they make it all look like you're using a old CRT old style terminal.

761
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,640
You can you can actually there's all kinds of different looks you can play around with.

762
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,160
And there is also an app image available if you just want to get started.

763
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,920
And there is some Ubuntu packages in the works right now.

764
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,880
I think we should be clear. You know, these are the effects are really pretty astounding.

765
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,920
That's why I like it. I mean, I thought it would be a little too distracting to use for, you know, kind of all the time stuff or even just like regular work.

766
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,080
But no, it's so pretty. They've gone to a lot of work to make it really shine.

767
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:20,840
Yeah. And I maybe wouldn't use it for everything just because it's like you don't need something that's even eating, you know, a half of a percent more CPU usage than your terminal needs to be.

768
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,000
That's not what the job of the terminal is.

769
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,720
But like there is times where you just want your machine to look really bad ass and awesome.

770
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,800
And, you know, you bring this up and then you put H top on there and I can confirm that looks bad ass and awesome.

771
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:54,160
And there was there was times when I would swear I was looking at an old, old system that I used to have that would hook up to a monitor over coax and the image would look just like this retro term that did with a little bit of a little bit of that snow in the background, just a really light sort of wave that goes through it every now and then.

772
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,600
I mean, it just nails it. It's like when you smell something and it brings you back or you hear a song.

773
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,040
This was like one of those visual experiences for me. So I think it's a lot of fun.

774
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:14,840
We'll have it linked in the show notes. And if you've got if you've got a really good app pick, tweet it at us or go to Reddit dot com slash r slash Linux unplugged and submit it there because we try to keep the app picks up.

775
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,440
But we want we want high quality pics.

776
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:24,880
You know, we're not just trying to do low budge pics. We want high quality pics. So we don't always have the pics unless it's something that's that's sort of noteworthy.

777
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:33,640
We want, you know, well, only the good stuff. And speaking of the good stuff, go check out Choose Linux, the new show turned out really great.

778
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,880
First episode is out. Choose Linux dot show and go listen to episode one.

779
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,320
It started right at the beginning. It is pretty awesome.

780
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:50,720
Jason Evangelo from Forbes switched to Linux about six months ago, and he's just going through that that that new experience, that rush you get.

781
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,560
And he's extremely intelligent and he's very articulate.

782
00:56:53,560 --> 00:57:01,320
So it's a great experience and it's a great show because you have Jason who is going through this and it has that that that new love feel of everything.

783
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,560
And you have Joe, who's been a Linux user for a decade.

784
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,960
He's kind of been there seeing that and they really balance it out really well.

785
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,520
It's a clean format.

786
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,560
It's an easy listen and it's about 30 minutes and it's totally, totally worth checking out.

787
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,680
Choose Linux dot show. Go give that a play.

788
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,040
I think you're going to love it. We are. We are so excited.

789
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,280
If that wasn't enough, we have recently introduced a new full time co-host with Wes.

790
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:35,080
So Wes Payne does TechSnap. And Jim Salter, a writer from Ars Technica, has joined as Wes's co-host.

791
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:39,880
They've just put out their first episode over at TechSnap dot systems and it's great.

792
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,800
Like it's so and then it's just it's so good.

793
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,960
That's why it's going to be a really great Linux fest, Wes, because it's like things are happening at a level they've never happened before.

794
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,600
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's hard to keep up. It's just flying by.

795
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,400
There's so much stuff getting made all the time. It's true. That's true.

796
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,920
All right. Well, that will bring us to an end.

797
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,200
The Ubuntu podcast is on season break. Will they come back?

798
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,400
We don't know. But in the meantime, you can go check out their back catalog at Ubuntu podcast dot org.

799
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,200
I have a little exclusive about the Ubuntu podcast.

800
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,440
Oh, go on. There will be a short podcast released this Thursday.

801
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,560
So what I should do is I should go subscribe.

802
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,680
So that way when it's out, I have it immediately. That's what I should do.

803
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,200
Yeah, it's an exciting announcement.

804
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:30,760
So, yeah, everyone needs to subscribe to the Ubuntu podcast to hear the short episode, which is being published on Thursday.

805
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,040
There you go. Very good.

806
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,080
Hot tip. Hot tip right there for Mr.

807
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:39,680
Martin Wimpress, one of three presenters on the Ubuntu podcast.

808
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:48,960
And I will have links to El's social media profile information and the blog posts that cover the content that we're releasing now in February,

809
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:55,320
as well as the study group voting sheet where you can vote on the next study group.

810
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,360
These study groups are kind of a work in progress.

811
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:06,840
If next Tuesday on the fifth, if that turns out to be well attended and well liked and we get a decent amount of votes on future study group topics,

812
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,520
we'll start scheduling these maybe on a monthly or more basis.

813
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:17,240
We're just going to kind of gauge what the audience interest is and then we'll we'll kind of build it out from there.

814
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:25,800
So I'm pretty interested to see where this goes because we have a lot of source material to work with and it's really kind of nice because you could show up.

815
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:32,920
I mean, I would love it if you showed up for Linux unplugged, just hung out with us in the mumble room or in the chat room and watch the stream and enjoy the show

816
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,560
and hang around for the study group and learn some yaml basics.

817
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,840
It's just I think so awesome. I think it's an awesome opportunity and I'd love to see more of it.

818
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,800
So I hope you guys love it and I hope you can make it next Tuesday.

819
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:51,000
You can go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar to get the start of the show times converted to your local time zone.

820
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:58,680
If you want to ask questions in the IRC, we will have that going IRC dot Geek Shed dot net pound Jupiter broadcasting to get in that room.

821
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,480
The live video stream will be at JBLive dot TV.

822
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,720
And if you want to join the mumble room, just Google search Jupiter colony mumble.

823
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,880
And there is a setup guide right there that you can follow to get in that mumble room.

824
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,520
We'll do an audio check to make sure you're using push to talk.

825
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,000
You have headphones and we can hear you. OK.

826
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,960
And you pass those checks and you are in our virtual lug.

827
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,160
Wherever you are in the world, you can be part of a lug.

828
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,400
And we have literally people from all over the world in there.

829
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,840
And you can be part of that. And now you can also learn with us, too.

830
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,760
All right, Mr. Payne, I think that just about checks all the boxes for this week's episode.

831
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,840
What do you say we get out of here? Are you ready to conclude?

832
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,400
We managed to do it. There was so much content and I didn't think we would.

833
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,760
We've got Elle now. Maybe she can help us get out of here.

834
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,760
Yeah. Why don't you say see you next Tuesday.

835
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,800
All right, guys, I guess I'll see you next Tuesday.

836
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,160
Boom. That's nice.

837
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,520
Couldn't have done it better ourselves. Yeah. Yeah.

838
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,480
I mean, she might not be here. She can.

839
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,440
She's welcome. But we will.

840
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,840
In fact, I think I will be on the road back to Washington by the next episode.

841
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,960
That's going to be pretty crazy. I'll be attempting to pull that off from the road.

842
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,840
Although at this point, the RV is basically a mobile studio.

843
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,200
So I should be able to manage that. It should be a successful broadcast.

844
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,360
Tune in next week to find out how good his LTE signal might be.

845
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:21,600
Yeah, if you can pull it off. Thank you very much for tuning this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

846
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:51,520
And like Elle just said, we'll see you next Tuesday.

847
01:01:51,600 --> 01:02:02,240
All right, I already know what title I like.

848
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,160
I've already I've already iced by the title that I think I want to go with.

849
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,640
Thank you, everybody. No way. No. Yeah.

850
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,040
Yeah. You know which one it is, too.

851
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,360
Elle, yeah, I was thinking I was thinking like I didn't mean to like say you had to be on the show,

852
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,320
but then I realized we are you are going to see them next Tuesday because it's the study group.

853
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,920
So that's happening. Yeah. That's what I thought you were referring to.

854
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,960
I was like, I'll be here. I'm slow. I'm slow to my own to my own my own schemes, I suppose.

855
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,320
It takes me a little while. You get there eventually. Yeah.

856
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,320
I mean, Wes can teach him YAML, I'm sure. Do you have any YAML skills?

857
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:34,160
I mean, how do you how do you avoid YAML? Like you said, you can't.

858
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:39,040
Of course, everyone has YAML skills. It's like essential for creating snaps.

859
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:43,520
Therefore, everyone knows YAML. You know, that was part of what played into the decision.

860
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,760
I was like, you know, this is something that's happening more and more.

861
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,200
Snaps are using YAML files. Yeah, let's do YAML essentials. Wise.

862
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,480
I think really Wes probably has, you know, like one of the things that Wes doesn't really share much on air

863
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,800
because it doesn't really come up topically is that he's a pretty big math nerd.

864
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,080
He's also quite a reader. Most I mean, you're would you say voracious is overstating it, Wes?

865
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,920
But you're a pretty consistent reader, too. Oh, yeah, of course. It's a big part of my life.

866
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,520
Yeah. These things Wes never talks about and we never get a chance.

867
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,520
That's why I need to have a show every now and then where we just talk about absolutely nothing and nobody would listen.

868
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,360
But we would at least get it out there on the record.

869
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:24,200
JB radio hour. Yeah. Mr. Wimpris, it's been a little while since we've got an update on the hardware situation.

870
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,000
Any any new changes on the workstation front?

871
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:35,600
I have hand built my own desktop workstation for the first time in 15 years over Christmas and New Year.

872
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,760
What made you decide to hand build? Because I mean, as you know, tons of pre-built systems pretty solid these days.

873
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:46,240
We going for something special? Well, you know, I've been doing the whole NUC thing, an external GPU thing.

874
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:54,080
And I was curious. I wondered how much performance I was giving away by going with a small form factor.

875
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,800
And there's lots of interesting technology around at the moment around the PC space.

876
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,120
And I thought, you know, it's time I refresh my skills and build a PC from scratch.

877
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:10,000
Yeah. And budget plays a part in this because, you know, I did look at pre-built systems.

878
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,160
I was really taken by the Corsair one. But then when you go and look at what you can build yourself,

879
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:22,560
then it gets a whole lot cheaper really fast. So that's true. I decided to build it myself.

880
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:29,200
So what did you build? Well, it's based around an i9 9900k CPU. Oh, all right.

881
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,920
And I've gone with a gigabyte Designair motherboard,

882
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,680
which has a couple of interesting properties that I found appealing.

883
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:47,840
Oh, yeah. Such as? The two NVMe slots on it, the M.2 slots are directly connected to lanes on the

884
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:54,960
CPU. They don't go through the PCH chipset. So they're super fast. Yeah, that's great.

885
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:03,040
Yeah. So, yeah, all the storage is fast lined. And this particular motherboard has full blooded

886
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:08,800
Thunderbolt ports on it. So I don't have to give up on my external GPU dream,

887
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:13,520
which sounds a bit strange, you know, because I've got a desktop and I've got the GPU on the

888
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:23,120
board. But for the first time, I can do objective comparisons of the same GPU in the same computer on

889
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:29,360
the PCI Express bus internally and in an external enclosure and actually accurately measure

890
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:38,000
what the performance cost is. So I'm gonna I'm gonna have some fun, you know, playing with that.

891
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,720
But yeah, I've water cooled this one and I've been doing a bit of overclocking for fun and lulls.

892
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,280
Making us drool.

893
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:54,640
You went the whole water cooling overclocking route and stability has been good. It must have

894
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,440
been a bit of finessing to get it right. Actually, I was dead surprised. I put it all together and

895
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,400
because of the build and, you know, water cooling and what have you, I kind of had to assemble the

896
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:10,640
whole thing and then turn it on and it worked first time. And turns out overclocking on Linux

897
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:18,720
is way, way easier than overclocking on Windows. So with not messing with the BIOS at all,

898
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,920
you just switch the performance governor on and immediately you get five gigahertz all core turbo

899
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:34,960
with no messing about. So it was really easy to get loads of performance off the off the CPU.

900
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,200
And I've been overclocking the GPU as well. So I've been playing around with overclocking

901
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:45,200
Nvidia GPUs on on Linux. That does sound like a good use of holiday time.

902
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:52,080
Yes, lots of fun. Yeah, that's nice. So how much storage total did you end up in the system?

903
01:06:52,080 --> 01:07:00,640
I've got two and a half terabytes of NVMe. I've got a one terabyte, two and a half inch SSD

904
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:08,560
and six terabytes of spinning rust. And so did you take the GPU? Is that the main GPU from the

905
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,240
enclosure for the Thunderbolt, the Thunderbolt enclosure? And did you put that in the workstation

906
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,800
case for now or what are you doing? Okay. Yeah. So I took the 1080 TI out of one of the enclosures

907
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:26,240
and that's inside this chassis. The Vega 56 is still in one of the external enclosures so I can

908
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:34,880
still tinker with that. But I'm going to get a 2080 TI soon so I can do some testing with that.

909
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,000
Well, I can't wait to hear how that goes. That's great.

910
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,120
Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I'm in full PC enthusiast mode at the moment. I'm having lots of fun tinkering

911
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:50,400
with stuff and even overclocking the memory and all that sort of thing, which doesn't get you all

912
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,840
that much gain, but it's fun to tinker with. Any stability issues or anything like that?

913
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:03,440
No, it's been rock solid. So I obviously run it without all of the performance tuning as my day

914
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:11,920
to day workstation, although I have got a permanent overclock. So the CPU will boost to 4.3 gigahertz

915
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:18,720
by default and I've changed that in the BIOS to go to 4.7. So that's a 4.7 default boost.

916
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:28,000
And then I've just got a little toggle in my panel to turn on performance mode, which ramps up

917
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,480
the GPU and the CPU overclock. And that's enough to make a considerable difference.

918
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,520
I've managed to get my 1080 TI performing just shy of what a 2080 can do.

919
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,080
Get it out of here.
