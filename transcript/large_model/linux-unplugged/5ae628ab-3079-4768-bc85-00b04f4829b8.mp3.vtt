00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 47 for July 1st, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.840
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's got all its updates applied

00:40.840 --> 00:43.800
as it prepares to go offline and live in a cabin.

00:43.800 --> 00:45.240
My name is Chris.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
My name is Matt.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.240
Hey Matt.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.160
It is hot here now.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.720
It's maybe not hot by like everybody's standards, but it's hot enough that we've got a brushfire

00:53.720 --> 00:54.720
nearby.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.720
I mean, that's hot, right?

00:55.720 --> 00:58.720
Yeah, it's about 87 degrees in the studio today.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.440
So it gets, and it gets wet.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.560
It's like a wet hot, Matt.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.580
It's like a humid kind of hot.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.920
That's what makes it so miserable.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.560
And of course I made my own predicament worse because I was barbecuing today.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.780
So we had to close up all the windows in the studio because I didn't want to make the studio

01:12.780 --> 01:14.960
smell like barbecue smoke.

01:14.960 --> 01:15.960
And it was delicious.

01:15.960 --> 01:16.960
I'm not going to lie.

01:16.960 --> 01:21.760
It turned out, Rekai gave me like, here is a bag full of burgers that I made.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.000
Why don't you cook them all?

01:23.000 --> 01:26.780
It was like, he threw down the gauntlet and I'm like, I'm going to cook all these burgers

01:26.780 --> 01:28.580
before Linux Unplugged.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.580
And I did it.

01:29.580 --> 01:30.580
And it was delicious.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.080
And we had copious amounts of bacon.

01:32.080 --> 01:35.600
And I made, I took some of the, this is kind of gross, but I took some of the bacon grease

01:35.600 --> 01:36.600
sauce.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.000
I took some of the, and made a sauce out of it with the barbecue.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
It was just, it was just amazing all around, Matt.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
That's all I'm trying to say.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Oh my goodness.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
So we got.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, I kind of lucked out.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I pretty cool, pretty cool office.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh, nice.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Starting the show.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
But it's still kind of warm.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
So we got to just persevere.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.480
I'm glad you took, I'm glad you took a wise precautions.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.920
I, on the other hand, was not so wise.

01:54.920 --> 01:55.920
But that's okay.

01:55.920 --> 01:56.920
We've got a good show.

01:56.920 --> 02:00.240
We're going to follow up first and then we're going to cover a couple of items, a few updates

02:00.240 --> 02:04.080
on some big news that's happened on stories that we've covered recently.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.280
And then after that, we're going to announce a new community, we're going to call it the

02:08.280 --> 02:13.220
Jupiter Colony Review Draft, where we're looking to expand our distribution reviews and cover

02:13.220 --> 02:14.220
more distributions.

02:14.220 --> 02:17.480
And we want to collate a group of folks out there that would like to get involved in reviewing

02:17.480 --> 02:21.480
a distribution and perhaps come on our show via mumble and share their thoughts.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.960
Now this isn't going to be necessarily an easy job because you're going to have to download

02:23.960 --> 02:26.680
the distribution, try it out and note down your thoughts.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.100
And then work with our team.

02:28.100 --> 02:31.080
But we want to expand the distributions that we're able to cover.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.320
And so we're going to talk more about that in today's show, including where you can sign

02:34.320 --> 02:37.880
up and draft yourself to be in our Jupiter Colony Review panel.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.720
We're going to talk about that a little bit.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.420
But first, Matt, this is something that's been kicking around.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.520
We talk about this a lot on the live stream.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.200
We haven't talked a lot about it in a show for a while, but the audience might be familiar

02:49.200 --> 02:52.880
that you and I have struggled with audio issues under KDE.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.600
It's been a struggle to being calm.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.240
Oh, yeah, that's that's being kind.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.640
Yeah, you're right.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.520
It's inexcusable because it's not just like one particular hardware setup.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.800
It's multiple hardware setups.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
Right.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.800
Come on.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.160
And I got to and I want to qualify that I want to completely back that statement up

03:08.160 --> 03:13.560
to because I've tried it on multiple systems with USB sound cards, on board sound cards,

03:13.560 --> 03:19.760
HDMI sound cards, you name it, different machines with NVIDIA, ATI, Intel, all the all the whole

03:19.760 --> 03:22.880
stack has been laptops, desktops, all of it.

03:22.880 --> 03:26.280
And I've had issues with switching my audio settings and things like that.

03:26.280 --> 03:31.040
So WiggleWaffles wrote into the subreddit and said, in previous installs of KDE, I haven't

03:31.040 --> 03:33.800
really had any troubles with phonon, especially running it on a VM.

03:33.800 --> 03:38.480
But since I dedicated to switching from dual booting with Arch and Windows 8 instead of

03:38.480 --> 03:42.280
running Arch in a VM, sound on KDE has been a nightmare.

03:42.280 --> 03:45.640
It works in the most basic sense of the term, but hooking up headphones is spotty.

03:45.640 --> 03:49.560
The volume buttons on the keyboard adjust the HDMI audio even when it's not plugged

03:49.560 --> 03:50.560
in.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.960
And it's reset to 100 percent every time I reboot, blowing out my eardrums whenever

03:53.960 --> 03:55.600
I get an error message.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.360
And then he goes on to ask if there's a way to overcome this.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.200
And then the discussions didn't go the way they usually go.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.600
Usually I see a ton of people saying, well, I run KDE and I never have a problem.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.000
And then I just kind of check out because I'm like, OK, well, I know I've had it on

04:09.000 --> 04:11.600
like a dozen systems, I've had these problems.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.000
But actually, just about everybody in here sort of chimed in and said, yeah, I've had

04:15.000 --> 04:20.480
some problems, definitely had some problems, you know, it's really bad, et cetera, et cetera.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.740
There's something going on.

04:21.740 --> 04:22.740
There's something going on.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.720
I don't know if it's the way Phonon interacts with Pulse Audio.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.720
I don't know.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.840
It's exactly what it is, in my opinion, based on my experiences with it and actually experimenting

04:28.840 --> 04:31.560
with it and just kind of troubleshooting, looking through the logs.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.600
That's where the hang up is.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.700
It's a one or it's either one or the other.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.600
You don't do both, in my opinion.

04:36.600 --> 04:42.060
OK, I have a suggestion because we can we can have a religious war about this or maybe

04:42.060 --> 04:46.440
as a community, we could create a database of the hardware that people are trying it

04:46.440 --> 04:51.960
on and the distributions and the versions of like Pulse and KDE and maybe we could come

04:51.960 --> 04:56.600
up with some common threads and then as a group, we'd have something we could submit

04:56.600 --> 05:02.160
as a bug report to the KDE folks so they could work on it.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.160
Sounds interesting.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.540
So I don't know if people in the subreddit would be interested in that.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.560
Maybe we could work together and all sort of come together and try to narrow this thing

05:08.560 --> 05:13.680
down and submit a bug and maybe we can fix this for other people because it's it's one

05:13.680 --> 05:18.000
of these functionalities that when it doesn't work, it's infuriating.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.400
It made me so frustrated because I got a new machine set up.

05:20.400 --> 05:25.620
I got a brand new steam game and all I wanted to do was set my audio out to my speakers

05:25.620 --> 05:29.600
and I probably spent two hours trying to make that work and I eventually gave up and it

05:29.600 --> 05:31.840
made me just sit there and think, you know, why did I just do that?

05:31.840 --> 05:35.240
I felt like I just wasted two hours of my life on something that shouldn't be a problem

05:35.240 --> 05:36.240
at all.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.900
And I think a lot of people have that experience and it can be very frustrating and it's something

05:38.900 --> 05:43.280
I think if we all work together, instead of just banging our table about how upset it

05:43.280 --> 05:48.400
makes us, maybe we can, as a group, figure out some commonalities.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Like something like that.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.400
What do you think?

05:50.400 --> 05:51.400
Yeah, it sounds interesting.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.400
Worth a try?

05:52.400 --> 05:53.400
Yeah, I think it's worth a try.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.400
I'm skeptical.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.400
I'm really skeptical.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.760
It's because I, every time it's ever been brought up, it's always been, well, it's just

05:59.760 --> 06:00.760
not an issue.

06:00.760 --> 06:06.040
And if we can get past that and we can get something legitimate out there, then I'll

06:06.040 --> 06:08.720
be able to stand behind it and say, okay, that's cool, let's evaluate.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.880
That's why I'm thinking those of us that acknowledge it's a problem, we band together and figure

06:12.880 --> 06:13.880
out what it is.

06:13.880 --> 06:18.160
Because it seems like there's so many moving layers and it could even be versions of things

06:18.160 --> 06:19.160
that make a difference.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
Yeah.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.400
I don't know, maybe it's more pronounced on Arch.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.400
Who knows?

06:23.400 --> 06:24.400
While we're...

06:24.400 --> 06:25.400
Possible.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.600
Let's shift gears.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.000
Let's talk about KD a little more in the context of Mint 17, they just had the new release.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.040
And producer of the show, Eric, has been trying out Mint 17 for a little while now and he's

06:36.040 --> 06:40.560
kind of gone in and made us really kind of finely tune it to the way he likes it.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.680
So Eric, what has been your impressions of using Mint now for a little while and what

06:43.680 --> 06:45.480
was the first thing you had to change?

06:45.480 --> 06:50.880
Well, I kind of went through it and the first thing I changed was the theme.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.960
For some reason, the error theme for me is just way too bright.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.960
So I changed it to one that you can download straight from the Get New Themes button called

06:57.960 --> 07:04.920
AMAKAGE, wherever you pronounce that, I don't know.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.480
So I've got that and then I got rid of oxygen.

07:08.480 --> 07:15.360
The way I did that was I changed my widget style to Qt Curve and then I was able to install

07:15.360 --> 07:22.040
on top of that, there's a Zekitwo, or Zekitwo, however you pronounce it.

07:22.040 --> 07:26.800
I was able to download that and make that a theme for Qt Curve.

07:26.800 --> 07:34.520
And on top of that, because Zekitwo, wherever it is pronounced it, it is available for GTK3

07:34.520 --> 07:37.520
as well and GTK2.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.720
So you get sort of the benefit of like the same benefit you get if you're using oxygen

07:40.720 --> 07:42.960
only you can use the theme you want.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
Correct.

07:43.960 --> 07:44.960
Yeah, exactly.

07:44.960 --> 07:49.000
And it gets rid of that glow that people are so upset about.

07:49.000 --> 07:55.280
And not only that, but I have not, at least in this KDE setup, experienced the audio issues

07:55.280 --> 07:57.760
that are prevalent in the Arch KDE setup.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.520
I don't know what it is about that setup.

07:59.520 --> 08:04.080
So you've had issues on the same machine and then you've loaded Mint and haven't had issues?

08:04.080 --> 08:05.080
Correct.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.920
I don't know how that is.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.480
It's got something to do with the phonon and pulse audio implementation, but it's got to

08:10.480 --> 08:12.440
be something with that.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.440
Hmm.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
Hmm.

08:14.440 --> 08:17.200
That sounds like something that needs to be a little investigated into.

08:17.200 --> 08:21.040
So overall, toolset, performance-wise, you like it?

08:21.040 --> 08:22.600
You think you're going to stay here for a while?

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
I think I might stay with it.

08:23.600 --> 08:28.760
And the reason being is that I have actually run it up against Kubuntu.

08:28.760 --> 08:33.660
And with Kubuntu, I don't know what the problem is there, but it just seems sluggish.

08:33.660 --> 08:37.600
Like if I go to open the system settings, Mint KDE, I don't have that problem.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.400
It just pops up right away and I was actually blown away by that.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
So I don't know what they've been doing.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.680
That'll be because we're sending all your data to Amazon.

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
That's what it is.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
Hey-oh.

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
I'm not talking about the Ubuntu.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
I'm not talking about the Unity desktop.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.680
I'm talking about the KDE implementation, Kubuntu.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.680
Kubuntu.

08:51.680 --> 08:52.680
Yeah.

08:52.680 --> 08:53.680
I was trying to be funny.

08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
Yeah.

08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
Oh, okay.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.880
Popey, any thoughts you want to share with the crowd on KDE from your end?

08:57.880 --> 08:58.880
I know you've been playing with it recently.

08:58.880 --> 08:59.880
Oh, man.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.880
Why did you set me up like that?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.600
I'm just curious.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.200
I think KDE is a great desktop.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.200
I just have sound problems.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.720
Honestly, KDE and Bay can go very well together.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
I got to say that.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.720
Yeah.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.720
Nice.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.720
Nice.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.720
I know KDE.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.280
I mean, Popey, that might not be a fair question because you're obviously a Unity guy, I'm

09:16.280 --> 09:17.280
sure.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.280
I'll bash it.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.280
It's okay.

09:19.280 --> 09:25.720
Well, you know, I use lots of different desktops and I've tried KDE in the past, the distant

09:25.720 --> 09:28.680
past, and I've tried it recently this week.

09:28.680 --> 09:35.840
And I find it incredibly painful to use and verbose and far too many settings and the

09:35.840 --> 09:44.680
layout of the UI is unbelievably painful with like bits scattered all over the screen and

09:44.680 --> 09:46.680
weird dialogues.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.040
I find it a horrible mess.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.320
Now, let me ask you, though, would you be willing to...

09:52.320 --> 09:56.480
Oh, somebody has open mic, hot mic, close your mic, there we go.

09:56.480 --> 10:02.320
Would you be willing to, you know, entertain the idea of you're just coming at it from

10:02.320 --> 10:03.320
a different angle?

10:03.320 --> 10:06.600
Like you come at it with a different set of expectations of what a desktop should be.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.160
So these things that don't meet that set of expectations really stand out at you.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.160
But if somebody else came at it with a different set of expectations, those things would be

10:14.160 --> 10:16.440
expected and they'd be missed if they weren't there.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.440
What do you think of that?

10:17.440 --> 10:18.440
Yeah, probably.

10:18.440 --> 10:23.600
I think if your expectations were, I'm a deeply technical user and I want to have absolute

10:23.600 --> 10:29.320
control over every single pixel on my display and I want to be able to fiddle with every

10:29.320 --> 10:33.200
possible setting that there is, sure, it's there for you.

10:33.200 --> 10:38.840
But if you're someone who wants to turn the computer on and use it, I find it obtuse.

10:38.840 --> 10:45.280
It just gets in the way and I was surprised how hard it was for me to find applications,

10:45.280 --> 10:55.840
download updates, I just found it really got in the way and that's from someone who uses

10:55.840 --> 11:00.840
Unity where everyone tells me that gets in the way of your workflow and it's hard to

11:00.840 --> 11:01.840
use.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.840
I'm lost for words.

11:02.840 --> 11:03.840
Okay.

11:03.840 --> 11:09.600
See, I like Unity too and I just like this also.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.600
Honestly, I'm the type of person who cannot decide between a desktop environment.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.600
I'm a total desktop.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.600
Because I like them all.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
I'm such a desktop hooker.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.600
It's crazy.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
Yeah, me too.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.200
I'll load up Cinnamon for a couple of days and be like, this is it.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.240
This is the perfect blend of classic and modern.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.440
And then I'll be like, in Nome, I'll be like, oh, I'm in the future and it's finally working.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
It's here.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.640
And then I'm in KD and I'm like, I can do anything I want.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.120
What is wrong with you people?

11:32.120 --> 11:36.340
Why don't you just install iOS and just leave it alone?

11:36.340 --> 11:37.340
It's a sickness, man.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.540
Just get on and do your work.

11:39.540 --> 11:40.760
Maybe there's a medication for it.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.760
It's like some sort of OCD.

11:41.760 --> 11:42.760
I don't know.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.760
It's weird.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.760
I don't know myself.

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
I'm compelled.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.920
Although I do find myself in Nome pretty much all the time right now.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.800
That's what my main DE is.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.380
And the thing I love about Nome is I have several different machines with different

11:55.380 --> 12:00.240
monitor sizes and I think Nome works great on my big 28-inch monitor and a 30-inch monitor

12:00.240 --> 12:01.240
that I have.

12:01.240 --> 12:04.880
I have one of those cinema displays that I bought used that Nome rocks that.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.040
And then I've got a 14-inch screen that I've got Nome on and it rocks that too.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.920
I mean, they all do good in that regard, but I just found that particularly works pretty

12:11.920 --> 12:12.920
well.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.920
I'm sorry.

12:13.920 --> 12:14.920
I cut somebody off.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.920
Did somebody want to add something before we move on?

12:15.920 --> 12:16.920
Yeah.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.240
I just wanted to say that I like KDE's functionality.

12:19.240 --> 12:24.080
It's got a lot of awesome technical features like KDE Connect and the widgets and all these

12:24.080 --> 12:25.080
things.

12:25.080 --> 12:29.040
And it's so cool as far as functionality, but it looks awful.

12:29.040 --> 12:33.320
Well, and I'm going to close the screenshots then and show you what I've got.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.320
Yeah.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.320
If you've got them handy, yeah.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.320
If the...

12:36.320 --> 12:40.200
Like what you said, I completely understand that how you could make KDE look good and

12:40.200 --> 12:41.280
it's possible.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.280
You just remove oxygen completely and it's fine.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.560
Oxygen is hideous, but also there's a few things that I don't like about the configuration.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.760
It's confusing.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.440
You can configure everything, but you can start a configuration and then right click

12:54.440 --> 12:57.280
something in that and there's another configuration on top of it.

12:57.280 --> 13:00.640
Well, they've explained the logic behind that, but yeah, I think it's like, well, people

13:00.640 --> 13:03.160
expect it in both places, so we put it in both places.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.160
I agree.

13:04.160 --> 13:08.760
And I am watching the Plasma Next and Plasma 5 stuff to see like, what are they doing there?

13:08.760 --> 13:11.840
Because Jen's in his team, like, what is their vision?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.000
And I like where they're going with it.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.920
I still, I think it's going to take, I think the next version of KDE is going to come out

13:17.920 --> 13:18.920
in a big way.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.400
They're going to try to keep it the same so that way they don't disrupt the Apple cart,

13:21.400 --> 13:22.400
right?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
They don't tip whatever the saying is.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.280
But I wouldn't be surprised if once this next version of KDE is out and they consider it

13:27.280 --> 13:31.360
sort of stabilized, if that's when they really start iterating on some of the more rougher

13:31.360 --> 13:32.360
edges I think.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.360
I think it's going to be a little bit.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.360
You know what they could do?

13:34.360 --> 13:35.360
They could add more options.

13:35.360 --> 13:41.800
Yes, I can understand, I can understand why, you know, people use various desktops.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.560
I can see why people use Gnome, Gnome Shell.

13:45.560 --> 13:52.680
I can see why people like Elementary and Mate and Cinnamon.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.800
The one that I just can't fathom is KDE.

13:55.800 --> 14:02.880
I just can't figure out what psychology brings people to use KDE on a daily basis and like

14:02.880 --> 14:03.880
it.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.040
I mean, it's unfathomable.

14:07.040 --> 14:12.540
Maybe you'll change your mind once all the Ubuntu apps are written in Qt and you're looking

14:12.540 --> 14:15.280
for something that's a really solid Qt-based desktop.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.720
Oh, I see what you've done there.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.720
No, no, no, no.

14:19.720 --> 14:24.280
KDE not equal to Qt, Qt not equal to KDE.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
I do, I do.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.280
All right.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
Well, look.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.280
You trolley monster.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.280
I'm sorry.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.280
I'm sorry.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.280
Look, before we move on, I should probably thank our first sponsor.

14:31.280 --> 14:37.840
I wanted to talk about, did you guys hear there's huge, huge, huge news for CoreOS?

14:37.840 --> 14:38.840
Huge news.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.080
Like we were just, it's probably because they were on our show.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.480
That's the only thing I can figure.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.560
It's gotta be because they're on our show, but I don't know.

14:45.560 --> 14:48.640
But first, let's take a little break and thank our first sponsor this week and that is the

14:48.640 --> 14:50.440
great folks over at DigitalOcean.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.040
Now, what the heck is DigitalOcean, my friends?

14:53.040 --> 14:57.480
I will tell you DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive

14:57.480 --> 14:59.880
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

14:59.880 --> 15:04.280
And most of you guys could probably get started in about 55 seconds, but if you're a pro and

15:04.280 --> 15:07.480
I'm not trying to challenge you, I'm not trying to say, hey, it's the 4th of July, go have

15:07.480 --> 15:11.000
a few drinks and then go spin up as many droplets as you can as fast as possible.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.420
But if you were to infer that from this spot, I would understand.

15:14.420 --> 15:18.440
But most people create a droplet in about 55 seconds and pricing plans start only $5

15:18.440 --> 15:19.440
per month.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.400
And that's what I've been using for months and months and months now.

15:22.400 --> 15:28.840
And here's what you get for $5 a month, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one blazing

15:28.840 --> 15:32.080
fast CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.920
And DigitalOcean has data center locations all around the world, New York, San Francisco,

15:35.920 --> 15:41.040
Singapore and Amsterdam, tier one bandwidth in those locations and amazing hardware providers.

15:41.040 --> 15:46.120
All of this connected to SSD drives running on top of KVM with their incredible control

15:46.120 --> 15:47.120
panel.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.460
Their interface is simple.

15:48.460 --> 15:52.200
Their control panel has got to be one of the most intuitive experiences I've ever used.

15:52.200 --> 15:56.960
And the best part is, is power users can really get at that with their straightforward API.

15:56.960 --> 16:00.240
And they have a great development community and there's tutorials that help you get set

16:00.240 --> 16:04.360
up with things like GitLab and there's one click deployment for a lot of great applications

16:04.360 --> 16:07.080
that I know our community uses the heck out of.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.300
You can create a droplet in less than a minute.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.300
You can do backups.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.680
You can do transfers.

16:11.680 --> 16:16.200
You can set up the perfect Linux server and then template that and then deploy that Linux

16:16.200 --> 16:18.960
server whenever you need it again.

16:18.960 --> 16:22.000
And DigitalOcean has hourly pricing, so if you want to take advantage of our special

16:22.000 --> 16:26.300
promo code, you can get a $10 credit or use that for the hourly pricing.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.680
Use the promo code.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.520
Now it's probably going to be changing because it's July now.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.800
I haven't gotten the official new one, but it'll probably be Unplugged July.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.280
If I was a gambling man, I would say Unplugged July.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.680
Unplugged June will still work too, of course, if you're listening to this right as we're

16:38.680 --> 16:39.680
changing over.

16:39.680 --> 16:41.280
But use the promo code Unplugged July.

16:41.280 --> 16:45.160
That lets them know that you appreciate them supporting the Linux Unplugged show.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.960
You want them to keep sponsoring.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.560
That way that keeps us on the air, but it also gets you that $10 credit so you can try

16:50.560 --> 16:53.880
out what I've been talking about for so long now and see how amazing it is to get your

16:53.880 --> 16:57.240
own server that you have root control over up in the cloud connected to tier one bandwidth

16:57.240 --> 17:00.000
sitting on top of SSD drives powered by KVM.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.840
I mean really, DigitalOcean.com, and a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

17:04.840 --> 17:05.840
Linux Unplugged.

17:05.840 --> 17:10.040
I tell you what, Matt, I'm starting to feel a little bit like I have short timers.

17:10.040 --> 17:14.400
Even though I'm only going to a cabin for two nights, as soon as this show's done, I'm

17:14.400 --> 17:15.400
hitting the road.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.400
I'm out of here.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
I'm going.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.400
You're packed.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.400
You're like Fred Flintstone going down the road.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.400
Totally.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.400
Totally.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
Okay.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
Check out the great news for CoreOS.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.520
They just got eight million dollars in funding.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.040
Eight million dollars.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.560
So CoreOS, you guys know, we've just had them recently on the show.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.180
We did a review of it as well.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.920
They're the company that makes this, well now they're a company, that makes a scalable

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
version of Linux custom tailored for servers.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.060
They just raised eight million dollars in a Series A funding round.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.920
It's now offering support services for companies.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.120
That's going to be their business model.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.400
They call it a new commercial help service called CoreOS Managed Linux, which the company

17:49.400 --> 17:55.920
describes as an OS as a service offering and they provide organizations with constant patches

17:55.920 --> 17:59.720
and updates in case they don't want the responsibility, so they're going to manage that for you.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.800
Sounds familiar.

18:01.800 --> 18:06.920
And they're promising to help reduce the admin work for people deploying CoreOS.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.920
The monthly charge will range from anywhere, forget this.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.880
This is for companies that have big deployments.

18:12.880 --> 18:17.160
Monthly charge ranges anywhere from a thousand to a hundred thousand dollars.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.160
Wow.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.640
For monthly.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.920
That's a good business.

18:21.920 --> 18:27.040
And so when Pulvey was asked about like who's your competitor here because this has got

18:27.040 --> 18:30.040
to be a hot space, he says well one of them for sure is Red Hat.

18:30.040 --> 18:35.920
Red Hat's project Atomic is a direct response to CoreOS he said.

18:35.920 --> 18:40.120
And of course CoreOS relies heavily on Docker who's been working closely with Red Hat.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.600
And of course Ubuntu and others too.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.360
Huge news for CoreOS though, huge.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.280
Eight million dollars for a Linux distro?

18:46.280 --> 18:49.120
It's got to be because we just had them on the show, right?

18:49.120 --> 18:50.120
Absolutely.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.120
Clearly.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.840
The last bump.

18:54.840 --> 18:55.840
It was totally.

18:55.840 --> 18:56.840
Yeah.

18:56.840 --> 19:00.600
Oh you know what, hey here's another last bump.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.280
I'm kidding of course but the creator project announced that they just didn't really announce

19:04.280 --> 19:05.280
it.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.280
They just reached their funding.

19:06.280 --> 19:12.160
This is the really nice, really nice illustrator program for that KDE desktop that Pulvey loves

19:12.160 --> 19:13.160
so much.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.720
They just reached their goal of $15,000 in funding and they still have eight days to

19:17.720 --> 19:18.720
go too.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.640
So now if you want to back a winner you can.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.500
And this is really one of the greatest open source desktop applications out there for

19:24.500 --> 19:27.160
people who are artsy fartsy.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.720
And yeah there's GIMP and yeah there's Inkscape.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.480
This is something unique, something different.

19:31.480 --> 19:32.720
And congratulations to them.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.440
Again the last bump I'm sure, I'm sure.

19:35.440 --> 19:40.760
And responding to pressure from the Linux action show OwnCloud 7 we've gotten more details

19:40.760 --> 19:41.960
on the server to server syncing.

19:41.960 --> 19:47.000
I remember I said on last, I'd love to get more details on how OwnCloud 7 is doing the

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
server to server syncing.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.360
We got some details.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.680
So I thought I'd give you guys an update on that too because to me this is the coolest

19:52.680 --> 19:54.240
feature of OwnCloud 7.

19:54.240 --> 19:58.240
So the server to server sharing allows you to mount a share from another OwnCloud instance

19:58.240 --> 20:06.240
and seamlessly collaborate on shared files from within each of your own OwnCloud instances.

20:06.240 --> 20:10.320
Essentially combining your private clouds into one single public cloud between you two.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.800
You can even have the folder locally synced to a client like through the OwnCloud client

20:14.800 --> 20:15.800
sync.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.720
No need to create accounts on your other instances.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.260
Just once it's all shared up you can connect to each other's own cloud.

20:21.260 --> 20:22.400
They use the example of a class.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.960
You can have your classmates connect to your own cloud server, send them a shared folder

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
link the usual way.

20:26.960 --> 20:31.040
Instead of them having to visit your own cloud each time and log in, they can opt to click

20:31.040 --> 20:34.960
to save to OwnCloud button and add a folder to their own OwnCloud instance.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.120
And then they can add this folder to the list of locally synced folders and it will sync

20:38.120 --> 20:42.600
between your own cloud instances as if it was on their own own cloud server.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
Oh cool.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.600
Right?

20:44.600 --> 20:45.600
Yeah.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.600
That sounds nice.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.600
That's freaking awesome.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.600
Yeah.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.600
I mean they talk about performance improvements.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.040
They talk about server to server syncing.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.520
I am digging that.

20:52.520 --> 20:56.320
I am thinking OwnCloud 7 is the one that this might be the time I switch.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.920
I cannot wait to load it up into.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.200
Clearly I'm spinning up another droplet.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.360
I mean I think that's been settled.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.360
There you go.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.360
Right there right?

21:03.360 --> 21:04.360
Yeah it could.

21:04.360 --> 21:09.360
I've been thinking you know I've been really trying to figure out like photos for my wife

21:09.360 --> 21:13.200
and I and music and then moving them between the two locations.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.480
It's not as easy as it should be.

21:15.480 --> 21:19.000
And there's not like there's like you could do BitTorrent sync but then you have to we

21:19.000 --> 21:23.040
have to run individual you have to configure each client application on each machine.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.480
So like let's say I'm using Rhythmbox I have to scan that BitTorrent sync folder and add

21:27.480 --> 21:31.200
it as a library on every machine and the metadata might be tracked differently or the podcast

21:31.200 --> 21:32.320
or whatever it is right.

21:32.320 --> 21:37.180
It's just not very smooth but the promise of OwnCloud where it could it could offer

21:37.180 --> 21:41.420
that one central library for you know even if it was just for business contacts and business

21:41.420 --> 21:46.080
events and things like that that sounds extremely compelling and essentially what I use the

21:46.080 --> 21:47.600
Google Apps for right now.

21:47.600 --> 21:51.960
And then if it does file sync on top of that gets us off Dropbox for some of our fixed

21:51.960 --> 21:56.280
assets because we have like a lot of our art and fixed visuals in Dropbox because it's

21:56.280 --> 22:01.040
just so easy to deploy Dropbox and have it sync up on the production machines.

22:01.040 --> 22:06.160
But if OwnCloud offers something there too it might solve a few problems.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.160
I'm really excited about it.

22:07.160 --> 22:11.680
And I wonder too like if there wouldn't be a bit of a contracting business and going

22:11.680 --> 22:17.560
around and saying hello this is Chris's OwnCloud installation and would you like an internet

22:17.560 --> 22:22.240
that actually works for you and offers file sync and gets your staff off of Dropbox.

22:22.240 --> 22:25.720
Let me introduce you to my OwnCloud installation package for only a thousand dollars I'll deploy

22:25.720 --> 22:29.520
OwnCloud for you and get all your users migrated off of Dropbox.

22:29.520 --> 22:32.300
Like that could actually be like a legitimate thing people go around and make money off

22:32.300 --> 22:34.360
of because OwnCloud is getting serious.

22:34.360 --> 22:38.120
And then if you offer like server sync that's a perfect solution for businesses to have

22:38.120 --> 22:39.240
a few offices.

22:39.240 --> 22:43.600
A small business has one or two offices OwnCloud sync between them.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
Money maker.

22:44.600 --> 22:48.280
I mean like especially when you think about like dental offices, real estate offices,

22:48.280 --> 22:51.640
anything that especially when you're dealing with the at home people as well as at work

22:51.640 --> 22:53.180
people multiple offices.

22:53.180 --> 22:54.880
Yeah there's a lot of opportunity there.

22:54.880 --> 22:59.240
Yeah you know very much so I mean I'm thinking very much of my workflow but I could easily

22:59.240 --> 23:04.480
see like a you know a small business owner that wants a sync of the most vital documents

23:04.480 --> 23:06.800
and things like that at their own house for backup right.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.280
I mean that seems legit.

23:08.280 --> 23:15.340
So it sounds like a good option for a couple clients I have that it can save a lot of effort

23:15.340 --> 23:17.600
for me as well.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.800
The other thing so OwnCloud right now is I'm going to look at for my for my all inclusive

23:21.800 --> 23:27.360
sync solution and then the other one I got experiment more with is sync thing.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.440
I've played with it a little bit.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.720
The thing I not love about sync thing is you have to authorize each device you're going

23:31.720 --> 23:32.720
to sync with.

23:32.720 --> 23:37.000
So distributing things like podcast files you know I can't authorize every viewer out

23:37.000 --> 23:40.220
there that wants to sync the Linux action show HD folder.

23:40.220 --> 23:41.220
That's just that'd be crazy.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.080
I'd be doing that all day long.

23:43.080 --> 23:49.600
But so BitTorrent sync seems like that's still the go to thing for that.

23:49.600 --> 23:53.160
It doesn't replace sync thing in the terms of like content distribution.

23:53.160 --> 23:57.000
So then if I'm going to be running an instance of BitTorrent sync anyways should I just go

23:57.000 --> 24:01.240
all in on that and just simplify my life instead of running BitTorrent sync and OwnCloud or

24:01.240 --> 24:03.280
BitTorrent sync and sync thing.

24:03.280 --> 24:06.440
I got too many sync options.

24:06.440 --> 24:12.400
So I'll figure it out eventually and then we'll make an episode out of it.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.640
Solve two problems with what you know just boom two birds one stone that hey speaking

24:15.640 --> 24:18.960
of solving problems let me tell you about our next sponsor and then we'll get into the

24:18.960 --> 24:25.540
community announcement the Jupiter review panel but first let me tell you about the

24:25.540 --> 24:32.360
great Canadians over at ting.com go to linux.ting.com why because it's linux.ting.com own that

24:32.360 --> 24:37.680
URL that is ours let's represent the Linux users at ting now here's really why you want

24:37.680 --> 24:43.460
to switch to ting no contract no early termination fee and you only pay for what you actually

24:43.460 --> 24:47.380
use you don't pay into some big contract where you have to kind of guesstimate how many minutes

24:47.380 --> 24:52.240
and how much data you might use and how many text messages you might send you just pay

24:52.240 --> 24:58.140
for what you use and it was interesting on tech talk today I had an email from a cellular

24:58.140 --> 25:01.900
wireless engineer and he's like the ting model from the perspective of a person who builds

25:01.900 --> 25:06.200
and maintains these networks is the only model that makes sense long term it's the only one

25:06.200 --> 25:10.960
that can work and I feel like I am living a bit in the future when I use ting because

25:10.960 --> 25:14.820
it's all the things I need in a cellular service my data is there I have hotspot and tethering

25:14.820 --> 25:19.760
included I get the pick of some of the greatest Android devices and iOS devices and or just

25:19.760 --> 25:25.060
feature phones all available through ting it's a flat six dollars per month then just

25:25.060 --> 25:29.220
my usage build on top of that all managed through an incredibly easy to use dashboard

25:29.220 --> 25:34.460
but also provides real insights and this is a big thing for me these dashboards this is

25:34.460 --> 25:38.940
2014 there is no excuse for the dashboards that some of these cell companies use they

25:38.940 --> 25:42.900
are just trash and the great thing about ting is they also support industry standards too

25:42.900 --> 25:48.700
so they works well on mobile works well on your desktop they also have featured like

25:48.700 --> 25:52.620
integration with Amazon payments to pay for your cell phone bill which is a really nice

25:52.620 --> 25:56.260
feature and it kind of shows you how ting is hip to a lot of these types of technologies

25:56.260 --> 25:59.780
and it's refreshing it's one of the things I appreciate the most and that's why I actively

25:59.780 --> 26:03.500
follow the ting blog because there's always good information even if you're not a ting

26:03.500 --> 26:07.020
subscriber on the ting blog and it's always worth checking out over there because they've

26:07.020 --> 26:10.180
often post videos that are behind the scenes it's fun to see the ting crew get insights

26:10.180 --> 26:15.300
into how the company operates and check out their devices too because when you go to linux.ting.com

26:15.300 --> 26:19.020
they're gonna take $25 off your first device if you've already got a device they'll take

26:19.020 --> 26:23.980
$25 off your ting service I paid for more than my first month now I've got two phones

26:23.980 --> 26:28.520
on my ting program and it's barely cracking $30 a month because we're really conscious

26:28.520 --> 26:32.980
about how we do it we're on Wi-Fi a ton we use Viber and Skype for our phone calls and

26:32.980 --> 26:36.700
the little bitsies that we do use phone calls for we just pay for when we use it I love

26:36.700 --> 26:42.900
it it's just worked so well for me linux.ting.com take $25 off your first device get or $25

26:42.900 --> 26:49.420
credit and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged okay so this is a fun initiative

26:49.420 --> 26:52.980
that the production team's been wanting to do for a while it not only is it a way for

26:52.980 --> 26:57.900
us to sort of increase the distributions that we cover and give attention to maybe some

26:57.900 --> 27:02.180
of the smaller ones that we wouldn't normally want to load up and install just for like

27:02.180 --> 27:06.460
a smaller distro but sometimes when you do that like you find a diamond in the rough

27:06.460 --> 27:12.700
so we are announcing the Jupiter colony review draft and this is an initiative that will

27:12.700 --> 27:17.600
eventually eventually establish a kind of a reoccurring group of folks but we're going

27:17.600 --> 27:20.860
to kind of take baby steps at first rotten do you want to jump in here at this point

27:20.860 --> 27:24.300
and kind of mention how we're going to launch this with the pre-selected group and why we're

27:24.300 --> 27:30.460
doing it that way yeah so it's the first the first week we're going to do to make it easier

27:30.460 --> 27:35.620
to kind of instead of having to vet everyone to join we're going to do a just a kind of

27:35.620 --> 27:42.060
a testing purposes of getting people to just a pre-selection of a few people maybe like

27:42.060 --> 27:45.860
a list less probably less than a dozen or so but just as many people as possible but

27:45.860 --> 27:51.220
then we're going to have it where they can we come on to like a show to get everybody

27:51.220 --> 27:55.380
does show together you get you just you play with the distro however you would normally

27:55.380 --> 27:59.460
would take some things like that yet take some notes maybe even try to beat it beat

27:59.460 --> 28:04.980
it up a little bit and see where you find some flaws and then we have a community discussion

28:04.980 --> 28:08.980
about whether you know whether they say it's something that could be good for a new user

28:08.980 --> 28:14.540
or just the bit the pros and cons of the distro itself yeah and do you want to go ahead and

28:14.540 --> 28:19.260
announce the first one no go ahead i'll let you do it okay the first dish we're gonna

28:19.260 --> 28:28.060
uh put in this little round table review thing is uh chaos yeah chaos has been on our list

28:28.060 --> 28:31.540
for a while but we just haven't gotten to it so that'll be a good one for people to

28:31.540 --> 28:40.580
give a go and uh yes yes yes yes it is it's considered a lean kde distribution at that

28:40.580 --> 28:46.780
uh yes is that even possible wow in the sense of how many packages they allow in their system

28:46.780 --> 28:51.220
so they only allow kde specific stuff and they have anything other than that they force

28:51.220 --> 28:54.620
it off and they have that interesting design aesthetic as well which i've been interested

28:54.620 --> 28:58.700
to try out so the idea here is uh we get a wide sampling of opinions on this you guys

28:58.700 --> 29:01.820
can look at it and some folks will look at it from very technical aspects some people

29:01.820 --> 29:05.340
look at it from the design aspect others will look at it from like a usability and things

29:05.340 --> 29:09.060
like that we'll get a nice rounded set of opinions and then we can accumulate it into

29:09.060 --> 29:14.940
sort of a concentrated review for the linux unplugged audience and honestly there's an

29:14.940 --> 29:20.700
opportunity here down the road where if a few folks stood out as you know really solid

29:20.700 --> 29:25.380
contributors maybe there'd be a role where you'd come on last and do dedicated review

29:25.380 --> 29:28.820
segments of specific distribution so there's opportunity for expansion and growth here

29:28.820 --> 29:33.000
but it's just something to start with for fun so embedded in the show notes we will

29:33.000 --> 29:36.920
have the jupiter colony review draft if you would be interested in reviewing a distribution

29:36.920 --> 29:41.020
for us we like rotten said we've already picked our first distribution and our first crew

29:41.020 --> 29:45.180
so that way we just kind of get things rolling but after that we'll be pulling from our draft

29:45.180 --> 29:50.300
list and you'll find that in the episode 47 show notes it'll be linked and embedded in

29:50.300 --> 29:54.580
there and it's also it'll be in the irc chat room for those of you watching live so are

29:54.580 --> 29:59.020
we going to do the review next week rotten yes next week okay so we'll have chaos on

29:59.020 --> 30:03.620
the show yeah you know what's coming up down the road in fact i want to put the word out

30:03.620 --> 30:13.740
there i'm thinking about on july 22nd i see well we have something already scheduled but

30:13.740 --> 30:18.340
i on the production calendar but i'm thinking about potentially being live from oscon in

30:18.340 --> 30:22.820
portland oregon on july 22nd so i want to put the word out there for the jupiter broadcasting

30:22.820 --> 30:27.500
audience if there's folks out there who might be interested in meeting up at oscon on july

30:27.500 --> 30:32.620
22nd that it's like that's a wednesday or no it's a tuesday so we and if it worked out

30:32.620 --> 30:36.300
it'd be really fun to be able to do unplugged live from there so kind of putting a feeler

30:36.300 --> 30:41.440
out there seeing what people think we were accepted at oscon as media so we could go

30:41.440 --> 30:44.300
in there we'd have media badges we could do interviews and stuff like that so there's

30:44.300 --> 30:47.940
some reasons to go down there but i'd really love to do it if we knew we're going to meet

30:47.940 --> 30:52.140
up with some folks oh yeah all right rotten is there anything else we want to cover on

30:52.140 --> 30:58.500
the community review the jupiter colony draft as it were um yeah the the draft is going

30:58.500 --> 31:03.000
to be um it doesn't we first want to make sure people that if they're interested in

31:03.000 --> 31:06.880
doing it they don't have to worry about having an extra computer or anything like that it's

31:06.880 --> 31:12.140
just like kind of play with it you don't need to remove remove your existing distro or anything

31:12.140 --> 31:17.380
like that so we're going to do something yeah it can be a virtual box like some things might

31:17.380 --> 31:22.140
will provide a virtual box image to make it easier for people or other other times they

31:22.140 --> 31:26.900
could just buy the i mean not buy but download the iso some things don't work very well in

31:26.900 --> 31:31.020
virtual box so we figure that out on the way to go yeah it might be distribution dependent

31:31.020 --> 31:34.860
yeah because like for example you can't really review a distribution like core os in virtual

31:34.860 --> 31:39.920
box so there's some yeah we were bouncing it around we found some uh some people had

31:39.920 --> 31:46.000
some questions about maybe um you know having a whether you should like run it all the week

31:46.000 --> 31:50.420
or is it just something we can just kind of like jump in and play with and if that's enough

31:50.420 --> 31:55.660
and essentially uh it's not you're not trying to ask people to just you know run live with

31:55.660 --> 32:01.340
it in a week or anything just to kind of you know play play with it use it see if you can

32:01.340 --> 32:05.500
break it kind of things yeah i mean it's really going to be results depending on what insights

32:05.500 --> 32:09.340
the audience that member brings and if like then if they bring something that we're like

32:09.340 --> 32:12.840
yeah that was a really great observation will you join us for the next review you know that's

32:12.840 --> 32:18.140
the kind of system it's going to be where uh solid contributions will be noted and appreciated

32:18.140 --> 32:21.780
and i love the idea too of then eventually establishing a pool of folks and saying okay

32:21.780 --> 32:26.320
we're looking for everybody who has intel graphics because we want to try out this wayland

32:26.320 --> 32:30.180
distribution you know or something like that because we if we built up a little pool we

32:30.180 --> 32:33.700
could maybe do stuff that is a little bit harder for ourselves to do because maybe i

32:33.700 --> 32:37.820
don't have a machine with dedicated intel graphics right so i couldn't do that review

32:37.820 --> 32:43.340
of of something that runs mere or wayland uh but if we had a resource out there of folks

32:43.340 --> 32:48.300
that wanted to participate and wanted to do these reviews you know essentially uh you

32:48.300 --> 32:51.140
don't even have to have experience but if you've done blogging too you're probably a

32:51.140 --> 32:55.580
great candidate if you've blogged a distro review uh and just it's something fun we want

32:55.580 --> 32:59.380
to do i'm looking forward to it i think it could be a great idea i think it could be

32:59.380 --> 33:03.220
a good way for matt and i discover a few distributions we hadn't really thought of trying before

33:03.220 --> 33:08.020
and then you never know like maybe we'll take a look at it and end up switching maybe i

33:08.020 --> 33:12.720
don't know i'm a little i'm a little skeptical yeah i don't know matt you seem skeptical

33:12.720 --> 33:17.580
so anyways uh form is in the show notes if you guys want to fill that out uh also uh

33:17.580 --> 33:24.540
just a little plugsies check out tech talk today um tomorrow's episode because i pre-recorded

33:24.540 --> 33:29.500
because i'm going to a cabin tomorrow's episode is a retro look back at two operating systems

33:29.500 --> 33:34.700
that almost dominated the market one of which i'm sure most of you've heard of one of which

33:34.700 --> 33:39.980
i would bet most of you haven't heard of and it'll be surprising who was making it and

33:39.980 --> 33:43.900
what it was based on so uh check out tech talk today it's a new show on the jupiter

33:43.900 --> 33:49.740
broadcasting network a daily technology podcast where uh me and my closest mumble friends

33:49.740 --> 33:55.300
discuss the tech news from perspectives of open source enthusiasts and linux users now

33:55.300 --> 33:59.880
that doesn't necessarily mean that every story is a linux story but what it means is instead

33:59.880 --> 34:04.140
of getting that typical silicon valley bias where it's very heavily google influenced

34:04.140 --> 34:09.140
or apple influenced and linux and open source are very often not considered not part of

34:09.140 --> 34:12.700
their perspective or not part of the discussion this has been something that we've talked

34:12.700 --> 34:17.400
about on linux unplugged for a couple of episodes the quality of journalism especially those

34:17.400 --> 34:21.900
coming at it from a linux perspective is pretty abysmal so uh one of the goals i have with

34:21.900 --> 34:26.940
tech talk today is to have a platform for us to have discussions around the tech events

34:26.940 --> 34:31.180
the tech news of the day and it's the stuff that actually is we're talking about you know

34:31.180 --> 34:35.120
it's not just rattling off headlines it's things that are actually worth discussing

34:35.120 --> 34:39.980
from a perspective of a linux user and i hope it's an i hope it's an interesting recipe

34:39.980 --> 34:45.460
i'd like you guys to check it out episode 18 came out today we talked about microsoft

34:45.460 --> 34:49.380
shutting down the no ip service which screwed a lot of jupiter broadcasting audience members

34:49.380 --> 34:53.420
i saw a lot of complaints about that in the form or in the threads in a couple different

34:53.420 --> 34:57.460
of our subreddits so we talked that's an issue we talked about in today's tech talk today

34:57.460 --> 35:01.460
doesn't quite fit in linux unplugged or linux action show but it's an issue we could talk

35:01.460 --> 35:07.820
about and then like i said tomorrow is the retrospective at the os's of futures past

35:07.820 --> 35:12.820
and so i encourage you to check out tech talk today if you want more show but i think that's

35:12.820 --> 35:15.780
everything we have for today i think we've gone through our list we kind of burned through

35:15.780 --> 35:18.740
it pretty quick but i'm okay with that because that means i get to wrap up and head out to

35:18.740 --> 35:24.820
a cabin so i'm not gonna complain man if you if you get my drift and it is hot i tell you

35:24.820 --> 35:29.740
what i was gonna say oh it is hot off a costco thing of water in the back oh yeah oh i got

35:29.740 --> 35:33.540
a big thing of water but i could use another one jeez louise i'll tell you what so all
