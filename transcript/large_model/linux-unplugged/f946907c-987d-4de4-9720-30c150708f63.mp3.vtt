WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.180
Well, this is gonna be a fun episode

00:01.180 --> 00:02.180
because Brent's in studio.

00:02.180 --> 00:03.080
Hello, Brent.

00:03.080 --> 00:04.200
Oh, hello.

00:04.200 --> 00:05.280
Nice to see you here.

00:05.280 --> 00:06.680
Oh, so nice seeing you too.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.000
We're getting ready to go down to Portland

00:08.000 --> 00:09.200
for a Clear Linux event.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.040
We are.

00:10.040 --> 00:12.440
And enjoying ourselves pineapple cider.

00:12.440 --> 00:13.900
I think we're just warming up at this point

00:13.900 --> 00:14.740
for the trip, you know?

00:14.740 --> 00:15.560
Yeah, that's right.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.760
We're warming up for the show,

00:16.760 --> 00:17.880
and then after the show,

00:17.880 --> 00:19.860
we'll be like ready to go to Portland, yeah.

00:19.860 --> 00:21.400
We're gonna need somebody to drive us, but.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.840
Anybody, anybody?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.280
I'm excited to have you here, Brent.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.120
Thank you.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.760
It's great to be back in studio,

00:28.760 --> 00:30.600
typically the way it's worked previously

00:30.600 --> 00:32.080
is a year's gap between that.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.120
But now we're looking at,

00:33.120 --> 00:34.760
this is, well, I haven't even been home

00:34.760 --> 00:35.920
since the last time I've been here, so.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.560
No, we were on the Friday stream

00:37.560 --> 00:39.560
and I was like, Brent, come back, come back.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.480
It's funny, because the whole story

00:40.480 --> 00:42.160
is really captured in that Friday stream.

00:42.160 --> 00:44.880
It really is, and I hesitated, I have to say.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.880
But you called, you were here, you're here though.

00:46.880 --> 00:47.960
You gotta pull those things off

00:47.960 --> 00:48.800
when you get to get the chance.

00:48.800 --> 00:49.640
When you get an opportunity.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.460
Yeah, of course.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.300
I'm glad you did.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.400
We went out and bought brats.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.200
Brats, they were at the front of line.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.660
As they should be.

00:56.660 --> 01:01.660
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 302 for May 21st, 2019.

01:03.460 --> 01:08.460
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show.

01:17.180 --> 01:18.180
My name is Chris.

01:18.180 --> 01:19.020
And my name is Brent.

01:19.020 --> 01:19.860
Hey there, Brent.

01:19.860 --> 01:20.680
Well, hello.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.520
Great to have you here.

01:21.520 --> 01:22.340
That's good mean.

01:22.340 --> 01:23.180
You already knew that though.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.220
Aw, you know.

01:24.220 --> 01:25.500
Well, you picked a good episode,

01:25.500 --> 01:27.540
because we have, I don't know, man.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.100
We have like staggering community news this week.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.940
You and I were out and about when this news came in.

01:31.940 --> 01:34.500
I was like, whoa, whoa, we're adding that to the show.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.840
It's just breaking today as we're going on the air.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.260
But there's also just some really great future stuff

01:39.260 --> 01:40.620
that we're gonna talk about with Cassidy

01:40.620 --> 01:41.980
from Elementary OS.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.500
Couple of important things in housekeeping

01:43.500 --> 01:45.740
I wanna talk to you guys about and get your feedback.

01:45.740 --> 01:48.720
And then, after all of that, we're going Team Silverblue.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.900
It's kind of like a Red Hat arc we've been having.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.700
You know, we started with Fedora's release,

01:54.700 --> 01:56.740
then we went to Red Hat Summit and Rell,

01:56.740 --> 02:00.580
and now we're ending it with a look at Silverblue,

02:00.580 --> 02:01.820
because Drew's joining us too.

02:01.820 --> 02:02.780
Hello, Drew.

02:02.780 --> 02:03.900
Hello, hello.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.100
Drew took the plunge.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.360
He's been rocking Silverblue for the past week and change

02:08.360 --> 02:10.640
and been taking copious notes.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.420
So he'll be joining us later on in the show

02:12.420 --> 02:13.940
to chat about that.

02:13.940 --> 02:15.020
Of course, Mr. Bacon's here too.

02:15.020 --> 02:15.940
Hello, Cheesy.

02:15.940 --> 02:16.780
Hey, guys.

02:16.780 --> 02:17.600
How's it going?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.440
Oh, good, good.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.280
And hello, Alex.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.240
Good to see you here as well.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.220
I'm excited to get into the news this week.

02:22.220 --> 02:23.460
Yes, there's a lot to...

02:23.460 --> 02:26.420
So very quickly, I will say hello to the mumble room

02:26.420 --> 02:27.700
to our virtual lug time.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.340
Appropriate greetings to y'all.

02:29.340 --> 02:30.180
Hello.

02:30.180 --> 02:31.020
Hello.

02:31.020 --> 02:31.840
Hi, there.

02:31.840 --> 02:35.020
Hello, Bruce and Byte and Cassidy and Mini Mac

02:35.020 --> 02:37.680
and Nerd Burner and the others that will join us

02:37.680 --> 02:39.800
that never get called out as they filter in later

02:39.800 --> 02:42.220
in the show because they're running late.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.040
But a future hello to you.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.820
Now, let's start with, I think,

02:45.820 --> 02:49.100
what is probably the news that sort of shocked me

02:49.100 --> 02:52.980
the most this week, and that is the Antergos project

02:52.980 --> 02:54.900
has announced it's coming to an end.

02:54.900 --> 02:55.920
Don't say it.

02:55.920 --> 02:56.760
It's true.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.660
Come on.

02:57.660 --> 03:00.200
Yeah, this is really, really sad

03:00.200 --> 03:02.220
because I know a lot of folks in our audience run it.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.340
I ran it for a while.

03:03.340 --> 03:05.540
They say over their run since they've been tracking,

03:05.540 --> 03:10.540
which is about 2014, they had 931,439 unique downloads.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.180
Today, they are announcing the end of the project

03:15.180 --> 03:16.860
for existing Antergos users.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.320
There's no need to worry.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.460
They'll continue to receive updates directly from Arch,

03:21.460 --> 03:23.980
and soon, Antergos will release an update

03:23.980 --> 03:27.600
that will remove some of their specific repos

03:27.600 --> 03:29.440
from your machine.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.620
You are a daily Antergos driver.

03:31.620 --> 03:32.860
You use it every single day.

03:32.860 --> 03:36.220
I really am, and part of that reason is from JB

03:36.220 --> 03:38.520
and all the recommendations that were coming in from that,

03:38.520 --> 03:39.620
and I've loved it.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.960
I've really loved it, and what I appreciated about Antergos,

03:41.960 --> 03:45.420
or Antargos as it was called,

03:45.420 --> 03:47.000
is that it made the whole process

03:47.000 --> 03:49.060
of going through Arch really simple,

03:49.060 --> 03:50.780
and so with seeing that go away,

03:50.780 --> 03:51.900
I know there's some alternatives,

03:51.900 --> 03:53.220
but with seeing that go away,

03:53.220 --> 03:56.940
it makes me wonder a lot of questions.

03:56.940 --> 03:58.580
I know, it's not that Manjaro isn't great,

03:58.580 --> 04:00.980
and you do wonder if maybe the Manjaro competition here

04:00.980 --> 04:01.980
is a bit of this.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.480
They say they ran out of time.

04:04.380 --> 04:05.700
Maybe there was too many options.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.540
The thing that I really liked about it over other options

04:08.540 --> 04:10.260
is it was essentially mainline Arch

04:10.260 --> 04:11.580
with a couple of small changes,

04:11.580 --> 04:14.100
like a couple of icon packages and whatnot

04:14.100 --> 04:15.580
from their own repository,

04:15.580 --> 04:19.100
but it was a great way to get a fairly base Arch desktop

04:19.100 --> 04:22.180
with Gnome or Plasma or any desktop you really wanted.

04:22.180 --> 04:23.900
They gave you an option right there,

04:23.900 --> 04:25.940
and it was really, it was just,

04:25.940 --> 04:26.780
gosh, it's good.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.540
I mean, we're talking about it like it's gone.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.200
I guess it'll still work for a little while.

04:30.200 --> 04:34.120
Do we know a little bit more about what the main reason was

04:34.120 --> 04:35.900
for the Switch or the decision, I suppose?

04:35.900 --> 04:36.820
Only what they posted.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.040
Dustin, Alex, and Gatsu posted on a blog over here about it,

04:40.040 --> 04:42.260
and they talk about just,

04:42.260 --> 04:43.880
if you've been paying attention to the project,

04:43.880 --> 04:45.340
and I kind of noticed this myself,

04:45.340 --> 04:47.940
like they really haven't been doing much recently,

04:47.940 --> 04:49.560
and it's because they've been running out of time.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.400
Right.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.520
Yeah, well, time is a precious thing,

04:51.520 --> 04:54.060
and sometimes it's a good thing

04:54.060 --> 04:56.460
when you can decide that a project needs to switch

04:56.460 --> 04:58.260
and to do it gracefully

04:58.260 --> 05:00.540
instead of just kind of letting it die for a long time.

05:00.540 --> 05:04.320
So I hope that this is accepted by the community

05:04.320 --> 05:05.160
in a nice way,

05:05.160 --> 05:08.020
and that the alternatives for current users,

05:08.020 --> 05:09.540
if I'm gonna stay on this system,

05:09.540 --> 05:11.100
which I love and I've had for a few years,

05:11.100 --> 05:12.700
I hope it doesn't just degrade.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.980
Does seem like a classy way to handle it, right, Cheez?

05:14.980 --> 05:16.980
Oh, yeah, definitely.

05:16.980 --> 05:19.180
And it seems like the way that they've kind of,

05:19.180 --> 05:20.640
they're shutting down the project,

05:20.640 --> 05:22.400
and they're pulling these packages,

05:22.400 --> 05:25.060
but they're still leaving you a desktop to work from.

05:25.060 --> 05:28.140
I mean, they're gracefully bowing out,

05:28.140 --> 05:31.860
and they state that it really began as just a project,

05:31.860 --> 05:33.560
a summer project seven years ago,

05:33.560 --> 05:35.880
and grew into what it is.

05:36.780 --> 05:41.400
And as people grow older and their time is more valuable,

05:41.400 --> 05:42.420
they move on to other things.

05:42.420 --> 05:47.380
So I'm very thankful that they've bowed out

05:47.380 --> 05:48.220
the way that they have,

05:48.220 --> 05:50.940
and they've allowed anyone to step up and take the plate,

05:50.940 --> 05:53.700
and fork it and keep going with any of their hard work

05:53.700 --> 05:55.820
that they've provided us.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.740
Alex, does this mean we can't really trust

05:57.740 --> 05:59.060
these small-time distributions?

05:59.060 --> 06:00.540
Like, we have to stick with our Ubuntu,

06:00.540 --> 06:04.200
Debian, Fedora world, and there are open SUSEs out there,

06:04.200 --> 06:09.200
and things like Antigros or other small projects

06:09.640 --> 06:10.500
are just too risky?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.340
They just seem to come and go every couple of years.

06:12.340 --> 06:13.340
They made it a few years.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.860
I mean, to give them some credit, they did make it a while,

06:15.860 --> 06:17.660
but at the end of the day,

06:17.660 --> 06:19.980
it's like another small distro that's distro fading.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.440
That's the nature of human effort though, isn't it?

06:22.440 --> 06:26.620
Is that, like Chi said, as you grow older,

06:26.620 --> 06:28.240
your time becomes more valuable,

06:28.240 --> 06:33.100
and priorities change and everything changes in your life.

06:33.100 --> 06:37.360
However, if we look at Google, right?

06:37.360 --> 06:39.200
They like changing stuff, don't they?

06:39.200 --> 06:40.620
And they're not a small-time thing.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.140
So I'm not necessarily certain

06:43.140 --> 06:46.340
that your assertion is accurate.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.300
It might be fair in this case though.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.460
However, another thing I'd like to say is that

06:52.460 --> 06:55.500
installing Arch isn't that difficult.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.580
So the value proposition of what Antergos

06:58.580 --> 07:03.460
brought to the table was, I mean, I used it a lot.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.060
So back in 2013, 14 sort of time,

07:07.060 --> 07:09.180
I did a computer science masters,

07:09.180 --> 07:12.820
and as part of that, I did a Linux desktop comparison

07:12.820 --> 07:14.740
as part of my dissertation.

07:14.740 --> 07:17.300
And I used the heck out of Antergos,

07:17.300 --> 07:21.520
and I'm reveling in that pronunciation.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.780
Might as well get it out while we can,

07:22.780 --> 07:24.620
cause it's gonna be gone.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.580
I used the heck out of it.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.820
It was one of the most vanilla Linux distro

07:30.820 --> 07:33.380
kind of presentations of multiple different

07:33.380 --> 07:36.260
desktop environments that was out there at the time.

07:36.260 --> 07:38.900
It really fulfilled that niche for me at that point,

07:38.900 --> 07:41.860
very, very well, and I'm sad to see it go,

07:41.860 --> 07:43.380
but at the same time I recognize

07:43.380 --> 07:45.420
that nothing lasts forever.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.740
Well said, and I agree also with Brent's point

07:47.740 --> 07:49.860
about if they have to do it,

07:49.860 --> 07:52.020
doing it in a graceful manner is the best way to do it.

07:52.020 --> 07:53.620
Keep users' expectations.

07:53.620 --> 07:56.780
They could've stretched the thing out for a year.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.600
I mean, this could've taken them a year

07:58.600 --> 08:00.220
to come clean about it. Or let it rot,

08:00.220 --> 08:02.380
and just disappear without having an official path.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.020
Your pride could get in the way

08:04.020 --> 08:05.820
of coming clean on that kind of stuff.

08:05.820 --> 08:07.660
What I appreciate about a small project like this

08:07.660 --> 08:09.900
is just taking some risks to try to get it going,

08:09.900 --> 08:12.420
and then okay, if it's not gonna work after a few years,

08:12.420 --> 08:14.100
that's okay, we can be all right with that.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.900
I think both you and Alex are convincing me

08:15.900 --> 08:17.660
that it's worth the attempt.

08:17.660 --> 08:20.580
Even if in the end you get four or six years in,

08:20.580 --> 08:23.780
or three years in, and it distro fades.

08:23.780 --> 08:26.020
In the meantime, if they're doing something innovative,

08:26.020 --> 08:27.340
it's worth the attempt.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.100
And I think I completely agree with that.

08:29.100 --> 08:29.940
I'm glad they tried.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.700
Yeah, did not all distributions start

08:31.700 --> 08:32.940
with two guys in a living room,

08:32.940 --> 08:35.740
or are a few people just trying to put some ideas together?

08:35.740 --> 08:38.420
Well, Apple started out of a garage, didn't it?

08:38.420 --> 08:39.900
You know, that's the famous one.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.620
I thought they all did.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.420
Yeah, I think that's the rumor.

08:43.420 --> 08:45.060
They all do.

08:45.060 --> 08:45.900
Hey, you know what?

08:45.900 --> 08:47.580
Technically JB did, so.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.460
All right, don't we all need garages?

08:49.460 --> 08:50.500
Yeah, we do.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.620
All right, so that's probably

08:52.620 --> 08:54.420
the most upsetting news of the week.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.420
So let's talk about something

08:55.420 --> 08:57.620
that I'm excited about for the future.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.140
And I made this a prediction on this show,

08:59.140 --> 09:01.380
so I'm very thrilled that this is happening, obviously.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.500
That's my bias up front.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.900
But dark mode, all the things.

09:04.900 --> 09:08.020
Not by force, but give the user option.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.180
And I thought Cassidy nailed it in a post

09:12.180 --> 09:14.460
that they posted on their Medium blog

09:14.460 --> 09:16.940
about OS-wide dark styles.

09:16.940 --> 09:18.780
And this is actually a,

09:18.780 --> 09:20.460
this is a pretty complicated topic.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.100
I was reading through your post, Cassidy,

09:22.100 --> 09:24.180
and I was reading the part you touch on

09:24.180 --> 09:26.380
and hear about research, and you say,

09:26.380 --> 09:29.340
"'In my time contributing to elementary and GNOME,

09:29.340 --> 09:31.180
I've become familiar with pleas from users

09:31.180 --> 09:34.300
to implement official support for arbitrary themes.

09:34.300 --> 09:37.660
While that itself is a large, controversial topic,

09:37.660 --> 09:39.740
I've been working over the past few years

09:39.740 --> 09:43.180
to better understand the why behind these requests.

09:43.180 --> 09:46.220
In addition to listening to folks across the elementary,

09:46.220 --> 09:48.740
pop OS, and GNOME issue trackers,

09:48.740 --> 09:51.500
as well as social media, in-person hackfests,

09:51.500 --> 09:53.700
meetups, and conferences,

09:53.700 --> 09:56.820
I also decided to conduct a study

09:56.820 --> 09:59.340
to see if I could identify patterns in the data

09:59.340 --> 10:02.100
over 1,500 users of various OSes,

10:02.100 --> 10:05.140
environments like Android, GNOME, Ubuntu, Mac OS,

10:05.140 --> 10:08.060
and dozens more were participating in the survey,

10:08.060 --> 10:10.980
which gave me a decent look into this group of users.

10:10.980 --> 10:13.620
In summary, I found an overwhelming majority,

10:13.620 --> 10:16.060
88% of respondents,

10:16.060 --> 10:19.180
said they sometimes or always use a dark style

10:19.180 --> 10:20.660
when given the choice,

10:20.660 --> 10:23.220
and 81% of that group are using dark modes

10:23.220 --> 10:25.420
to address factors outside their device,

10:25.420 --> 10:28.540
like getting headaches, combining that with eye strain,

10:28.540 --> 10:30.860
or just working in a dark office."

10:30.860 --> 10:33.940
This research you did here seems fairly extensive, Cassidy.

10:33.940 --> 10:35.620
Thanks, yeah.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.180
Maybe a little obsessive about it,

10:37.180 --> 10:40.460
but it's really important to get it right, I think.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.660
It's really easy to say,

10:42.660 --> 10:44.820
you know, of course you can use a dark theme today.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.340
You just switch out your GTK theme,

10:46.340 --> 10:49.220
and, you know, if apps are broken, they're broken.

10:49.220 --> 10:50.900
Yeah, why doesn't a dark theme solve this?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.380
Because, you know what, Cassidy,

10:52.380 --> 10:53.460
I can install ArcDark,

10:53.460 --> 10:55.820
and I can go tick a box in GNOME tweaks,

10:55.820 --> 10:57.620
and I'm off to the races.

10:57.620 --> 11:01.780
Yeah, and especially on platforms like elementary OS,

11:01.780 --> 11:02.980
where we have developers

11:02.980 --> 11:05.660
doing much more interesting custom styles,

11:05.660 --> 11:07.500
that doesn't really work.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.580
First of all, those developers

11:08.580 --> 11:10.180
are targeting a specific style sheet,

11:10.180 --> 11:11.460
like the elementary style sheet,

11:11.460 --> 11:14.500
or in the case of GNOME apps, more commonly now,

11:14.500 --> 11:18.220
they're targeting Adwaita for their custom styling.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.860
And so when you, basically,

11:19.860 --> 11:21.940
you're ripping the style sheet out from under that app

11:21.940 --> 11:25.020
and replacing it with something that's inverted,

11:25.020 --> 11:27.380
unless they've tested against that specific style sheet,

11:27.380 --> 11:28.380
it's not gonna go well.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.260
Yeah, the app doesn't know that you've just done that.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.100
It's unaware that it's now on a dark canvas, right?

11:33.100 --> 11:34.300
Exactly, and there's, of course,

11:34.300 --> 11:36.420
there's APIs you can manually look at,

11:36.420 --> 11:37.620
well, what is the background color?

11:37.620 --> 11:38.820
What is the foreground color?

11:38.820 --> 11:41.660
Does the theme end in dash dark?

11:41.660 --> 11:45.820
Which is, all of those hacks exist in apps in GNOME today,

11:45.820 --> 11:48.060
but they're hacks, they're not really a,

11:48.060 --> 11:51.020
they don't really solve this issue in an elegant way,

11:51.020 --> 11:54.700
and they also don't solve it for other toolkits

11:54.700 --> 11:57.620
or big popular apps like Chrome and Firefox,

11:57.620 --> 12:00.900
which today don't support dark mode on Linux,

12:00.900 --> 12:03.500
but they do on Mac OS and on Windows now.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.740
It seems like we also have a more comprehensive problem

12:06.740 --> 12:10.100
we're just on the verge of, Android Q, Android 10,

12:10.100 --> 12:11.940
big parts of their feature focus there

12:11.940 --> 12:15.300
is their new dark mode, which also interestingly enough,

12:15.300 --> 12:17.780
if you turn on battery saver now in Android Q,

12:17.780 --> 12:19.540
it automatically turns on dark mode,

12:19.540 --> 12:21.700
so there does seem to be maybe some power saving benefits,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.500
especially if you have an OLED screen.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.260
But like I say, it's more comprehensive than that.

12:25.260 --> 12:28.780
So it's the applications, it's the system dialogues,

12:28.780 --> 12:30.980
but in the future, it also could be the web browser

12:30.980 --> 12:32.180
and the web page.

12:32.180 --> 12:35.860
The website could be, I'm not sure

12:35.860 --> 12:37.020
what the right terminology to use here,

12:37.020 --> 12:38.420
because this hasn't really happened yet,

12:38.420 --> 12:41.860
but the web browser and the website could communicate

12:41.860 --> 12:43.700
to know if they're both using a dark theme

12:43.700 --> 12:45.380
and display the dark theme by default

12:45.380 --> 12:47.180
if your desktop is in dark mode.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.620
Like it seems like it's a full stack issue

12:49.620 --> 12:52.540
from the OS dialogues all the way up to the applications

12:52.540 --> 12:54.820
and what the applications themselves are rendering.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.340
So it has to be a solution

12:57.340 --> 13:00.060
that is bigger than elementary OS, I think.

13:00.060 --> 13:00.980
Do you agree?

13:00.980 --> 13:03.580
Exactly, and that's why I published this post

13:03.580 --> 13:04.660
and ended this study,

13:04.660 --> 13:06.220
not just from the elementary perspective,

13:06.220 --> 13:08.620
but from the known perspective and the cross desktop,

13:08.620 --> 13:10.780
the free desktop perspective.

13:10.780 --> 13:12.580
We had been working, I'd been working,

13:12.580 --> 13:13.860
I guess I said in the post, you know,

13:13.860 --> 13:17.220
kind of secretly for months on this, on a prototype

13:17.220 --> 13:19.700
for supporting a dark mode in elementary OS.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.620
But what I kept running into is it really doesn't work

13:22.620 --> 13:24.780
unless it's a cross desktop effort.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.260
You know, you can hack it on,

13:26.260 --> 13:29.500
you can bolt it on on a GTK desktop like elementary OS,

13:29.500 --> 13:31.500
but as soon as you open Firefox

13:31.500 --> 13:34.060
and your web pages are all white, it really sucks.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.740
Yeah, it's a blast of white in the face.

13:35.740 --> 13:38.540
Yeah, and it's actually implemented today

13:38.540 --> 13:40.860
on Mac OS now in Safari.

13:40.860 --> 13:43.900
Their dark mode actually propagates out to the websites

13:43.900 --> 13:46.540
and on Chrome, I believe Chrome Canary,

13:46.540 --> 13:49.740
maybe Chrome Daily on Android, on Android Q,

13:49.740 --> 13:50.580
you can enable it.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.620
So you have, it follows your system-wide dark mode.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.660
So it's sooner than later then.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.780
Yeah, and as of Firefox 67,

13:57.780 --> 14:00.300
it's also supported on Mac OS and Windows,

14:00.300 --> 14:02.180
and there's a buried setting you can go change on Linux

14:02.180 --> 14:03.700
to force it as well.

14:03.700 --> 14:06.340
So it's happening across the entire industry.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.100
It's not even just Linux, it's the entire industry

14:08.100 --> 14:12.020
that's really shifting to say, you know what?

14:12.020 --> 14:15.340
Dark style preference is really an accessibility feature.

14:15.340 --> 14:17.220
It's something that users expect

14:17.220 --> 14:19.340
and it's something that they're catering to.

14:19.340 --> 14:20.860
Yeah, it just means I really nailed that prediction.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.140
It's so great.

14:22.140 --> 14:25.500
So moving from beyond that, it also seems like

14:25.500 --> 14:28.460
if it's say a free desktop.org standard type thing,

14:29.700 --> 14:33.740
then there is still a room for a distribution like yourself

14:33.740 --> 14:35.100
that's building a whole platform

14:35.100 --> 14:37.460
to still provide a lot of value

14:37.460 --> 14:38.980
that's outside the standard potentially,

14:38.980 --> 14:42.140
like really good documentation for developers

14:42.140 --> 14:45.900
on how to use your whole toolkit in dark mode.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.700
Those kinds of areas,

14:47.700 --> 14:49.460
integration with your own applications,

14:49.460 --> 14:51.580
with the app center, there's areas that

14:51.580 --> 14:53.180
once there's a standard, you could kind of build

14:53.180 --> 14:54.020
on top of it.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.980
Exactly, so cross platform across toolkit,

14:56.980 --> 14:59.940
there's just the baseline of, hey, this app

14:59.940 --> 15:02.420
or this user has requested the app to use a dark style.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.940
And that's just, that's it, that's where that ends.

15:04.940 --> 15:06.460
But then on the distribution side,

15:06.460 --> 15:07.780
there's things like making sure

15:07.780 --> 15:11.220
that all of the included apps support this dark style,

15:11.220 --> 15:13.540
that third-party developers are heavily encouraged

15:13.540 --> 15:15.220
to support it, that you give them hints

15:15.220 --> 15:18.100
on how color works differently in a dark style.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.860
Maybe they use slightly desaturated colors

15:20.860 --> 15:24.540
because it's less harsh against a darker background.

15:24.540 --> 15:26.380
All of those types of issues are things

15:26.380 --> 15:28.460
where we can step in as a distribution

15:28.460 --> 15:30.660
and really make the experience really great.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.100
Yeah, I could totally see that.

15:32.100 --> 15:35.580
And I could see where you and Island Montreal OS

15:35.580 --> 15:37.980
in particular would really exceed at that area.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.020
So it seems like I've seen the prototype screenshots

15:40.020 --> 15:41.260
which we'll have linked in the show notes

15:41.260 --> 15:43.180
and it looks really good.

15:44.140 --> 15:47.140
Now it's sort of like convince everybody else, right?

15:47.140 --> 15:48.460
It looks like you're planning to go to Guadec

15:48.460 --> 15:50.660
and try to get people talking about this.

15:50.660 --> 15:52.940
Yeah, so I have a session at Guadec,

15:52.940 --> 15:55.860
the free desktop dark style preference,

15:55.860 --> 15:58.180
birds of a feather session, which is a mouthful.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.140
Yeah.

15:59.140 --> 16:02.780
But we're hoping to get people both within Gnome proper

16:02.780 --> 16:04.780
and also just interested app developers

16:04.780 --> 16:06.740
and free desktop people together in a room

16:06.740 --> 16:10.060
to kind of hammer out the actual technical side of it.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.820
I have basically an example specification

16:13.820 --> 16:15.060
that could be adopted,

16:15.060 --> 16:17.820
but it's not necessarily a cross desktop specification.

16:17.820 --> 16:20.820
So I've also been reaching out to people from KDE

16:20.820 --> 16:23.540
and XFCE and other desktops to see,

16:23.540 --> 16:27.060
hey, if we were to do this cross desktop,

16:27.060 --> 16:28.940
how would be, what would be a way

16:28.940 --> 16:30.940
that we're all comfortable with?

16:30.940 --> 16:33.460
And also keeping in mind technologies like Flatpak

16:33.460 --> 16:35.900
where the way an app interacts with their system

16:35.900 --> 16:36.740
is slightly different.

16:36.740 --> 16:39.340
You can't just read and write to system settings

16:39.340 --> 16:43.340
the same way you can with native non-containerized apps.

16:43.340 --> 16:45.980
So there's a whole lot of pieces that have to come together,

16:45.980 --> 16:49.060
but I really was, I'm really trying to show people,

16:49.060 --> 16:52.260
hey, this is a thing we need to do.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.660
It's an accessibility issue.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.620
It's also something that users are gonna expect

16:55.620 --> 16:58.660
more and more as other platforms are all adopting it.

16:58.660 --> 16:59.700
Absolutely.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.420
I'm really glad that you're reaching out too

17:01.420 --> 17:03.900
to the other projects, because, you know,

17:03.900 --> 17:06.380
obviously you're very GTK focused,

17:06.380 --> 17:10.140
but the project has done a really good job in my opinion

17:10.140 --> 17:12.420
of visiting the different camps

17:12.420 --> 17:15.020
and sort of staying friendly with the entire community

17:15.020 --> 17:17.460
and not really tribling down.

17:17.460 --> 17:22.340
And so, you know, like your recent decision with Flatpak,

17:22.340 --> 17:25.940
I know for a fact that people from elementary

17:25.940 --> 17:27.700
attended a lot of canonical events

17:27.700 --> 17:29.460
to get all the information to participate

17:29.460 --> 17:31.100
in both sides of the discussion fully.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.940
Like I witnessed that firsthand.

17:32.940 --> 17:35.100
And I think you guys did that really well.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.980
You have a great reputation for design.

17:36.980 --> 17:38.380
So it seems like too, you're a project

17:38.380 --> 17:40.380
that's already respected in this design area.

17:40.380 --> 17:42.220
So you're positioned really well

17:42.220 --> 17:44.620
from a design standpoint too,

17:44.620 --> 17:46.540
like people respect your opinions on this stuff.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.500
So I really think you got a shot here, Cassidy.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.980
Yeah, I hope, I mean, we're always a fan of a co-operatition,

17:52.980 --> 17:55.220
I guess is what we call it, where, you know,

17:55.220 --> 17:57.260
we think we have the best desktop obviously,

17:57.260 --> 17:59.700
cause we made it and we wouldn't be making it

17:59.700 --> 18:01.740
if we didn't think it was the best.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.700
But we're gonna work with everyone else

18:03.700 --> 18:06.780
to help them, you know, realize their visions too.

18:06.780 --> 18:09.100
And if there's shared effort,

18:09.100 --> 18:10.700
it's gonna make everyone better.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.060
Well, Cassidy, keep us posted on how it goes.

18:13.060 --> 18:15.740
And if you wanna check out the post, go do so.

18:15.740 --> 18:19.220
And is there a way for elementary OS users right now

18:19.220 --> 18:20.740
to try out any of this?

18:20.740 --> 18:23.420
Not super easily slash officially,

18:23.420 --> 18:27.820
but if you do go to github.com slash elementary,

18:27.820 --> 18:29.660
there's a projects tab there.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.540
And one of those projects is called Dark Style Preference.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.620
And you can kind of track the work there.

18:34.620 --> 18:37.300
There's a bunch of in-progress branches

18:37.300 --> 18:39.300
that might support this feature.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.500
So if you get your hands dirty and start compiling stuff,

18:42.500 --> 18:44.740
you can kind of see what's going on.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.340
What do you think of this kind of thing, Cheese?

18:47.340 --> 18:50.180
Because I know as a professional design application user,

18:50.180 --> 18:51.220
your day-to-day applications,

18:51.220 --> 18:54.540
almost all of them for years now have been dark themed.

18:54.540 --> 18:57.340
Plus you just have the overall design differences

18:57.340 --> 18:59.740
between designing for a web that's dark versus light,

18:59.740 --> 19:02.780
applications, curious to get your perspectives on this.

19:02.780 --> 19:04.900
Yeah, I mean, I think dark theming everything

19:04.900 --> 19:07.460
is definitely happening.

19:07.460 --> 19:10.140
It's gonna happen a lot sooner rather than later.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.940
But I would say too that there is something to be said

19:13.940 --> 19:17.700
about dark text on a white background too.

19:17.700 --> 19:21.420
I mean, there is a reason that books are printed

19:21.420 --> 19:22.620
the way they are.

19:22.620 --> 19:26.780
But I really like what Cassidy's done here,

19:26.780 --> 19:28.300
the research that he's done,

19:28.300 --> 19:30.540
and providing this back to the community.

19:30.540 --> 19:34.620
And I think it's something that is really something

19:34.620 --> 19:38.540
that needs to be focused on going forward in future distros,

19:39.500 --> 19:44.500
is that UI and UX done top-notch.

19:45.020 --> 19:48.660
And that's to me is what elementary has seemed to have done

19:48.660 --> 19:49.700
over the years.

19:49.700 --> 19:52.940
And for them to iterate on that and put a dark theme,

19:54.140 --> 19:56.660
I mean, I think it's just, it's gonna be great.

19:56.660 --> 19:57.860
My body is ready.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.260
Yeah, I'm ready to have it.

19:59.260 --> 20:02.740
Cassidy, I would say I've been waiting for this for years,

20:02.740 --> 20:05.020
doing all the photography stuff that I do.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.740
The worst thing I experience

20:07.740 --> 20:09.460
is doing a whole bunch of photography,

20:09.460 --> 20:12.060
getting in the zone and then opening a webpage

20:12.060 --> 20:14.740
or a spreadsheet and just bam.

20:14.740 --> 20:17.860
But what I realized is that it changes my,

20:17.860 --> 20:20.900
the ways my eyes adjust to the colors

20:20.900 --> 20:21.780
and things on the monitor.

20:21.780 --> 20:25.140
And so it takes me a little while for that to come back.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.540
And it's sort of frustrating.

20:27.540 --> 20:28.700
My mom says the same thing.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.420
My mom is a professional graphic artist.

20:30.420 --> 20:33.660
And one of the reasons she's very, very particular

20:33.660 --> 20:36.180
about having her background one solid color

20:36.180 --> 20:38.100
is because it does that same thing to her eyes.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.540
It messes with her perception of it.

20:39.540 --> 20:40.380
Yeah, absolutely.

20:40.380 --> 20:41.860
But when an application comes and hits you in the face,

20:41.860 --> 20:44.260
you don't really have a choice, do you?

20:44.260 --> 20:47.540
Yeah, so hopefully we can get applications on board

20:47.540 --> 20:50.660
and get desktop environments on board and fix that problem.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.180
I just want it because I'm sitting in dark rooms

20:52.180 --> 20:53.020
all the time.

20:53.020 --> 20:53.860
Yeah, right.

20:53.860 --> 20:56.820
Well, I think you're gonna see that 88% support

20:56.820 --> 20:59.980
just be out there through everybody.

20:59.980 --> 21:01.260
Well, that's pretty neat.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.620
I'm looking forward to see where that goes.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.740
I love the ideas as it's, you know,

21:04.740 --> 21:05.820
here's a working example,

21:05.820 --> 21:07.980
but also let's make this a free desktop standard.

21:07.980 --> 21:09.140
It's cross toolkit.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.540
I think it's brilliant.

21:11.540 --> 21:14.180
And a link to information in the show notes.

21:14.180 --> 21:16.060
I wanna move forward now to WireGuard.

21:16.060 --> 21:17.700
Love it, love it, love it.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.100
It's really great.

21:19.100 --> 21:22.420
WireGuard is a beautiful novel VPN technology

21:22.420 --> 21:24.740
that we've been talking about and texting up

21:24.740 --> 21:25.580
for a little bit now.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.620
We've covered a little bit in this show,

21:26.620 --> 21:29.860
but it's great because it's a VPN as fast as it takes

21:29.860 --> 21:32.860
to bring up a network interface on your box.

21:32.860 --> 21:35.780
However, it does require you do some command line fiddling

21:35.780 --> 21:37.940
and nothing too bad, you know.

21:37.940 --> 21:39.620
If your old humble podcaster here can do it,

21:39.620 --> 21:41.780
you can probably do it if you follow some directions,

21:41.780 --> 21:43.860
but you won't need to very soon.

21:43.860 --> 21:48.860
Native WireGuard support is coming in Network Manager 1.16.

21:48.860 --> 21:52.660
It has landed and it is beautiful.

21:52.660 --> 21:55.020
So Network Manager just provides a defacto standard API

21:55.020 --> 21:57.500
for configuring networking on the host.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.300
The other thing that's really nice about this

21:59.300 --> 22:01.180
is you get a lot of other features besides

22:01.180 --> 22:02.940
just a basic WireGuard tunnel setup.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.780
You get some DNS configuration and firewall D,

22:05.780 --> 22:07.500
which is set up in a consistent manner.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.980
So your traffic's getting routed properly.

22:08.980 --> 22:10.940
Your name resolution is getting routed properly

22:10.940 --> 22:13.580
and it's all done from the nice, comfortable GUI

22:13.580 --> 22:14.740
of Network Manager.

22:14.740 --> 22:17.140
This to me feels like such a gift.

22:17.140 --> 22:19.140
I've been interested in WireGuard for a long time,

22:19.140 --> 22:21.940
which I think probably everybody should be.

22:21.940 --> 22:26.660
But I, unlike the Wes, I don't have the technical skills

22:26.660 --> 22:28.500
necessarily to feel really cozy about it.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.340
I've read it over and over and over

22:30.340 --> 22:31.540
and I've wanted to implement this,

22:31.540 --> 22:34.300
but just haven't quite felt comfy about it.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.260
And I'm really hoping this makes the difference.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.660
I was hoping I could point you at the last episode

22:38.660 --> 22:42.380
of TechSnap because Jim and Wes did a fantastic job

22:42.380 --> 22:46.820
breaking down some of the stigma around WireGuard.

22:46.820 --> 22:48.500
So maybe Brent, have a listen to that

22:48.500 --> 22:50.620
and maybe you'll feel like you don't need to be quite

22:50.620 --> 22:54.180
so much of a command line ninja to pull it off.

22:54.180 --> 22:56.820
Yeah, I've been getting a lot of good feedback

22:56.820 --> 22:58.260
about that last episode of TechSnap.

22:58.260 --> 23:00.740
If you haven't checked out TechSnap recently,

23:00.740 --> 23:02.220
that might be a good one to go catch

23:02.220 --> 23:04.300
because I've gotten several comments

23:04.300 --> 23:05.260
saying it was a pretty good one.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.380
Do you agree, Alex?

23:06.380 --> 23:07.900
Yep, I do.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.180
Jim in particular just has this great way

23:10.180 --> 23:14.780
of breaking down, he's like the new version of Alan.

23:14.780 --> 23:19.020
He breaks down a complex topic and distills it

23:19.020 --> 23:20.980
to the points you actually need to understand

23:20.980 --> 23:24.020
and then communicates it in a simple way.

23:24.020 --> 23:27.220
Yeah, it was great meeting Jim at LinuxFest Northwest.

23:27.220 --> 23:29.660
Okay, so we've been talking a little bit

23:29.660 --> 23:32.020
about Project Stadia and I think the big takeaway

23:32.020 --> 23:34.620
from all of the Linux media coverage was,

23:34.620 --> 23:36.780
well, it could be good for Linux.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.500
It could be good for Linux because it's gonna be

23:39.500 --> 23:42.340
using Falcon and the servers are gonna be running Linux,

23:42.340 --> 23:46.780
right, that's been the coverage and it was a gamble.

23:46.780 --> 23:49.140
We weren't sure if that was the case.

23:49.140 --> 23:51.500
Well, this week, we've gotten some evidence

23:51.500 --> 23:53.700
that it is very much the case.

23:53.700 --> 23:57.580
Now again, anecdotal, but this seems like strong evidence

23:57.580 --> 24:01.380
that Stadia, which is Google's game streaming platform

24:01.380 --> 24:06.100
that runs Linux, will benefit desktop Linux gaming

24:06.100 --> 24:08.180
and here's perhaps why.

24:08.180 --> 24:12.260
At GDC 2019, in one of the developer sessions,

24:12.260 --> 24:15.420
up on stage was a developer from id Software

24:15.420 --> 24:18.460
who was responsible for porting Doom,

24:18.460 --> 24:21.060
because why not, you know, it's the acid test, right?

24:21.060 --> 24:24.940
Porting Doom over to Stadia and he talks about

24:24.940 --> 24:28.020
the base setup they did to get ready to do the porting

24:28.020 --> 24:30.540
and I think some of this setup might sound familiar.

24:30.540 --> 24:33.460
As I mentioned before, we had gotten Doom 2016

24:33.460 --> 24:35.580
running on vanilla Ubuntu.

24:35.580 --> 24:37.580
We actually used this as a stepping stone

24:37.580 --> 24:41.260
to get onto Stadia itself and it's an easy approach

24:41.260 --> 24:44.380
for you to take to start experimenting

24:44.380 --> 24:46.620
with the various technologies involved.

24:46.620 --> 24:48.580
We always recommend that you simply engage

24:48.580 --> 24:51.020
with Google directly, but this is an easy way

24:51.020 --> 24:54.060
to evaluate technologies if that is preferred.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.820
What we did is we developed our own spec

24:57.820 --> 25:00.060
in which we took, for the software side of things,

25:00.060 --> 25:03.340
we took a vanilla Ubuntu 1804 image

25:04.380 --> 25:08.420
with Clang 6 as the compile tool chain.

25:08.420 --> 25:11.780
You'll want to develop against Vulkan, Pulse Audio,

25:11.780 --> 25:13.620
and then for the hardware you can use,

25:16.220 --> 25:17.740
sorry, for the hardware you can build a box

25:17.740 --> 25:20.500
comprising an Intel processor with eight threads,

25:20.500 --> 25:23.940
an AMD Vega 10 GPU with eight gigs of VRAM,

25:23.940 --> 25:26.060
eight to 16 gigs of system memory,

25:26.060 --> 25:28.180
and an SSD-like storage device.

25:28.180 --> 25:29.620
Not too surprising because there's been

25:29.620 --> 25:31.740
a lot of speculation, but that detail there

25:31.740 --> 25:34.460
that the GPU they're targeting is the AMD Vega

25:34.460 --> 25:37.940
is also very exciting because it's just likely

25:37.940 --> 25:41.460
to just battle test the hell out of that software stack,

25:41.460 --> 25:43.380
and that has a lot of good ramifications

25:43.380 --> 25:45.180
for desktop Linux too.

25:45.180 --> 25:46.980
That seems like a good indication

25:46.980 --> 25:50.220
that at least for some folks, they're demoing or testing,

25:50.220 --> 25:52.140
they're gonna use Linux to try it out,

25:52.140 --> 25:54.500
and if that means they have to get their build on Linux,

25:54.500 --> 25:56.460
it's not gonna be that big of a leap

25:56.460 --> 25:59.300
to go from that to fixing it up and shipping it.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.260
It is a leap, I grant that.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.340
They're not moving mountains to make that happen.

26:03.340 --> 26:05.500
Like they've already ported it and got it working on Stadia,

26:05.500 --> 26:08.220
and they must have it at least somewhat reliable on Linux.

26:08.220 --> 26:10.100
So to just then go, well, now let's package it up

26:10.100 --> 26:13.300
and sell it on Steam, that doesn't seem crazy.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.660
That seems reasonable.

26:15.660 --> 26:16.780
So I think this could actually,

26:16.780 --> 26:19.460
I think the Stadia crap, if it's successful,

26:19.460 --> 26:22.500
I'm sorry, I think the Stadia project, if it's successful,

26:22.500 --> 26:24.300
could be really good for desktop Linux.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.700
Not that that's all I care about.

26:25.700 --> 26:28.140
I don't know, anybody wanna push back

26:28.140 --> 26:30.020
and tell me I'm being crazy there?

26:30.020 --> 26:31.500
But I think that's a good sign, right?

26:31.500 --> 26:33.140
We can't trust Google for this thing

26:33.140 --> 26:35.500
to stick around, though, can we?

26:35.500 --> 26:38.020
I know, I know, but even if it sticks around

26:38.020 --> 26:40.460
for three years, you're gonna have, what,

26:40.460 --> 26:42.660
a dozen different game makers try to get their games

26:42.660 --> 26:43.660
to work on Linux?

26:43.660 --> 26:44.500
Well, that's true.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.820
And Vulkan, too, and the AMD Vega graphics stack.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.060
And maybe that's what's needed

26:49.060 --> 26:50.380
to just break that barrier of entry

26:50.380 --> 26:54.820
or the thought that there's this uphill climb to take on.

26:54.820 --> 26:55.980
This seems really crazy.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.620
I'm just trying to picture explaining the story

26:57.620 --> 27:00.380
to a 10-year version of me, like 10 years ago,

27:00.380 --> 27:01.300
trying to explain the story,

27:01.300 --> 27:03.260
and his mind would just be like, what, no,

27:03.260 --> 27:04.220
this isn't possible.

27:04.220 --> 27:05.820
I thought you were gonna say 10 years in the future

27:05.820 --> 27:06.940
when everything's running on Linux.

27:06.940 --> 27:08.420
Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.620
It's the air of the Linux desktop, Brent.

27:10.620 --> 27:13.380
Oh, I'm feeling it every year, every year.

27:13.380 --> 27:15.100
The bell's getting some use today, guys.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.020
It's been a while.

27:17.580 --> 27:19.300
I definitely think that there's an issue.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.220
There's a deal there, too, with the reliability,

27:22.220 --> 27:24.500
like Alex said, of Stadia being around

27:24.500 --> 27:26.860
in another seven years, and then you've got gamers

27:26.860 --> 27:31.300
that invested multiple hours into a game,

27:31.300 --> 27:33.460
and Google kills its service.

27:33.460 --> 27:35.460
That's gonna upset a lot of people.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.940
That's no different to a PlayStation game now, though.

27:37.940 --> 27:41.060
I have progress on GTA 5 on the PlayStation

27:41.060 --> 27:43.020
that I've literally had to bring across the ocean with me

27:43.020 --> 27:44.580
so I wouldn't lose it.

27:44.580 --> 27:45.900
It's the same vendor lock-in.

27:45.900 --> 27:46.740
True.

27:46.740 --> 27:48.980
The thing that I think is really going to be good about it

27:48.980 --> 27:51.740
is it's going to get more people using Vulkan.

27:51.740 --> 27:56.020
Even if Google goes away once people start targeting Vulkan

27:56.020 --> 27:58.780
and say, well, this isn't too much different

27:58.780 --> 28:03.940
from, say, DirectX and its cross-platform,

28:03.940 --> 28:07.260
maybe we'll see much more adoption of Vulkan,

28:07.260 --> 28:10.940
not just if this project leaves, but forever more.

28:10.940 --> 28:15.140
Well, that's my point, Drew, is if they get two,

28:15.140 --> 28:17.180
three years down the road with this thing,

28:17.180 --> 28:19.260
then dev shops will set up a tool chain

28:19.260 --> 28:22.500
and a software workflow based around this technology stack,

28:22.500 --> 28:23.660
and they're gonna be all in.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.220
They're not gonna, like if Stadia goes away,

28:25.220 --> 28:26.620
they're not gonna be like, well, throw away

28:26.620 --> 28:27.780
all these computers.

28:27.780 --> 28:30.700
Best case scenario is the next Xbox or PlayStation

28:30.700 --> 28:33.220
is based around Vulkan because of this.

28:33.220 --> 28:37.220
I wouldn't be too surprised if the next console

28:37.220 --> 28:39.660
uses streaming in a heavy way.

28:39.660 --> 28:41.620
Maybe like all backwards compatibility

28:41.620 --> 28:43.740
is via streaming or something like that.

28:43.740 --> 28:45.580
I could definitely see that.

28:45.580 --> 28:47.260
You could see them just virtualizing those things

28:47.260 --> 28:48.180
and then streaming it.

28:48.180 --> 28:50.020
I feel like Sony has already talked about that

28:50.020 --> 28:51.700
with the PlayStation 5.

28:51.700 --> 28:55.700
I'm not 100% on that, but I do feel like I read that

28:55.700 --> 28:56.540
somewhere.

28:56.540 --> 28:57.740
Okay, that wouldn't surprise me.

28:57.740 --> 29:01.300
All right, well, some important things

29:01.300 --> 29:02.140
in housekeeping this week.

29:02.140 --> 29:05.260
So we're rolling out a Joe Rez original

29:05.260 --> 29:06.100
for the background music.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.500
You like this?

29:07.500 --> 29:08.340
I'm grooving already.

29:08.340 --> 29:09.860
I'm dancing in this west chair here.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.060
Yeah, I know, right?

29:11.060 --> 29:12.580
You can tell it's kind of a Joe original, too.

29:12.580 --> 29:13.420
It's great.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.260
I love it.

29:14.260 --> 29:17.300
So I have tried to put together,

29:17.300 --> 29:18.300
although I have failed miserably.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.140
I'll see if I can put one in the show notes.

29:20.140 --> 29:22.500
I've been doing PC part picker.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.500
You ever done this before?

29:23.500 --> 29:24.580
I don't know what this is.

29:24.580 --> 29:25.820
Really?

29:25.820 --> 29:26.840
Oh, it's really kind of cool.

29:26.840 --> 29:27.680
You should check it out.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.700
So you go through here and people will spec out

29:30.700 --> 29:32.900
different PC builds and they'll save them.

29:32.900 --> 29:37.300
And so I went in and I built a Ryzen AMD build

29:37.300 --> 29:38.140
for my son Dylan.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.100
I'm thinking after school, after school gets out,

29:41.100 --> 29:43.220
in the summer we do a little build project

29:43.220 --> 29:46.780
and do an AMD system top to bottom to replace his laptop.

29:46.780 --> 29:49.180
That's an amazing learning opportunity for him, I think.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.940
Yeah, last week I was asking about laptops,

29:50.940 --> 29:51.860
but then I thought about it more.

29:51.860 --> 29:54.540
It's like a desktop is really what he needs.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.600
And so I was wondering if the audience had any suggestions,

29:56.600 --> 29:59.440
if they wanted to send me some PC part picker links

29:59.440 --> 30:03.500
at Chris LAS or hit me up on Telegram at Chris LAS.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.380
And there's the Jupyter broadcasting Telegram link

30:05.380 --> 30:07.300
at the top of the JB website.

30:07.300 --> 30:12.100
I got a couple different builds I've done.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.180
It's like around 800 bucks,

30:13.180 --> 30:14.940
so it's not like the cheapest machine.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.180
I'll try to get a link to it in the show notes

30:16.180 --> 30:18.220
so people can review it and tell me what I've done wrong.

30:18.220 --> 30:19.420
Cause I think like the one thing is like,

30:19.420 --> 30:21.860
I'm not sure about the storage or the RAM.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.580
That's tricky, but it's all AMD top to bottom

30:24.580 --> 30:26.100
and it looks like it'd be Linux compatible.

30:26.100 --> 30:28.420
And it's just going to be a gaming rig for him, right?

30:28.420 --> 30:29.440
Yeah, I mean, it's his desktop,

30:29.440 --> 30:31.580
so he'll do schoolwork too, but mostly it's for gaming.

30:31.580 --> 30:36.300
Right, so, and you've got the 2600, 2600X?

30:36.300 --> 30:37.120
Oh yeah, you can see it.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.020
Can you see it there in the link

30:39.020 --> 30:40.540
that I put in the show notes?

30:40.540 --> 30:41.600
I don't think that it's in the link,

30:41.600 --> 30:44.700
but there are some stats, some specs that you put in there.

30:44.700 --> 30:45.600
That's a pretty good setup.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.020
I would bump the RAM to 16.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.300
I did, so I, well actually I bumped it to 32

30:50.300 --> 30:53.180
and I put a Radeon RX 580 in there.

30:53.180 --> 30:56.220
And then I put a 930 gig Samsung

30:56.220 --> 30:58.620
and then I put a one terabyte spinning rust

30:58.620 --> 31:01.300
for like large, long-term game storage and stuff.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.140
That much storage, why wouldn't you just wait

31:03.140 --> 31:04.460
till it got cheaper in a year or two

31:04.460 --> 31:05.300
and then upgrade it?

31:05.300 --> 31:06.140
Maybe, yeah.

31:06.140 --> 31:11.100
You can get a one terabyte SSD for about 90 to $100 now.

31:11.100 --> 31:13.840
And I know a spinning rust is half that price,

31:13.840 --> 31:16.860
but an SSD versus a spinning rust

31:16.860 --> 31:19.700
is a heck of a difference to usability, isn't it?

31:19.700 --> 31:21.060
Yeah, oh yeah.

31:21.060 --> 31:23.340
Well, I had an SSD in there for his OS drive.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.180
You're right, OneDrive.

31:24.180 --> 31:26.180
Anyways, I'd like to get people's part lists,

31:26.180 --> 31:27.260
get their own suggestions,

31:27.260 --> 31:29.140
and then I'm gonna, I'll follow up on the show

31:29.140 --> 31:29.980
and I'll build it.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.260
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

31:31.260 --> 31:33.140
Be Dylan's first home-built Linux rig?

31:33.140 --> 31:33.980
No.

31:33.980 --> 31:34.800
No.

31:34.800 --> 31:35.640
For what it's worth.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.480
Yeah, he doesn't know yet.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.300
This is almost exactly my computer,

31:39.300 --> 31:41.080
except I've got 16 gigs.

31:41.080 --> 31:44.500
And I've got three SSDs in there

31:44.500 --> 31:46.500
instead of one big one.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.620
How's the GNU slash Linux compatibility?

31:48.620 --> 31:49.460
Perfect.

31:49.460 --> 31:51.180
Perfect, those are bold words, Drew.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.020
Perfect.

31:52.020 --> 31:55.180
Those are, cause I'm looking for zero IT overhead here.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.740
I'm gonna put elementary OS on it,

31:56.740 --> 31:59.260
and then I'm just gonna let them run it for years again.

31:59.260 --> 32:01.800
Well, so the thing about an AMD GPU these days

32:01.800 --> 32:03.180
is it's built into the kernel.

32:03.180 --> 32:06.260
So there's nothing proprietary to install,

32:06.260 --> 32:07.300
so it just works.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.260
It's fabulous.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.140
That's what I was thinking.

32:09.140 --> 32:09.980
And it does.

32:09.980 --> 32:11.200
It just works.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.580
Mm-hmm.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.980
All right, well, I'll follow up.

32:13.980 --> 32:15.940
And I'll let you know what the audience suggests too.

32:15.940 --> 32:16.860
I'd like a range.

32:16.860 --> 32:19.460
I'd say that the max is 1500.

32:19.460 --> 32:21.300
So, and that'd be really high end,

32:21.300 --> 32:24.020
but I'd like to see a range of devices people recommend.

32:24.020 --> 32:26.820
And Linux compatibility is top.

32:26.820 --> 32:27.660
And then gaming.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.360
And you know, Samsung, for their SSDs,

32:30.360 --> 32:33.340
they even have a utility to upgrade the firmware

32:33.340 --> 32:35.960
in Linux from the CLI.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.260
All right, so that's my personal thing in housekeeping.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.660
Moving on, we were just talking

32:39.660 --> 32:41.340
about free desktop standards.

32:41.340 --> 32:43.420
The guys are gonna have a much deeper conversation

32:43.420 --> 32:46.100
in user error.show.

32:46.100 --> 32:46.940
Even, you know what,

32:46.940 --> 32:48.740
just not even for the free desktop standard stuff.

32:48.740 --> 32:49.720
Just go there.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.240
It is such a good show.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.540
It is such a good show.

32:52.540 --> 32:55.820
It's hosted by Joe Rezington, Alan Pope, and Daniel Foray.

32:55.820 --> 32:56.660
And I love it.

32:56.660 --> 32:57.860
It's my, like, as soon as it's out,

32:57.860 --> 32:59.460
I listen to it immediately.

32:59.460 --> 33:02.340
Episode 66 comes out this Friday.

33:03.220 --> 33:05.100
Then the show that is one train wreck after another,

33:05.100 --> 33:06.400
it's the Friday stream.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.220
This is a way for you to come say hi,

33:08.220 --> 33:10.220
hang out with us, and meet us.

33:10.220 --> 33:11.900
We wanna do more things with our community.

33:11.900 --> 33:16.860
We wanted an opportunity to stream and do live chats,

33:16.860 --> 33:17.940
have people join us.

33:17.940 --> 33:19.780
Brent, you've been joining every episode?

33:19.780 --> 33:20.860
I think so far? Ever since the start,

33:20.860 --> 33:23.220
even from various pubs near you.

33:23.220 --> 33:24.060
Yep, yep.

33:24.060 --> 33:24.880
Yeah, that's right.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.720
That's right.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.560
That's when we got the,

33:26.560 --> 33:28.140
was that when we heard the squirrel story?

33:28.140 --> 33:28.980
That was Andrew's.

33:28.980 --> 33:30.020
No, squirrel was what?

33:30.020 --> 33:31.960
Was that last week? Okay, okay.

33:31.960 --> 33:33.040
If you listen to the Friday stream,

33:33.040 --> 33:35.580
you know why Brent's here right now already.

33:35.580 --> 33:36.420
That's what it is.

33:36.420 --> 33:37.320
It's like there's a lot going on.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.660
We have a big crew.

33:38.660 --> 33:40.340
And it's a chance to hear from people

33:40.340 --> 33:43.020
that are often in this show in a different context.

33:43.020 --> 33:43.940
If that interests you at all,

33:43.940 --> 33:46.860
come check out the Friday stream, fridaystream.com.

33:46.860 --> 33:49.200
What I love too is a giant mash of ideas

33:49.200 --> 33:50.800
that otherwise on certain other shows

33:50.800 --> 33:52.700
don't have the space for, which is really great.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.060
Yeah, you know, you've seen behind the curtain

33:54.060 --> 33:55.340
of some of the stuff we're playing with.

33:55.340 --> 33:56.580
We've got some ideas.

33:56.580 --> 33:57.820
Just around the corner,

33:57.820 --> 34:00.880
Texas Linux Fest, May 31st to June 1st.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.440
Cheesy Alex and I will be at Texas Linux Fest

34:03.440 --> 34:04.740
along with Elle.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.420
Come say hi to us.

34:06.420 --> 34:08.660
We have a meetup too down there, like a dinner.

34:08.660 --> 34:10.100
Yep, come get some barbecue.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.620
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

34:12.620 --> 34:14.060
as well as information about

34:14.060 --> 34:16.420
our next Kubernetes study group over there.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.220
And I'm gonna just say this.

34:18.220 --> 34:21.620
I don't know if, don't tell them I told you this, okay?

34:21.620 --> 34:23.100
If you become a Community Edition member

34:23.100 --> 34:24.380
over at Linux Academy,

34:24.380 --> 34:26.500
there may be an opportunity to upgrade that account

34:26.500 --> 34:27.340
at a really good deal.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.340
I'm gonna put that out there.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.180
It's kind of a secret.

34:29.180 --> 34:30.000
I don't wanna say anything.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.540
And they've recently added the Community Edition

34:33.540 --> 34:35.440
to the Linux Academy mobile app.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.580
So you can grab the mobile app

34:36.580 --> 34:38.860
and get access to the free community content.

34:38.860 --> 34:40.880
Now that's the content that Elle and I curate

34:40.880 --> 34:42.220
every single month.

34:42.220 --> 34:43.580
And there's a lot of really good stuff

34:43.580 --> 34:44.580
that she and I have been putting in there.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.500
She's got a good head for what should go in there, really.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.540
So it's more like I say, good idea Elle.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.940
That's really my involvement.

34:49.940 --> 34:51.260
Um,

34:51.260 --> 34:53.740
but she's good at it.

34:53.740 --> 34:55.620
And that's available now for free.

34:55.620 --> 34:56.460
And the app's free.

34:56.460 --> 34:57.660
You can get into the Community Edition for free.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.220
And then if you decide to get,

34:59.220 --> 35:01.340
you know, upgrade to like all of the stuff,

35:01.340 --> 35:02.180
there might be a promo in there.

35:02.180 --> 35:03.100
I can't say.

35:03.100 --> 35:03.940
This is so great.

35:03.940 --> 35:05.340
I would totally grab this.

35:05.340 --> 35:07.380
Like for example, when I took the train down here.

35:07.380 --> 35:08.220
Yes.

35:08.220 --> 35:09.060
You can do it on your mobile

35:09.060 --> 35:10.900
instead of having to take out something like the laptop.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.700
You can also cache the videos offline and stuff.

35:12.700 --> 35:13.540
So.

35:13.540 --> 35:14.360
Now you're talking.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.200
Yeah, if you want.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.700
For us out of country travelers.

35:17.700 --> 35:18.580
It's nice, isn't it?

35:18.580 --> 35:19.420
It is.

35:19.420 --> 35:20.240
Go check it out.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.180
We'll have links in the show notes.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.780
And that my friends is the housekeeping.

35:26.220 --> 35:29.180
So Silverblue is an interesting beast.

35:29.180 --> 35:31.260
And it promises, I would say,

35:31.260 --> 35:35.140
what seemed like an impossible stable workstation, Drew.

35:35.140 --> 35:36.700
And so that's why we've been talking about it

35:36.700 --> 35:37.600
behind the scenes.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.340
Seems like it could have, you know,

35:39.340 --> 35:41.700
long-term great use in the studio.

35:41.700 --> 35:44.100
There could be all kinds of production purposes

35:44.100 --> 35:46.720
for an OS like Silverblue.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.900
Is there like a newbie way you could explain

35:49.900 --> 35:53.800
what the draw is to Silverblue above regular Fedora?

35:53.800 --> 35:54.640
Okay.

35:54.640 --> 35:59.320
So Silverblue is following on the heels of Project Atomic.

35:59.320 --> 36:04.060
And I love the idea of immutable file systems

36:04.060 --> 36:08.540
where basically your root is mounted read-only.

36:08.540 --> 36:11.280
So anytime that you go to do an upgrade,

36:11.280 --> 36:15.160
it builds a whole image and then you reboot into that image.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.380
That's kind of the high level view of

36:18.380 --> 36:20.180
this is what Silverblue is doing

36:20.180 --> 36:22.520
and this is how it remains stable.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.500
And the advantage to that would be something goes haywire,

36:25.500 --> 36:27.860
you could boot back into the previous image

36:27.860 --> 36:30.600
and you're exactly right back where you left off.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.500
Correct.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.440
So if an upgrade goes horribly wrong,

36:34.440 --> 36:37.220
you just reboot and in your boot menu,

36:37.220 --> 36:39.140
just drop back to the last version,

36:39.140 --> 36:41.180
boot up, you're right where you were

36:41.180 --> 36:42.640
before you did that upgrade.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.620
No need to go in and do an LVM snapshot rollback

36:45.620 --> 36:47.740
or anything like that.

36:47.740 --> 36:51.580
You're just, you're right there with minimal downtime

36:51.580 --> 36:53.140
trying to fix the issue.

36:53.140 --> 36:55.660
I have a layman's question about this.

36:55.660 --> 36:57.900
If you're updating just like, let's say one piece of salt,

36:57.900 --> 36:58.900
you get a new, I don't know,

36:58.900 --> 37:01.260
a new version of Audacity coming in and you update,

37:01.260 --> 37:03.020
does that mean you have to do a reboot every time

37:03.020 --> 37:04.540
or how does that work out?

37:04.540 --> 37:05.860
Depends on how you installed it.

37:05.860 --> 37:09.540
So the whole thing is it's trying to push people

37:09.540 --> 37:12.860
into using flat packs more for their standard applications

37:12.860 --> 37:16.580
rather than installing directly into the OS.

37:16.580 --> 37:19.020
If you have Audacity installed as a flat pack,

37:19.020 --> 37:21.260
which yes, there is a flat pack for it,

37:21.260 --> 37:25.460
then no, it just upgrades automatically in the background,

37:25.460 --> 37:27.060
no need to reboot or anything.

37:27.060 --> 37:31.960
However, if you're using RPM OS tree to slip that

37:31.960 --> 37:35.540
into the image, then yes, you would need to reboot

37:35.540 --> 37:37.740
for every application update.

37:37.740 --> 37:41.980
Is the idea a clear wall between your base operating system

37:41.980 --> 37:43.060
and your applications?

37:43.060 --> 37:46.340
In fact, so much so, I think by default,

37:46.340 --> 37:48.500
doesn't Silverblue even lack DNF?

37:48.500 --> 37:52.500
It does lack DNF and you're not going to put it on

37:52.500 --> 37:53.560
the base image.

37:53.560 --> 37:54.400
Oh, really? No.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.240
Really, okay.

37:55.240 --> 37:59.340
If you want to use DNF to say search for package

37:59.340 --> 38:03.460
because RPM dash OS tree does not have a search feature

38:03.460 --> 38:04.420
that I found yet.

38:04.420 --> 38:05.580
Womp, womp.

38:05.580 --> 38:08.640
What you do is you use this thing called toolbox

38:08.640 --> 38:11.740
and toolbox is really, really cool.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.660
What you do is you use the toolbox command

38:14.660 --> 38:17.100
to create an OCI container,

38:17.100 --> 38:20.900
which then has a full Fedora 30 base image.

38:20.900 --> 38:23.780
It's a minimal image, but it's a base image

38:23.780 --> 38:28.780
as an OCI container that you then enter into that toolbox

38:28.980 --> 38:31.300
and you can do things like install DNF,

38:31.300 --> 38:35.580
install applications, including graphical applications,

38:35.580 --> 38:39.860
and it does have by default access to your home directory,

38:39.860 --> 38:41.020
which is great.

38:41.020 --> 38:45.300
So you can do something like install Audacity in a toolbox,

38:45.300 --> 38:49.060
launch it there, and then you can do your DNF upgrades

38:49.060 --> 38:53.340
in that OCI container and have your stable base

38:53.340 --> 38:54.420
stay the same.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.660
In theory, could you also install your own versions of,

38:56.660 --> 38:58.280
you can install FFmpeg and other things

38:58.280 --> 39:01.540
in that same toolbox and Audacity could see it?

39:01.540 --> 39:04.360
Like VST plugins, could you stash those in there?

39:04.360 --> 39:05.580
Yes.

39:05.580 --> 39:08.900
Now, that's kind of where it fell down for me though,

39:08.900 --> 39:12.420
is I thought, okay, well, what if I make an audio container?

39:12.420 --> 39:14.060
It has all of my audio stuff.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.660
It has my VSTs. Right, right, sure.

39:15.660 --> 39:19.220
It has LinVST to let me use my Windows only VSTs.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.460
It's got wine in there.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.900
It's ready to go.

39:21.900 --> 39:23.500
I got everything set up.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.140
I got Reaper installed.

39:25.140 --> 39:26.540
It launched.

39:26.540 --> 39:31.100
I had the graphical interface and no connection

39:31.100 --> 39:33.940
to the audio system.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.940
You can't see any of the sound devices.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.380
Right, sad trombone there.

39:38.380 --> 39:41.260
So that didn't last long.

39:44.700 --> 39:46.500
And this was after I put it on bare metal

39:46.500 --> 39:47.920
because I wanted to play with it.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.500
I wanted to see how well it worked on bare metal.

39:50.500 --> 39:55.700
And it works great except for those little fringe cases.

39:55.700 --> 39:59.420
Now, it's clearly meant for developers, right,

39:59.420 --> 40:04.300
for people who want to, say, launch this OCI container

40:04.300 --> 40:09.460
with Python version whatever and program against that

40:09.460 --> 40:11.940
because they know that that's what they have on their server

40:11.940 --> 40:13.540
and they want to do their testing

40:13.540 --> 40:16.340
in this particular container.

40:16.340 --> 40:19.380
And then they want to see what happens when they upgrade it.

40:19.380 --> 40:22.660
That's the sort of use case that they're really targeting.

40:22.660 --> 40:26.860
General workstation use cases, it can be done.

40:26.860 --> 40:32.020
But you've got to really be aware of what you're doing,

40:32.020 --> 40:34.900
the fact that you're adding complexity to your upgrade

40:34.900 --> 40:38.660
mechanisms because, say, you need to upgrade something

40:38.660 --> 40:39.780
in an OCI container.

40:39.780 --> 40:41.580
Well, you'll have to go into that container,

40:41.580 --> 40:45.500
do the DNF upgrade from the command line, all of that.

40:45.500 --> 40:49.500
So there's a lot more complexity that you're adding on top.

40:49.500 --> 40:53.180
Per toolbox, you have to do that per container slash toolbox.

40:53.180 --> 40:56.020
OK, so that could get to be a little much after a while.

40:56.020 --> 40:56.860
It can.

40:56.860 --> 40:59.300
But that's the trade-off for having

40:59.300 --> 41:01.620
such a super stable base.

41:01.620 --> 41:03.740
Now, you can go the other direction

41:03.740 --> 41:08.380
and just do things in rpm-ostree and add them to the base image.

41:08.380 --> 41:11.700
The problem you might face, which the developers are really

41:11.700 --> 41:16.220
upfront about this, is if you add too much on top in their hybrid

41:16.220 --> 41:19.340
application layer, you could end up

41:19.340 --> 41:22.780
with a system that does not properly upgrade when

41:22.780 --> 41:25.180
it comes time for Fedora 31.

41:25.180 --> 41:27.700
And you don't really know until you've crossed a threshold.

41:27.700 --> 41:28.200
Right.

41:28.200 --> 41:30.860
It's never going to tell you, oh, hey, by the way,

41:30.860 --> 41:31.620
your system is.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.140
Yeah.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.260
This particular library.

41:33.260 --> 41:34.620
That sounds pretty risky to me.

41:34.620 --> 41:35.380
Yeah.

41:35.380 --> 41:36.060
Right.

41:36.060 --> 41:40.020
So daily driver, not for me yet.

41:40.020 --> 41:43.180
But I think if they keep working on it

41:43.180 --> 41:46.020
and Toolbox gains more functionality

41:46.020 --> 41:47.940
to be able to tie into maybe GNOME

41:47.940 --> 41:50.780
software or something along those lines

41:50.780 --> 41:55.220
where it can be more useful to supplant the hybrid application

41:55.220 --> 41:58.700
layer, I think it has a real shot

41:58.700 --> 42:02.620
at being an excellent workstation for regular users

42:02.620 --> 42:04.100
and not just devs.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.100
Interesting.

42:05.100 --> 42:08.060
Now, putting on your IT hat, you must see some use cases too

42:08.060 --> 42:10.380
as like enterprise-grade workstations.

42:10.380 --> 42:12.620
I wonder, is it usable now for enterprise,

42:12.620 --> 42:16.660
or would it require changes on the Silverblue team's part

42:16.660 --> 42:18.060
to make it usable?

42:18.060 --> 42:19.260
So here's the nice thing.

42:19.260 --> 42:24.900
You can point the RPM-OS tree upgrade path wherever you want.

42:24.900 --> 42:27.020
So say you're in an enterprise, and you've

42:27.020 --> 42:29.900
deployed a bunch of these workstations,

42:29.900 --> 42:32.000
even in VDI or something like that,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.880
and you publish a new image with some upgrades

42:34.880 --> 42:36.540
or some new applications for your employees

42:36.540 --> 42:40.340
to take and use, what you can do is

42:40.340 --> 42:44.220
you can point all of those at your image

42:44.220 --> 42:47.300
locally on your servers and have them pull it.

42:47.300 --> 42:50.260
And once they reboot, they're in that new image,

42:50.260 --> 42:52.540
and they're working, and it's on a new image

42:52.540 --> 42:55.740
that you've already tested and put it through its paces

42:55.740 --> 42:57.700
and said, yes, this is ready for my employees

42:57.700 --> 43:01.540
to use, which limits downtime for individual people

43:01.540 --> 43:03.700
and issues that they might have.

43:03.700 --> 43:07.260
That's really a huge benefit to something like this,

43:07.260 --> 43:11.020
where you've got the stable base that is bit for bit

43:11.020 --> 43:13.780
the same across deployments.

43:13.780 --> 43:16.300
And it's also the same reason why

43:16.300 --> 43:19.660
Debian and NixOS and other distributions

43:19.660 --> 43:22.580
are targeting build reproducibility

43:22.580 --> 43:26.100
is for this exact kind of thing.

43:26.100 --> 43:28.940
Now, I think that it could be made better.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.780
They could build some tooling around it

43:30.780 --> 43:34.780
to tie into, say, LDAP, where you can automatically

43:34.780 --> 43:37.340
spin up an instance in a VDI cluster

43:37.340 --> 43:39.340
that people could log into.

43:39.340 --> 43:40.940
Right, maybe some central storage,

43:40.940 --> 43:43.620
like maybe make some provisions for quickly

43:43.620 --> 43:45.260
mounting some NFS storage.

43:45.260 --> 43:46.340
Exactly.

43:46.340 --> 43:49.740
I think if they can really get that going,

43:49.740 --> 43:53.340
then that would be a game changer for enterprise.

43:53.340 --> 43:56.300
Yeah, you could really see the beauty in a VDI

43:56.300 --> 43:58.860
or even just standard workstation setup,

43:58.860 --> 44:01.100
where you combine it with LDAP for the authentication.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.980
So that way you're not having to keep updating password files

44:03.980 --> 44:05.660
and things like that.

44:05.660 --> 44:06.860
It's all centralized.

44:06.860 --> 44:07.940
Oh, man.

44:07.940 --> 44:09.620
God, that would be a dream.

44:09.620 --> 44:12.380
Well, I used to use a Citrix desktop, which

44:12.380 --> 44:15.220
was a Windows-based system VDI thing.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.220
And the applications on there were

44:17.220 --> 44:19.900
delivered via a container.

44:19.900 --> 44:23.860
So a lot of this stuff is already done in the Windows

44:23.860 --> 44:24.900
space, bizarrely.

44:24.900 --> 44:26.460
Yeah, any other thoughts on it, Drew?

44:26.460 --> 44:28.700
I mean, this seems like it was a worthwhile experiment,

44:28.700 --> 44:30.460
but ultimately, you're not sticking with it.

44:30.460 --> 44:31.020
Right.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.380
I'm not going to stick with it, just

44:33.380 --> 44:37.460
because my particular workflow, working with media,

44:37.460 --> 44:43.020
is not a use case that really is part of their spec.

44:43.020 --> 44:44.860
And I don't expect it to be.

44:44.860 --> 44:49.740
But right now, it does not work for me for what I need to do.

44:49.740 --> 44:53.340
If I were wearing a sysadmin hat,

44:53.340 --> 44:54.460
things would be different.

44:54.460 --> 44:56.180
I would love this.

44:56.180 --> 45:00.340
Yeah, that's what I was just thinking.

45:00.340 --> 45:03.780
For what I'm doing, it doesn't quite fit the bill.

45:03.780 --> 45:06.820
Now, speaking of the sysadmins again, though,

45:06.820 --> 45:08.900
just to bring it back a little bit,

45:08.900 --> 45:13.620
if they could put some tooling in that really ties this

45:13.620 --> 45:16.220
together, you could start supplanting things

45:16.220 --> 45:20.220
like Chef and Puppet for broad system control,

45:20.220 --> 45:22.860
where that can be baked into the image,

45:22.860 --> 45:25.140
and you don't need to run as many scripts

45:25.140 --> 45:26.940
across multiple machines.

45:26.940 --> 45:28.380
I could see that's where they're going.

45:28.380 --> 45:29.580
It could still be really early days.

45:29.580 --> 45:32.180
I mean, it's only been called Silverblue for a few months.

45:32.180 --> 45:33.140
That's very true.

45:33.140 --> 45:33.740
Yeah.

45:33.740 --> 45:35.140
I think Atomic might have been a better name.

45:35.140 --> 45:35.780
But hey, you know what?

45:35.780 --> 45:36.380
We'll move on.

45:36.380 --> 45:37.620
We'll move on from that.

45:37.620 --> 45:39.080
Well, Drew, thank you for the roundup.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.700
I've been very, very curious about it.

45:40.700 --> 45:43.100
So I'm glad you had a chance to do a deep dive on that.

45:43.100 --> 45:44.540
That was fascinating.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.060
And I think we'll keep watching it and seeing

45:47.060 --> 45:49.340
if there isn't a time, maybe an opportunity down the road,

45:49.340 --> 45:51.100
to use it in something.

45:51.100 --> 45:53.260
I could also really see it as just being a great host

45:53.260 --> 45:55.260
for containers and VMs on the server.

45:55.260 --> 45:57.060
That's another area beyond the workstation,

45:57.060 --> 45:58.860
where it just seems like it could be a killer system.

45:58.860 --> 46:00.260
We've got CoreOS for that one.

46:00.260 --> 46:01.020
Don't forget.

46:01.020 --> 46:01.860
That's true.

46:01.860 --> 46:02.420
That's true.

46:02.420 --> 46:04.540
CoreOS is really sort of the story there now.

46:04.540 --> 46:06.220
And that's sort of when things changed.

46:06.220 --> 46:07.740
And we went to Silverblue, really,

46:07.740 --> 46:09.540
was after CoreOS came along.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.980
Alex, I want to give you all of the credit

46:11.980 --> 46:13.540
for one of the picks this week.

46:13.540 --> 46:15.700
I did not even have it in my list.

46:15.700 --> 46:19.020
I'd never even seen it until you suggested it to me.

46:19.020 --> 46:21.020
Full disclosure, audience, prepare yourselves.

46:21.020 --> 46:22.580
Get ready.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.420
I have to tell something to Brent in private.

46:25.420 --> 46:26.660
So just give me a moment.

46:26.660 --> 46:27.060
I'm sorry.

46:27.060 --> 46:27.940
You won't be able to hear this.

46:27.940 --> 46:28.860
The cone of silence.

46:28.860 --> 46:29.340
Ooh.

46:32.140 --> 46:33.580
Hey, Brent.

46:33.580 --> 46:34.260
Yeah, Chris?

46:34.260 --> 46:35.540
They can't hear us, so don't worry about it.

46:35.540 --> 46:37.100
I am.

46:37.100 --> 46:38.900
So I got a really good app pick this week.

46:38.900 --> 46:39.220
Really?

46:39.220 --> 46:40.180
Where'd you find it?

46:40.180 --> 46:41.820
It was Alex told me about it.

46:41.820 --> 46:46.140
The issue is, though, it's on an Electron app.

46:46.140 --> 46:46.900
It's a what?

46:46.900 --> 46:48.660
It's an Electron app.

46:48.660 --> 46:50.900
You think I should tell them about it?

46:50.900 --> 46:54.700
You know, that's a little risky, I think.

46:54.700 --> 46:56.140
All right, you got my back on this?

46:56.140 --> 46:56.620
I'm with you.

46:56.620 --> 46:57.100
All right.

46:57.100 --> 46:58.540
The cone of silence.

46:58.540 --> 47:00.060
All right, well, sorry.

47:00.060 --> 47:00.940
We're back now.

47:00.940 --> 47:04.580
The app pick this week is called MineTime.

47:04.580 --> 47:07.140
It's a calendar for the 21st century.

47:07.140 --> 47:09.340
And it's, I think, the best calendar application

47:09.340 --> 47:10.020
I've ever used.

47:10.020 --> 47:11.340
Alex, how the hell did you find this?

47:11.340 --> 47:12.820
And why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

47:12.820 --> 47:13.580
I hate you.

47:13.580 --> 47:19.020
I had to try and find a way to get calendars for work

47:19.020 --> 47:25.940
and at home in sync, because Android's just rolled out

47:25.940 --> 47:28.060
a new feature, or it's just been presented to me

47:28.060 --> 47:30.220
a new feature that you can have different profiles

47:30.220 --> 47:33.300
on your device for work and home.

47:33.300 --> 47:35.620
So it installs Gmail and the Calendar app

47:35.620 --> 47:38.780
on your Android device into a container.

47:38.780 --> 47:41.620
The downside of that is it means that I can no longer

47:41.620 --> 47:44.860
see my home calendar and my work calendar in the same place.

47:44.860 --> 47:45.460
Right.

47:45.460 --> 47:47.980
So I was looking for a way to try and synchronize things

47:47.980 --> 47:50.460
with Nextcloud, with CalDAV, to try and get it all in one

47:50.460 --> 47:51.500
place again.

47:51.500 --> 47:55.300
And I just searched for Linux CalDAV calendar,

47:55.300 --> 47:57.020
and this MineTime thing came up.

47:57.020 --> 47:59.540
And I've been searching for the longest time

47:59.540 --> 48:00.980
for an iCal replacement.

48:00.980 --> 48:05.580
I think the Apple Calendar application is possibly

48:05.580 --> 48:09.220
my favorite way of just viewing events.

48:09.220 --> 48:10.580
The UI is clean.

48:10.580 --> 48:12.500
Adding new events is simple.

48:12.500 --> 48:14.780
And it's just really customizable.

48:14.780 --> 48:19.020
I can tell it that I want 15 hours viewable in a day,

48:19.020 --> 48:19.860
for example.

48:19.860 --> 48:25.340
And it just basically looks like a polished version

48:25.340 --> 48:27.980
in Electron of Apple's iCal.

48:27.980 --> 48:31.740
It also is a fairly snappy Electron application.

48:31.740 --> 48:34.540
I wasn't 100% sure it was even Electron.

48:34.540 --> 48:36.980
It wasn't smelling real bad or anything like that.

48:36.980 --> 48:38.620
It didn't have a code stink.

48:38.620 --> 48:41.020
It launched pretty good, doesn't use a ton of memory.

48:41.020 --> 48:43.580
And sure enough, if it doesn't work great

48:43.580 --> 48:45.860
with the different hosted calendars I have.

48:45.860 --> 48:47.940
And I've really been recently struggling with this

48:47.940 --> 48:50.340
because Linux Academy uses Google Apps.

48:50.340 --> 48:52.220
I have my own personal stuff.

48:52.220 --> 48:53.860
And I have the JB stuff.

48:53.860 --> 48:55.380
And it's been a real struggle for me

48:55.380 --> 48:57.700
because I don't really like Lightning.

48:57.700 --> 49:00.100
I don't like the way Evolution does it.

49:00.100 --> 49:03.020
I haven't really taken to any particular calendaring

49:03.020 --> 49:04.060
application.

49:04.060 --> 49:06.780
And so what I've been doing like a monster

49:06.780 --> 49:10.640
is I've been just natifying the Google Calendar

49:10.640 --> 49:12.620
for different calendars and just having

49:12.620 --> 49:15.060
three different natifier applications running

49:15.060 --> 49:18.540
on my desktop like a caveman, right?

49:18.540 --> 49:20.700
I mean, this is horrible, think about this.

49:20.700 --> 49:22.660
So I could have those different calendar stuff.

49:22.660 --> 49:26.140
And then Alex comes around with this mindtime.ai application.

49:26.140 --> 49:27.300
And Bob's your uncle.

49:27.300 --> 49:29.100
I've got it all in one application.

49:29.100 --> 49:31.500
But here's another thing it does,

49:31.500 --> 49:34.780
which you did not even tell me about, but is quite impressive,

49:34.780 --> 49:38.580
is it gives you a fascinating analysis of how

49:38.580 --> 49:41.820
you spend your time and who you spend your meetings with,

49:41.820 --> 49:43.300
who initiates the meetings.

49:43.300 --> 49:44.300
That might be dangerous.

49:44.300 --> 49:45.700
Oh, yeah.

49:45.700 --> 49:47.960
Boy, is it sometimes fuel for a righteous fire

49:47.960 --> 49:49.260
that I can have, let me tell you.

49:49.260 --> 49:51.740
But it's so great because now I have

49:51.740 --> 49:54.860
visuals of how much of my time per week is spent in meetings.

49:54.860 --> 49:57.460
And it's, let's just say, vindicating.

49:57.460 --> 49:58.580
Let's just put it that way.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.540
And it tells you who the worst offenders

50:00.540 --> 50:02.060
are for scheduling meetings.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.980
So my boss is right at the top of the list.

50:04.980 --> 50:06.580
Yeah, yeah.

50:06.580 --> 50:10.740
Mindtime also has, like, they call an assistant.

50:10.740 --> 50:13.460
But a lot of other really nice calendar applications

50:13.460 --> 50:16.580
have this, where it just understands natural language.

50:16.580 --> 50:20.820
So you just say, go to Portland with Brent on Wednesday.

50:20.820 --> 50:23.620
And it processes all of that.

50:23.620 --> 50:26.020
It says, well, he must mean the next Wednesday.

50:26.020 --> 50:28.500
And he must mean Brent from his contacts.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.420
And so it just figures all of that out

50:30.420 --> 50:31.860
and then puts it on your calendar

50:31.860 --> 50:32.540
right at the right time.

50:32.540 --> 50:35.140
And you can just do a brain dump right into a text field.

50:35.140 --> 50:36.060
You mean in English?

50:36.060 --> 50:36.780
Yeah.

50:36.780 --> 50:37.580
Isn't that right?

50:37.580 --> 50:40.420
Yeah, the computer has to adapt to you.

50:40.420 --> 50:42.500
And then it also provides some smart scheduling,

50:42.500 --> 50:43.940
which is really, really nice.

50:43.940 --> 50:46.460
It'll try to analyze your schedule.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.380
And it'll look at other people's schedules.

50:48.380 --> 50:50.980
And it'll make group scheduling simple and easier

50:50.980 --> 50:53.140
and recommend the times that have worked best for you

50:53.140 --> 50:53.940
in the past.

50:53.940 --> 50:56.500
It's a nice, it's an electron application, like I said.

50:56.500 --> 50:58.460
But that means it is also cross-platform.

50:58.460 --> 51:00.780
And it's probably one of the better electron applications

51:00.780 --> 51:02.140
that I've seen.

51:02.140 --> 51:05.260
Could I highlight their data policy?

51:05.260 --> 51:06.100
Yes, please.

51:06.100 --> 51:08.180
As a research project, Mindtime is

51:08.180 --> 51:12.980
financed by ETH Zurich, a Swiss innovation agency.

51:12.980 --> 51:15.140
We take data protection seriously.

51:15.140 --> 51:17.420
We will never sell your data.

51:17.420 --> 51:20.340
These technologies are developed and released for free

51:20.340 --> 51:23.860
and can be used by everybody for non-commercial purposes.

51:23.860 --> 51:25.500
That's pretty clear, don't you?

51:25.500 --> 51:26.100
Thank you, Alex.

51:26.100 --> 51:27.980
Yeah, I think that's a good thing to point out.

51:27.980 --> 51:31.100
So Alex, I was literally, last evening,

51:31.100 --> 51:33.100
I was literally looking for something like this

51:33.100 --> 51:35.460
because I'm sharing a few calendars with some people who

51:35.460 --> 51:37.620
only do the Googles and stuff like that.

51:37.620 --> 51:40.700
And it's almost like you were listening into my mind

51:40.700 --> 51:43.180
and you've solved my problem for me in about 15 hours.

51:43.180 --> 51:44.660
So kudos to you.

51:44.660 --> 51:47.420
I was looking recently, and this did not come up.

51:47.420 --> 51:50.220
Well, you're not looking in the right places.

51:50.220 --> 51:52.420
Just need to ask Alex.

51:52.420 --> 51:53.580
It's fairly new, right?

51:53.580 --> 51:56.260
So I don't know when it exactly was released,

51:56.260 --> 52:01.460
but it's a new entrance into the 21st century calendar

52:01.460 --> 52:02.700
landscape.

52:02.700 --> 52:04.420
Well, check out Mindtime.

52:04.420 --> 52:07.020
We will have a link in the show notes, as always,

52:07.020 --> 52:10.460
at linuxunplug.com slash 302 or in your podcast player.

52:10.460 --> 52:13.060
Now, since we did an Electron application,

52:13.060 --> 52:17.620
I want to clear the decks with a good old classic desktop

52:17.620 --> 52:19.100
Linux application.

52:19.100 --> 52:21.940
The good stuff just keeps on getting better.

52:21.940 --> 52:25.660
Now, if you've been rocking a rolling release Linux distro,

52:25.660 --> 52:28.500
you may already be enjoying this goodness.

52:28.500 --> 52:32.740
But if you are on Ubuntu 18.04 or 19.04,

52:32.740 --> 52:39.500
it turns out you may be running a slightly older

52:39.500 --> 52:42.420
version of Quake that is the world's best

52:42.420 --> 52:44.540
drop-down terminal.

52:44.540 --> 52:46.380
Have you had the pleasure of a drop-down terminal?

52:46.380 --> 52:47.340
Oh, I have.

52:47.340 --> 52:50.940
So I am an old Quake game user.

52:50.940 --> 52:52.580
Yes, yes.

52:52.580 --> 52:54.860
So I was first familiar with the drop-down terminals

52:54.860 --> 52:56.540
where its origin.

52:56.540 --> 52:57.140
That's where it's from.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.260
And it was great.

52:58.260 --> 53:00.060
That's why I keep it to the tilde key, too.

53:00.060 --> 53:01.560
That's why I still use the tilde key.

53:01.560 --> 53:02.060
Classic.

53:02.060 --> 53:03.860
One tilde key away from a terminal.

53:03.860 --> 53:06.580
Man, it's so brilliant.

53:06.580 --> 53:08.980
Well, Quake has, and something I have not

53:08.980 --> 53:11.100
been able to really enjoy until I just went ahead

53:11.100 --> 53:13.780
and slapped a PPA on my system, Quake

53:13.780 --> 53:15.780
has added a bunch of great features.

53:15.780 --> 53:17.820
And one of them that I just want to take a moment

53:17.820 --> 53:20.740
and highlight recently, if you're using an older version,

53:20.740 --> 53:22.580
first of all, you need to upgrade.

53:22.580 --> 53:25.540
Second of all, split terminal functionality.

53:25.540 --> 53:27.300
Now, let me take a moment here and tell you

53:27.300 --> 53:28.700
about how this will change your life.

53:28.700 --> 53:29.740
So you got a tilde key.

53:29.740 --> 53:30.780
You're one tilde key away.

53:30.780 --> 53:32.780
Boom, your terminal drops down, right?

53:32.780 --> 53:35.540
So now you can split this sucker horizontally, vertically,

53:35.540 --> 53:36.420
however you want it.

53:36.420 --> 53:37.580
Let me tell you how I do it.

53:37.580 --> 53:40.740
So I've got one large terminal on the left-hand side.

53:40.740 --> 53:42.580
That's my free terminal, always available.

53:42.580 --> 53:44.900
As soon as I need to do something, I got a terminal.

53:44.900 --> 53:46.820
And then on the right side, the right half

53:46.820 --> 53:49.940
of the drop-down terminal, I've got

53:49.940 --> 53:52.500
three different terminal areas.

53:52.500 --> 53:56.820
They're all vertical breaks on this horizontal panel.

53:56.820 --> 54:00.300
And in there are all of those weird esoteric command line

54:00.300 --> 54:02.300
applications that I need to run that I

54:02.300 --> 54:04.140
go start on the command line for some reason

54:04.140 --> 54:06.380
that I don't really need them until the time comes.

54:06.380 --> 54:07.940
So I just go run them manually.

54:07.940 --> 54:10.300
And then I like to watch their output on the command line

54:10.300 --> 54:11.240
because that's how I get feedback

54:11.240 --> 54:12.480
of what they're doing.

54:12.480 --> 54:15.020
I stash those in the different panes.

54:15.020 --> 54:18.420
And they're just why I always have the left-hand side always

54:18.420 --> 54:19.140
available.

54:19.140 --> 54:22.020
So I'm always a tilde key away from getting immediate feedback

54:22.020 --> 54:24.340
on what my Usenet application is doing

54:24.340 --> 54:26.740
or what that command line torrent application is doing

54:26.740 --> 54:28.420
or any of that kind of stuff.

54:28.420 --> 54:33.060
So I find that to be so useful just to have that.

54:33.060 --> 54:35.380
And then one tilde key, and it's all gone.

54:35.380 --> 54:36.940
And I'm right back to what I'm doing.

54:36.940 --> 54:37.980
I just think it's great.

54:37.980 --> 54:43.820
So Guake if you're on GNOME and Uake if you're on Plasma.

54:43.820 --> 54:45.660
And they both are just fantastic.

54:45.660 --> 54:48.740
And is this propagating to Uake?

54:48.740 --> 54:50.460
I think Uake already has it, although I

54:50.460 --> 54:51.980
don't remember for sure.

54:51.980 --> 54:53.220
Because that's what I use daily.

54:53.220 --> 54:56.300
And if not, if someone in the community in IRC

54:56.300 --> 54:57.900
would just put a feature request there.

54:57.900 --> 54:58.660
Open that thing up.

54:58.660 --> 55:00.300
And then in the post show, you should tell us.

55:00.300 --> 55:01.500
Well, maybe I will.

55:01.500 --> 55:03.180
Because Uake's great too.

55:03.180 --> 55:07.700
But now that I'm an XFCE user, I've been using Guake again.

55:07.700 --> 55:08.700
You like that?

55:08.700 --> 55:12.180
It's part of what makes the perfect XFCE desktop is

55:12.180 --> 55:14.380
ULauncher and Guake.

55:14.380 --> 55:17.220
You add those two applications, and you're 90% of the way

55:17.220 --> 55:17.700
there.

55:17.700 --> 55:20.380
Then you add the Arc theme to XFCE.

55:20.380 --> 55:21.300
And then you're good.

55:21.300 --> 55:23.300
You just sit back and wait for Cassidy and team

55:23.300 --> 55:25.740
to make elementary OS and dark theme a thing.

55:25.740 --> 55:26.340
They're going to do it.

55:26.340 --> 55:26.860
Come on.

55:26.860 --> 55:27.940
We're working on it.

55:27.940 --> 55:30.980
I had a real XFCE problem today, Chris.

55:30.980 --> 55:34.260
I'm so used to 10, 12 hours of battery life

55:34.260 --> 55:36.380
that I just stopped packing my charger.

55:36.380 --> 55:37.940
And I turned up at the office.

55:37.940 --> 55:40.300
And nobody had a USB-C charger.

55:40.300 --> 55:42.460
First world problem, eh?

55:42.460 --> 55:44.780
And the value of this is negative.

55:44.780 --> 55:45.540
You know what?

55:45.540 --> 55:48.900
I really, really appreciate the battery life.

55:48.900 --> 55:51.500
In fact, Brent is sitting here in the living room

55:51.500 --> 55:52.020
at the studio.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.180
And I'm like, Brent, watch this.

55:53.180 --> 55:53.860
Watch this, Brent.

55:53.860 --> 55:54.940
And I open up the laptop.

55:54.940 --> 55:55.380
And boom.

55:55.380 --> 55:55.980
You see how fast?

55:55.980 --> 55:57.260
Did it wake up fast or what?

55:57.260 --> 55:58.180
I was impressed.

55:58.180 --> 56:00.060
It almost like it knew you were going to open the lid

56:00.060 --> 56:00.900
and it woke itself up.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.180
And that was after it had been there for like a day

56:02.180 --> 56:02.660
and a half.

56:02.660 --> 56:03.380
Just pow.

56:03.380 --> 56:03.940
It's instant.

56:03.940 --> 56:04.900
XFCE to the rescue.

56:04.900 --> 56:05.700
It's impressive.

56:05.700 --> 56:06.380
It took you.

56:06.380 --> 56:07.060
You asked me.

56:07.060 --> 56:08.220
You said, so how's it going?

56:08.220 --> 56:11.180
And what don't you like about using XFCE right now?

56:11.180 --> 56:12.020
And it took me.

56:12.020 --> 56:14.060
I sat there and I thought about it for a minute.

56:14.060 --> 56:17.460
And I realized what I'm not in love with right now

56:17.460 --> 56:19.140
is the window management.

56:19.140 --> 56:22.180
I did figure out how to stop applications that bring

56:22.180 --> 56:24.660
a browser tab up from moving the browser from, say,

56:24.660 --> 56:26.580
the first virtual to the fourth virtual desktop.

56:26.580 --> 56:27.980
I figured out how to fix that.

56:27.980 --> 56:31.060
But if anybody in the audience has tips on scripts

56:31.060 --> 56:34.860
I can run that would restore my applications to their

56:34.860 --> 56:39.540
positions and also restore my window screen layouts,

56:39.540 --> 56:41.660
I'm still having the issue from time to time.

56:41.660 --> 56:44.380
When I wake up from sleep, my windows are completely

56:44.380 --> 56:46.140
jumbled, even though I've put everything

56:46.140 --> 56:48.340
in the right display ports, I've made sure

56:48.340 --> 56:50.220
like the primary displays and the right display

56:50.220 --> 56:52.860
port and all of that, I still get things that move around.

56:52.860 --> 56:55.700
Because I've got one regular monitor,

56:55.700 --> 56:57.340
one 16 by nine regular monitor,

56:57.340 --> 56:59.700
and then two vertical monitors.

56:59.700 --> 57:02.900
And XFCE just has a hell of a time with that sometimes.

57:02.900 --> 57:05.420
Sounds like you want to try out i3 next, Chris.

57:05.420 --> 57:07.300
That is something I'm actually considering doing.

57:07.300 --> 57:08.980
A lot of people have been recommending that to me.

57:08.980 --> 57:10.980
It's definitely something I'm starting to consider

57:10.980 --> 57:12.620
much more seriously right now.

57:12.620 --> 57:15.060
I'm just still like in the XFCE zone.

57:15.060 --> 57:19.140
But I gotta be honest, because I was so judgmental

57:19.140 --> 57:21.740
about XFCE and discounted it for a long time,

57:21.740 --> 57:24.980
I've now decided that, well, alright,

57:24.980 --> 57:26.300
I need to also give i3 a shot,

57:26.300 --> 57:28.620
because I've been sort of behaving the same way with i3.

57:28.620 --> 57:29.580
So I'm getting there.

57:29.580 --> 57:31.140
But in the meantime, if people have scripts

57:31.140 --> 57:33.220
or hacks they have to like restore window layouts

57:33.220 --> 57:35.640
and screen layouts for XFCE, let me know.

57:35.640 --> 57:37.540
Because one of the things I'm really enjoying

57:37.540 --> 57:40.860
is I can go find like a stack exchange post

57:40.860 --> 57:43.460
or whatever from like two years ago,

57:43.460 --> 57:44.660
and it's still applicable.

57:44.660 --> 57:47.020
It's still applicable, it's the best thing ever.

57:47.020 --> 57:48.300
It's so nice.

57:48.300 --> 57:50.580
Like it just makes so much more of the documentation

57:50.580 --> 57:51.900
online actually applicable,

57:51.900 --> 57:54.600
because like XFCE for the last four years

57:54.600 --> 57:55.960
has basically not changed much.

57:55.960 --> 57:58.820
So if I find something from like the last four years,

57:58.820 --> 58:00.740
I'm pretty much good.

58:00.740 --> 58:02.620
It's a persistent documentation.

58:02.620 --> 58:04.860
It's like what Windows users get.

58:04.860 --> 58:05.700
It's true.

58:05.700 --> 58:08.540
But in Windows, it's just because nothing changes.

58:08.540 --> 58:09.780
Yeah, well, yeah, because it's super boring,

58:09.780 --> 58:11.360
nothing changes, yeah, and nobody upgrades.

58:11.360 --> 58:13.220
But it's the same thing.

58:13.220 --> 58:16.760
All right, well, if anybody has,

58:16.760 --> 58:18.740
this has been the Help Chris episode really.

58:18.740 --> 58:22.100
If anybody, don't you think, help me build a PC for my son

58:22.100 --> 58:24.900
and help me fix XFCE.

58:24.900 --> 58:27.280
It's not that I3 wouldn't work for me either, I think.

58:27.280 --> 58:28.540
So it may happen.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.220
You know, some of these pics are helping me with problems

58:30.220 --> 58:31.460
I didn't even realize I had.

58:31.460 --> 58:32.280
Oh, yeah?

58:32.280 --> 58:33.740
Are you trying to wake out already?

58:33.740 --> 58:36.260
Yeah, I have to say, I haven't figured it out yet, so.

58:36.260 --> 58:38.020
What if you right click in the middle of the terminal?

58:38.020 --> 58:39.980
Oh, hey, now, that seems too obvious.

58:39.980 --> 58:42.580
So go over there and drop that terminal down.

58:42.580 --> 58:44.360
So I'm a control tilde, just saying.

58:44.360 --> 58:45.200
Oh, yeah, well.

58:45.200 --> 58:46.460
Because I got nothing on the right click.

58:46.460 --> 58:47.740
Plasma already assigned something

58:47.740 --> 58:48.900
to the tilde by default.

58:48.900 --> 58:49.580
Really, nothing?

58:49.580 --> 58:51.340
No, not even like adjust your profile?

58:51.340 --> 58:54.420
Oh, split left, right, split top, bottom.

58:54.420 --> 58:56.060
You just got to know where to right click.

58:56.060 --> 58:56.860
Yeah, there you go.

58:56.860 --> 58:58.180
Yeah, I figured.

58:58.180 --> 59:00.340
That's how all Plasma software is.

59:00.340 --> 59:01.340
It already does.

59:01.340 --> 59:02.340
You just got to find it.

59:02.340 --> 59:04.780
Well, it's all a learning journey, right?

59:04.780 --> 59:05.940
Especially with Plasma.

59:05.940 --> 59:07.300
Yeah.

59:07.300 --> 59:09.220
All right, Brent, well, thanks for filling in

59:09.220 --> 59:10.100
on Mr. Paint's seat.

59:10.100 --> 59:10.620
Thanks for being here.

59:10.620 --> 59:11.460
This is a great seat.

59:11.460 --> 59:12.980
And we have missed Mr. West.

59:12.980 --> 59:14.300
Yeah, we have.

59:14.300 --> 59:16.660
Hey, Wes, how are you doing out there in Barcelona?

59:16.660 --> 59:17.820
Bubble worries.

59:17.820 --> 59:18.460
What was that?

59:18.460 --> 59:19.500
Bubble worries.

59:19.500 --> 59:21.260
Oh, bubble worries, OK.

59:21.260 --> 59:24.620
Yeah, he's out in Barcelona right now at Kubicon with Elle.

59:24.620 --> 59:26.300
So I'm sure they're doing OK.

59:26.300 --> 59:27.940
I think it's like 3 AM there right now.

59:27.940 --> 59:29.980
I would imagine they're partying at this point.

59:29.980 --> 59:32.540
I hope they're sleeping, to be honest with you.

59:32.540 --> 59:33.460
Because they've got to get back here,

59:33.460 --> 59:34.860
and they've got to get back on mic.

59:34.860 --> 59:37.460
So anyways, this show will be live next Tuesday.

59:37.460 --> 59:39.860
I think Mr. Paint will be back, assuming he's not

59:39.860 --> 59:40.620
too jet-lagged.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.420
You can get it converted to your local time

59:42.420 --> 59:44.380
at jupitabroadcasting.com calendar.

59:44.380 --> 59:46.860
LinuxUnplugged.com for our website.

59:46.860 --> 59:47.700
See you next Tuesday.

59:47.700 --> 01:00:16.940
I'll talk to you then.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:22.500
Holy smokes! Look at this, Wes Payne on the remote line. Wes, I can't believe you're here.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.460
Shocker.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:29.060
Hey buddy, so how are you feeling? Give me just like the quick elevator review

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.820
of how Kubicons gone so far.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.540
It's like the most boring rave I've ever been to.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.500
Really? Wow. Well, can I ask you something? Do you think,

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.220
do you feel like it's something that regular people would want to go to?

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.660
Could anybody do it, Wes? Could anybody be like you and go to Kubicons?

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.820
It turns out if you try hard enough, you can.

01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.980
Well, there you go. Wes, thank you so much for being here. See you later, buddy.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.860
But we'll, but we'll raise.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.660
Yeah. See you later.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:53.620
So nice to hear from him.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.260
Yeah, it really was.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:54.660
Good guy.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.900
What a champ showing up at 3 AM, huh?

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:57.300
I know.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.420
He's so dedicated.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.900
All right. Let's go pick our title. JBtitles.com. So Bruce, are you, are you still over there?

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.100
Are you still 3D printing?

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.260
I sure am. The lizards are still squealing.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.300
Oh, they really are.

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.260
Screaming salamanders.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:15.140
That is funny. Yeah. So if you, if you hear something in the background,

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.500
when Bruce talks, it sounds like a thousand salamanders being strangled.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.060
He's 3D printing what right now, Bruce?

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.100
So I've got this show thing coming up. So I'm printing things that I hope will be

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:28.260
interesting to people. So right now I'm doing a, what's called a self-watering flower pot.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:33.380
Oh, that is right. That is so cool. How is this self-watering flower pot?

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:40.820
This one's pretty basic. It's just, it's got a, an inner cone, basically with a perforated cone

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:45.460
inside that you plant the plant in that goes inside a bigger reservoir thing that you can water from

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.300
the side that, you know, you can fill it with water without having to pour it right in the dirt.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.220
It's supposed to just draw water up as it needs it.

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.820
And Bruce, can we get a clean salamander screaming sound here? Just an open mic.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:04.420
Yeah. It truly sounds like a torture chamber there for a second. Did you hear that?

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.660
Well, it's the sound of the stepper motor singing. So actually some people use the,

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:12.500
they use like, you just, you know how you had the people who did the floppy drives

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.180
doing songs and stuff like that? So they do, they could do the same thing with 3D printers.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.380
They can program the three motors on them to do harmonies and stuff like that.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.580
So if I was ever like torturing lizards in the background while doing a show,

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.860
I could just say I was 3D printing and people wouldn't know any better.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.540
What kind of 3D printer is it?

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:32.660
It's actually interesting that I've been looking for, I've had a little one for a while and 3D

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:37.540
prints are typically, you know, fairly expensive, usually over four figures to get one. And I walked

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:43.140
into a computer store and found this guy, which is a pretty standard size for 3D printers, which is

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:48.580
a 20 by 20 centimeter bed. And it was only 300 and some odd dollars.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:54.100
And then do you load everything onto an SD card or a USB thumb and pop that sucker in there? Or

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:55.380
is it actually hooked up to a machine?

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:57.540
This particular one can do both.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.740
How are you doing it though?

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:04.820
I'm doing it from the computer and that's because I want to be able to click on the screen and move

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:09.700
the head around for things like if I want to move the head out of the way for taking things off the

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.700
bed or stuff like that.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.860
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:15.700
Is that working on GNU slash Linux?

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.220
Absolutely. I wouldn't do it if it didn't.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.220
I love that answer.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:24.340
Hey, Bruce, I have a quick question for you. Have you discovered OctoPrint yet?

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:29.060
I know about it. I haven't gone to that level yet, but it's probably in my future. I have a

01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:35.380
couple of other... I have a RepRap 3D printer, which just needs a new part that belongs to the

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:39.940
makerspace that I'm part of. And another little guy that's only 100 by 100 millimeter that I think

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:44.020
I probably will end up putting Octopi on when we get our physical makerspace set up.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:49.940
And Bruce, I have a question as well. How many salamanders do you have to feed it per hour

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.540
to get to the output that you're looking for?

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:59.220
It's measured by millimeters of PLA, so it depends on what you're printing.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:03.060
Of course, right, obviously. Well, it's really exciting here that you're setting up a makerspace.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.940
How far along is that?

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:09.940
Well, a lot of the preparation is done. It's just a matter of... We've got a local space that's

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:14.900
probably about 15,000 square feet that we're dealing with the current owner that is probably

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.860
going to give us a sweet deal on it because it's community based and that sort of thing.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.260
So we're probably within a week or two of getting the signature and then moving in.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:23.300
It's going to be fantastic.

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:27.060
Congratulations. Will you please keep us updated? That's really awesome.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.180
I love to follow that kind of stuff. Can I ask where you are?

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:38.180
Barrie, Ontario, which is an hour north of Toronto and three hours south east of Brent.

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:38.740
Yeah.

01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:46.740
Oh, that's a nice reference. So I have given some talks at a makerspace in Sudbury and I would...

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.540
And actually when I was in Cranbrook recently at the coworking space, I was doing the podcasting

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:55.140
out of, they were saying, hey, we're just putting up a makerspace. So this is an area that I'm

01:04:55.140 --> 01:05:00.580
pretty interested in. And so with my having travels through Barrie often,

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.980
I would love to come see this space once you get it up and running.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.260
I've been thinking for a while and I've kind of put it out there a couple of times in the

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:11.620
chat room and stuff is that I think JB would do well with having some sort of a maker kind of

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:15.940
podcast. But of course, another thing on your plate is not... I mean, I would love to be part

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:20.980
of it, but time and stuff like that. I'm the kind of guy who can talk, but I've got four kids and

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.380
a makerspace to do, but I would like to be part of it. It might be something we can put together.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:30.020
Well, we'll talk more. Let's keep talking and yeah, maybe we'll get Brent out there

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.140
sometime. He can be our on the scene reporter and maybe we'll get going. Maybe something

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.980
will get rolling because I do want to do a makers podcast in the future. Well,

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.740
good luck Bruce and make sure those salamanders meet their doom.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.700
I'm keeping this puppy running as fast as often as I can.

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.260
Bruce, I would say hit me up in like Telegram or something, but I'd love to come down and

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:53.380
take a few photos for you if you need that kind of thing. I'll get you some extra assets.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.660
Yeah, media and promotion and all that kind of stuff is definitely valuable.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:06:14.260
Yeah, no kidding. It's a great idea, Brent.
