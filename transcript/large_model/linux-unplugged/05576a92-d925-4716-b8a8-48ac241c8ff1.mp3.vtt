WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.740
Well, Wes and I were having this conversation

00:01.740 --> 00:03.720
before the show started and it went something like this.

00:03.720 --> 00:07.240
It was, in some ways, Linux has suffered greatly

00:07.240 --> 00:09.280
by having its focus scattered across

00:09.280 --> 00:10.480
so many different initiatives

00:10.480 --> 00:12.200
and so many different efforts.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.400
You know, you have so many different takes

00:13.400 --> 00:18.040
even just on GTK desktops, let alone GNOME versus Plasma.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.280
Even in the Plasma space, you've got LXQ,

00:20.280 --> 00:22.640
there's all these different iterations.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.340
And you look at the Apple model or the Windows model

00:25.340 --> 00:27.140
and you go, if we just had a team

00:27.140 --> 00:29.720
that focused on a singular application,

00:29.720 --> 00:30.680
things would be a lot better.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.460
And the example you went to was Gparted, right?

00:33.460 --> 00:34.300
Oh yeah, right.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.120
Gparted's fine, but it really hasn't gotten a ton better.

00:38.120 --> 00:39.600
And there's other partition managers

00:39.600 --> 00:42.380
like Kpart or whatever it is that are fine,

00:42.380 --> 00:45.320
but they're not like the definitive beat all tools.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.560
And if we were developing one partition manager,

00:47.560 --> 00:50.340
it would probably be pretty great at this point.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.980
And I think all of us have always,

00:51.980 --> 00:53.920
you know, we've thought about that.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.760
But in light of the news of IBM buying Red Hat,

00:57.760 --> 01:00.000
you kind of have to appreciate the,

01:01.560 --> 01:02.400
I don't know what to call it.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.080
There's like upsides of this diversity of thought, right?

01:05.080 --> 01:05.920
Yeah.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.380
We have less net things per unit,

01:07.380 --> 01:09.320
but we have a lot of redundancy.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.920
It takes us way longer to get there in some cases,

01:12.920 --> 01:17.640
but we also are not victim to the bus factor as much.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.320
Linux could be hurt if say,

01:19.320 --> 01:22.120
all of Red Hat's open source desktop initiatives

01:22.120 --> 01:23.640
went away in a year.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.980
Desktop Linux would be hurt,

01:24.980 --> 01:27.160
but that code would still be free software.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.700
It wouldn't end desktop Linux.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.720
And those contributors that worked at Red Hat

01:30.720 --> 01:32.240
could still decide to contribute.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.080
They have-

01:33.080 --> 01:33.900
People could pick it up.

01:33.900 --> 01:34.920
Like, yeah, there's a lot of options.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.540
So it is both a blessing and a curse in a sense,

01:38.540 --> 01:41.220
because sometimes it means we can't have the shiniest,

01:41.220 --> 01:44.160
but it also means you really can't take it away from us.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.440
Yeah, I think that's why you have to be careful.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.520
When you, I mean, you just said, if it goes away,

01:48.520 --> 01:49.780
I mean, it won't go away.

01:49.780 --> 01:50.620
It's free software.

01:50.620 --> 01:51.440
It's out on the internet.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.600
None of this stuff is going to go away.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.720
And I'm a glass half full kind of guy,

01:55.720 --> 01:58.280
and I don't have any inside knowledge

01:58.280 --> 01:59.640
of the IBM Red Hat deal,

01:59.640 --> 02:02.680
but I can't see them throwing away that giant body

02:02.680 --> 02:04.640
of good free software.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.320
I just can't see that happening.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.120
And so, and even if it did,

02:10.120 --> 02:11.240
the software is still out there.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.440
People will coalesce around it,

02:12.440 --> 02:13.440
who are passionate about it,

02:13.440 --> 02:14.480
and we'll keep it going,

02:14.480 --> 02:16.200
just like every other free software project

02:16.200 --> 02:20.160
that gets dumped by, you know, a corporation.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.840
This is Linux Unplugged,

02:22.840 --> 02:26.920
episode 273 for October 30th, 2018.

02:26.920 --> 02:31.920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

02:40.160 --> 02:41.080
that's sort of wishing

02:41.080 --> 02:43.080
it was a stock advice show right now.

02:43.080 --> 02:43.920
My name is Chris.

02:43.920 --> 02:44.760
My name is Wes.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.260
Oh, some of that Red Hat stock

02:46.260 --> 02:47.680
would be looking pretty good.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.960
We have a big show for you this week.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.920
I'm back from the BSD den,

02:52.920 --> 02:55.160
went down, hanged out,

02:55.160 --> 02:56.880
meet BSD at the Intel campus.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.440
I'll give you my book report

02:58.440 --> 03:00.520
on how it went at meet BSD.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.440
Then we'll get into some community news.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.240
Well, actually we'll start with some community news,

03:04.240 --> 03:07.500
including that massive IBM buying Red Hat story,

03:07.500 --> 03:08.840
but there's other things too to talk about.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.880
In fact, there's quite a bit of community news

03:10.880 --> 03:12.760
that I would still consider this a packed news show.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.040
Oh yeah, even if that didn't happen,

03:14.040 --> 03:15.040
it's a giant show.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.120
We've been doing less news,

03:16.120 --> 03:17.660
but there's just so much we gotta talk about,

03:17.660 --> 03:18.500
so much going on.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.720
The community keeps making news.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.560
It's great.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.040
It's a good time to be a Linux user.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.700
And then today, as we record the latest

03:25.700 --> 03:28.740
and greatest Fedora, Fedora 29 is out.

03:28.740 --> 03:31.960
We'll give you our first impressions of Fedora 29,

03:31.960 --> 03:35.040
and I'll tell you about my favorite feature

03:35.040 --> 03:38.140
that I am so excited to see finally land in Fedora.

03:38.140 --> 03:42.420
Also, my report, good or bad,

03:42.420 --> 03:44.720
on how my Fedora cloud upgrade went.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.840
This is the one that I've been upgrading for a while now,

03:46.840 --> 03:48.500
and it's now also the home

03:48.500 --> 03:50.460
to my in-production Nextcloud instance.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.720
So this, it mattered more than-

03:51.720 --> 03:52.560
This upgrade counts.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.400
It was, yeah, this upgrade really counted,

03:54.400 --> 03:55.900
so I'll give you my report

03:55.900 --> 03:58.180
on how that upgrade went as well.

03:58.180 --> 04:00.440
Then some follow-up items from the past couple of episodes,

04:00.440 --> 04:02.800
as well as a huge announcement for a friend of the show,

04:02.800 --> 04:05.020
and then a couple of workarounds

04:05.020 --> 04:06.840
if you're sticking with Dropbox

04:06.840 --> 04:08.560
and don't feel like formatting your disk,

04:08.560 --> 04:10.200
give you a couple of workarounds for that.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.760
I can tell you're thinking about this a lot.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.600
Who, me?

04:12.600 --> 04:13.420
Yeah, you.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.260
But before we go any further,

04:14.260 --> 04:16.040
we gotta bring in that virtual log.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.640
Time, appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.680
Good morning.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.920
Hello, hello, everybody.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.520
We got Eric in there, MiniMech, Popey, Sean,

04:24.520 --> 04:25.760
and is that two Seans?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.800
No, C, I gotta look, I'm an old man,

04:27.800 --> 04:28.640
and Wimpy.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.540
It's good to have you guys in there.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.340
Rumor has it a few others may be trickling in

04:32.340 --> 04:33.920
as the show goes along.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.880
Speegling, speaking, speegling, speegling, Wes,

04:36.880 --> 04:40.060
speeglingling of trickling in.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.840
Mr. Linus Torvalds is trickling back

04:41.840 --> 04:43.440
into command of the Linux kernel.

04:43.440 --> 04:44.800
That will be old news.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.140
This is actually kind of old news now

04:46.140 --> 04:47.640
by the time we're talking about it in this show.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.280
I mean, the Ubuntu podcast guys

04:49.280 --> 04:50.920
talked about it on last Thursday.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.840
It was fresh for them.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.280
They got, the Ubuntu podcast guys

04:54.280 --> 04:57.720
were the first, I believe, to air with the story.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.100
Yeah, look at you guys over there,

04:59.100 --> 05:00.360
Mr. Breakin' News over there

05:00.360 --> 05:02.600
at the Ubuntu podcast decision.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.280
This is CNN Breakin' News.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.120
And-

05:06.120 --> 05:06.960
But you don't have to watch CNN.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.120
You can just listen to the great Ubuntu podcast instead.

05:09.120 --> 05:09.960
I like them more.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.640
It's way better, it's way better, yeah.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.720
So this is kind of old news,

05:12.720 --> 05:15.040
but I just wanted to kind of close the loop on this story.

05:15.040 --> 05:19.880
Greg Kh posted in the kernel 4.19 release announcement,

05:19.880 --> 05:21.480
and it's a long post.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.240
And right in there, he writes a couple of things

05:24.240 --> 05:26.160
that I thought were powerful statements,

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
powerful, that we should read here on the show.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.040
He says, these past few months

05:30.040 --> 05:32.440
have been tough one for our community,

05:32.440 --> 05:35.460
as it is our community that is fighting from within itself,

05:35.460 --> 05:36.960
the prodding from others out,

05:36.960 --> 05:39.640
and with prodding from outside.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.180
Don't fall into the cycle of arguing about those others.

05:43.180 --> 05:44.960
That is the trap that countless communities

05:44.960 --> 05:46.920
have fallen into over the centuries.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.400
We all share the same goal.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.500
Let us never lose sight of that.

05:51.660 --> 05:52.500
It's good.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.320
That's a good message.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.160
I mean, it's true, right?

05:54.160 --> 05:56.200
I mean, we're all here for the same reason,

05:56.200 --> 05:58.080
to support the same project, to help the project grow.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.600
The thing that resonates there with me, Mr. West,

06:00.600 --> 06:02.540
the real synergy I got with that, you know,

06:02.540 --> 06:04.040
the top level thing there-

06:04.040 --> 06:04.880
Oh, stop, oh, stop.

06:04.880 --> 06:05.720
Okay, sorry.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.680
This is something that has affected countless communities

06:11.680 --> 06:12.520
over the centuries.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.200
It's a human nature thing.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.440
It's not a Linux kernel mailing list thing.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.280
And that's true, right?

06:17.280 --> 06:19.600
I mean, this is a human activity done by lots of humans

06:19.600 --> 06:21.080
with different motivations and goals,

06:21.080 --> 06:22.440
and that's what makes it so difficult.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.260
He wraps it up with, and with all of that, Linus,

06:25.260 --> 06:26.800
I'm handing the kernel tree back to you.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.640
You can have the joy of dealing with the next merge window.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.460
I'm outta here.

06:30.460 --> 06:31.300
That's good.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.720
It's good to see Linus back.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.900
Everybody's been watching to see how Linus behaves.

06:36.900 --> 06:41.900
Like, the spotlight was on him before, but holy crap.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.820
Now it's like everything he's writing

06:44.820 --> 06:46.740
is being analyzed by the news media.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.580
Have you seen this?

06:47.580 --> 06:49.860
Like, people are just copying and pasting,

06:49.860 --> 06:51.340
like mail, his entire post.

06:51.340 --> 06:54.500
Yeah, he writes something and then it's news now.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.460
Oh, that's annoying.

06:55.460 --> 06:56.420
Let the man work.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.360
I don't know, mumble room, any take on Linus being back?

06:59.360 --> 07:01.460
Was that a long enough break for him to really make

07:01.460 --> 07:03.980
an actual substantive change?

07:03.980 --> 07:05.140
What do you guys think?

07:05.140 --> 07:07.980
That's long enough for him to put an email filter

07:07.980 --> 07:09.060
on his email system.

07:09.060 --> 07:10.060
So yeah, probably.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.260
Is that the takeaway here?

07:11.260 --> 07:13.420
Is that the lesson that Linus learned?

07:13.420 --> 07:14.720
Because that's what everybody's talking about.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.380
Well, it looks like you put a filter on.

07:17.380 --> 07:20.280
It will be the most popular email filter in history

07:20.280 --> 07:23.040
and everyone will be using it this time next year.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.340
There will be whole businesses built on top of it.

07:26.340 --> 07:27.580
And IBM will buy them.

07:28.900 --> 07:29.900
There it is.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.140
I would hope the willingness to implement a filter.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.840
Like, I don't think any of this is a thing

07:33.840 --> 07:35.140
you learn in a month.

07:35.140 --> 07:37.580
Hopefully it just means that he's thinking about it.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.560
These are things he's aware of

07:38.560 --> 07:40.140
and that there's a little more focus

07:40.140 --> 07:41.820
on the health of the community.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.020
Yeah, it's an ongoing thing.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.700
Right, it has to be.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.600
That's a good point, Wes.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.440
That's very wise.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.280
That was sage.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.100
I like that.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.020
This is something I could use some sage wisdom for.

07:50.020 --> 07:51.980
Now, Michael Aribel over at Ferronix,

07:51.980 --> 07:52.980
and I haven't seen,

07:52.980 --> 07:55.820
I don't think I've seen confirmation of this anywhere else.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.900
So keep that in mind.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.580
But, cause it seems like big news.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.060
He's reporting that Samsung has apparently shut down

08:03.060 --> 08:05.320
the Samsung open source group,

08:05.320 --> 08:07.460
commonly known as Samsung OSG,

08:07.460 --> 08:09.240
which you'll see like in their kernel contributions

08:09.240 --> 08:10.740
or whatnot.

08:10.740 --> 08:15.740
And it appears that they are disbanding this division,

08:17.180 --> 08:21.060
which is responsible for quite a bit of contributions.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.100
They've been around since 2012.

08:23.100 --> 08:26.500
They employ a dozen developers for a number of years now.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.880
Yeah, and I mean, they've contributed to things like,

08:27.880 --> 08:32.820
well, Wayland, Xorg, Cairo, Klang, Gstreamer, FFmpeg,

08:32.820 --> 08:35.100
and of course a whole bunch to that there Linux kernel

08:35.100 --> 08:36.860
we were just talking about.

08:36.860 --> 08:38.340
Yeah, so it would kind of be a big deal,

08:38.340 --> 08:39.740
especially you got to wonder about Wayland

08:39.740 --> 08:41.020
if they were to go away.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.340
They're usually in the top five kernel contributors,

08:43.340 --> 08:45.420
like the total in the top five.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.420
I mean, and this just feels very, very timely, right?

08:47.420 --> 08:49.580
Where corporations play a big part

08:49.580 --> 08:51.980
and they are not obligated to in open source development.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.820
So we just, right, we're lucky to have them.

08:53.820 --> 08:55.300
We benefit from this.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.900
Why are they closing this?

08:56.900 --> 08:57.740
Maybe they're done.

08:57.740 --> 08:58.680
Like, hey, we got everything we needed.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.940
All right, well, Google says,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.080
we're going to have to use this kernel

09:01.080 --> 09:02.220
for the next X amount of years.

09:02.220 --> 09:03.860
So we don't have to develop any new drivers for a while.

09:03.860 --> 09:04.700
We're out.

09:04.700 --> 09:05.520
See you.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.360
But that's not how it works.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.460
That's not how software development works.

09:07.460 --> 09:10.420
So it could be a hundred things.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.000
It could be just a restructuring.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.100
Right, that's still the open source work.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.420
It's just under one umbrella anymore.

09:15.420 --> 09:16.260
It's a good question.

09:16.260 --> 09:18.460
One hopes, Wes, one certainly hopes

09:18.460 --> 09:21.740
because it is funny, I'm not Samsung's biggest fan,

09:22.740 --> 09:24.980
but it seems like they've made genuine contributions

09:24.980 --> 09:27.660
that really have made a difference.

09:27.660 --> 09:29.980
I mean, you look in the top five, that matters.

09:29.980 --> 09:30.820
That matters.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.940
Hopefully it's not a total abandonment.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.500
It also makes me think about just,

09:34.500 --> 09:36.320
we look at like Linux kernel contributors,

09:36.320 --> 09:38.860
but when a company contributes across so many projects,

09:38.860 --> 09:40.020
we don't often get a view

09:40.020 --> 09:41.420
into just all the things they're doing.

09:41.420 --> 09:42.740
You might see pockets of that.

09:42.740 --> 09:44.080
Oh, they support Krita or whatever,

09:44.080 --> 09:46.820
but a lot of these companies are pretty broad support.

09:48.140 --> 09:49.140
You're touching on something there

09:49.140 --> 09:51.040
that really grinds my gears, Wes.

09:51.040 --> 09:54.060
And that is that a lot of times these companies

09:54.060 --> 09:55.380
are contributing to open source

09:55.380 --> 09:56.580
and they do it kind of quietly.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.900
Like you're not even aware of what they're doing.

09:58.900 --> 10:02.100
And there's a real resistance to them talking about it.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.660
They don't, and I say this from somebody

10:04.660 --> 10:06.180
who tries to talk to them about it.

10:06.180 --> 10:08.180
And it's, they'll talk to you

10:09.880 --> 10:12.860
in like a non-formal setting off air,

10:12.860 --> 10:15.540
but they won't talk to you in any official capacity.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.300
And when you go to events in a lot of cases,

10:18.300 --> 10:19.980
they won't even talk to me.

10:19.980 --> 10:22.620
Like I can't, I'm not allowed to like speak to an engineer.

10:22.620 --> 10:25.260
Like if their engineer realizes that I'm from the media,

10:25.260 --> 10:26.740
then they go grab the PR person

10:26.740 --> 10:28.140
and I have to talk to the PR person.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.100
And then if I have questions, I have to schedule it.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.160
And like, I just completely lose all access.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.460
They don't, they don't want to talk about it.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.620
And I think it's for liability.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.780
Is this still like a business enterprise

10:39.780 --> 10:41.620
sort of uncomfortability with open source?

10:41.620 --> 10:43.540
Like it's okay to do the lawyers vet things,

10:43.540 --> 10:45.980
but it's not our business line, it's not our core thing.

10:45.980 --> 10:47.540
We don't want to talk about it.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.860
Or it's a liability thing, like from the patent wars.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.060
Or it could be simple things like, you know,

10:52.060 --> 10:55.340
companies like Samsung work on, yes, stuff like Wayland,

10:55.340 --> 10:57.060
but you look at where they put it.

10:57.060 --> 10:59.380
They may be developing IVI systems

10:59.380 --> 11:01.680
for large motor vehicle manufacturers.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.180
And those people, those motor vehicle manufacturers

11:04.180 --> 11:05.620
are probably the kind of people

11:05.620 --> 11:08.300
who don't want this kind of information revealed

11:08.300 --> 11:10.980
because it's so competitive, such cutthroat market.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.420
They don't want some engineer

11:13.420 --> 11:15.620
at the bottom of the stack at Samsung

11:15.620 --> 11:18.140
revealing that there's some deal going on

11:18.140 --> 11:20.580
for the next generation infotainment system

11:20.580 --> 11:23.780
in their new car that's not even out yet.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.780
Have you run into this working, you know,

11:25.780 --> 11:27.220
through Canonical? Yeah, totally.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.220
Yeah, it's frustrating, isn't it?

11:29.220 --> 11:30.140
Yep.

11:30.140 --> 11:33.940
All right, well, I've said my piece.

11:33.940 --> 11:35.940
And so, yeah, it's, but going,

11:35.940 --> 11:37.500
what you said that made me think about this is like,

11:37.500 --> 11:39.700
we don't really have a great window

11:39.700 --> 11:41.020
into what their contributions were.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.500
So how do we quantify what the loss is?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.340
Yeah, exactly.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.820
Like we have an idea by, oh, well,

11:44.820 --> 11:46.380
here's a percentage of code contributions

11:46.380 --> 11:47.220
to the Linux kernel.

11:47.220 --> 11:49.940
That seems valuable, but it doesn't really tell me what.

11:49.940 --> 11:53.860
Is it support for some stupid vibrator

11:53.860 --> 11:55.140
in a Samsung phone somewhere?

11:55.140 --> 11:56.100
I mean, is that what that,

11:56.100 --> 11:57.900
was that what that kernel contribution was?

11:57.900 --> 11:59.740
Or was it to make it possible for Wayland

11:59.740 --> 12:04.140
to render the Firefox pop-up on a very different scale?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.660
There's way more development that happens

12:05.660 --> 12:07.540
outside of the Linux kernel as well,

12:07.540 --> 12:10.100
that, you know, revolves around hardware enablement

12:10.100 --> 12:10.940
and what have you.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.700
Yeah, yeah, boy, there's,

12:12.700 --> 12:15.180
we could do a whole episode on that, really.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.380
It's a fascinating world.

12:16.380 --> 12:20.300
I got some insight into that when I was down at Dell

12:20.300 --> 12:22.500
and I was watching how they work upstream

12:22.500 --> 12:25.300
with different hardware OEMs and yeah,

12:25.300 --> 12:26.420
it's fascinating stuff.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.420
But I'd like to take a moment

12:28.420 --> 12:32.740
and talk about some rapid pace development around Proton.

12:33.780 --> 12:38.780
You can now play 2,600 Windows games on Linux

12:39.860 --> 12:42.900
via that Steam Play, which is using Proton underneath.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.780
That is, that is massive.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.620
That is a huge accomplishment.

12:46.620 --> 12:49.700
And along with this, kind of an addendum to this,

12:49.700 --> 12:52.860
is the launch of ProtonDB at Protondb.com.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.500
I'd like you guys just to know about this.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.620
You may remember when we first talked

12:56.620 --> 12:58.180
about Steam Play on this show,

12:58.180 --> 13:00.500
I mentioned there was a Google Docs spreadsheet

13:00.500 --> 13:03.380
that was keeping track of the games that was compatible.

13:03.380 --> 13:04.220
Oh yeah, right.

13:04.220 --> 13:08.340
Well, that's now developed into Protondb.com.

13:08.340 --> 13:13.340
And it got so popular they basically broke Google Docs.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.980
For a while they were just breaking Google Docs.

13:14.980 --> 13:16.580
It was pretty funny.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.460
So they have all kinds of compatibility reports

13:18.460 --> 13:21.220
and whatnot, and to celebrate the.com launch,

13:21.220 --> 13:25.020
they're also redesigning the look of the overall database.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.620
Like they're making it look really nice.

13:26.620 --> 13:27.860
Get the initial data reports in there

13:27.860 --> 13:28.900
so it's easier for people to see

13:28.900 --> 13:31.180
what the compatibility expectations are.

13:31.180 --> 13:34.780
And it's sort of remarkable to me.

13:34.780 --> 13:36.700
Oh, there's some good games in here too.

13:36.700 --> 13:40.220
I mean, gosh, classics to modern stuff.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.020
Like it's all over the map.

13:42.020 --> 13:44.460
Yeah, it's remarkable to me that they've gone

13:44.460 --> 13:46.740
to 2,500 games and this community

13:46.740 --> 13:49.260
that looks almost like it's a commercial venture.

13:49.260 --> 13:51.420
Like this site, this Protondb site.

13:51.420 --> 13:52.260
It's well made, yeah.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.180
It's branded pretty nicely, it doesn't look bad.

13:54.180 --> 13:58.780
18,459 compatibility reports in this database

13:58.780 --> 14:00.140
for those 2,000 games.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.780
So it's the year of the Linux gaming desktop.

14:02.780 --> 14:05.340
And just to circle back again on another topic

14:05.340 --> 14:07.740
is I've now gotten multiple confirmations.

14:07.740 --> 14:09.540
And aren't you one of them actually?

14:09.540 --> 14:11.140
People in the Google Stream beta,

14:11.140 --> 14:16.140
like the streaming video games under GNU slash Linux.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.540
Hey, it's happening.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.940
15 megabits is like the absolute minimum

14:19.940 --> 14:21.540
it's gonna work with something around there.

14:21.540 --> 14:25.980
And you have to have like less than 5% packet loss

14:25.980 --> 14:29.980
and less than 1% is recommended.

14:29.980 --> 14:32.460
And for a while it wanted you to have

14:32.460 --> 14:34.420
an external controller to plug in as well.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.620
I don't know if that's still true.

14:35.620 --> 14:36.900
I don't know, I don't think so, actually.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.140
It sounds like it's not.

14:38.140 --> 14:42.980
So you combine that streaming system with Proton.

14:42.980 --> 14:45.900
It's a really good time to be a hardcore gamer

14:45.900 --> 14:46.740
like Wimpy.

14:46.740 --> 14:47.980
I mean, Wimpy's a hardcore gamer.

14:47.980 --> 14:48.820
Hardcore.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.140
I'm just pretty excited.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.660
Have you tried any of these Wimpy

14:51.660 --> 14:52.980
with all the travels you've been doing?

14:52.980 --> 14:55.420
Have you had a chance to try the Proton thing out?

14:55.420 --> 14:57.580
Not while I've been traveling, but at home I have.

14:57.580 --> 15:02.260
I've invested in probably more than a dozen racing games

15:02.260 --> 15:04.860
that were originally launched for Windows.

15:04.860 --> 15:09.780
And some of the ones I enjoyed on the PS3 years ago,

15:09.780 --> 15:11.660
some of the Need for Speed series.

15:11.660 --> 15:15.340
And I'm playing those quite happily now on my Linux desktop.

15:15.340 --> 15:18.820
Also, I have a question for you.

15:18.820 --> 15:21.660
I thought I saw you on Twitter posting pictures of a ThinkPad,

15:21.660 --> 15:25.700
but I thought you got a new XPS or a new Dell 15.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.380
I went with ThinkPad in the end.

15:27.380 --> 15:28.900
Yeah, so I have the ThinkPad now.

15:28.900 --> 15:29.980
No, really?

15:29.980 --> 15:31.900
That bald Serp he would, gosh.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.100
Yeah, and how has it been?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.580
Have you had much of a chance to play with it?

15:36.580 --> 15:38.900
I'm using it right now.

15:38.900 --> 15:41.220
And you upgraded, what was it, the RAM and the drive

15:41.220 --> 15:42.460
in that thing?

15:42.460 --> 15:46.100
Well, I couldn't upgrade the RAM post-market

15:46.100 --> 15:51.940
because only major OEMs can actually get the 32 gig DIMMs.

15:51.940 --> 15:53.740
So that delayed the order, in fact.

15:53.740 --> 15:54.260
Oh, wow.

15:54.260 --> 15:55.900
So I think I may have been the first person

15:55.900 --> 15:58.300
to actually order one of these with 64 gigs of RAM.

15:58.300 --> 15:58.820
Oh.

15:58.820 --> 16:01.460
Oh.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.180
What are you doing to us?

16:03.180 --> 16:07.420
Yeah, but so I couldn't source those after market.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.580
So I had to get it ordered with that.

16:09.580 --> 16:13.300
But I ordered it with the cheapest SSD option,

16:13.300 --> 16:15.900
which was a 256 gig SSD.

16:15.900 --> 16:20.980
And then purchased some 970 EVOs, a 512 and a 2 terabytes.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.380
So two drives.

16:22.380 --> 16:22.940
Yeah.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.260
So I've left Windows on the drive it came with,

16:26.260 --> 16:27.940
put the two new drives in, and I've

16:27.940 --> 16:32.540
got a 500 gig boot partition and a 2 terabyte home partition.

16:32.540 --> 16:33.260
Oh, my gosh.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.660
What do you need 2 terabytes?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.380
Is that for VMs, for home drives?

16:36.380 --> 16:38.180
Think about how many electron amps he runs?

16:38.180 --> 16:41.340
It's for all the code that I work on and all of the VMs.

16:41.340 --> 16:44.060
Just copies of data.

16:44.060 --> 16:44.940
Just stuff.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.420
This is a five year machine, at least.

16:47.420 --> 16:48.460
Yeah, I think so.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.940
In fact, since I've had it for a few days

16:50.940 --> 16:53.500
now, because I've still got back at the weekend

16:53.500 --> 16:56.340
and it had arrived whilst I'd been away,

16:56.340 --> 16:58.100
and I've decided to go all in with this.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.180
So I've actually ordered the Thunderbolt docking

17:01.180 --> 17:02.460
station for it.

17:02.460 --> 17:04.300
And I'm going to set that up and actually use

17:04.300 --> 17:08.020
this as not just my laptop, but my main workstation for work.

17:08.020 --> 17:11.860
So I will plug it into the Thunderbolt dock, which

17:11.860 --> 17:13.900
connects to the screens and everything else.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.700
Have you decided which Thunderbolt dock

17:15.700 --> 17:16.420
you're going with, because I've been

17:16.420 --> 17:17.900
considering doing the same thing?

17:17.900 --> 17:20.660
Yeah, there's a new one that Lenovo have released.

17:20.660 --> 17:21.980
Oh, really?

17:21.980 --> 17:26.020
Yeah, that has an adapter that connects alongside the power.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.820
So the power adapter in the laptop

17:27.820 --> 17:29.740
is next to one of the Thunderbolt ports.

17:29.740 --> 17:33.940
And they've made a cable, which connects to both of those

17:33.940 --> 17:35.380
in one connector.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.620
Do you have a link?

17:36.620 --> 17:37.540
That's it right there.

17:37.540 --> 17:38.260
That's what I want.

17:38.260 --> 17:40.660
Yeah, I can look one up and send it over to you.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.260
This is great.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.020
So does this mean if you're switching away

17:43.020 --> 17:44.220
from the Dell to the ThinkPad, I'm

17:44.220 --> 17:46.060
not going to be looking up your nose whenever

17:46.060 --> 17:47.660
we're having video chats?

17:47.660 --> 17:48.820
This is true.

17:48.820 --> 17:50.700
In fact, it sounds ridiculous, right?

17:50.700 --> 17:53.180
But the placement of the webcam was actually

17:53.180 --> 17:55.260
a serious consideration in all of this,

17:55.260 --> 17:59.340
and I would say was actually the clinching feature that

17:59.340 --> 18:00.340
took me over the edge.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.100
Because everyone talks about how small the Dell bezels are,

18:03.100 --> 18:05.500
but the bezels on this are also very small, too.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.820
Yeah.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.740
Apple announced a new MacBook with small bezels today.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.280
And one of the things they specifically

18:11.280 --> 18:13.100
took time in the announcement to call out

18:13.100 --> 18:16.540
was that they had placed the camera at the top of the screen

18:16.540 --> 18:18.460
because people care about that kind of thing.

18:18.460 --> 18:21.260
And I completely agree.

18:21.260 --> 18:24.380
I do Zoom meetings a lot now, a lot of Zoom meetings.

18:24.380 --> 18:27.580
And their whole video, everybody's looking at my face.

18:27.580 --> 18:30.540
So that was an issue when I was reviewing the Precision.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.300
Or I'm sorry, when I was using the XPS,

18:33.300 --> 18:36.020
and the Precision has the same thing.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.740
So you wouldn't want to just carry around a little C920

18:38.740 --> 18:39.580
or whatever?

18:39.580 --> 18:40.740
No, no way.

18:40.740 --> 18:41.580
No, I don't think so.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.740
But what if you already have to live the Dell Go lifestyle?

18:43.740 --> 18:45.020
You've already got your little Go bag.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.340
No, because the cord's not good.

18:46.340 --> 18:47.340
It's long.

18:47.340 --> 18:48.620
Well, congratulations, Wimpy.

18:48.620 --> 18:53.060
This one's got a mini RJ45 port in it,

18:53.060 --> 18:55.180
which is a proper Gigabit Ethernet port.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.740
And it has a little stub that expands that

18:57.740 --> 19:00.020
into a regular RJ45.

19:00.020 --> 19:02.860
So it has proper Ethernet on it as well.

19:02.860 --> 19:06.260
And it's got USB-A and USB-C ports on it,

19:06.260 --> 19:08.780
and HDMI ports and head jack ports.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.420
It's got plenty of I.O.

19:11.420 --> 19:13.900
This is a serious, this is a serious dock.

19:13.900 --> 19:16.260
This is not cheap, but it's really nice.

19:16.260 --> 19:17.860
Yeah, there's a version of that that's

19:17.860 --> 19:21.060
more expensive that's got an NVIDIA graphics card in it

19:21.060 --> 19:21.580
as well.

19:21.580 --> 19:23.180
Oh, was I not just talking about that?

19:23.180 --> 19:24.020
You just were.

19:24.020 --> 19:25.380
Before we started going on there,

19:25.380 --> 19:26.540
I was like, you know what would be really nice?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.700
Is to do an eGPU Thunderbolt dock.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.700
Yeah, well, I don't need that because I've already

19:30.700 --> 19:31.700
got the eGPU.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.220
So I'm just getting the one that's, you know,

19:34.220 --> 19:35.700
connect all of your stuff up.

19:35.700 --> 19:36.780
Yeah.

19:36.780 --> 19:37.500
Oh, man.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.460
Well, I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on how

19:40.460 --> 19:42.220
the dock works out, because I think I want to pick one up,

19:42.220 --> 19:42.900
too.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.700
So I may live vicariously through you for a bit.

19:46.700 --> 19:52.540
Well, speaking of new hardware, our friends at System76

19:52.540 --> 19:56.540
have been teasing this Thelio system for a while.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.660
And we've got some details.

19:58.660 --> 20:00.260
Yeah, OK, so they're not actually

20:00.260 --> 20:02.460
going to announce it until, well, November 1.

20:02.460 --> 20:06.580
So it's soon, but you don't have to wait that long.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.020
They're calling them open hardware systems.

20:09.020 --> 20:11.940
And in theory, they're shipping in December.

20:11.940 --> 20:16.040
Yeah, and so I had the fortune of Carl

20:16.040 --> 20:18.380
willing to be able to stay up late and email exchange

20:18.380 --> 20:20.780
with me last night to answer some of my questions

20:20.780 --> 20:23.540
about what do they mean by open hardware,

20:23.540 --> 20:26.820
where's the innovation here, what's different about this.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.820
And so I got some insight into that.

20:28.820 --> 20:31.660
And I think the first thing I want to clarify

20:31.660 --> 20:34.300
is what makes Thelio open hardware, because that's,

20:34.300 --> 20:35.500
I think, a big question here.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.340
And according to them, Thelio's design

20:38.340 --> 20:40.540
that they've been working on for more than three years now

20:40.540 --> 20:42.940
is completely open source.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.460
Anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell

20:45.460 --> 20:47.820
the design of the hardware.

20:47.820 --> 20:49.420
I'll get into that again in a second.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.040
I'll come back to that.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.580
But another part that I think is maybe

20:51.580 --> 20:55.820
the part that's more interesting to the audience is,

20:55.820 --> 20:59.180
he writes in a blog post, to further our open computer

20:59.180 --> 21:02.420
ambition, we are working to remove functionality

21:02.420 --> 21:05.940
from the proprietary main board, like the motherboard.

21:05.940 --> 21:08.300
To that end, we've designed Thelio IO,

21:08.300 --> 21:12.460
a daughter board that manages thermal and chassis control,

21:12.460 --> 21:16.260
also providing storage backplane for the drives in Thelio.

21:16.260 --> 21:18.260
So they've got this daughter board system where

21:18.260 --> 21:19.860
they're going to be moving the proprietary functionality.

21:19.860 --> 21:20.100
I see.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.780
So all of your little proprietary blobs

21:21.780 --> 21:24.420
or chipsets that need them, black boxes,

21:24.420 --> 21:27.220
that's on one board, then just standard more open components

21:27.220 --> 21:29.020
can be on the actual main board.

21:29.020 --> 21:30.260
Yeah, exactly.

21:30.260 --> 21:33.260
So I had an email thread back and forth with Carl.

21:33.260 --> 21:36.620
And this machine, first of all, they're

21:36.620 --> 21:39.520
going to have three SKUs of it, essentially,

21:39.520 --> 21:41.540
like big, bigger, and massive.

21:41.540 --> 21:45.740
And they're going to be desktop x86 workstations

21:45.740 --> 21:47.660
with a ton of horsepower.

21:47.660 --> 21:48.640
Like beefy.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.100
The thing they're doing that is hard to describe in audio,

21:51.100 --> 21:53.580
but when you see it in pictures, looks really sharp,

21:53.580 --> 21:57.100
is they've worked on this custom case design

21:57.100 --> 21:59.780
that even the back end of it's beautiful.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.660
Like it's just really clean.

22:01.660 --> 22:05.980
But it is a combination of brushed metal

22:05.980 --> 22:09.100
with like a metal powder coated finishing.

22:09.100 --> 22:09.980
Oh, yeah, premium.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.860
Really nice.

22:11.860 --> 22:12.540
And wood.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.460
Wait, wood?

22:13.460 --> 22:13.980
And wood.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.900
So like maples in there, and it looks really

22:15.900 --> 22:17.580
like it's got this beautiful contrast

22:17.580 --> 22:19.420
when the black and the maple wood.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.300
And there's no seams, like no bumps.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.140
This sounds like a premium desktop.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.980
It looks really good.

22:24.980 --> 22:27.140
So this one goes on the desk, not under the desk.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.940
Yeah, it looks really good.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.740
I won't share all the details, but what I did get to see,

22:31.740 --> 22:33.740
and what I did learn about it, it

22:33.740 --> 22:38.420
looks like a killer Linux desktop, just something

22:38.420 --> 22:40.980
that they've put probably more effort into than I think

22:40.980 --> 22:42.860
they've ever put into any other product.

22:42.860 --> 22:45.980
And it's a big commitment, because this

22:45.980 --> 22:48.340
is the first thing they're making in this new factory,

22:48.340 --> 22:49.220
is this.

22:49.220 --> 22:49.780
Is that right?

22:49.780 --> 22:50.220
OK.

22:50.220 --> 22:50.900
And then he says long term.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.020
So this is the testing ground.

22:52.020 --> 22:55.300
Yeah, long term, their goal is to work

22:55.300 --> 22:57.860
to try to open the rest of the hardware in the machine.

22:57.860 --> 23:00.140
Right, because right now it sounds like open hardware

23:00.140 --> 23:01.500
kind of means open specs.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.540
Like here's how you put all these proprietary parts

23:03.540 --> 23:09.220
together, and with some effort made to use less of them.

23:09.220 --> 23:12.740
I can tell Carl's really excited about it,

23:12.740 --> 23:14.020
and he got me excited about it.

23:14.020 --> 23:16.780
I would say after I read his description of the machine,

23:16.780 --> 23:18.900
it exceeded what my expectations were of what

23:18.900 --> 23:20.340
they would be working on.

23:20.340 --> 23:24.100
And we have pretty soon, November 1st, that's pretty soon.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.140
Right around the corner.

23:25.140 --> 23:27.220
So we'll find out more about it.

23:27.220 --> 23:29.580
And I might get a chance to fly out there and see it in person

23:29.580 --> 23:31.900
too before it's shipping.

23:31.900 --> 23:34.380
But if I was in the market for a Linux desktop right now,

23:34.380 --> 23:37.860
I would 100% wait until November 1st.

23:37.860 --> 23:38.980
Yeah, so to keep your eyes on.

23:38.980 --> 23:44.180
Because just the cases alone look gorgeous.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.340
And then the hardware they're putting in this thing

23:46.340 --> 23:47.380
is pretty top end.

23:47.380 --> 23:49.140
It's pretty top end hardware, and the prices

23:49.140 --> 23:50.420
are pretty reasonable.

23:50.420 --> 23:52.780
So if you're in the market, I would definitely

23:52.780 --> 23:55.020
be waiting for a Linux desktop right now.

23:55.020 --> 23:57.220
I love that idea of a really powerful Linux

23:57.220 --> 24:00.780
desktop and a nice, light, portable laptop to go with it.

24:00.780 --> 24:02.700
Yeah, I did get a little peek.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.300
I got a little peek at the machine.

24:04.300 --> 24:04.780
She's baking.

24:04.780 --> 24:06.260
She's baking in the chat room asking

24:06.260 --> 24:07.380
if I got to see a little.

24:07.380 --> 24:10.300
And yeah, this is going to be big for them.

24:10.300 --> 24:13.420
And you can tell that he's really passionate about it,

24:13.420 --> 24:16.220
because he's taking the time, Colorado time,

24:16.220 --> 24:19.220
to chat with me at night, where I'm in the Pacific time zone.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.140
It's nighttime for me.

24:20.140 --> 24:20.660
Yeah, right.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.900
That's some real user, real creator evangelism right there.

24:23.900 --> 24:27.060
Yeah, and he's talking about it in ways you can really

24:27.060 --> 24:28.260
tell he's very proud of it.

24:28.260 --> 24:31.220
And it does, the pictures I got to see are really sharp.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.220
I think when you guys get to see it,

24:32.220 --> 24:33.660
you're going to get to see even more than I got

24:33.660 --> 24:35.700
to see when it does go public, because I think you're

24:35.700 --> 24:36.900
going to be pretty impressed.

24:36.900 --> 24:40.460
So yeah, the Thelio hype is real.

24:40.460 --> 24:42.900
Some people are hoping it's a RISC-V system that

24:42.900 --> 24:45.260
would be totally open.

24:45.260 --> 24:46.580
It isn't like that.

24:46.580 --> 24:49.780
But I think their innovation here

24:49.780 --> 24:51.340
is this daughter board system.

24:51.340 --> 24:52.300
I mean, it's probably a good thing, right?

24:52.300 --> 24:54.620
We don't want them to bite off more than they can chew and fail.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.900
It's probably better to go in small incremental steps.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.260
They'll get their new facilities up and running.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.900
They'll get this guy going, provide more revenue for them

25:00.900 --> 25:03.300
to work on, slowly building up these relationships,

25:03.300 --> 25:05.140
and hopefully freeing more of it.

25:05.140 --> 25:06.500
Make for a great Plasma workstation.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.020
Oh, yeah.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.860
That's what I'm saying.

25:08.860 --> 25:12.860
Frequent virtual lug contributor and friend of the show, Alex,

25:12.860 --> 25:16.300
had reached a major milestone himself recently.

25:16.300 --> 25:19.180
His project, Linux Server IO, his project and the team

25:19.180 --> 25:22.340
over there just passed one billion total

25:22.340 --> 25:24.140
polls from Docker Hub.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.460
One billion polls.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.580
So congratulations to Linux Server IO.

25:27.580 --> 25:29.180
I've actually, before I even knew Alex,

25:29.180 --> 25:31.380
I bumped into Linux Server IO a couple of times,

25:31.380 --> 25:33.900
just pulling down, I think it was like an NZB client

25:33.900 --> 25:34.940
or something I was pulling off of Docker Hub.

25:34.940 --> 25:37.180
There was a lot of popular software packaged up by them.

25:37.180 --> 25:37.700
Yeah.

25:37.700 --> 25:38.660
A billion.

25:38.660 --> 25:42.540
That really shows you the size and scale of Docker Hub.

25:42.540 --> 25:43.980
When you can start a project like this

25:43.980 --> 25:45.500
and you package up applications that

25:45.500 --> 25:48.380
have been packaged many a time before in various formats,

25:48.380 --> 25:49.940
and you put it up on Docker Hub and it

25:49.940 --> 25:53.620
gets a billion, a billion downloads.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.780
Over a billion.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.340
So congratulations to them.

25:56.340 --> 25:58.940
Yeah, there's a lot of hard work, some good insights there.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.220
Go check that out and then go use some of their,

26:01.220 --> 26:03.180
some cool applications you can run easily.

26:03.180 --> 26:05.460
It's a great mix because you can throw it up

26:05.460 --> 26:07.820
on your own machine, a laptop, or a VPS

26:07.820 --> 26:10.820
and try out something that's all packaged up and ready to go.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.940
And you can at least see if you like it

26:11.940 --> 26:13.580
and then go build it yourself if you want

26:13.580 --> 26:14.980
or stick with the image.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.380
All right.

26:16.380 --> 26:18.940
We got to do something because this next story.

26:18.940 --> 26:19.820
How do we get there?

26:19.820 --> 26:20.980
We've got to talk about this.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.540
The inescapable story of the week.

26:22.540 --> 26:23.700
I don't think I'd ever be ready.

26:23.700 --> 26:24.940
I think that's it.

26:24.940 --> 26:26.540
There's never going to be a point in which I am ready to talk.

26:26.540 --> 26:27.460
We're still in shock.

26:27.460 --> 26:27.660
All right.

26:27.660 --> 26:28.100
I got one.

26:28.100 --> 26:28.660
I got something.

26:28.660 --> 26:29.260
OK, Wes.

26:29.260 --> 26:30.260
I'm going to give you a little quiz.

26:30.260 --> 26:30.740
Are you ready?

26:30.740 --> 26:31.220
Oh, oh.

26:31.220 --> 26:32.060
OK.

26:32.060 --> 26:33.900
OK.

26:33.900 --> 26:37.380
Mr. Payne, see if you can guess the project.

26:37.380 --> 26:41.020
With 80 components tracked, 55 of those components

26:41.020 --> 26:44.660
at 100% completion, and many other components

26:44.660 --> 26:50.220
with significant progress, what beloved open source project

26:50.220 --> 26:54.260
is near 80% done for its next major version?

26:54.260 --> 26:56.180
Well, I was about to guess Linux Mint,

26:56.180 --> 26:58.500
but it sounds like I don't know if that's there.

26:58.500 --> 27:01.420
Spoiler.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.580
No, you can't do that one.

27:02.580 --> 27:02.820
OK.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.380
Well, you said open source, so it's not Duke Nukem forever,

27:05.380 --> 27:07.260
despite all of our hopes.

27:07.260 --> 27:07.740
You ready?

27:07.740 --> 27:10.580
You got a guess?

27:10.580 --> 27:11.380
What could it be?

27:11.380 --> 27:12.380
There's just so many good options.

27:12.380 --> 27:15.140
OK, I'm just going to say that it's

27:15.140 --> 27:17.540
got to be the next GNOME release.

27:17.540 --> 27:18.620
Oh, you're close.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.140
You're close.

27:20.140 --> 27:25.220
So with 80 components tracked, 55 at 100% completion,

27:25.220 --> 27:33.140
and many others with significant progress, XFCE 4.14 is 80% done.

27:33.140 --> 27:35.220
And they've just updated the roadmap.

27:35.220 --> 27:37.860
It's time for one last big push, and then you're

27:37.860 --> 27:39.260
going to get new XFCE goodness.

27:39.260 --> 27:39.780
Hey, yo.

27:39.780 --> 27:41.420
After this long, long wait.

27:41.420 --> 27:43.660
That story was really for one member of our audience,

27:43.660 --> 27:44.540
and that's our editor.

27:44.540 --> 27:46.060
And now it is time for us to actually get to it.

27:46.060 --> 27:47.460
We got to keep him happy.

27:47.460 --> 27:49.420
Yeah, it's contractually obligated for us

27:49.420 --> 27:51.900
to talk about XFCE once every quarter.

27:51.900 --> 27:56.860
All right, so on Sunday, IBM and Red Hat

27:56.860 --> 28:00.540
announced that IBM would be purchasing Red Hat

28:00.540 --> 28:02.860
and becoming the world's, as they put it, number one

28:02.860 --> 28:07.260
hybrid cloud provider, which is pretty easy when

28:07.260 --> 28:08.340
you're making up a term.

28:08.340 --> 28:16.380
Red Hat is being purchased for $34 billion.

28:16.380 --> 28:21.260
That's over 60% of their value on Friday

28:21.260 --> 28:22.420
when the stock market closed.

28:22.420 --> 28:26.620
And today, after the news has had time to hit the market,

28:26.620 --> 28:28.740
depending on when you check it, obviously, these things

28:28.740 --> 28:29.740
are going to come and go.

28:29.740 --> 28:32.220
But when we checked it, Red Hat's stock

28:32.220 --> 28:35.420
was up, I think, 34% on the news.

28:35.420 --> 28:38.100
No, 45% on the news.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.180
Damn.

28:39.180 --> 28:41.380
What?

28:41.380 --> 28:43.140
45%.

28:43.140 --> 28:44.220
Damn.

28:44.220 --> 28:48.820
This is one of those stories that you didn't ever really

28:48.820 --> 28:50.660
expect.

28:50.660 --> 28:51.500
In all fairness.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.580
You probably don't think that much about IBM,

28:53.580 --> 28:54.740
unless you're an enterprise, right?

28:54.740 --> 28:55.860
You don't talk about it.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.860
Fair, fair point.

28:57.860 --> 29:00.380
And two, I just sort of assumed Red Hat wasn't for sale.

29:03.060 --> 29:06.300
I guess I've been struggling with this in a way that

29:06.300 --> 29:08.500
felt really personal to me, because I'm not

29:08.500 --> 29:09.220
a Red Hat employee.

29:09.220 --> 29:10.260
I'm not even a Red Hat user.

29:10.260 --> 29:13.100
In fact, I don't even like using RHEL.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.220
For some reason, though, I felt a really personal struggle

29:16.220 --> 29:17.340
with this one.

29:17.340 --> 29:23.500
And I think part of that is I feel

29:23.500 --> 29:30.300
like the great wars of the late 90s, early 2000s

29:30.300 --> 29:31.820
were for nothing.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.300
What was it all for?

29:33.300 --> 29:38.260
Because in 2018, Microsoft is one of the key open source

29:38.260 --> 29:40.820
contributors and now owns GitHub officially.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.980
That's gone through as of Monday.

29:42.980 --> 29:48.700
And the star rebel, the shining open source revenue generator,

29:48.700 --> 29:51.900
Red Hat, is now owned by an establishment company,

29:51.900 --> 29:55.020
or is going to be, IBM.

29:55.020 --> 29:58.500
All of our trailblazing and cause fighting,

29:58.500 --> 30:00.020
we went through so much.

30:00.020 --> 30:03.300
In the 90s, Microsoft was so dominant.

30:03.300 --> 30:06.060
And by the late 90s and early 2000s,

30:06.060 --> 30:07.260
we had all of these projects.

30:07.260 --> 30:10.500
We had Wine and Mono and all of these attempts

30:10.500 --> 30:15.420
to just coexist in a world that was dominated by Microsoft.

30:15.420 --> 30:18.060
And we finally get through all of that.

30:18.060 --> 30:21.380
And we look back at it, what was it all for?

30:21.380 --> 30:25.780
And I feel the same way with Red Hat being bought by IBM.

30:25.780 --> 30:29.020
I thought they would be the ones buying IBM.

30:29.020 --> 30:32.860
I thought they would be the ones buying Amazon,

30:32.860 --> 30:33.940
not the other way around.

30:33.940 --> 30:37.220
That's not the way I saw it going down.

30:37.220 --> 30:40.260
So I just, I don't know, the old man in me

30:40.260 --> 30:43.460
just really sort of took it hard a little bit.

30:43.460 --> 30:44.820
Isn't this something, though, that we always

30:44.820 --> 30:45.660
had to be aware of?

30:45.660 --> 30:47.700
I mean, it's kind of like using a proprietary service,

30:47.700 --> 30:49.300
where you've said it many times, right?

30:49.300 --> 30:51.460
Like, you use it, but you know that it could go away,

30:51.460 --> 30:53.020
it could change, that business could fold,

30:53.020 --> 30:55.020
or they could just stop interrupting with however

30:55.020 --> 30:56.020
you like using it.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.300
And I mean, for as long as Red Hat's been public,

30:59.300 --> 31:01.420
it's a for-profit corporation.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.500
They may have a culture that really likes open source,

31:03.500 --> 31:04.940
but that's not why it exists.

31:04.940 --> 31:06.660
Right, and as Red Hat will tell you,

31:06.660 --> 31:08.060
they don't have any intellectual property.

31:08.060 --> 31:11.300
They have staff, and they give away all their software.

31:11.300 --> 31:14.900
They have been a services company for a very long time.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.580
They were one of the early services companies.

31:17.580 --> 31:18.780
That's what they make their money on,

31:18.780 --> 31:21.220
is the services around the open source software

31:21.220 --> 31:22.500
that they sell, and in some cases,

31:22.500 --> 31:24.940
the closed source software they sell.

31:24.940 --> 31:29.460
They have been more like IBM for a very long time

31:29.460 --> 31:31.140
than we'd like to acknowledge,

31:31.140 --> 31:33.580
because we like to look at the things that they do

31:33.580 --> 31:37.940
that feel like the open source fairy

31:37.940 --> 31:39.020
delivering us great software.

31:39.020 --> 31:40.740
You know, we get things like Network Manager,

31:40.740 --> 31:43.100
and we get things like Pulse Audio, and System D,

31:43.100 --> 31:45.500
and PipeWire, which we just recently talked about,

31:45.500 --> 31:48.220
and so many other fundamental technologies,

31:48.220 --> 31:49.540
Flatpak, et cetera, et cetera,

31:49.540 --> 31:52.980
that don't really seem to have a direct cloud angle,

31:52.980 --> 31:55.620
don't have a direct services industry angle,

31:55.620 --> 31:58.100
but yet are extremely useful and beneficial

31:58.100 --> 32:00.100
to all Linux distributions,

32:00.100 --> 32:01.940
and that's the thing that we like to talk about.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.740
That's how we like to look at Red Hat in that light,

32:03.740 --> 32:06.860
but the reality is Red Hat is a for-profit public company

32:06.860 --> 32:08.660
who makes money selling services,

32:10.340 --> 32:12.460
much more like IBM than we'd like to admit,

32:13.700 --> 32:15.700
but it still was shocking to see it.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.220
Like I said, I think I always expected

32:17.220 --> 32:18.660
that Red Hat wasn't for sale,

32:18.660 --> 32:20.300
and that they would be the ones doing the buying one day.

32:20.300 --> 32:21.580
Right, they'd been our juggernaut.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.420
They were the ones like, look, Linux can make money.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.860
The services open source model, it can make money.

32:25.860 --> 32:26.700
It makes sense.

32:26.700 --> 32:29.900
These are good philosophies to build a company on,

32:29.900 --> 32:31.820
and obviously that's still true,

32:31.820 --> 32:34.820
but they obviously had a little bit of a special culture too,

32:34.820 --> 32:38.260
and how much of that can stay, will stay, we just don't know.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.500
But the big difference between IBM and Red Hat, I think,

32:41.500 --> 32:43.900
is that, I mean, how much does IBM

32:43.900 --> 32:45.220
really give back to the community,

32:45.220 --> 32:49.820
whereas Red Hat seriously has multiple full-time employees.

32:49.820 --> 32:52.020
They have two or three that work for the GNOME Foundation.

32:52.020 --> 32:55.020
They have others that work on other projects.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.420
Some people have been hired by Red Hat

32:57.420 --> 33:00.700
just to keep working on those essential applications

33:00.700 --> 33:02.220
that we need.

33:02.220 --> 33:04.220
Yeah, it's hard to really think

33:04.220 --> 33:06.260
of what major contributions IBM has made

33:06.260 --> 33:07.940
to the industry in general recently.

33:07.940 --> 33:09.140
Well, I think it is another case

33:09.140 --> 33:10.260
that we kind of talked about before,

33:10.260 --> 33:12.660
where they do have a lot of contributions

33:12.660 --> 33:15.260
to open source in their history, in a broad manner,

33:15.260 --> 33:17.260
but they don't talk about it, right?

33:17.260 --> 33:18.300
Red Hat talked about it.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.780
It was a big thing that they did.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.100
The people they employed were very prominent

33:21.100 --> 33:23.420
in the community, and so it is right,

33:23.420 --> 33:26.420
they have both a decent history of open source contribution,

33:26.420 --> 33:27.740
but they don't do it in the same way.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.460
They don't exactly have the same attitude,

33:29.460 --> 33:30.780
and they don't spend all their time talking about it,

33:30.780 --> 33:33.780
especially from like the business executive side.

33:33.780 --> 33:36.020
Right, that's a big part of Red Hat's branding,

33:36.020 --> 33:37.980
is Jim Whitehurst, open culture, open source.

33:37.980 --> 33:38.980
He wrote a book about it.

33:38.980 --> 33:40.340
They talk about it at the very top,

33:40.340 --> 33:42.420
whereas IBM, it's like an implementation detail.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.260
Exactly.

33:43.260 --> 33:46.340
Okay, so you know, when I first saw this news too,

33:46.340 --> 33:49.620
the first question that I tried to frame all of this in

33:49.620 --> 33:54.180
was is it possible that the new owner

33:54.180 --> 33:57.540
could be a better owner of what Red Hat has,

33:57.540 --> 33:58.740
like Red Hat's properties?

33:58.740 --> 34:03.100
Can they be, could IBM be a better owner of those things?

34:03.100 --> 34:04.300
Can IBM be a better owner?

34:04.300 --> 34:07.900
Can they own this stack better than Red Hat can?

34:07.900 --> 34:09.460
I don't know, I don't know,

34:09.460 --> 34:13.020
but I think the one thing that I did recall

34:13.020 --> 34:18.020
is that a long time ago, like back in 2000, 2001,

34:18.780 --> 34:20.940
IBM made a hard play into Linux.

34:20.940 --> 34:22.660
They just made this abrupt turn,

34:22.660 --> 34:26.420
and they announced a billion dollar investment in Linux,

34:26.420 --> 34:31.420
and they hired a whole crew to film these Linux commercials.

34:31.820 --> 34:32.660
Oh yeah.

34:32.660 --> 34:35.620
And one of my favorite had Captain Cisco in it.

34:35.620 --> 34:39.500
1991 Helsinki, a 21 year old student named Linus Torvalds

34:39.500 --> 34:41.660
writes a new computer operating system.

34:41.660 --> 34:44.460
He calls it Linux, then does something revolutionary.

34:44.460 --> 34:47.260
He gives it away free over the internet.

34:47.260 --> 34:50.300
The powers that be dismiss him as an eccentric, a freak,

34:50.300 --> 34:52.740
but everywhere coders and free thinkers embrace Linux,

34:52.740 --> 34:54.180
improve and refine it.

34:54.180 --> 34:56.380
Now the forces of openness have a powerful

34:56.380 --> 34:58.420
and unexpected new ally.

35:00.060 --> 35:01.620
It's a different kind of world.

35:01.620 --> 35:03.460
You need a different kind of software.

35:06.180 --> 35:08.580
That IBM went away for a while,

35:08.580 --> 35:10.860
and they became a services sales company.

35:10.860 --> 35:13.180
And I wonder if we're seeing IBM return to that.

35:13.180 --> 35:16.140
That is what I hope is happening.

35:16.140 --> 35:17.820
I mean, they've done a lot of good stuff, right?

35:17.820 --> 35:20.340
A lot of good engineering work has come out of them.

35:20.340 --> 35:22.300
And you're right, they haven't really kept up.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.620
Maybe a question is, can you do that?

35:24.620 --> 35:27.860
How much can new blood be injected into a company?

35:27.860 --> 35:29.620
Is this really gonna change things?

35:29.620 --> 35:31.420
What is their capacity for change?

35:31.420 --> 35:36.300
I have heard from more than five, less than 10.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.540
I'll just put it that way.

35:37.540 --> 35:41.260
Red Hat employees now who are very not happy.

35:41.260 --> 35:42.660
They are very not happy.

35:42.660 --> 35:46.460
I would say panic and disparity is the tone.

35:47.420 --> 35:49.540
Interestingly enough, I've also heard from people

35:49.540 --> 35:50.780
who do not work at Red Hat,

35:50.780 --> 35:53.020
but know people really well who work at Red Hat,

35:53.020 --> 35:54.420
and they say they're pumped.

35:54.420 --> 35:58.180
So there is some people inside that are very excited.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.540
But the people I heard about,

35:59.540 --> 36:01.060
they're primarily concerned about things

36:01.060 --> 36:02.940
like they have this memo list internally

36:02.940 --> 36:04.620
that it's a very expose kind of thing.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.260
They're worried that's gonna get shut down.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.460
They have a very unique culture.

36:07.460 --> 36:08.820
They're worried that that's gonna get shut down.

36:08.820 --> 36:10.300
Right, that seems like a lot that can be difficult.

36:10.300 --> 36:11.140
Yeah.

36:11.140 --> 36:15.380
So there's, internally, the theme sort of is,

36:15.380 --> 36:18.540
I work at Red Hat because this is Red Hat.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.940
And I am passionate about open source.

36:20.940 --> 36:22.620
And I wanted to work somewhere

36:22.620 --> 36:25.220
where my open source software would ship to end users

36:25.220 --> 36:26.140
and make a difference.

36:26.140 --> 36:27.580
And that's why I'm at Red Hat.

36:27.580 --> 36:30.900
Because it's Red Hat, not because it's IBM.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.460
And the thing that Jim Whitehurst knows very well

36:33.460 --> 36:36.660
is Red Hat's real value is the software developers.

36:36.660 --> 36:37.500
That's the talent.

36:37.500 --> 36:40.300
Their engineers are their most valuable asset.

36:40.300 --> 36:43.500
Because everything else is free, for the most part.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.540
All of their source code stuff, it's free.

36:46.540 --> 36:49.100
The source RPMs that they still, you know.

36:49.100 --> 36:49.940
Yep, yeah.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.780
That is free.

36:50.780 --> 36:52.580
And so the developers are their real talent.

36:52.580 --> 36:54.700
And if they leave because it's no longer Red Hat,

36:54.700 --> 36:56.780
then this deal loses a ton of its value.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.460
A couple of other interesting things I have grok'd

37:00.460 --> 37:02.620
from my conversations with friends

37:02.620 --> 37:07.100
is the way this is being sold to the staff right now

37:07.100 --> 37:09.500
is the reason Red Hat won't change.

37:09.500 --> 37:10.940
The reason why Red Hat will remain

37:10.940 --> 37:13.700
its own independent entity within IBM

37:13.700 --> 37:16.980
is because that is the true value of Red Hat.

37:16.980 --> 37:18.820
The way they phrase it is,

37:18.820 --> 37:20.820
Red Hat needs to remain Switzerland.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.860
Red Hat has to be this independent,

37:22.860 --> 37:26.100
non-vendor, lock-in, neutral platform

37:26.100 --> 37:30.220
that IBM sales teams can go to these high-end clients

37:30.220 --> 37:33.700
and sell a solution that doesn't have, quote,

37:33.700 --> 37:35.420
vendor lock-in.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.460
So the way IBM CEO frames this,

37:37.460 --> 37:41.100
she says that essentially they have clients

37:41.100 --> 37:42.700
that are so big it would blow your mind.

37:42.700 --> 37:43.740
The greatest clients ever.

37:43.740 --> 37:44.940
They're the best clients.

37:44.940 --> 37:49.940
And that 80% of their workload is not yet in the cloud.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.220
See, that first 20% that's in the cloud

37:52.220 --> 37:53.260
was all the easy stuff.

37:53.260 --> 37:55.060
The stuff that's, quote, cloud native.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.900
But now, now it's time for hybrid cloud.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.180
And this is what she says.

37:59.180 --> 38:04.180
Hybrid cloud is gonna bridge the on-premises stuff

38:04.180 --> 38:06.940
with the things that normally, traditionally,

38:06.940 --> 38:08.180
didn't work in the cloud

38:08.180 --> 38:10.260
that are now being moved into the cloud.

38:10.260 --> 38:13.260
And Jim Whitehurst says that what IBM and Red Hat

38:13.260 --> 38:15.380
will do together is they will create

38:15.380 --> 38:17.660
the one unifying platform

38:17.660 --> 38:20.100
that bridges on-premises and cloud.

38:20.100 --> 38:22.060
And when you're gonna do this in a large capacity,

38:22.060 --> 38:23.260
this is who you go to.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.460
And these clients,

38:24.460 --> 38:26.460
the number one thing they're afraid of these days,

38:26.460 --> 38:30.100
according to IBM CEO, vendor lock-in.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.780
And so Red Hat must remain independent.

38:32.780 --> 38:35.540
Their, quote, go-to-market strategy

38:35.540 --> 38:38.020
must remain independent, end quote.

38:38.020 --> 38:40.700
And that reason is because they want to sell

38:40.700 --> 38:44.220
into competitors that IBM is currently competing

38:44.220 --> 38:45.500
in similar markets with,

38:45.500 --> 38:47.580
and they want Red Hat to still sell to them,

38:47.580 --> 38:50.060
and they want to be able to sell to large clients,

38:50.060 --> 38:52.220
quote unquote, they're afraid about vendor lock-in.

38:52.220 --> 38:55.700
So IBM can go, no, this isn't a vendor-specific solution.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.740
This is Red Hat.

38:57.740 --> 38:58.700
It's totally our solution.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.060
You're totally getting locked into us.

39:00.060 --> 39:01.940
Go ahead, deploy Red Hat.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.220
It's got Kubernetes.

39:03.220 --> 39:04.500
It's got OpenStack.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.260
It's gonna be fine.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.100
It's an interesting question too,

39:07.100 --> 39:08.260
because I think we've seen this from other things,

39:08.260 --> 39:10.220
either like larger companies like Alphabet

39:10.220 --> 39:11.980
or just different sections of Amazon,

39:11.980 --> 39:15.020
where you're like, you're selling to one hand

39:15.020 --> 39:16.220
and buying from the other.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.340
Like, how does this work?

39:17.340 --> 39:18.260
How well does it actually work?

39:18.260 --> 39:19.420
And sometimes it seems like business

39:19.420 --> 39:21.860
is pragmatic enough that it's fine.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.140
People are like, all right, yeah,

39:23.140 --> 39:25.900
install me my OpenShift cluster managed by IBM's

39:25.900 --> 39:27.940
managed services, and away I go.

39:28.860 --> 39:31.820
Today, October 30th, Mark Shuttleworth released a statement

39:31.820 --> 39:33.820
on the IBM acquisition of Red Hat.

39:35.100 --> 39:35.940
And this is great.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.860
This is, I didn't expect this.

39:38.860 --> 39:40.540
Canonical usually plays it quiet.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.940
They usually tend to default to not saying anything.

39:42.940 --> 39:43.940
Like, they just don't say it.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.220
They don't get in the mix.

39:45.220 --> 39:48.180
But this time, Mark wasn't standing still.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.900
And this isn't the first time we've seen this.

39:49.900 --> 39:53.420
I think you guys will recall, almost a year ago,

39:53.420 --> 39:56.060
we had a ZDNet article where Mark was taking some shots

39:56.060 --> 39:57.700
at Red Hat's open.

39:57.700 --> 39:58.940
Oh, yeah.

39:58.940 --> 40:02.340
Yeah, it was a good read.

40:02.340 --> 40:03.180
I love it.

40:04.020 --> 40:06.300
This though, this is even better.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.140
I love this.

40:07.140 --> 40:09.300
He writes in here, public sources of data on Linux trends

40:09.300 --> 40:11.940
show that we've had a clear move.

40:11.940 --> 40:14.420
And he's setting up that essentially,

40:15.540 --> 40:18.020
Red Hat has been losing market shares is his position

40:18.020 --> 40:19.620
and that they were pushed into this.

40:19.620 --> 40:21.260
He says, we salute Red Hat for the role it played

40:21.260 --> 40:25.780
in framing open sources familiar shrink wrapped replacement

40:25.780 --> 40:27.260
for additional Unix on Wintel.

40:27.260 --> 40:28.100
In that sense,

40:28.100 --> 40:30.860
RHEL was critical in the open source movement.

40:30.860 --> 40:33.980
Nevertheless, the world has moved on

40:33.980 --> 40:36.780
and replacing Unix is no longer sufficient.

40:36.780 --> 40:39.860
The decline in RHEL growth contrast with the acceleration

40:39.860 --> 40:42.940
in Linux more broadly is a strong market indicator

40:42.940 --> 40:45.220
of the next wave of open source.

40:45.220 --> 40:47.100
So what he's saying is RHEL market share decreasing,

40:47.100 --> 40:49.420
but overall Linux deployments were going up,

40:49.420 --> 40:50.740
market indicator.

40:50.740 --> 40:51.580
I think he's right.

40:51.580 --> 40:53.100
And that's what's so great about it.

40:53.100 --> 40:54.980
And then he goes into containers and whatnot,

40:54.980 --> 40:58.020
essentially kind of implying that IBM was able

40:58.020 --> 41:00.220
to scoop them up because of this situation

41:00.220 --> 41:01.060
that Red Hat found.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.740
The time of RHEL is past.

41:02.740 --> 41:03.660
Maybe true.

41:03.660 --> 41:06.460
Red Hat's explanation is that we just simply couldn't sell

41:06.460 --> 41:09.460
into the clients at the scale we wanted to anymore.

41:09.460 --> 41:12.460
Like we had reached the end of our sales capacity

41:12.460 --> 41:13.860
and to get to the next big fish,

41:13.860 --> 41:15.500
we had to get even bigger ourselves.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.460
That's their version of the story.

41:17.460 --> 41:21.020
Besides the fact that all the shareholders make buckets.

41:22.020 --> 41:22.860
Right.

41:24.260 --> 41:25.860
Which fine, that's a legit enough,

41:25.860 --> 41:28.060
you know, who would say no to that?

41:28.940 --> 41:30.340
Well, having interviewed

41:30.340 --> 41:33.260
with their consulting department recently,

41:33.260 --> 41:36.020
I can actually verify their statements

41:36.020 --> 41:39.340
about they've got customers lining up through the door

41:39.340 --> 41:40.900
and they just don't have the consulting staff

41:40.900 --> 41:45.260
to actually do the onsite implementations

41:45.260 --> 41:47.060
that they're wanting to do.

41:47.060 --> 41:49.980
So there may be some validity to that.

41:49.980 --> 41:51.940
Wall Street seems to think so.

41:51.940 --> 41:56.540
I mean, up 45%, geez, that is really something.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.340
I don't know.

41:59.340 --> 42:01.900
I'd be curious to know any old timers,

42:01.900 --> 42:04.580
what your thoughts are just in terms of,

42:04.580 --> 42:06.260
I mean, this is Red Hat.

42:06.260 --> 42:09.420
Like this is Red Hat we're talking about right here.

42:09.420 --> 42:13.700
For us old timers, this to me, it feels huge.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.820
Go beyond market strategies and things like this,

42:15.820 --> 42:20.300
like is there any, besides Microsoft's complicity

42:20.300 --> 42:22.340
in working with open source,

42:22.340 --> 42:25.140
is there any other major, major, major indicator

42:25.140 --> 42:28.460
we've seen that how successful free software

42:28.460 --> 42:30.500
and open source has become in the industry?

42:31.620 --> 42:34.580
$36 billion makes this the largest software acquisition

42:34.580 --> 42:37.140
in the history of software acquisitions.

42:38.700 --> 42:41.220
That's the largest, and it was an open source one.

42:41.220 --> 42:43.940
It was a company making free software.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.420
I don't think we see the same focus.

42:45.420 --> 42:48.740
Like obviously, AWS is built on a lot of free software.

42:49.980 --> 42:50.820
It's not marketed that way.

42:50.820 --> 42:52.700
That's what Red Hat was so special about, right?

42:52.700 --> 42:55.300
It was, it was not, I guess it was not technically

42:55.300 --> 42:57.460
an open source company, but it sure felt like it.

42:57.460 --> 43:02.460
Well, here's what gets me is that we talk about companies

43:03.620 --> 43:06.940
that have a smaller impact on the market

43:06.940 --> 43:08.940
than Canonical does.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.900
Canonical has this weird problem

43:12.900 --> 43:14.820
where like their deployments of Ubuntu

43:14.820 --> 43:16.620
are like shadow deployments.

43:17.660 --> 43:21.140
There literally could be a safe margin

43:21.140 --> 43:24.660
more Ubuntu deployments in production workloads

43:24.660 --> 43:26.860
in the world than there are RHEL deployments

43:26.860 --> 43:31.340
when you consider VPSs and containers and VMs,

43:31.340 --> 43:33.100
which the vast majority, not all,

43:33.100 --> 43:35.060
but a lot of them are Ubuntu based.

43:35.060 --> 43:38.900
And I have had specific information given to me

43:38.900 --> 43:41.660
by AWS engineers who tell me that the majority

43:41.660 --> 43:45.300
of the Linux instances on AWS are also Ubuntu.

43:45.300 --> 43:46.260
And I've heard the same thing

43:46.260 --> 43:48.580
from Microsoft employees about Azure.

43:48.580 --> 43:50.740
They don't like to release this information publicly.

43:50.740 --> 43:51.780
So you just have to trust me.

43:51.780 --> 43:52.980
I'm sorry, I can't link to anything,

43:52.980 --> 43:53.940
but this is what they've told me

43:53.940 --> 43:55.620
is that they're Ubuntu based.

43:55.620 --> 43:57.980
And yet we talk about Ubuntu

43:57.980 --> 44:00.340
as if it is in another tier from Red Hat,

44:00.340 --> 44:04.180
as if it's along the same deployment scale of Fedora

44:04.180 --> 44:06.620
or Mint or elementary OS.

44:06.620 --> 44:10.860
But in reality, it has tens of millions more deployments

44:10.860 --> 44:13.260
because of the container and VPS craze.

44:13.260 --> 44:14.180
Well, I think part of it too

44:14.180 --> 44:17.060
is like RHEL means Red Hat, right?

44:17.060 --> 44:18.940
Ubuntu kind of just means Linux.

44:18.940 --> 44:21.020
Like it's just, it's Ubuntu Linux

44:21.020 --> 44:22.580
and you got it because it was an easy to use.

44:22.580 --> 44:23.420
It was already there.

44:23.420 --> 44:24.500
It might've been the default,

44:24.500 --> 44:25.620
but you didn't have to talk to Canonical.

44:25.620 --> 44:27.420
You don't even, you might not even know who Canonical is.

44:27.420 --> 44:28.780
You just know about Ubuntu.

44:30.180 --> 44:31.980
Unless you're buying managed services.

44:31.980 --> 44:33.060
I was having a conversation

44:33.060 --> 44:34.980
with some of the leadership at Linux Academy

44:34.980 --> 44:37.380
talking about beefing up the Ubuntu courseware

44:37.380 --> 44:38.220
at Linux Academy.

44:38.220 --> 44:40.300
And it's something they're interested in doing,

44:40.300 --> 44:43.420
but they have zero student data showing,

44:43.420 --> 44:44.820
I shouldn't say zero,

44:44.820 --> 44:46.620
but they have less student demand for Ubuntu

44:46.620 --> 44:48.420
than they have for Kali Linux right now.

44:48.420 --> 44:50.340
And I know that just simply is incongruent

44:50.340 --> 44:52.020
with the market share of Ubuntu.

44:52.020 --> 44:53.460
And the way we talk about Ubuntu

44:53.460 --> 44:54.900
is incongruent with the market share of Ubuntu.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.340
And the way the tech industry,

44:56.340 --> 44:58.300
we talk more about Fitbit and Netflix

44:58.300 --> 44:59.300
than we talk about Canonical.

44:59.300 --> 45:01.260
Meanwhile, Canonical's running all of this stuff

45:01.260 --> 45:03.260
that these companies are using.

45:03.260 --> 45:04.700
It's really, it's a bizarre thing.

45:04.700 --> 45:07.900
And so the other thing that really sort of landed hard on me

45:07.900 --> 45:10.300
is does this mean Canonical is next?

45:11.180 --> 45:12.500
Is Microsoft now going shit?

45:12.500 --> 45:15.460
Well, Azure is powered by,

45:15.460 --> 45:18.460
I mean like 30, 40% of the rigs on here are Ubuntu based.

45:18.460 --> 45:21.460
Can we afford for one of our competitors to control this?

45:21.460 --> 45:22.300
Right.

45:23.420 --> 45:24.300
Right.

45:24.300 --> 45:25.580
And I wonder if there wasn't a bidding war

45:25.580 --> 45:26.540
going on for Red Hat.

45:26.540 --> 45:27.780
The way this news came out,

45:27.780 --> 45:29.300
the way it came out on a Sunday,

45:29.300 --> 45:31.620
it was leaked and then they had to confirm it

45:31.620 --> 45:34.540
before they could even tell their own staff.

45:34.540 --> 45:36.940
It makes you wonder if there was another company

45:36.940 --> 45:39.500
involved in the bidding process for Red Hat.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.580
And this is all my way of saying

45:41.580 --> 45:44.060
we have major shifts still ahead of us.

45:44.060 --> 45:45.060
Like when you look,

45:45.060 --> 45:48.060
there are certain shifts happening in the industry

45:48.060 --> 45:50.740
because now of the success of open source.

45:50.740 --> 45:52.980
And this is the result of that success.

45:52.980 --> 45:53.820
Right.

45:53.820 --> 45:55.380
We can't ignore that like for it to be successful

45:55.380 --> 45:58.740
means it's used by big companies

45:58.740 --> 46:00.220
and they have different ideas

46:00.220 --> 46:02.260
of what they want to do with that technology.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.380
To me, it also underscores like,

46:03.380 --> 46:04.940
it's still important that we have

46:04.940 --> 46:06.460
some non-commercial distributions,

46:06.460 --> 46:08.460
like things like Debian or Arch

46:08.460 --> 46:10.860
that like maybe I don't run them on my server.

46:10.860 --> 46:12.580
I mean, I have certainly in both cases,

46:12.580 --> 46:16.060
but they're there and that is a thing that keeps,

46:16.060 --> 46:18.380
I think like keeps the community focused a little bit,

46:18.380 --> 46:20.340
or at least like that's our fallback.

46:20.340 --> 46:22.620
So Brandon just joined,

46:22.620 --> 46:24.220
but I don't know if he's at his mic

46:24.220 --> 46:26.900
and I'm going to steal his thunder a little bit maybe.

46:26.900 --> 46:30.540
I want to propose kind of an alternate reality

46:30.540 --> 46:31.980
to this merger.

46:34.180 --> 46:35.540
Brandon and I were talking the other day

46:35.540 --> 46:36.900
when this happened about an article

46:36.900 --> 46:40.940
that was posted about maybe IBM bought Red Hat

46:40.940 --> 46:43.220
and Red Hat takes over IBM.

46:43.220 --> 46:47.580
So instead of this being the corporatizing of Red Hat,

46:47.580 --> 46:49.620
not sure if that's a word, but it is now.

46:50.540 --> 46:54.820
Instead, Jim becomes the new CEO of IBM

46:54.820 --> 46:56.460
in the next couple of years

46:56.460 --> 47:00.260
and Red Hat's culture overwhelms that of IBM.

47:00.260 --> 47:03.980
And now, you know, open source takes over from the inside.

47:03.980 --> 47:06.300
I mean, I like that idea.

47:06.300 --> 47:09.500
300,000 employees though, it's pretty,

47:09.500 --> 47:11.380
it feels like a drop in the ocean.

47:11.380 --> 47:13.780
It's one department within a massive entity.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.620
I think that in reality, it'll be somewhere in between.

47:17.500 --> 47:20.900
I'm hoping for best case scenarios

47:20.900 --> 47:23.500
that it will be like Microsoft and LinkedIn.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.060
If you didn't know the business behind it,

47:25.060 --> 47:27.340
you wouldn't know that Microsoft owns LinkedIn.

47:27.340 --> 47:30.300
And I think that's kind of based on the articles

47:30.300 --> 47:31.900
that I've read.

47:31.900 --> 47:34.980
I think that's kind of what IBM wants to do with Red Hat

47:34.980 --> 47:35.820
because they're supposed to be

47:35.820 --> 47:39.220
an autonomous subsidiary of IBM.

47:39.220 --> 47:40.180
That's what they say.

47:40.180 --> 47:41.980
You know, but you think about this.

47:41.980 --> 47:45.860
I mean, really IBM has been around in one form or another

47:45.860 --> 47:49.140
since the early 1900s, 1911.

47:50.140 --> 47:52.620
They weren't called International Business Machines

47:52.620 --> 47:54.740
until 1924.

47:54.740 --> 47:55.580
But I mean, we're talking,

47:55.580 --> 47:57.700
these guys have been around since the world wars.

47:57.700 --> 48:02.340
And the idea that a division of a company

48:02.340 --> 48:05.980
that has been around for nearly a hundred years

48:05.980 --> 48:10.020
will change the culture is optimistic.

48:10.020 --> 48:11.140
It is definitely optimistic.

48:11.140 --> 48:12.820
I'm hopeful though.

48:12.820 --> 48:15.380
If nothing else, maybe they could use them as a steward.

48:15.380 --> 48:17.820
Like IBM trying to navigate a new world

48:17.820 --> 48:20.260
and a new technology landscape could defer

48:20.260 --> 48:22.500
to Red Hat's expertise in certain areas.

48:22.500 --> 48:23.820
Right, I mean, yeah, it's interesting.

48:23.820 --> 48:25.980
Like we kind of assume that the IBM culture

48:25.980 --> 48:27.620
will crush Red Hat or that's a lot of the fears.

48:27.620 --> 48:29.580
But hey, maybe it'll go the reverse

48:29.580 --> 48:33.220
and IBM opens up and some of this new blood distributes.

48:33.220 --> 48:35.340
But you're right, it's a numbers game.

48:35.340 --> 48:37.100
Brandon, did you wanna jump in there with some thoughts?

48:37.100 --> 48:40.460
Yeah, just IBM's contributed open source

48:40.460 --> 48:42.700
for a very long time.

48:42.700 --> 48:44.260
They have an open source culture.

48:44.260 --> 48:48.300
Yeah, I'm not, you know, I'm former Red Hatter.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.580
So I have a different perspective,

48:50.580 --> 48:54.460
but I don't think it's gonna be all the doom and gloom.

48:54.460 --> 48:56.060
But that's just my personal opinion.

48:56.060 --> 48:56.900
Good.

48:56.900 --> 48:59.100
Do you feel it is because IBM has been a good steward

48:59.100 --> 49:00.100
to open source in the past

49:00.100 --> 49:02.300
or what is it that's making you feel?

49:02.300 --> 49:04.380
It's been a good steward.

49:04.380 --> 49:07.340
A few people in the chat have mentioned

49:07.340 --> 49:09.020
some of the things that they've done.

49:09.020 --> 49:13.900
They have a lot of projects between Red Hat and IBM.

49:13.900 --> 49:18.620
I think they've contributed more to open source

49:18.620 --> 49:21.460
than any one period.

49:21.460 --> 49:24.820
So it'll be interesting.

49:24.820 --> 49:27.580
If not, you know, if all's fails,

49:29.100 --> 49:31.300
everything Red Hat does is open source,

49:31.300 --> 49:33.420
just go fork it, right?

49:33.420 --> 49:38.420
Right, and I think that is a nice safety hatch we have here

49:38.540 --> 49:42.460
is there's free software and the original contributors

49:42.460 --> 49:43.940
still own the copyrights of them.

49:43.940 --> 49:47.020
So that's impressive and that is good to note.

49:47.020 --> 49:48.220
I hope so.

49:48.220 --> 49:52.020
I think in some ways it could supercharge

49:52.020 --> 49:54.100
their sales engine and that could be really good.

49:54.100 --> 49:57.980
And in the meantime, business continues as normal.

49:57.980 --> 50:01.980
Today, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 shipped

50:01.980 --> 50:05.260
and Fedora 29 shipped.

50:05.260 --> 50:07.500
Now this I am very excited about.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.220
There's a big feature in Fedora 29

50:09.220 --> 50:10.900
that I've been looking forward to trying.

50:10.900 --> 50:14.700
And in just one week as we record this episode,

50:14.700 --> 50:17.260
it will be 15 years since they announced

50:17.260 --> 50:18.660
the release of Fedora Core 1.

50:18.660 --> 50:20.100
Wow. Yeah, it's big.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.900
That's big, that's a big deal.

50:21.900 --> 50:24.220
And now they have not just like the core Fedora,

50:24.220 --> 50:26.260
but they have workstation, they have server,

50:26.260 --> 50:28.420
they have atomic host, they have all these different

50:28.420 --> 50:30.740
like little spins and stuff that are semi-popular.

50:30.740 --> 50:33.020
Of course, they have the cloud version that I use,

50:33.020 --> 50:34.820
they have support for ARM devices.

50:34.820 --> 50:38.060
And if this wasn't maybe thinking ahead a little bit,

50:38.060 --> 50:40.180
they even have a system 390 spin.

50:40.180 --> 50:42.660
So they're good to go.

50:44.780 --> 50:48.020
This release though, I think is probably

50:48.020 --> 50:50.460
from an end user perspective, the most appealing

50:50.460 --> 50:52.420
because it ships Gnome 3.3.0,

50:52.420 --> 50:54.940
which has some performance improvements.

50:54.940 --> 50:57.340
They've got better support for ARM images,

50:57.340 --> 50:59.060
including ZRAM on those,

50:59.060 --> 51:02.340
vagrant images for Fedora Scientific.

51:02.340 --> 51:03.860
But there's something else in this one

51:03.860 --> 51:05.580
that we wanted to talk about.

51:05.580 --> 51:07.420
The West got a chance to kick the tires on.

51:07.420 --> 51:09.500
And so we kind of took two tracks.

51:10.540 --> 51:15.540
I have been managing a Fedora cloud instance for years now.

51:15.980 --> 51:18.220
And I've been dutifully updating, updating, updating,

51:18.220 --> 51:20.540
updating, and then in the last release

51:20.540 --> 51:22.260
after having zero issues of updating

51:22.260 --> 51:23.620
after release, after release, after release,

51:23.620 --> 51:24.980
I decided I wanted to rebuild

51:24.980 --> 51:27.460
and build a bigger, stronger Fedora box

51:27.460 --> 51:30.740
and use cockpit to manage it and move everything I had.

51:30.740 --> 51:33.740
I had multiple systems and I moved everything to one system

51:33.740 --> 51:35.500
and then put it in containers on that one system.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.300
But I wanted to experiment with that

51:37.300 --> 51:39.140
and I wanted to use Fedora cloud to do it.

51:39.140 --> 51:43.260
And I ended up using my next cloud instance in production.

51:43.260 --> 51:47.620
I attached an extra 250 gigs of digital ocean storage

51:47.620 --> 51:50.660
to that droplet, put my next cloud folder on there,

51:50.660 --> 51:52.740
and that's mounted inside the container.

51:52.740 --> 51:53.980
It's all very nice, right?

51:53.980 --> 51:56.500
So I sit down, I'm like, okay, Self,

51:56.500 --> 51:59.700
you're gonna take this Fedora 28 system up to Fedora 29.

51:59.700 --> 52:00.540
We're gonna start this upgrade all over again.

52:00.540 --> 52:03.260
You got your tool belts on, you're at the console.

52:03.260 --> 52:04.740
I was, it was good.

52:04.740 --> 52:07.460
It was, so the first thing I did is I logged into cockpit

52:07.460 --> 52:10.260
and just did all the security and system updates.

52:10.260 --> 52:13.180
I couldn't do a distribution upgrade in there though.

52:13.180 --> 52:15.540
So I had to, so I SSH into the box.

52:15.540 --> 52:17.140
Oh, old school. Yeah.

52:17.140 --> 52:19.300
And you know, the DNF commands are well-documented.

52:19.300 --> 52:21.540
Like you, first you do like this update thing

52:21.540 --> 52:24.380
and then you install like an upgrade plugin

52:24.380 --> 52:26.340
and then you just, there's like three commands.

52:26.340 --> 52:30.180
And then the final command is do a DNF reboot.

52:30.180 --> 52:32.260
And this is neat because it ties in with system D,

52:32.260 --> 52:33.420
reboots your system.

52:33.420 --> 52:35.540
And while it's in the boot up state, clean,

52:35.540 --> 52:37.060
installs the packages, checks it,

52:37.060 --> 52:38.340
and then reboots the system once more

52:38.340 --> 52:39.700
and you boot up with all the fresh stuff.

52:39.700 --> 52:41.020
Oh, that is nice.

52:41.020 --> 52:42.260
So I do that once with cockpit.

52:42.260 --> 52:45.140
So that way I have a 28 update that's totally current,

52:45.140 --> 52:47.860
all up to date, everything's working.

52:47.860 --> 52:49.420
It just feels like the best way to do it.

52:49.420 --> 52:52.020
Then I SSH in and I do all that DNF stuff,

52:52.020 --> 52:54.500
get the 29 upgrade going, does the same process,

52:54.500 --> 52:56.540
it reboots, you know, does the install upgrades at all.

52:56.540 --> 52:58.780
So now I have a full 29 install that's up to date.

52:58.780 --> 52:59.620
Just like that.

52:59.620 --> 53:02.300
Boots up, feels like it takes forever

53:02.300 --> 53:04.460
because when it's doing that system D upgrade

53:04.460 --> 53:06.700
in the background, it's offline.

53:06.700 --> 53:08.740
And so you're just sitting there waiting

53:08.740 --> 53:10.420
for your box to come back.

53:10.420 --> 53:12.580
And hoping, hoping that it pings again

53:12.580 --> 53:14.460
or your SSH connection resumes.

53:14.460 --> 53:17.700
I have been remotely upgrading servers

53:17.700 --> 53:22.580
in one form or another, literally since the 90s.

53:22.580 --> 53:26.060
And it's still just as anxiety inducing

53:26.060 --> 53:28.660
during that moment as it ever has been.

53:28.660 --> 53:30.980
It doesn't matter if I have an IP KVM

53:30.980 --> 53:34.380
or an HTML5 console that I can use in any browser I want

53:34.380 --> 53:37.380
via the Ting dashboard for days, it doesn't matter.

53:37.380 --> 53:39.500
I still am anxious during that time

53:39.500 --> 53:41.220
when I can't ping the box.

53:41.220 --> 53:42.300
I mean, it's just natural, right?

53:42.300 --> 53:43.300
Nothing else is happening.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.020
I'm just sitting there staring at the terminal.

53:45.020 --> 53:45.860
That's all that's happening.

53:45.860 --> 53:47.420
Well, and even with the best of intentions,

53:47.420 --> 53:51.580
all the snapshots, mutable file systems,

53:51.580 --> 53:52.420
things can still break.

53:52.420 --> 53:53.620
It's still just, I don't know, man.

53:53.620 --> 53:54.460
I just don't know.

53:54.460 --> 53:55.300
And of course, you know what?

53:55.300 --> 53:58.060
Now I think about it, I didn't do a snapshot beforehand.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.420
I think I have backups for that box,

54:00.420 --> 54:01.260
but I didn't actually.

54:01.260 --> 54:02.660
Oh, you reckless admin.

54:02.660 --> 54:04.940
I just went for it, I just went for it.

54:04.940 --> 54:08.940
You can tell I'm from a day before, I'm pre-VPS, Wes.

54:08.940 --> 54:11.140
Anyways, so it boots up finally.

54:11.140 --> 54:15.540
And I type in the Nextcloud URL, hit Enter on the old box.

54:15.540 --> 54:16.940
Page cannot be found.

54:16.940 --> 54:19.100
Oh no, this is it.

54:19.100 --> 54:22.060
After like years of doing these upgrades,

54:22.060 --> 54:24.700
like this is the one that broke, this is it.

54:24.700 --> 54:27.180
And I'm like, all right, what about my cockpit URL?

54:27.180 --> 54:29.100
Because cockpit, by the way, it's just great.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.180
So I log in, cockpit's working.

54:31.180 --> 54:32.500
I can SSH into the box.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.540
Okay, so what's up?

54:33.540 --> 54:35.780
I can ping it, cockpit's fine.

54:35.780 --> 54:37.980
I'm digging around, I go to the container section,

54:37.980 --> 54:41.460
and I see that my containers are restarting.

54:41.460 --> 54:43.780
All of them are just stuck in this restarting loop.

54:43.780 --> 54:47.500
And it's hit my CPU because I've got a database container,

54:47.500 --> 54:49.540
I've got a Nextcloud container, excuse me,

54:49.540 --> 54:50.620
I've got an MB container,

54:50.620 --> 54:52.180
and they're all just rebooting constantly,

54:52.180 --> 54:53.020
rebooting, rebooting.

54:53.020 --> 54:55.140
As fast as the system can reboot a container,

54:55.140 --> 54:57.060
these things are cycling.

54:57.060 --> 54:58.580
And I'm like, okay, what?

54:58.580 --> 55:00.540
I know I've seen this before.

55:00.540 --> 55:02.660
How did I fix this before?

55:02.660 --> 55:04.180
And I'm still looking at it, and I look at the,

55:04.180 --> 55:06.660
because in cockpit, it puts the console log right there,

55:06.660 --> 55:08.020
so you can click on the container,

55:08.020 --> 55:10.580
you can actually see the console log in cockpit.

55:10.580 --> 55:12.020
And I see permission denied, permission denied.

55:12.020 --> 55:14.140
It's just permission denied scrolling past my screen

55:14.140 --> 55:15.860
as fast as it can possibly.

55:15.860 --> 55:19.540
I know I've seen this after an upgrade before.

55:19.540 --> 55:21.780
Think about it for a second, oh, of course.

55:21.780 --> 55:22.620
It was SELinux.

55:22.620 --> 55:23.460
Of course it's SELinux.

55:23.460 --> 55:24.300
Of course it's SELinux.

55:24.300 --> 55:26.460
Of course it's SELinux.

55:26.460 --> 55:28.220
So I had to get that, and that just got reset

55:28.220 --> 55:29.060
as part of the upgrade.

55:29.060 --> 55:31.020
Right, it's because you enabled a lot of custom stuff,

55:31.020 --> 55:33.780
right, you really tuned SELinux perfectly for your use case.

55:33.780 --> 55:35.820
Oh yeah, you know me, not that off button at all,

55:35.820 --> 55:36.900
not for me.

55:36.900 --> 55:37.740
I got a question though.

55:37.740 --> 55:39.580
So that's not the thing I was most excited about.

55:39.580 --> 55:41.380
That was just my standard test I do with Fedora 9.

55:41.380 --> 55:44.020
But the feature that I am the most excited about,

55:44.020 --> 55:46.700
we had talked to Matthew Miller about it ages ago.

55:46.700 --> 55:48.940
We've been teasing it for a long time.

55:48.940 --> 55:53.580
It's finally landing in Fedora 29, and it's modularity.

55:53.580 --> 55:55.980
This release is particularly exciting

55:55.980 --> 55:59.300
because it is the first to include Fedora modularity,

55:59.300 --> 56:02.820
which features a system that allows

56:02.820 --> 56:04.540
you to install a version.

56:04.540 --> 56:05.900
Boy, this is hard to explain.

56:05.900 --> 56:08.500
It allows you to install, say, a version of Node.js

56:08.500 --> 56:11.500
that is not in the main package repository of the version

56:11.500 --> 56:12.860
of Fedora you're using.

56:12.860 --> 56:14.900
So say Fedora 30 ships, and you want

56:14.900 --> 56:17.100
to use a newer version of Node.js.

56:17.100 --> 56:19.820
Or you need to use the version that was in Fedora 28.

56:19.820 --> 56:21.980
You can now mix and match the versions

56:21.980 --> 56:24.780
with these modular repositories.

56:24.780 --> 56:28.620
You no longer need to upgrade your entire OS just

56:28.620 --> 56:30.460
to get the new Node.js.

56:30.460 --> 56:32.380
And what I love about this is it's

56:32.380 --> 56:35.620
sort of solving the same problem that Snaps and Flatpak solve,

56:35.620 --> 56:37.820
but from a different perspective.

56:37.820 --> 56:40.780
Snaps and Flatpaks are very developer-driven.

56:40.780 --> 56:42.940
That way, the creator of the software

56:42.940 --> 56:45.580
can directly distribute to the end user.

56:45.580 --> 56:48.100
And I think that's perfect for a lot of types of applications,

56:48.100 --> 56:51.300
even server-side applications.

56:51.300 --> 56:55.140
But package management, that's a sysadmin system.

56:55.140 --> 56:56.940
That's software distribution designed

56:56.940 --> 57:00.140
by system administrators for system administrators.

57:00.140 --> 57:03.940
And they're still valid uses for the package management system

57:03.940 --> 57:05.940
to manage server software.

57:05.940 --> 57:10.100
And the only real downside has been these version issues

57:10.100 --> 57:14.180
you run into when you're on, say, like, REL or CentOS

57:14.180 --> 57:15.980
or something that doesn't update very often,

57:15.980 --> 57:18.220
but all of a sudden, you need a newer version of a package

57:18.220 --> 57:20.020
that isn't in the repo.

57:20.020 --> 57:21.340
It starts to fall apart.

57:21.340 --> 57:22.260
Right, that's the perfect thing.

57:22.260 --> 57:23.220
You're like, oh, I have safety.

57:23.220 --> 57:24.180
I know nothing's going to break.

57:24.180 --> 57:26.380
And then you're like, oh, wait, no, but I need one more version

57:26.380 --> 57:28.580
because there's a bug fix that only affects me.

57:28.580 --> 57:30.820
And right now, one of our solutions,

57:30.820 --> 57:33.220
Flatpaks and Snaps, if you're dealing with server software,

57:33.220 --> 57:34.700
it's really only Snaps.

57:34.700 --> 57:36.500
And that works great, like, for something like,

57:36.500 --> 57:38.060
especially for, like, Plex Media Server,

57:38.060 --> 57:39.580
it's the perfect solution.

57:39.580 --> 57:41.980
But for, like, low-level stuff, like your Apache server

57:41.980 --> 57:46.140
or maybe Postgres or Node.js,

57:46.140 --> 57:49.540
do you really need to have that as a snap

57:49.540 --> 57:52.860
when you could maybe just have modular repositories

57:52.860 --> 57:54.580
that allow you to pull in that newer version

57:54.580 --> 57:55.940
on the older version of Fedora?

57:55.940 --> 57:58.340
It seems like magic, but it works.

57:58.340 --> 57:59.180
Oh, yeah, it does.

57:59.180 --> 58:01.260
I mean, we've been playing with it here

58:01.260 --> 58:02.780
the past couple of days.

58:02.780 --> 58:05.420
The way to think about it is before, you know,

58:05.420 --> 58:07.260
a Fedora release comes along and they sort of pick,

58:07.260 --> 58:09.220
like, oh, OK, here's the version of Node

58:09.220 --> 58:10.580
that we're going to ship with this.

58:10.580 --> 58:13.260
And there would be a different one for 28 versus 29.

58:13.260 --> 58:15.620
Now, they're just taking whatever version of lists

58:15.620 --> 58:17.260
of nodes that they're going to support

58:17.260 --> 58:19.380
and building them for all the Fedora versions.

58:19.380 --> 58:20.700
So it doesn't matter which one.

58:20.700 --> 58:22.380
You can pick and match your version of Node

58:22.380 --> 58:25.180
and your version of Fedora support totally independently.

58:25.180 --> 58:27.540
So this isn't some crazy container system

58:27.540 --> 58:28.380
they're doing.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.020
Right, and you're not running multiple of those.

58:30.020 --> 58:30.860
What you get to do is there's this...

58:30.860 --> 58:31.980
You get one Node.js.

58:31.980 --> 58:33.700
You pick your version, but you get one Node.js.

58:33.700 --> 58:36.740
Yes, and DNF now has this module system

58:36.740 --> 58:37.940
that you can tie in, and there's commands for it.

58:37.940 --> 58:40.060
And you can see, and you basically choose, like,

58:40.060 --> 58:41.140
all right, well, I know that my app

58:41.140 --> 58:42.940
is targeted at the older Node 8,

58:42.940 --> 58:45.220
so I'm going to make sure that that module is what I pick.

58:45.220 --> 58:47.740
And then when you go and use DNF to install Node,

58:47.740 --> 58:49.540
it knows which dependencies and which systems

58:49.540 --> 58:50.540
it actually needs to use.

58:50.540 --> 58:51.860
And then it just gets updated

58:51.860 --> 58:53.500
as part of your DNF upgrade process.

58:53.500 --> 58:54.820
It's just one of the many packages installed.

58:54.820 --> 58:56.460
That's the nice part is that you can get

58:56.460 --> 58:58.900
some newer software, but it's still tied in

58:58.900 --> 59:00.340
with the distribution.

59:00.340 --> 59:04.220
And this is as much of a DNF change

59:04.220 --> 59:06.220
as it is the repo change.

59:06.220 --> 59:07.860
Like, they had to make changes

59:07.860 --> 59:10.300
in how they keep track of versions,

59:10.300 --> 59:11.700
how they build them for the different versions.

59:11.700 --> 59:12.740
Yeah, a lot of build system changes.

59:12.740 --> 59:14.580
It's like a multi-component change

59:14.580 --> 59:17.220
that they've made to enable this modularity.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.900
That's also an impressive, like, project-wide effort.

59:20.940 --> 59:22.700
And you've got to imagine, by, like, the time 30, Lance,

59:22.700 --> 59:24.140
this is going to really be dialed in.

59:24.140 --> 59:25.620
That's some of the things I like about this is,

59:25.620 --> 59:27.780
obviously, as you say, there are a ton

59:27.780 --> 59:29.460
of third-party options for getting software,

59:29.460 --> 59:31.740
even just building it yourself if you have to.

59:31.740 --> 59:33.500
But distributions do a lot of hard work.

59:33.500 --> 59:35.300
Fedora does a lot of hard work getting the stuff packaged,

59:35.300 --> 59:37.580
having updates for the software that needs to be there,

59:37.580 --> 59:39.540
security updates, whatever else that you have in mind.

59:39.540 --> 59:41.820
With a system like this, you still get all those things.

59:41.820 --> 59:43.260
You can just get newer versions,

59:43.260 --> 59:45.020
or, as you say, older versions.

59:45.020 --> 59:48.860
I'll say the story now, as they call it,

59:48.860 --> 59:50.660
of how you get software on Fedora

59:50.660 --> 59:52.260
is getting a little complex.

59:52.260 --> 59:55.220
So you've got DNF in the repositories,

59:55.220 --> 59:58.140
you've got Flatpaks, you've got Copper,

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.620
and you've got modular Fedora repositories.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.380
And I think I'm actually missing...

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.820
I mean, there's things like RPM Fusion,

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.140
which it just plugs in, but it's a separate project.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.020
It's true, there is that, too, yeah.

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.620
So there's a lot of ways to get software.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:13.900
When we were trying out Fedora, I said...

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:14.740
I'll tell you what I feel like,

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.940
because I feel like Fedora is really great

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.220
if you're just doing, you know, get down, start working,

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:20.500
you're doing a terminal, doing a web browser,

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.900
it's so great for that.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.300
But, like, what if you need it as your daily driver, Wes?

01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:26.940
Can you get Slack and Telegram and these things on there?

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.780
How did that go for you?

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.940
How did it go trying to get these Electron apps

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.780
or these proprietary applications?

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.500
With FlatHub, honestly, it was pretty good.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:38.140
Now, it went, I'd say, 85% of the way

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:39.660
to being pretty seamless,

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.260
where I could just go to the website,

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.820
follow the installation instructions,

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.980
and then, like, click through on the FlatHub.org website

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:45.980
and install stuff.

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.260
That didn't quite work with Known Software,

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.460
but all of the command line versions of those same stuff

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.500
did work just fine.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.420
Known Software just kicks an air up.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.620
Yeah, so that was a little cryptic.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:54.900
I didn't find an easy solution

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:57.020
within the, like, first two Google results.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:58.220
I didn't try any harder than that.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.300
I'm sure it's easy to fix,

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.900
but I just wanted to play with it.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.940
But, I wasn't sure,

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.140
so that's interesting that you ran into that,

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.780
because I wasn't sure if I was doing,

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.780
so this is, if this is an actual bug,

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.180
I might try to reproduce the process

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.060
and file a bug for this,

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.220
because I thought maybe I was,

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.820
when I ran into it, I thought I was just being dumb.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:12.940
Yeah, we'll have to play with that a little more,

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.140
because it was almost really slick.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.260
Yeah, I should stress, too,

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.700
that, like, just running it on the command line

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.100
and installing, like, the name of the Flat Pack

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:20.940
works totally fine.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:23.860
Slack, Dropbox, Telegram, they're all there.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.700
Once you add the Flat Hub repo,

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.540
you have to do that first.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:26.380
That part was easy.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.220
That was easy.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.140
That was, like, you just go to Flat Hub,

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.260
they have a thing you can click,

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.620
and just, if you're on Fedora already,

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.220
it's all integrated so that, you know,

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:33.820
it calls up all the right applications,

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.140
it launches Dome software, it installs correctly.

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:39.740
Yeah, and then you're able to get Telegram and Slack

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.860
and all of the, you know, proprietary goodies

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:43.940
that you use to communicate during the day.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.260
And it works on the Fedora desktop.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.980
Any other kind of impressions you had when using it?

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:48.820
Any other takeaways?

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:50.180
Like, there's that installer.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.460
I mean, I'm just not a fan of Anaconda.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.940
I will say that their newer,

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.340
what is that, Bevitt or something?

01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:59.660
Their new, the new version of their disk manager

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:01.940
in the installer, that's actually gotten better.

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.780
I like it a lot.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.180
I hate the original version.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.820
The new version is pretty easy.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:06.660
It's gonna work.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.140
And I will say that, like, once we got it all set up

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.940
on our JB test machine, it boots really fast.

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.940
Like, once it's all installed, it's really nice.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.300
Yeah, it's probably one of the fastest booting

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.020
Linux distros out there right now.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.820
I mean, so we've recently tried Ubuntu 18.10.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.580
18.04, obviously, I'm very familiar with.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.220
Elementary OS, we've recently booted on there.

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:32.220
I guess it's about as fast as Haiku was, right?

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.180
Yeah, you're right.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.180
It's about as fast, which is really fast.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.340
Which was pretty darn fast.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.780
Yeah, and then, so the test machine is Intel-based.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.300
And so it took both Wes and I,

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.260
it took us until there was a bit of a glitch.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.300
You saw it in Firefox.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.140
Oh, yeah.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.860
But it took us a little bit before we realized

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.300
our test machine was on Wayland.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.220
Totally on Wayland, yeah.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.900
We got a far way into the workday before we realized that.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.180
And it was a small glitch.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.420
It went away in seconds,

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.300
and the rest of it was pretty darn smooth.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.380
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.780
I will say, too, the setup, like when you've got

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.300
everything installed and then you boot up into Fedora,

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.820
then it has you, like, set up your first account.

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:11.340
Yeah, that welcome wizard thing.

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.180
Pretty smooth.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.460
Like, it just does that, and then it reloads

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.300
the GNOME session and logs you into your new account

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.140
that you've just made.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:18.100
I'm surprised more distros don't use that.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:18.940
Yeah.

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.460
But a lot of them just get it done

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.900
during the installation process,

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.580
which Fedora, some of those questions that they ask

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:26.460
post-installation, they've removed from the Anaconda.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.140
There's obviously upsides to both,

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.620
but I was glad that it worked,

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.300
and it didn't crash Wayland.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.380
Yeah, that's true.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:34.620
It didn't crash.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.140
Oh, that's a good point.

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:36.980
Huh.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.020
In fact, I'd have to use it harder.

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.220
I bet you I could get it to crash.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.060
You know, I'm pretty good at getting

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.180
no shell to crash. You are.

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.460
I get it to crash usually. You have a gift.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.980
I do have a gift for it.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.020
Yeah, so this modularity, I think, long-term

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.620
is the bigger deal, because you look at Fedora,

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:53.140
it's got essentially like a 13-month support cycle

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:56.620
per release, and that sort of means

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:57.660
you're gonna need to update.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.020
If you were gonna actually deploy this

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.940
in a production server environment,

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.340
about every 13 months,

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:05.660
probably just about right there on the nose,

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:07.580
you're gonna need to go log into your servers

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.580
and upgrade them, and one of the reasons

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.460
I've been doing this experiment with this droplet now

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.180
for ages is because I wanted to know

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.420
how far I could push it.

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:18.380
Is that really possible?

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:21.620
I have now experienced more than five or six,

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:24.220
I lost track at so many flawless upgrades.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:25.100
It just keeps working.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.100
Without issue.

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.540
Part of it, it helps that the applications

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.500
are containerized, so they're isolated from the system,

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.820
and I have to keep those containers updated too,

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.820
but it has made the risk surface

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.300
of the upgrade a lot smaller,

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:42.420
and so I have a very small core Fedora install

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.260
that can just be pretty standard.

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:45.100
Yeah.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.940
And when you combine this software repository modularity,

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.380
it means that when 30 comes around,

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:54.540
and I'm rather compelled to upgrade,

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:56.460
if something I need to do my job

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.620
still depends on 29's version of something,

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.260
modularity will allow me to upgrade to Fedora 30

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:05.580
but still run that software dependent on Fedora 29.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:06.940
When you combine it with RHEL too,

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.060
it seems like a really good story

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.420
because let's say you're developing on Fedora,

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.420
and a new one comes out,

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.460
you're not ready to update Node

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.500
because your whole production stack's

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.460
based on this one version.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.740
Well, you can keep it, and then RHEL's released,

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.140
and of course it's gonna have an older version,

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.820
but if both of them have the modularity set up,

01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:21.660
well, it doesn't matter.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.700
You just pick and choose and match them.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.980
Right, this modularity is clearly gonna be

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.820
way more important when it hits Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:32.260
and that's in light of this acquisition.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.900
You have this, this is the first release

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.380
since we know about IBM wanting to buy Red Hat,

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.460
and here's the Fedora project,

01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.820
and the thing that we are probably collectively

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.660
the most worried about is what the hell's gonna happen

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.500
to Fedora long term?

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.460
Because they're becoming a hybrid cloud company,

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.700
and I don't really know what a hybrid cloud is.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.100
I know what the cloud is.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.060
I know what hybrids are.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.540
Those are cars.

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.900
So I don't know what a hybrid cloud is,

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:58.660
but whatever Red Hat's gonna do

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.860
to be the dominant platform of a hybrid cloud

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.140
probably doesn't include a lot of Fedora on the desktop.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:06.300
Yes, right, like obviously there's lots of stuff

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.740
that isn't just desktop specific

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.340
that gets put in and tested in Fedora,

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.300
but we don't talk very much or hear very much

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:13.820
about the Fedora server story.

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:14.740
So maybe even internally,

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:17.260
maybe there's ways that they test all of that,

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.580
but 13 months, you're not gonna run

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:23.260
your five-year production application on it.

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:24.580
It's a weird future.

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.620
And that's just really the beginning of it.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.860
I mean, Gnome Shell is primarily a Red Hat project,

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:34.660
or in a big way, GDK, GDK.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:39.900
And so using Fedora now in light of that,

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.540
you sit here and you realize this is an important project.

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.340
This is a pretty important project.

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.980
And I don't want anything happening to Fedora.

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.900
I want it to stick around.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.740
I wanna see 30 ship, because when 30 lands,

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.860
I think we're gonna see more Project Stratus,

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.300
or Stratus Storage, I think it's called now, land in 30.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.700
I think we're gonna see a more complete version

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.420
of Pipewire land in Fedora 30.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.540
Plus, you're gonna see another go

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.300
at this modularity stuff in Fedora 30.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.100
And aren't they also saying that that's when

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.020
Silverblue's gonna be...

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.140
There's hopes there that Silverblue will be pretty prominent.

01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.420
Maybe even the preferred workstation choice by Fedora 30.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.260
I don't know if they'll get there,

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.620
but lots of neat stuff there with OS tree

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:19.980
and immutable system packages.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.460
Yeah.

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.460
Yeah, so overall, if you're a Fedora user,

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.460
this is just another easy slam dunk.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:30.420
There's really, and with Flat Hub and Flatpaks now,

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.580
and containers for server-side applications,

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.100
the risks for upgrading between Fedora releases

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.980
are getting really low.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.300
You gotta figure, if you kept that installation around

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.460
for a while, when Fedora 30 came out,

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.700
those Flatpaks are still gonna work.

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.540
Just fine.

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:44.940
And they've done some things,

01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.700
like it's easy to get H.264.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.740
They've even got the write-in GNOME software.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.460
You can enable the repo for Google Chrome.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.300
So like...

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.140
Really?

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:52.980
Yeah, I was impressed with that.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.820
I didn't do that.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:54.980
I'm gonna use some Firefox.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:56.260
And that's totally fine too.

01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.300
Look, you got a browser, you've got a great desktop

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.860
and a good shell and all of that.

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.260
And then you've got all the Flatpaks

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.180
for your proprietary Electron apps.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.020
Yeah.

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:04.860
That's it, that's what I need.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.660
That's my production machine for just day-to-day use.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.220
Yeah, and DNF, every time I use that tool,

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.260
I'm like, damn, this is great.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.980
It's come a long way from the days of YUM.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.380
It's a package manager if you were gonna make

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:18.580
a package manager, a more modern...

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.140
Like if today you were gonna start over

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:21.740
and build a package manager,

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:22.900
DNF is probably what you'd come up with.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.740
There's still some things,

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:25.740
like there are times where it's weirdly slow

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:27.900
or some of the things don't feel very optimized.

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.060
But you're right, like the principles behind it,

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.060
the concepts, the abstractions there,

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.780
they're really solid.

01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:36.700
Yeah, so you can get it at getfedora.org

01:08:36.700 --> 01:08:40.580
and go grab an image.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.020
They don't have the upgrade post out yet,

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.140
but they almost always have those out.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.860
Oh, nope, still the old ones.

01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:49.860
But actually the commands still work, I think.

01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:52.100
You just have to change the release from 28 to 29.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.300
Just don't blame Chris when your machine doesn't boot up.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.740
Yeah, so if this modularity thing sounds confusing

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:02.340
and odd to you, trust me, it is.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.900
And we have a link in the show notes

01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:05.740
where you can read more about it

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:09.900
at linuxunplug.com slash 273.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.100
And they have a diagram up there

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.220
on how modularity kind of works.

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.780
It really just comes down to just

01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:17.140
making all the different components work,

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.180
making the repository descriptions work correctly,

01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.060
making DNF understand what you're asking for, all of that.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.460
And then the applications being linked

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.660
to the right libraries.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.700
I think it's a pretty cool system.

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.820
I know they've been working on it for a long time.

01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.340
I'm surprised it took so long.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.380
I mean, this feels like something

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:33.580
we should have had ages ago.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:34.420
Yeah.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.780
Well, I had an opportunity last week, was it,

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:39.380
that we did our PipeWire episode?

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.220
Oh, yeah.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:43.460
When that episode came out, I was down in Santa Clara

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.820
at the Intel campus at MeetBSD.

01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.340
Look at you.

01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.220
They have these, boy, these BSD guys,

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.340
they have a lot of conferences.

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:55.220
But MeetBSD is only like twice a year in California,

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.940
like the one down here in the States.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:57.780
Oldly.

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.220
That's, or once every two years, I'm sorry.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.540
Oh, yeah, okay.

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.500
No, yeah, the other way around.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.060
They have plenty of other ones

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.660
going on all the fricking time.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.780
But this one, the one that's put on by IAC Systems,

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:11.900
is once every two years.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.340
And so I went to the last one,

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.260
and that was at the Berkeley campus.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.100
Oh, yeah, right.

01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:16.940
Yeah.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.540
And so I got a chance to go to this one,

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:21.260
and I didn't know what to expect exactly

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.300
because not only was this post-Linux Academy acquisition,

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:27.180
so I wasn't sure if that would be awkward or not,

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:30.860
but also, at the time, it was when Linus was getting

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.660
a whole bunch of, you know,

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.940
just all the attention for getting,

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:34.780
and he was taking his break.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:36.340
Like, I just wasn't sure what to expect.

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.180
And it must be interesting, too.

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:39.020
I mean, you're coming into a community,

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:41.100
obviously, you know and like the BSDs,

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:42.780
but it's not something you use in your day-to-day life.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.460
Yeah, and I know some of the people there.

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:48.100
And the other thing is, too, it's like,

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.060
it's like going to learn something about something

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.060
that you kind of are tangentially familiar with

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:53.940
but not like crazy familiar with.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:55.900
So it's not like the kind of event I would normally go to,

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.420
but I always find it to be worth the time.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.780
So I knew when I had the opportunity to go to this next one,

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.620
I knew I was going to go, there was just no question.

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:03.580
But I thought what I would do,

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.980
because I have such a bad memory,

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.660
especially when it's a week later,

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.980
I took an audio recorder with me

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:12.580
to capture some of my thoughts there at the conference.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.100
And I wanted to kind of recreate

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.180
some of the conference experience for you.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:19.820
So this was me arriving at the Intel campus,

01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:23.380
which, holy crap, the Intel campus is multiple blocks

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:27.300
with multiple sky bridges and multiple parking lots.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.900
That's what matters, the sky bridge count.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.740
When it's more than one sky bridge, it does matter.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.780
Like, this is a big place.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.860
So like, the first 15 minutes of me getting to MeetBSD,

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.740
we're figuring out how to get from the parking lot

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.620
to where I was allowed to go.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:45.140
But it was fascinating to be at their home office.

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.540
So this is day one of MeetBSD California 2018.

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.140
I've said my highs to, hey, Alan, there's Alan.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.260
Hi, people.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:53.740
There's Alan, said my highs to Alan.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:55.620
And we're getting seated.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.940
They're showing a montage of BSD people.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.900
I don't recognize any of them.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.740
I just keep waiting to see Alan up there.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:04.120
And you know what else I found?

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.740
It's mostly just them eating food, just mostly

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:07.580
them eating food.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:08.620
But we're getting ready.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.740
I think it's going to be a good day because we're here

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:16.100
at the Intel campus in one of their convention rooms,

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:16.980
I guess.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.980
What do you call this room?

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:19.860
Gorgeous.

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.100
Yeah, it's a big room.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.860
And they got a big screen, they got lights,

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:24.740
they got professional audio.

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:28.180
And they're getting everybody settled for what is clearly

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.180
going to be a great day.

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:31.140
And I got an Intel badge for the day.

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:32.700
They gave everybody an Intel badge

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.820
so you can get to certain areas of the building

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.540
and steal all their secrets.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.860
Hey, there's a picture of Alan.

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860
Lots of pictures of Alan.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.220
He's a bit of a celebrity around there.

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:43.580
So the first talk was good.

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.820
It was a really good talk.

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.340
It was more of a fundamentals talk

01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.580
to get us going in the morning.

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.820
Producer Q5SIS did a great Q&A in the morning,

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:50.820
got everybody talking.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.340
Nice.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.740
It's a crowd of like 80, 90 that first day.

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:57.420
So it was big enough that you felt like you're an event,

01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.500
but small enough that we could pass the microphone

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.180
around the whole room.

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.300
And everybody did introductions.

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:01.980
Oh, really?

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.060
Everybody talked about what project they work on.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.220
That is kind of intimate.

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.140
That's neat.

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.460
Yeah, and lots of joking about Linux.

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:09.800
Because a lot of people were there

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.300
because they're passionate about BSD,

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.740
but they make their day money programming or developing

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:14.860
on Linux.

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:17.140
A lot of device driver guys there.

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:21.100
Network performance was a big focus for a lot of them.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.260
I have a blog post where I go into some

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.260
of the details of the companies that were there.

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.700
LinuxUnplugged.com, if you click on the blog link at the top.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.220
Somebody from eBay was there.

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:38.020
Juniper Networks, Cisco, Groupon, obviously Intel.

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.720
Just lots of companies that are interested

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:41.140
in that low level stuff.

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:42.680
And so it was fascinating to hear what they're working on

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.020
as they passed the mic around.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:49.060
But the second talk I think was really symbolic

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:52.420
because it was from an individual in Intel's open

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:57.180
source group who has been a graphics driver, a low level

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.500
graphics driver developer for Linux for years.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:05.860
We owe this guy a lot of thanks for enabling tons and tons

01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.420
of low level graphics capabilities in Linux,

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.580
not just on Intel Harbor, but on Intel in general.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.340
He now works on enabling general BSD technologies.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.100
I don't know what that means.

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:20.500
But there was a clear tone to his talk.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:24.220
He had gotten that presentation at this event for 80 or 90

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:29.500
people, super scrutinized by the Intel legal and brass in a way

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.940
that his talks never get scrutinized.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.820
Because there was an area in there

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.740
that they felt very delicate about.

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.420
This is my opinion.

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.940
And that's the area where he apologizes

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.060
for how bad Intel screwed the BSD community with Meltdown

01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.700
and Spectre.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:46.660
That's got to be, right?

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:48.140
That has to be on every one's book.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.700
And in there he, and I have a picture in the blog,

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.060
and I have the quote.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.700
In there, they adopt a security first pledge that he makes.

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.300
And you can see that in the blog post.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.220
But here's my thoughts after that talk.

01:15:01.220 --> 01:15:05.860
It's lunchtime, my favorite time of day one at Meet BSD 2018.

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:07.900
I just wanted to share some initial impressions

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.240
of the Intel campus because that's

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.540
one of the coolest things about going to this event

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:15.740
is getting access to the Intel campus with our security

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.820
badges and our whatnots.

01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.180
But it is only a small area.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:24.160
We're confined to a specific area of the Intel campus.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.620
But even there, you can still glean

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.180
a few things about their corporate culture.

01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:31.500
Of course, you get to see how they do security.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.100
And you get to meet some engineers.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.460
In fact, I've already met a couple of Intel engineers

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:37.620
who are big Linux fans.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.380
And a couple of them are BSD fans too.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.900
But don't tell the Meet BSD coordinators that.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.380
They wouldn't want to know.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:47.660
And it's unlike going to an event center that is

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:49.300
designed to hold these events.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:52.220
You are seeing a corporate building

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:53.940
be adapted for an event.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.820
So we're using their corporate auditorium

01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:01.940
that they must give big product presentations and Apple style

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:05.980
events to their own employees in this room that we're sitting

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:08.500
in there talking about BSD now.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.260
And they've had to give us access to their network

01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.860
so we can get on the Wi-Fi.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.540
There's facilities that has to come in there to provide food,

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:16.780
like catering.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:20.240
And Intel has to facilitate all of that.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.740
And I've gotten the impression that it

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.400
started a little broader.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.480
They were a little more concerned.

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.100
They wanted everyone to have an escort when they left the room.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:31.740
They didn't want to provide internet access.

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:35.560
They wanted to have reviews of what was going to be discussed.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.440
And over time, as they worked with the Meet BSD coordinators,

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.760
Intel loosened up.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.180
They kind of became a little more hip to what was going on,

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.900
the idea of it and the unconference fact of it.

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:49.240
And now we just have full run of this area of the Intel campus.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.340
So day one has been really about everybody

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.140
kind of getting to know each other.

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.620
One of the first talks out of the gate was Chris Moore.

01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:00.580
And he talked about people building future BSD projects

01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.900
off of a true OS build system that they're creating.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.140
Don't call it a distributions, but that did sneak in there

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.280
once, the word BSD distribution snuck in there once.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.140
The second talk was from an Intel employee, who in part

01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:15.940
wanted to apologize for the fiasco of Meltdown Inspector

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:17.380
to the BSD community, but also was

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:19.380
talking about some of the current things they're

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.020
struggling with and trying to fix,

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:22.660
things they were able to solve in Linux

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:24.580
that they're now trying to solve in BSD.

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:28.100
And that was a lot more interesting than I expected,

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:31.540
to hear an Intel insider talk about the things they're

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.780
working on day to day for open source that

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.100
just generally doesn't get the day of light.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:39.100
Now it's net BSD after lunch, and then

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:43.080
the one I'm looking forward to, a ZFS discussion panel.

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.260
Yeah, I mean, when you've got the room full of folks

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.140
that you do, you've got to talk about ZFS.

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.580
And they did.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.380
And it's so funny.

01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:55.260
Like the ZFS panel now, they've done this before.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:56.940
And they don't bother going up there

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.660
and having a talk anymore, because they really just

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:01.860
have it down to a Q&A. Because everybody just

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.020
has all of these questions.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.220
How do I solve this problem?

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:05.540
It's a room full of people trying

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.900
to solve storage problems.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.260
And the thing about the BSD community

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.940
is they don't have this debate about what file system to use.

01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:13.620
There's only one file system.

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:14.740
Well, I mean, there's two.

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:15.460
There's UFS and.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.460
Yes, yes.

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.460
Yeah, in fact.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:20.420
But you know which one they're for, right?

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.220
You know what you're doing, where you're using it.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:24.900
The original developer of UFS gives a talk

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:27.020
that I cover here in a second.

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.820
So the ZFS panel, they go up there.

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:31.900
Alan Jude, of course, up there.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.100
Dan Landgill up there as well.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:34.620
It was great.

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:35.900
It was really good.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.660
I got to hang out with Benedict, Alan, and Dan.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.180
That sounds like a fun trip.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:41.380
It was a lot of fun.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:44.140
So here was my reactions after getting to hear

01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:45.860
a little Alan Jude ZFS talk.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:47.820
It's the end of day here at MeetBSD,

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:49.100
for at least the first day.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.860
And the conference had a pretty strict schedule,

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.300
but a very relaxed feel.

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.740
I mean, every 45 minutes or so, something's

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.780
happening, for the most part.

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:01.320
There was a few areas here and there

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.620
where the conversation got pretty in-depth,

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.940
and things maybe ran a little long.

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:09.340
It's a very enthusiastic crowd.

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:10.920
Everybody here is very passionate

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:13.280
about this particular technology area.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.940
And they just wrapped up the ZFS panel,

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.580
which got a bunch of questions from the audience.

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:18.540
The entire time, the panel did nothing but take questions

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:19.500
from the audience.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:21.180
And now that we're all done with day one,

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.020
it's time to go have a pizza social.

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.260
The BSD people are serious about their food,

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.260
just about as serious as I am.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:29.740
Where they had this pizza social,

01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:31.540
they had IT vending machines.

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.040
Did I show you a picture of these?

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:33.540
Oh, yeah.

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.420
That is neat.

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.180
Touchscreens that run the whole length of the vending machine.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.660
And it's got a companion storage box next to it.

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:41.740
That's also the size of a vending machine.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:47.500
And inside it is Lenovo ThinkPad batteries, MacBook dongles,

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:51.580
headsets with microphones, like your average everyday.

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:52.820
HDMI adapter.

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:55.780
A mouse, that kind of stuff, just IT accessories.

01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:58.860
And you, quote unquote, purchase it with your company badge.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:02.340
So you run your Intel badge, and then out comes a mouse.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.820
It's the craziest thing.

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:05.940
So that pizza social was pretty fun, because I just

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:07.740
got to chat with everybody.

01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:12.580
And I left early, because I've done enough of these events.

01:20:12.580 --> 01:20:16.260
And if it's not my core crew, sometimes I'll go out

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.060
and I'll party late.

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.980
But if it's not my core crew, I'm like, well,

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.260
it was great seeing you guys.

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:21.220
You guys have a great night.

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:21.980
I'm going to bed.

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.060
And I go to bed at 9 o'clock, and I get great sleep,

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.380
and I don't get sick.

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:28.820
You see, the other folks, though, they didn't really

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:29.700
follow that.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.260
And I got there early, and I thought I was in bad shape,

01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.980
but the whole crew was hungover.

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:36.940
Good morning.

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:41.220
It's day two at Meet BSD in Santa Clara, California.

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:44.220
Today is October 20, 2018.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.980
And the BSD folk are trickling in.

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.460
You feed them, and they show up.

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:52.620
Some of them were out quite late last night, 1 AM or so,

01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.660
being very geeky.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:58.420
I, on the other hand, being the seasoned fest-goer that I am,

01:20:58.420 --> 01:20:59.900
was in bed by 10 o'clock.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.380
You see, I got these systems I keep in place.

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.460
Keep hydrated, wash the hands, and go to bed by 10 o'clock.

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.940
And then you don't get any con crud.

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:12.540
But here, for these people, it's a rare opportunity

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:16.420
to actually get together and talk in person.

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:18.220
They do all of their communication

01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:20.580
primarily over IRC and email.

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.180
So to actually get here in person and chat

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.180
is a nice opportunity.

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.500
So a lot of them show up an hour before the thing even starts.

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:28.580
So think about that.

01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:29.980
They've been up till 1 AM.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:33.180
And then they show up at the Intel campus at 8 AM.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.820
First talk doesn't even start till 9 AM.

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:37.980
But they get a chance to catch up with someone else,

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.440
to chat with somebody else.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.140
And some of them are just pretty hardcore.

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.660
Plus the free pastries, coffee, juice, and fruit

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.780
doesn't hurt either.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:46.860
Today, they have a very special guest joining us.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.480
We'll get to hear from him.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:51.420
And it'll be a nice, steady pace.

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:55.420
But I'm looking forward to getting a few more

01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:58.180
opportunities to have a few conversations with people.

01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:00.260
Now, this special guest was sort of teased.

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.880
We weren't sure if he's going to make it.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.660
He might make it.

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:06.100
And I asked Denise, who was organizing the event,

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:09.220
how do you not know if your star speaker is

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.260
going to make it or not?

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.740
That's sort of rough.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.020
She's like, trust me, I know.

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:15.340
It's very, very rough.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.020
We'll just vamp.

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:16.960
It'll be fine.

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.460
But they had been kind of teasing this might happen.

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.460
But they didn't put it on the official schedule

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:23.380
because they weren't sure.

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.740
But in the BSD land, you have your royalty.

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:30.300
There are people in BSD that are real royalty

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:33.380
that the group has a reverence for.

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:36.440
If they speak, everybody stops talking to listen.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:38.420
When they enter a room, all the heads turn.

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.020
There's real respect.

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.620
And they're not snooty.

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:43.140
They're really down to earth.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:43.700
They're nice.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.300
In fact, if you weren't part of the BSD community at first

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.420
and not maybe paying attention to the social cues,

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:50.620
you wouldn't know they were anybody special.

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.340
But because they're just another person hanging out.

01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.180
With hanging out with the BSD people.

01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:56.900
But when you know what to look for,

01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:01.300
you can tell how respected these individuals are.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.660
And maybe one of the most respected

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:07.420
is the creator of that file system, UFS.

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.300
And he was able to make it.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.980
He walks up on stage.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:14.140
And the moment he's up there, he has all eyes.

01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.940
Nobody's looking at their laptops.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:17.500
Everybody's paying attention.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.300
Even though he's probably told the story they've all heard

01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.340
100 times before, everybody's paying attention.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:26.700
Because, I don't know, it's sort of like when

01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.940
you're that family member that you love the stories

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:29.860
the family member tells.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:32.100
He goes up there, he tells one of his famous stories.

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:37.700
Well, that was a great history talk by Dr. Kirk McCusick.

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.940
The room really seemed to enjoy that.

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.620
And that was pretty neat, because they

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.780
weren't sure if Kirk was going to be able to make that talk

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:44.900
because of jury duty.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.160
And at the last minute, he was able to make it.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.180
So they popped out some lightning talk rounds.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:53.660
They had a batch of lightning talk rounds and popped in Dr.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:54.820
McCusick in there.

01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.380
He went a little long, though.

01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:57.900
I don't think anybody's going to mind.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:58.100
Yeah.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.660
They follow the schedule pretty closely

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.800
until Dr. McCusick's up on stage.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.540
And then he can take as long as he likes.

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:06.660
There was sort of a different tone to the second day.

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.820
And I go into this a little bit more in the blog post.

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:11.740
But in the second day, it was a smaller crowd.

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:13.140
I thought Saturday would be bigger.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.540
But the second day was a smaller crowd.

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:14.980
Oh, that is weird, right?

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.860
You think more people would be going on a weekend.

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.320
But everybody, so you'd had that first day where everybody

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:22.220
had done introductions and sort of broken the ice.

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:26.260
Then everybody hung out until like 1 AM, getting drunk

01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:27.580
and having a good time.

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:33.500
And so the second day had a really casual, friendly vibe.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:39.300
Just like that, day two of being inside Intel

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:40.580
comes to a close.

01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:42.720
They're doing the breakout sessions right now.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.700
And then they're going to wrap things up.

01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:47.860
The end of the day actually is the beginning

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.660
of the party for FreeBSD's 25th birthday.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.140
So that's what we do next.

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:55.300
Day two, though, is the one to go to.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:59.020
If you could only make it to one day, it's almost day two.

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:02.860
Because by day two, everyone's guard's down a little bit.

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.900
Everybody's cracking jokes.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:06.420
It's more friendly.

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:07.660
It's more laid back.

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:08.900
It's more natural.

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:10.780
It's a great, fun scene.

01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.820
It's like hanging out with friends day two.

01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.340
Day one is great.

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.620
But everybody's still kind of getting to know each other

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.140
and letting their guard down.

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:21.140
It takes that dinner, that hanging out,

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.980
and that next day where things have thinned down,

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:25.340
it's just a little bit smaller of a crowd.

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:26.820
All those things add up to everybody

01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:28.020
being a little more relaxed.

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.420
And it makes it a really fun environment.

01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.540
It's been pretty cool to hang out inside Intel.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:33.900
They've limited where we could go.

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:36.140
But where we've been able to go has been very nice.

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:37.500
And they've been very gracious.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.340
You combine that with the constant supply of fruits

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.580
and snacks and coffee.

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.380
It's just been a really good educational event.

01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:47.500
And now I'm going to go eat a whole bunch of pizza

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.460
in the name of FreeBSD's birthday.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:50.500
They had a cake.

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.180
They had, actually, it ended up being a taco bar.

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.140
That was the other thing.

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:57.660
I was there with listener Ryan, and friend Ryan, really.

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:02.140
And he and I are Linux admins, I used to be,

01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:03.300
and he is currently.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.140
And so we kind of shared a common bond

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.140
over processing this BSD information,

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.100
because we both have a Linux admin background.

01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:09.780
Totally.

01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:11.460
And he's working on tons of systems.

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.000
He's got a whole bunch of BSD systems

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.040
he's responsible for, too.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.100
So he's coming at it from two different angles.

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.340
I asked him afterwards, I said, what do you think?

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.100
Was this valuable?

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.580
He was like, every talk, I learned something.

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:22.820
Every single talk.

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.620
And because it's not huge, you didn't

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:25.820
have to go to multiple rooms.

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:27.940
You stayed in the auditorium the entire time.

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:29.420
You weren't scrambling around trying

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.140
to figure out which thing you were going to listen to.

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.140
Yeah, you just basically had the hallway track,

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.480
or you had the auditorium.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.440
And the hallway track was constantly

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:39.980
Intel provided this area where you could hang out and chat.

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.700
And there was always like, you know.

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:42.060
It was easy to do.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:42.860
You weren't in the way.

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.220
There was just a space for that.

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.060
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:48.300
Or you could go sit in the main auditorium and catch a talk.

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:51.620
And so you always were able to catch all the talks.

01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:55.200
Or if there was one that just didn't really appeal to you,

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.260
you could take a break.

01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:57.740
It was really nicely done.

01:26:57.740 --> 01:26:59.860
A lot of the Linux events that we go to now

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:03.380
are so big that there's multiple tracks happening

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.160
at the same time.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.540
And you get there.

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:07.420
And this is, I think, a common problem

01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:09.180
that newcomers to conferences have,

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.180
is you get completely overwhelmed because you

01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:12.420
can't attend at all.

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.860
And there will often be multiple talks

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:15.980
going on that you're interested at the same time.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:16.980
And it's really overwhelming.

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:18.780
Whereas with MeetBSD, it's all in one room

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:20.700
because of the size and the scale of the event.

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.140
And it was a good size for me.

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:23.020
I really enjoyed it.

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.860
It seems like from what you've said,

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.940
like there's a bit more of a cohesiveness.

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:30.800
Or I don't know, at Linux events,

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.140
there's obviously lots of people there with the same mindset.

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:34.420
They're almost always wonderful.

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:35.780
You like what-minded people.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.920
People are interested in the same stuff

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.340
that you learn out about.

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:39.720
But you're interested in maybe different things.

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:41.060
Like maybe you care about Linux,

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.740
or you just care about open source desktops

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.180
and Linux as an implementation deal.

01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:47.140
Or you really love GIMP, and you don't care at all

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:48.460
about containers, right?

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.260
Was there anything different in this, in that if you go here,

01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:53.140
you probably use a BSD stack, right?

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.620
You use OpenBSD on your firewall.

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:57.860
You use FreeBSD for a whole bunch of your desktops

01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.900
that like, was it different?

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:06.100
You know, there is a cohesiveness and a singularness

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:09.620
of thought that we don't have in Linux, for sure.

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:10.820
More so than we have in Linux.

01:28:10.820 --> 01:28:13.980
But at the same time, more than I've ever seen,

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.820
I saw a lot of fragmentation.

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.180
I was really surprised.

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:18.740
So behind the scenes, and I think

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.340
one of the things that I learned in this event

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.660
that the BSDs are really going to struggle with

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.180
is modernization.

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:26.060
A lot of people like to use BSD because it's

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.980
how things have been done for a long time, which

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.500
means when you need to modernize, people don't like it.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.360
Before the General Meet BSD people attended,

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.620
there was a developer summit.

01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.580
And in there, they were trying, some of the developers

01:28:36.580 --> 01:28:38.120
were trying to make a case to the other developers

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.340
that we need to move to Git off of SVN.

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:42.780
And that wasn't going over.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:45.580
I mean, the sell is, well, OK, well, we'll build a bridge

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.780
so you can keep doing SVN, and on the back end,

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.580
we'll have that going up to Git.

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:52.540
So there's a resistance to change, which

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.260
could be challenging for them.

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:57.540
But yeah, I mean, I think that's both like many things.

01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:58.900
That's a positive and negative, right?

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.620
Yeah, it means that it's more carefully crafted.

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:02.340
But it means you have certain developers who are like,

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.460
come on, man, we need to start doing this in a better

01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:05.300
way, in a newer way.

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.060
And then you have other people like,

01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:08.100
this has worked fine for 20, 30 years.

01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:09.900
We don't need to change this.

01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.620
And that's a hard argument that they get stuck at, I think.

01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:13.980
But they're managing it, and they're

01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:15.780
trying to walk that line while still

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.100
being respectful to the old way of doing things.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.600
So they're trying to walk the line.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.780
The other thing is, I was really surprised.

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:23.940
They asked how many people in the room are using Trident,

01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.060
the new desktop.

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.460
Only the developers of Trident were using it.

01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.980
Interesting.

01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:32.300
A lot of them were just using the command line.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.940
There's a lot of differences in how they use it.

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.180
But I'd say they have more in common

01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:39.300
than the average group of Linux users does.

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:40.620
That was my over.

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.900
I was surprised where they differed.

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:45.140
And I realized, damn, that could be a drag on the project

01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.340
in some cases.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:48.860
But I felt like they differed in less places overall.

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.540
Yeah, it's impressive.

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:53.200
BSDs, obviously, they're separate communities,

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.500
and they're separate BSD projects when we say the BSDs.

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:58.420
But in general, it seems like they've

01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:00.060
grown a really good community that's

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:01.220
supportive and interesting.

01:30:01.220 --> 01:30:04.060
And they all do a good job of just making cool shit.

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:04.860
Professional.

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:06.340
I felt like it was a professional event.

01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.100
It was well-run.

01:30:07.100 --> 01:30:09.020
IX Systems does a great job.

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:11.020
And it was really gracious of Intel to host it there.

01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.740
So anyways, that's my take on Meet BSD.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.820
It was totally worth going, even as a Linux user.

01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.500
I would go again to the next one.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.020
I agree.

01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.140
I don't think every talk I learned something.

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.360
But absolutely every day, I learned several things

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.820
that I thought were valuable.

01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:27.820
Is there anything you think Linux conferences or conventions

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:31.900
can learn from the way Meet BSD happened?

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.240
It's really hard to say, because one

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.860
of the things that made it so great was the size.

01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:37.260
Wasn't so big.

01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:39.460
And that's really hard to deal with,

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:42.020
because we just have a lot of people to come to these events.

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:44.140
But that's something worth that.

01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.980
I do think it's something worth thinking about.

01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:48.420
And I think it's something that organizers of Linux events

01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.680
should consider doing is attending

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:50.720
some of these BSD events.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.700
Because it feels like you're not overworked,

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.900
but you're getting stuff done.

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:56.020
You're learning stuff.

01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:58.600
It's worth your time, but you don't

01:30:58.600 --> 01:30:59.860
feel like you're at work.

01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:02.580
And you can feel like maybe you don't have so much FOMO.

01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:05.580
You feel like you understood the whole conference.

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.780
I want to do a follow up to last week's episode,

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:11.340
where we finally got that review of the Dell Precision 5530,

01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.340
that monster of a system.

01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:16.020
It looks like a bigger version of the XPS 13.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:18.340
But I wanted to follow up and say,

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:21.140
we've posted a companion blog post of the review,

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:24.100
so that way you can see what it actually looks like,

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:26.320
because it is a beautiful machine.

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:29.460
And I posted some additional thoughts about the review

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:32.500
and links to the benchmarks that I mentioned in that review.

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.100
So if you go to linuxunplugged.com,

01:31:34.100 --> 01:31:36.060
look for the blog link at the top of the site,

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:38.660
and then you'll find the post for both Meet BSD

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.300
and the Dell machine.

01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:41.420
It's a good looking machine.

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.780
So it's like we had to show some pictures of it.

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:45.620
But be honest, the real reason was just

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:48.540
to show up that cute picture of Dylan.

01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:50.040
I did debate putting that picture in,

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.500
but I thought it was good scale.

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.220
Here's what it looks like with the kid in there.

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:56.820
It's a good looking laptop, and he's a good looking kid,

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:58.340
so you put them both in there.

01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.740
The thing I like about that too is

01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:02.820
it's the perfect example of you might not bring it with you

01:32:02.820 --> 01:32:04.740
to the beach every time, but if you need to,

01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:05.900
you definitely can.

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:08.740
Yeah, I actually, this makes me sound like a hipster,

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:12.660
but I actually walked like a mile to a coffee shop

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.580
carrying that laptop.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.420
And I thought, you know what,

01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.300
if I can carry this laptop a mile,

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:19.020
that means it's light enough.

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.100
And so my review of the weight

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.500
that I put in the blog there was,

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:25.940
it's heavy enough that you notice it's in your bag,

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:27.380
but light enough that you can carry it a mile

01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.220
to the coffee shop.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:30.780
So, you know, good enough, right?

01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:31.700
It's good enough.

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:34.460
Anyways, I don't know if we're gonna keep doing

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.980
this blog stuff, so I did one for MeetBSD

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.740
and did one for this Dell Precision 5530.

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.720
I'd like to know your thoughts.

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.640
Tweet me at ChrisLAS or go to the contact page.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:44.580
Is it useful when we,

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:46.340
I think for like the hardware it would be,

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.780
to see a picture of what we're talking about,

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.540
and then you can check it back later on.

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:53.300
Like if you get closer to time to make like a purchase,

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:55.720
you could always come back and check this.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:58.200
But at the same time, it means I'm out there taking pictures,

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.700
we're writing up blogs, it's a fair investment in time.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.340
Not negligible, but if people are gonna look at it,

01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:04.780
if this would be a helpful addendum

01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.700
or extra reference for the show,

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:07.540
it'd be interesting to do.

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.980
We're exploring other ways of just sort of, you know,

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:12.200
increasing our coverage and the ways we do that.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:14.340
And this is one way we could do it, you know,

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.340
there's lots of ways we can make that happen.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:21.340
And boy, speaking of expanding coverage,

01:33:21.700 --> 01:33:23.540
Crazy Noah is blowing out the doors.

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:24.940
Crazy Noah is, right.

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:26.620
It's just, when I saw this, I thought.

01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.820
We cannot keep up with that guy.

01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.020
My God, man, my God.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:34.020
So Ask Noah is near 100 freaking episodes now.

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:38.220
And it's massive because not only is he doing

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:41.280
like a daily show push to get to episode 100,

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.180
so he's doing like episodes on like nearly every day

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:48.180
this week, next week, but for episode 100,

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:50.940
he's gonna have a party that looks awesome.

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:54.980
It's at the Tamarack, I think it is, Tamarack Tap Room.

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.980
And man, does that look good.

01:33:57.980 --> 01:34:00.180
And I think Noah's gonna be buying too.

01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:03.060
So Ask Noah 100 is coming up.

01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.500
He's got a lot planned for it.

01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:05.860
So we wanted to give him a shout.

01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:08.140
So if I show up, I can ask him Linux questions

01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.460
and he'll give me beer?

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.300
That's how that works?

01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:11.140
I wonder.

01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.420
I mean, so it's gonna be, I think it's November,

01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:15.700
I think the party's gonna be November 7th.

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:18.900
And I'll have a link to the Tap Room in the show notes

01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:20.300
if you wanna check it out.

01:34:20.300 --> 01:34:23.780
It is in Minnesota, so just keep that in mind.

01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.660
I tell you what though, if I could make it,

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:29.780
I would so, I called him up, I'm like,

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:32.580
Noah, Noah, wins your party, can I make it?

01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:33.500
He's like, it's on the 7th.

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.680
I'm like, damn it, Noah, I'm gonna be traveling on that day.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.060
So I can't make it, but it looks really great.

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.100
And 100 episodes.

01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:42.900
That is not an easy thing to do.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.300
That is a lot of content and a lot of it, I mean.

01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:48.460
Yeah, he's gonna be doing, with these daily episodes,

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:50.860
he's gonna be doing like format experiments

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.260
to see what people like.

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.180
Try switching up the format of the Ask Noah program

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:55.340
and see what sticks.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.780
So he's gonna be looking for feedback and stuff.

01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.700
So if you've listened to the show before,

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:00.420
maybe it didn't click for you,

01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.540
now's an opportunity to listen while he's doing this

01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.820
and let him know what did click.

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:04.660
Yeah, exactly.

01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:05.480
And he'll do more of it.

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.320
He's pretty keen on that.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.500
So that's the hardest thing, I think, right?

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.420
Like from our side is, there's a lot of ways

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:10.500
to present some of this stuff

01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.180
and not everyone likes all of it,

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.900
so your feedback goes a long way.

01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:18.780
Now, just a couple of quick links before we get out of here.

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:20.360
A couple of workarounds,

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.780
if you're still using Dropbox out there

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:24.860
and you don't have Extended 4,

01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:26.820
there is now DBXFS.

01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:28.700
You can mount Dropbox folders locally

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.400
as a virtual file system on XFS.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.300
There's one.

01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.340
It's using Fuse, as you probably guessed.

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:35.460
And then I'll link to another.

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.500
I knew, I love the internet.

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:37.380
I knew this would happen.

01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:38.220
I knew this.

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:39.300
I said, well, the first thing I said,

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.640
you know, you could just make a loop back.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.980
Just make a loop back.

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:43.580
Put that right, put a loop back image.

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:46.380
Make a loop back and put that right there on your XFS.

01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.660
And make that Extended 4 and you're good to go.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.500
That's why I said that, right?

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:50.860
You said exactly that.

01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:52.580
Make a loop back, loop back.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.380
Well, it is easy to do,

01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:57.420
but I just didn't really get around to doing it yet.

01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:02.420
So Ang P wrote up a rough how-to on Reddit

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:04.460
to do this loop back thing and then mount it

01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:06.420
and make it your Dropbox folder, et cetera.

01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:07.620
So I'll link to that in there too

01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:09.500
if that's something you want to do.

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.940
But you know, I'm just saying,

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.940
I'm just saying this could be,

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.120
with the effort you put into that,

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:16.540
that could be like half the effort

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:17.500
it would take to move to next cloud.

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:18.340
I'm just saying.

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:19.900
Yeah, and I think one of the problems

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.260
is there's a lot of things going on in Dropbox.

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.900
It can be hard to emulate like DBA XFS.

01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:26.900
There's just a lot of things you have to,

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:28.280
there's a lot of things you give up

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.700
because they have all that magic with the file systems.

01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.180
A lot of these need to require connectivity

01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:35.940
or you're gonna have to do manual syncing.

01:36:35.940 --> 01:36:37.900
Let's just go the FOSS way.

01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.780
Yeah, you know, and the thing is,

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:42.020
is Nextcloud has been really,

01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:44.500
so this blog post I did for MeetPSD,

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.460
I use Nextcloud to,

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.540
so I'm taking the pictures on the phone

01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.580
and then I'm writing the blog post on the laptop.

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.820
Well, how do you think I'm getting the pictures

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:54.020
from the phone to retext,

01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.740
which is what I'm writing up the blog post in?

01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:57.480
I think you're sending them to yourself

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:59.300
one by one on Telegram.

01:37:00.540 --> 01:37:02.100
No, that'd be crazy.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.060
I'm using Nextcloud.

01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:05.340
So I take the pictures, they sync up to Nextcloud.

01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:06.860
I've got a specific MeetPSD folder

01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:08.340
I created beforehand to have them sync to.

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:09.500
Oh, nice.

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.360
So what I'm doing is I take the pictures,

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.860
I go to the ones I like in the photo album,

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.640
I share those to the Nextcloud app,

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:17.300
which is set already to go to the MeetPSD folder.

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.560
I upload them, sit down at the old laptop.

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:21.640
They're already there right there on the file system.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.700
Bada bing, bada boom.

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:23.540
I'm working.

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.460
You slot them in, upload them up, then done.

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:27.400
So it's a nice system.

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.100
I missed Dropbox still in a few ways,

01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:30.560
but it is working for me.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:32.420
And my Fedora upgrade didn't break it.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:35.020
So all in all, I'm calling it a win.

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:36.900
Calling it a win.

01:37:36.900 --> 01:37:39.240
All right, well, they haven't said much for a little bit.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:41.820
So I encourage you to go get more poppy and wimpy

01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:43.460
because you're probably missing them right now.

01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:44.540
I know I do.

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:45.380
I know.

01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:47.060
And they had a really good episode on Thursday

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:50.100
where they were first with the Linus news.

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:52.980
And they had a fill-in for wimpy and Jesse.

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:53.820
And he did great.

01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:54.860
It was great to hear Jesse again.

01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:55.700
And he was on there.

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:57.300
And I miss wimpy though.

01:37:57.300 --> 01:37:58.120
I'm not gonna lie.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:58.960
I'm not gonna lie.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.620
But it was a good show nonetheless.

01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:02.660
Another excellent edition of the Ubuntu podcast.

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.500
Ubuntu podcast.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:04.540
Go check that out.

01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:06.020
Go get more Westpane.

01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:11.020
Techsnap.systems and at Westpane on the Twitter's P-A-Y.

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.040
Any.

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.460
Not P-A-I.

01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.740
John, we're right.

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:16.560
Right?

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.400
Get it straight.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.240
No, it's classier with the line.

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.080
I gotta say.

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.140
I gotta say.

01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.300
And I'm at Chris Elias.

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:23.100
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:25.260
And of course, everything we talked about today

01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:29.480
is linked at linuxunplug.com slash 273.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.140
So if you wanna find something we talked about,

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:33.180
grab a tool.

01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:34.280
Oh, we got all the links this week.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.140
So I mean.

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:35.980
Yeah.

01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.820
Unlike last week.

01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.640
We take all the time to add them.

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:38.480
So you gotta go click on them.

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:39.340
Somebody better click them.

01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.380
If you have got a great app pick too,

01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:42.980
we didn't have one this week.

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:43.940
Let us know.

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:44.780
Let us know.

01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:46.900
Yeah, just take all the cool software that you find

01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:48.460
and hurl it at us.

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:49.300
I would.

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.120
Rapid fire style.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:50.960
I would.

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.800
And we'll sort through it.

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.620
Geez, that would be great.

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:53.460
That would be great.

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.940
Also, call back to last week's episode.

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:58.100
Used our jack audio setup on the road

01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.140
to record Linux Action News.

01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:00.940
It worked out great.

01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:01.760
We were crushing it.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.700
So those scripts, checked out in production.

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:04.780
Good work, Mr. Payne.

01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:06.100
All right, thanks so much for tuning in

01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:08.180
to this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:10.740
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:15.740
Bye.

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:42.260
Get it out of here.

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.340
I've been playing around with a new to-do manager,

01:39:52.340 --> 01:39:53.180
Todoist.

01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:54.020
We talked about that a little bit.

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:54.900
Yes, we have.

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:55.740
But people have been asking me,

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.980
well, what if I don't want something

01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:58.340
as sophisticated as Todoist?

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:02.660
I just want it to essentially make to-dos in plain text.

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:05.520
Well, I found this really cool one.

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.660
There's this little known Twitter account

01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:08.500
that you can follow

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.540
that will sometimes tweet new applications.

01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:11.380
Nobody knows about it.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.220
It's my little secret.

01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:14.860
It's the at snapcraft.io Twitter account.

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:15.700
And it tweeted about-

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:16.520
Hello.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.360
Hey-o.

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:18.580
And it tweeted about Taskbook.

01:40:18.580 --> 01:40:21.340
Some mysterious individual has discovered this

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:22.340
and let us all know.

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:24.540
So you can snap install Taskbook.

01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:26.500
And it is a text-based to-do manager.

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:27.700
You get a chance to actually play with it

01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:29.100
before you tweet about it, Poppy?

01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.260
Because it looks really good.

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:31.100
No, I didn't actually.

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.980
I did the bare bones of installing it.

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:34.820
Huh, that looks good.

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.060
Yeah, it does.

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.580
It does actually look quite good.

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:41.540
It's sort of that perfect blend of syntax highlighting,

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.500
text-looking, kind of console-based-looking

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:44.500
kind of text editor.

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.860
And with like a rich command line interface,

01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:48.460
which are two of my favorite things.

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:49.300
I know.

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:50.740
I did switch.

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:53.900
I'm gonna look out for your post about Dropbox

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:55.900
because I've switched away from Dropbox to Syncthing.

01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:58.500
So I'm using Syncthing again across all my machines

01:40:58.500 --> 01:40:59.320
and I love it.

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.860
So why Syncthing and not something like C file

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:03.700
or Nextcloud?

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.420
Because Syncthing is kind of complicated.

01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.740
Oh, really?

01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:12.020
Next, all I did with Syncthing was snap install Syncthing,

01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:15.260
run it, and then it discovered the other machines

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:16.100
on my LAN.

01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:16.940
It said, do you want to add this one?

01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:17.820
I went, yep.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:18.640
What about this one?

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.480
Yep.

01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.320
And I just added them all

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.620
and they all synchronized with each other.

01:41:21.620 --> 01:41:23.500
And I just drop files in a folder and I'm done.

01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.220
So it's not that much harder than Dropbox, to be honest.

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:27.060
I gotta try that again.

01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:28.500
I always had problems with the discovery

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.220
not working here at the studio.

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.740
So, yeah.

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:32.780
And it's a snap now.

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:35.460
So that also is nice because the other issue I had

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:38.860
was my Syncthing systems would lose version sync

01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:40.660
if you'll allow the terminology.

01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:42.260
Yeah, they get out of sync with each other, don't they?

01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:43.380
But that seems like with snaps

01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:45.380
that wouldn't really be as much of a problem.

01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:46.220
Hmm.

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:47.040
Hmm.

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.180
All right, I'll give it a go again.

01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.100
I will.

01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:50.220
That actually is very encouraging

01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.020
because Syncthing's pretty nice.

01:41:52.020 --> 01:41:53.380
Yeah, there was a long time where Syncthing

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:55.620
was like half of my personal infrastructure

01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:56.580
of getting things right.

01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:57.740
I should do that again.

01:41:57.740 --> 01:41:58.580
It feels so good.

01:41:58.580 --> 01:41:59.400
It worked really well.

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:00.240
I just stopped using it

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.180
but it wasn't because it wasn't working.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:02.740
No, it's like a real network file system.

01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.420
It's like everything's available on all your machines.

01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.700
Put it somewhere and there it is over there.

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.220
Sync to each other, peer-to-peer.

01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:09.020
If I remember right, you can also do like proxying.

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:11.620
So if you had like a Syncthing in a DigitalOcean Droplet

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.380
it might get around some network issues.

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:14.740
I did try that for a while

01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:16.460
but then it just, that also stopped working.

01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:18.020
This is what made me lose face.

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:21.540
And I just, I guess I wouldn't say lose faith

01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:24.020
but this is what made me reconsider using Syncthing

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:27.420
was I had these issues where randomly

01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:28.980
they wouldn't discover each other

01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.040
or maybe I could see a local system

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:32.180
but I couldn't see the one on the Droplet.

01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.740
Or I actually, the problem I'd often have

01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.900
is I could see the Droplet funny enough

01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:37.460
but I couldn't see my local boxes

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:41.340
and yeah, I don't know, but again, this was ages ago.

01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:42.900
The only problem I've had with it,

01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:44.900
with machines not discovering each other

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:48.940
is because the machine that couldn't see the others

01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:50.620
had an IPv6 address.

01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:53.340
Ah, I was gonna say it wasn't using the same DNS server.

01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:56.900
Well, it was using a different protocol to talk

01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:59.560
and so it was looking for the others on IPv6

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:01.940
and none of my machines have IPv6

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:04.100
so I just disabled IPv6 everywhere

01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:33.100
and now everything's working sweet.
