1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
We have we have something kind of unusual for the unplugged show we have a

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,640
Well a real lug member. I guess not a virtual lug member Anthony is right here in the trailer with me. Hey Anthony

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,380
Hey, how y'all doing? I love your this so let me paint the picture for you guys Anthony is rocking a last jacket

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,740
It's a little warm, too. You're rocking a last jacket and then underneath it Linux fest Northwest 2015

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,200
That's how'd you get that jacket that shirt picked it up back in the spring mm-hmm when you were at?

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
Linux best North there you go

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,600
So did you make the drive did you drive all the way from here cuz I could now tell you officially

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,080
That's a long-ass drive. Oh, yeah to me. I don't know it's I go to Seattle a lot

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,400
So it's like to me is I guess that's nine hours, right? It's nine hours. Not too bad. Okay in ten hours

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,240
Yeah, nine ten hours. Not too bad. All right. Do you do it all in one drive? Oh, yeah, okay?

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,000
So you're crazy then I do you do it in your car. Yeah, all right you podcast the whole way

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,680
Yeah, now you do something right? I am a vlogger. Yeah, yeah, YouTube vlogger, so tell me about that

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,440
Um I vlog my life and my experiences with the Linux and computers. Are you oh really Linux isn't it mm-hmm?

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,600
Are you gonna vlog this you know what I'm gonna have to yeah

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
You got a camera over there, huh?

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
Yep, yep. Oh boy. Oh boy. Okay. You guys. I don't I don't know if I

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,940
Okay, now he's pulling out the camera right now. I'm painting a picture for you. Oh now. It's on me now

18
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,040
How did this have this supposed to be an audio show turn the tables on Chris last I love it

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,800
Now he's on video. Yeah now mom video right there. Hello everybody. Hey, it's a 4k camera here

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,360
Here's the JB rover in 4k everybody is that 4k. Yeah, wow I guess if you're doing YouTube right you should do 4k

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,120
Yeah, I just recently got into 4 take 4k. Yeah, how much was that? That's nice about 600 bucks. Oh, she's bad alright alright

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,280
No, I want another toy now. Yeah, I bet you know that you know there

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,720
Are there are a few things that come out a lot of times?

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,160
I think it's just marketing like when it comes to 4g or something like that

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm like ah just a new way of marketing the same old thing, but when it comes to 4k

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,920
There are very clear defined advantages that nobody can deny

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,440
That make it really really really compelling to spend some money on something like a 4k camera, right?

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,480
It's it's beautiful when you actually even on a 1080 display

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,800
It still looks very very good right and you use it for do you do you like the super zoom effect you?

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,520
But you're releasing 4k, so you're probably not doing I see. I'm getting ready to release in 4k. I just recently upgraded to this

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,640
Because the new Lightworks beta is now supporting. Are you editing? Okay? Yes, I do everything on Linux

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,180
Yeah, he's doing you know he's doing everything under Linux. How about that awesome brother?

33
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,640
He's doing 4k. No you better step it up. I know I know well

34
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,980
Here's that here's the thing if I if if it give me this alright

35
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,320
Give me this the user interface like the layout of Lightworks is like it's horrible right like the workflow is pretty bad

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,920
I don't know

37
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,040
I actually it kind of grows on you because I've spent a lot of time in the program when I first first few months

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,360
Yeah, it was the worst thing in the planet to learn and now that I'm kind of learning

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
It's in and out somewhere everything's kind of hidden

40
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,120
I feel like it's it's just on the power level of like premiere. What do you use for encoding?

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,200
What do you what do you code out from Lightworks or using an FFmpeg once you get it out of it works?

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,680
I go straight from my camera load it up into the Lightworks

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,100
Yeah, and then just export it out of light

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm just export it out and Lightworks handles all the encoding all that news and throw it right up on YouTube. Yep nice

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,480
That's not bad. All right. All right. I got to give that a shot the the thing about like so you've used premiere

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
So then you'll know what I'm talking about. I feel like every other

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Audio product or a video production suite like I can even if I've never used it before if you just

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,240
Screw around with it a little bit. You can figure it out man

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,440
I bang my head against the desk for weeks trying to figure out Lightworks and I never did figure it out

50
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
and what I ended up doing was they have a

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,080
fantastic set of tutorials on

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,760
YouTube and you can go through and they teach you how to do all the stuff and like you said once you kind of get

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,720
Into their mindset and I almost and tell me if you agree with this. I almost treat Lightworks like an operating system

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,780
It feels very immersive because it just kind of takes over the entire machine and then you do all of the stuff

55
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,060
Inside of Lightworks itself, so you don't ever really leave the program

56
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,500
And if it turns your editing machine into like an appliance, right?

57
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,460
And if you do a monitor sport because your monitors are a mess

58
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,900
You need especially if you need research on the other side other monitor or doing other things like checking Twitter's and whatnot

59
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,220
You know, yeah

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,620
Yeah

61
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,460
But the one thing that I think that Lightworks has a leg up on pretty much every other video editor

62
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,580
I've ever used is the fact that when you do that

63
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,780
When you treat it like an operating system like it takes over all your monitors

64
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,180
The like the preview screen you can make it as big or as small as you want

65
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,060
You can place it anywhere on the quote-unquote workspace that you want

66
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,700
and

67
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,260
Mind you I haven't used some of the latter versions of Premiere some of the latter versions of Final Cut

68
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
So perhaps these features do exist now

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,420
But when I was previously when I was using them

70
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,300
It seemed like there was like kind of a stock layout how they wanted you to to kind of do things and where the toolbars

71
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,480
Were located and and that was kind of static. There was no real way to change that and with Lightworks

72
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,240
Everything is dynamic. Everything can be moved to wherever you best think it should be. Oh

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,800
Yeah, and did you know this shark actually eats some of the windows? I actually hate that

74
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,840
I didn't it was funny like I actually wrote into the form and I'm like

75
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,960
Is there a way to get rid of that shark and they go that's part of the sex appeal of Lightworks as we leave the shark

76
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,480
There and I'm like, right, but it literally destroys the corner of my screen and I can't get rid of it

77
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,960
And then it's like over all my windows and they're like, yeah, that's kind of the fun

78
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,880
But you can you can drag it up and then it like sinks back down. I'm like, right?

79
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,880
well, yeah, you can you can actually go over windows and it'll the shark will eat it Wow and then when you left-click the

80
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Shark all your all your eating windows will pop back up. So we got a lot of things going on on the screen

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,160
So there is shark it almost some functionality there. Yeah, there's a function in there. Yeah, it's called shark. Okay. All right

82
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll give them that then

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,600
Yeah, I I don't know. I just don't wish there was a way to turn it off. I can't say I'm a fan. I I

84
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,880
I the there there are there are I just saw actually actually for anyone that's interested

85
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
They're actually running a sale today. I

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,960
Just got I just got an email from the University

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
50% off Lightworks Pro

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,680
for for the for the editor so you can get access to all of the

89
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,080
Kodaks and the way that Lightworks structures or licensing is actually pretty cool

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,120
You can pay a one-time fee a large fee like you would for Adobe Premiere or Final Cut and then you buy that version of

91
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Lightworks and it's yours forever

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,320
And so you download it and then you install it and then you're stuck on that version now the way that I do it is

93
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,560
I pay something like 89 bucks a year and I get the latest version as soon as it comes out

94
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,240
For you know indefinitely, but the trade-off is I'm paying a recurring fee and at first I was a little against that actually

95
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,360
I thought to myself. I don't like I feel like I'm just renting software

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,040
I don't feel like I actually own the software and it kind of bothers me and then a buddy of mine said

97
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Let me ask you something. How much did you pay for at the time?

98
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,360
I think it was it was Final Cut that I was using and I said it was a couple, you know

99
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,720
High hundreds of dollars if I remember right at least back in the day. Yeah. Yeah seven

100
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,720
I think was the last one I bought it. I want to say Chris. Does this sound right seven or eight hundred bucks?

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,040
Hey, well, if you bought it at its peak Final Cut seven might have even been you got the full Final Cut suite

102
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,840
It could have been twelve hundred dollars. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was it was it was Final Cut and then it was motion

103
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,320
And then that's the twelve hundred dollar one. Yeah. Yeah, I think I got a bit of a discount cuz I remember

104
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,440
I think it was under a gram, but I remember being a significant amount of money and

105
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,160
When I and then then I was talking to him about and he goes how long did you use it?

106
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,080
I said, oh, you know three four years and he goes great

107
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,200
So it'd be half the cost man to just pay the 89 bucks a year

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,720
And if you you're never gonna keep the software for ten years, and I thought about it

109
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm like, yeah, he's right. When would I use one version of software for ten years? I would that would never happen

110
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,400
That's true. Yeah, and you know so for some reason though that same logic doesn't come for me about Adobe Creative Cloud because we have

111
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,720
Adobe Creative Cloud because we have JB has a subscription to Creative Cloud for a couple of machines

112
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,740
none of the machines that I use well not frequently but

113
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,820
The it that burns me that for some reason paying for Creative Cloud burns me. I don't know why

114
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,760
If maybe maybe it's because it's it probably mainly actually I actually probably would have zero issue

115
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,600
Paying for it if they made Creative Cloud work on Linux then I yeah

116
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,160
Yeah, then I could do it and maybe if it was a little less irritating with constantly reminding you

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,080
Yeah, thank you. Yes that too. I think as free software people I think is open-source people

118
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,760
I think as Linux people I think that I think what it is is I think we have it ingrained in our head

119
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,200
That subscription leans leads to us getting burned because I have been burned so many times by a company who?

120
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Existed and then the company goes away and so I can't renew my subscription or reactivate the software and let's take for example

121
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,940
Lightworks, let's just say here's here's what is a very realistic prospect

122
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,260
Seven years from now

123
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,540
Maybe edit share goes out of business and then my subscription thing goes down the tubes because I never bought it outright and so I

124
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,100
No longer have access to Lightworks. All I can do is start it up and I get to a login screen

125
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,340
I have all of my projects for the past ten years that right now I can open them back up and make any edits

126
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
I want change anything. I want

127
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:08,060
Re export them if if tomorrow a different Kodak comes out and everyone wants it in a different format and now Lightworks supports that I

128
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,780
Could open that project file up with my raw video and export back out into this new format. I could do all of that

129
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:22,540
Until I no longer have access to the software and then all of that that the all those options go away and essentially I have

130
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,580
been archiving all those project files for years for nothing and I think that as

131
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,980
As people that have been burned by that in the past

132
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,020
I think that people like you and I Chris I think we're and West I think that we are aware of that

133
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,540
And I think that I and I think that so then when it comes down to it

134
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,220
Even if we can't always put our finger on it

135
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,580
And even if it doesn't make sense on paper paying twelve hundred dollars as a one-time fee versus 89 bucks a year

136
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,260
I think it just makes it in our in our ethos and in and deep inside of us

137
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,820
I think we know that there is an inherent danger. There's inherent risk associated with that and so we shy away from it

138
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,340
I think anytime you've been around even for a few years

139
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,700
You realize that a lot of times commercial companies are more dictated by the whims of the market

140
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,740
Then they will try to present even companies like Adobe and other really big companies

141
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,700
They are very much driven by the next new shiny the next new thing that's going to generate profit and they're not

142
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:19,620
You know that doesn't and I'm not I'm not making a comment if that's bad or good because in some ways

143
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,860
That's what pushes things forward

144
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,940
But in another way it it also means abandoning previous ways of doing things and one of the things

145
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,840
I this is just me being you know

146
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,180
Maybe I've been looking at the hills of Montana for too long

147
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:37,500
but I really kind of look back at some of the stuff that we create in these proprietary formats these proprietary containers and

148
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,620
And I think this is stuff that is gonna be generationally lost

149
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,460
It's a generation is generational problem

150
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,260
It is an entire generation of people that are going to lose access to the content that they have created be it

151
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,540
Videos or photos or music?

152
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,140
I mean anything that's stored in a garage band file anything that's stored in a logic file

153
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,460
That's probably not gonna open in a hundred years and maybe maybe your crappy music doesn't need to open up in a hundred years

154
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:09,280
But wouldn't it be neat if a hundred years from now a family member or a historian or somebody could access a perfect digital

155
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:15,740
pristine copy of what you created a hundred years ago and be able to listen to it or watch it and the only thing preventing

156
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:22,040
Them from be able to do that is some proprietary codec or some a proprietary format or some lockdown application

157
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,740
And when you think about in that context, it's it's a real shame

158
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,220
It's a real shame actually if you think about it, too

159
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,100
Let you look at like when when my when my grandfather passed away him and I were very close

160
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,900
And so I was I was really interested in learning about his life before

161
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,020
Before me before I knew him as grandpa. I wanted to know, you know what the rest of his life was like and

162
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,620
We found pictures and documents and all this stuff that he had from back when he was in the military when he was 18 19

163
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,940
Years old and I found that I found that two days before he graduated high school

164
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,780
Was what I found his enlistment application and it was dated two days before

165
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,780
He he graduated high school and it was just interesting to look and see that was you know

166
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,540
That was him as he was an Air Force guy

167
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,740
I'm like, wow, I can't imagine like before I even get out of high school saying this is what I'm gonna commit the next

168
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,820
You know for sure at least eight years of my life

169
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,900
but then 30 years and the only reason I was able to go back and have that connection with him was because I found these

170
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,380
documents and I found the pictures and stuff like that and

171
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:25,820
Like you're talking about in in in 50 my grandkids. I don't have I haven't taken pictures of my kids that we print out

172
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,100
They're on Facebook and they're on Twitter. There's I have tons of them on a hard drive as I do video, right?

173
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,520
Yeah, who knows what is JPEG gonna open in a hundred years? I don't know. I mean, I hope so. I think so

174
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,460
So yeah, I think that I so I I think that there is I think there's a real concern of that

175
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,460
I think we have to be careful

176
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:49,540
This is Linux unplugged episode 111 for September 22nd 2015

177
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,640
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly tech

178
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,820
Talk show that's being brought to you from well

179
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,140
It kind of depends upon the hour and the current geographical location of JB rover

180
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,340
My name is Noah and joining me is

181
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,260
Wes

182
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,660
Hey, it's Wes guys. Wes is

183
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,140
joining me in

184
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:26,300
Seattle in the studio and then I'm actually in Grand Forks hosting the show and then Chris

185
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,900
The hair master Chris is actually in JB rover right now in the middle of Montana

186
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,500
Hello guys. Hi, how is Montana?

187
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,660
Well, I found a spot that has connectivity and it's actually quite pleasant here

188
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,340
And it's it there's time differences and all these kinds of things. It's a lot of fun

189
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,220
I get to struggle with time math. I get to find cellular connectivity and I get to be part of the virtual log

190
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,780
I'm pretty excited. That sounds amazing. And I heard that you found a I first heard that you found a straggler

191
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,860
That's right

192
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,860
Actually to be totally correct. He found me. Hey Anthony. Hey, what's going on? Not much

193
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,580
so Anthony I was tracking us over Jupiter broadcasting comm slash rover and

194
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,980
He saw us parked here. We're in a gravel lot. We were driving around literally Noah

195
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:15,500
We were driving around trying to find the best signal possible. We found like stop the vehicle stop the vehicle

196
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,820
We pulled over right here

197
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,540
Anthony was watching us in real time on the rover because he knew we were getting the best chicken in town

198
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,140
Oh, yeah, and then

199
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,540
That he when we got parked I started set up he came knocking on the door

200
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:25,740
No

201
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,420
I swear I started to almost panic because I thought it was the cops telling me to get the heck out of here

202
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:36,900
Well, you had you had that particular spot you would stopped because of a very specific technical reason, right?

203
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,300
It wasn't just like you were like, wow, this seems like a good place to park

204
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,380
That's true. Well, I had to get good signal. I had to have good connection. I had that. Hello music. Hi there

205
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,820
Go go go go. Yeah

206
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,660
I wanted to make sure that we were able to get a good spot solid spot

207
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,620
so that way we could get the prep the show prep necessary done and like there was like

208
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,740
Different sections of the city that would have no cellular coverage at all. Like that's a thing around here. Oh, yeah

209
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,340
Oh, yeah, it's just part of the challenge is part of the fun. Yeah, wait life is up here

210
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,180
You know you go one block you have no signal, right?

211
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,980
So we found this spot here we set up and now the only downside is we don't have any shore power here

212
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,440
So everything we're doing right now is completely running off of DC battery

213
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,860
So hopefully we'll last we got we got the my five plugged in to the DC outlet

214
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,140
We're running both laptops off of battery power and the mixer itself is as you know

215
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,580
Noah is able to run off of 9-volt batteries

216
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,700
So we're running the mixer off of batteries right now, too. Oh good. You had to change them though. I heard

217
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,620
Just when we were about to start the show

218
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,780
Literally right like everything's all dialed in Noah and it's like all these different challenges because I didn't I didn't quite plan to have two

219
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,540
People in the rover, but Anthony was totally prepared brought his own microphone. It's a gold mic too. Yeah. Yeah, it's a gold mic

220
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,620
That's awesome. But we didn't so we got everything wired and I'm like look at us

221
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,100
We managed to get two people set up right on and then all of a sudden no audio

222
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,540
Zoom and we're like what what's going on?

223
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,180
What is but it was it was enough power to still show power light on the mixer

224
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,140
But not enough power to send phantom power to the microphones

225
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,580
So the mics themselves were dead, but the mixer had enough power

226
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,700
So thankfully you included a nice box of 9-volt battery

227
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,740
So I just plugged another three in and we're good to go. Oh good the you know

228
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,500
It's funny is when I bought that mixer the guy specifically told me he's like it will run forever

229
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,700
without a battery change and being as you've been on the road for going on 72 hours and

230
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,660
You've done attempted one show and this is the first one. We're going all the way through. I'm gonna guess that's not the case

231
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,780
Unless you left it on the whole time. No, I did not leave it on. I didn't think so

232
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,780
Do you have to think though? It's if you think about it, so there are three nine volt batteries that are in there, right?

233
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,860
So yes three nine volts. So math tells us that's nine eighteen

234
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,140
Nineteen twenty four. Is that right?

235
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,180
Yes. Okay, so

236
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,780
48 volts is what's required for the phantom power

237
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:59,140
And so I guess that would kind of make sense that they would essentially what they're doing is they're getting half of the voltage and then

238
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,620
Probably doubling it to power the phantom power

239
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,280
But that's a lot that's twice the amount of voltage draw on on on each of those batteries

240
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,060
So it would make some I guess that 27. Yeah. Yeah, Matt and now we're also we're powering two microphones now

241
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,340
Yeah, well there are do you have dynamic mics or condenser mics?

242
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,780
There there one. What is your mic? I have the re20. What's yours? Yeah, it's a condenser mic

243
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,740
Yeah, it is condensers. You know what? I don't know. It was a cheap one on Amazon. I did it for game

244
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,320
I use phantom for the re20 because it powers the amp is powered by phantom

245
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,580
Huh?

246
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,580
So anyways, but you know

247
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:41,940
The the thing that's actually a little more interesting about about the rover is I'm actually I'm finding some challenges some challenges with DC

248
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,900
Power that I didn't expect so I'm not I'm hitting some speed bumps there

249
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,840
But other than that, we're all good and you have you have your you brought the the XPS 13 with you, right?

250
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Yes, sir. Now, is that running enter goes?

251
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,340
Yes, sir. All right. So I saw that we are talking about enter goes today and

252
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,700
That is we are going to talk about supporting enter goes now

253
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,820
Here's the thing the first time I ever did arch

254
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,460
When you got when back when you and Matt actually did the Linux action show and talked about how we should switch to arch

255
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,960
I was game. I thought I'll give it a shot

256
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,740
I don't really think I'm gonna stick with it, but we'll see what it's like now

257
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,860
I'm too lazy to read the wiki which is what everyone which is what a good arch user should do and in fact

258
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,220
Oh, yeah, exactly. You can see where this is going, right?

259
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,460
So what I did was I did what I call the way of the future

260
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,140
Which is when your dishwasher breaks, you don't break out the manual anymore when your refrigerator breaks

261
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,660
You don't break out the manual. What do you do? You go to YouTube and type in the problem and see if somebody walks you

262
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,380
Through so that's what I did

263
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,060
By the way

264
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,560
That's also what you do when you can't remember if you put the sway bars on your hitch

265
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
When it's up a little bit or down all the way

266
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,660
It up if I remember right? Yeah, it works much better. You can get it. You can get a few more links in the chain

267
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,400
So I went to YouTube and I looked how to install arch and there was this guy

268
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,700
He pronounced a bunch of words wrong despite making claims that he was pronouncing them

269
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,620
Correct, and then and then went through it and and and went through the installation at March

270
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,740
And after I got done, I was like I could do that

271
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,100
It'll take me about an hour

272
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,300
but I could do that so I grab a spare computer and I installed arch and when I got done I was happy I

273
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,540
Was most I was 90% happy with the experience and I was 90% happy with the result

274
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,900
But my problem was I was afraid to go back and change anything

275
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,700
I was afraid to blow it away and do it all over again because there was no way I was gonna be able to reload

276
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,980
My laptop, you know in the 20 minutes that I've become accustomed to and so anytime I would travel

277
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,020
I would never take my laptop with me because I thought if anything ever happens

278
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:38,540
I have to have an internet connection and I have to have like an hour of time and not to mention my guide

279
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,060
Which I was keeping on an Evernote so I'd have it on my on my phone

280
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,260
So I'd have all the steps written down because I remember them

281
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,540
So it was just kind of problematic and I thought so it's a great operating system and I really like arch

282
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,800
But I don't think I could ever seriously commit to it because of some of those problems and answer goes

283
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,100
completely solve that for me and it did that in that I

284
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,060
Could now treat the Linux installation the at the arch Linux installation

285
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,620
I could have an arch Linux installation

286
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:11,500
but I could treat it just like every other distro in that I had a USB installer and I stuck it in and I just

287
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,420
clicked next and I waited for the bar to go from left to right made a couple couple of choices along the way and

288
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,220
I had a working Linux distro. Yeah, it's not even I mean you could stop right there

289
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,900
I mean, it's not even the fact that it's arch right this fact that it's just a nice setup usable distro with a good-looking theme

290
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,180
by default and you know, one of the things they're doing now to make arch more approachable is

291
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:38,020
They are giving you options at installation to do things like enable the long-term support kernel instead of the instead of the kernel gets updated

292
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,980
All the time use the LTS kernel. Do you want to have Samba work out of the box? Check a box

293
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:49,580
You want an arch user repository tool check a box you want Samba printer support check a box what LibreOffice check a box and all

294
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:56,260
Yeah, or simple a simple firewall check a box, right and these things all are just one check now

295
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,540
And they make for a very good distro

296
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,820
It doesn't matter if it's arch fedora or Ubuntu

297
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,180
You'd want that on anything and the fact that antergos is making this as part of their installation

298
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,660
It in my opinion takes and it takes arch not just approachable

299
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,780
But when you start talking LTS kernels and things like that

300
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,660
I think it opens up to a whole other realm of use cases and the fact that they're just building that right in there is

301
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,580
smart smart smart

302
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,220
So and well, I'm gonna get your take and I definitely want to get West's take on this too

303
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,940
But a lot of times I feel like when I'm trying a Linux distro out

304
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,980
Essentially what I'm really doing is evaluating the desktop

305
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,780
Having used fedora for so long and so having used gnome 3 for so long

306
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,020
it's not uncommon for me to sit down at my arch box and type yum and

307
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Because of that and that's just because I'm so used to when I see gnome

308
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,700
I just have fedora pictured that's running in the background

309
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,540
And the reality is thus the differences between arch and fedora at least from a usability standpoint once it's set up

310
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:56,100
It's not much right if I'm primarily interacting with gnome now where antergo sets itself apart

311
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,180
And why I think it's it's a it's a really solid good operating system. In fact in some ways a lot better than fedora is

312
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,420
Well, really it begins and ends with the AUR

313
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,740
Right when I want to try software if I want to try a new piece of software

314
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,700
Especially if we're testing something for the show, I don't grab the Ubuntu box

315
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,380
I certainly don't sit down in my fedora box

316
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:21,500
I grab my arch laptop and or my antergos laptop and that's because with a single command I can go out and grab

317
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:28,420
How however the package is packaged whether it's available with source code or whether it's available in a deb or available in RPM

318
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:34,780
somebody has taken that and putting that into the arch AUR and then I can pull that down onto my laptop and

319
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:41,980
To me that is such a huge time-saver that feature alone almost trumps everything else

320
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,680
Every other advantage that every other distro could offer it is nice

321
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,340
It's nice to be able to just like install software on the fly while I'm on air

322
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,860
Like a lot of times when you and I are talking about an app on the show

323
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,040
If it's not if you if you convinced me to try it

324
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,580
I'll just install it right there on the show and try it. So I know Wes

325
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm gonna jump to you for a second. But Anthony, what are you using for Linux? What's your main distro?

326
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,220
My main distro is arch. Oh really and Wes your main distros arch too, right?

327
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,220
Sure is has been for three years or so. Jeez. Listen to us. Oh my gosh. Well, it's funny. It's later in the show today

328
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,700
I might confess my love for fedora. I don't know. You know, there's a couple of things

329
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:24,340
I note where I'm offline and having to update a rolling distro on over a cellular connection is getting old

330
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,960
Super fast, so I don't know. I don't want to say we're all a bunch of arch bitch bigots

331
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
But it is now no and to be fair though. No, it's not your daily driver, right?

332
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,960
well

333
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,280
I'm not exactly sure how to answer that because I

334
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,960
For the purpose of not getting made fun of by all of my Jupiter broadcasting supportive teammates who constantly make fun of my fedora laptop

335
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,840
I installed on my ThinkPad

336
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,760
I have arch and so everything I do for Jupiter broadcasting all the show prep all of that stuff is being done on my ThinkPad and

337
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,440
Then somewhere along halfway through the year. I decided it was too inconvenient to do all the speed stuff on my Dell and

338
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,500
Jupiter broadcasting stuff on my ThinkPad

339
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,240
but at that point all of my stuff and all of my programs and everything was kind of set up on my ThinkPad so I

340
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,980
just kind of

341
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,980
unintentionally, I guess switch to it full-time and

342
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,920
so

343
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,700
My main laptop is running arch and that is the laptop that sits in front of my face

344
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:25,260
80% of the day. I have an Ubuntu box. That's that's downstairs at home, and I don't have any particular

345
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,140
I don't have any particular native love for Ubuntu if it was my choice

346
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,460
I'd probably be using fedora, but because Ubuntu is such a successful operating system

347
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,580
It's the one that I point other people to and therefore it becomes it becomes

348
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,860
Extremely important for me to know how to solve the problems on Ubuntu

349
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,620
So I forced myself to use it

350
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,420
So if I'm at home and I'm sitting at my desk

351
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,620
I'm using Ubuntu and I I kind of feel like I have forced myself to do that

352
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,280
It's not so much of a choice. I'm interested though. What got what got you started on on arch west?

353
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,180
you know I was in a bunch of user for a long time before that and

354
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,920
I kind of just wanted to dig in more get into I ran into a couple configuration problems after the initial unity switch

355
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,580
obviously things are a lot more polished now, but that had me digging around in configuration files and

356
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,860
And some forums I'd you know I heard some people using arch and they talked it up a lot

357
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,660
And I was like well is this really that cool and so far. I've been really happy with it

358
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:25,200
I think what you touched on with the AUR speaks kind of the way arch is built in general with the arch build system

359
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,280
You know you can download the package build for any of the repo files if you want you can modify them

360
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,380
It makes it really easy to add your own files as well

361
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,620
If you just want to make you know turn something that you can only get in a tar GZ

362
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,780
You can make that into a into a regular install

363
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:43,960
Yeah, speaking of software that speaking of software or solutions that you can get on the fly

364
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
over at reddit.com

365
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,700
Slash our slash Linux action show people submit projects that they think we'd be interested in or software

366
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,540
They think we might be interested in and Chris has been talking about how he's trying to move his life

367
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:03,060
from being connected online to being connected to seeming like he's connected online while simultaneously being offline and

368
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,740
One of the ways that he is going to do that or one of the things that he needs to accomplish that is he

369
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:15,980
Needs to minimize the amount of traffic that he's sending and so French AP 41 was kind enough to submit when proxy

370
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,340
to the subreddit and

371
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:26,220
Essentially what went when proxy is is a free portable TCP proxy which makes TCP connections send less data which improves TCP performance

372
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,260
and the throughput over lossy links now if you're sitting on a

373
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,820
Mobile hotspot and I don't care who is providing the mobile hotspot

374
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,580
Connection can be up and down particularly if you don't know within

375
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,340
500 miles where exactly you're gonna be then things really get interesting

376
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:50,380
And so the ability to limit the amount of traffic that you're sending back and forth becomes really really important

377
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,700
I'm interested Chris. Have you set this up and have you tried it? And if so, how is it working?

378
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,260
You know the other thing, you know, I haven't set it up yet

379
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,260
I just saw this today because he's he's submitted it six hours ago

380
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,340
But the other thing I thought about know is you nailed it right on the over the over the my fight connection anything you can

381
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,340
Do to reduce traffic is killer

382
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:14,020
But the thing that that struck me is it might also work really well when driving down the road just because it might help

383
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,100
Smooth out that spotting is that you have as you're just driving down the road and there's different, you know

384
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Different you're moving between towers and things like that

385
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,140
And I he likes he warns us to he says don't be fooled or repelled

386
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,180
By its Spartan web page rent when proxy helps by compressing and duplicating data

387
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,460
So it makes things magically faster when you have slow links

388
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,080
He says that seems like that'd be super important if you're sitting in you know, you know trailer

389
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,160
I can't think of I was trying to think as I was reading over the show notes if there was a place that I could

390
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,280
Implement this honestly, you know Grand Forks back in 1997

391
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,420
We had a really bad flood like a super bad flood. And in fact when you come here Chris, I will show you

392
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,540
There's a landmark. It actually looks kind of like a giant penis but

393
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,840
Around the shaft of the statue is a ring and that shows how high the water was back in

394
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,360
1997 and it was it I mean people's houses were literally underwater when we got back into Grand Forks

395
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,980
There were like cars on the roof of garages and stuff like that Wow

396
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,460
Yeah, it was crazy

397
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,500
But here's the good thing that came out of it when they went through to redo the streets and essentially rebuild the city

398
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,260
Somebody somewhere had the brilliant idea of let's bury fiber everywhere in Grand Forks. I'm moving there. Yes. Yeah

399
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,700
Yeah, so we have fiber right up almost right up to our doorstep

400
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,160
There is a multiplexer that's out in the that is at this at the box out in the yard that and then they run copper

401
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
into the house, which I think is silly but

402
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,400
The that I have there is no place in in the city or any of the customers that I support where it would ever be

403
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,940
Where it ever be beneficial to me to limit my TCP traffic

404
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,700
So I can't say that this is something that I'm going to try

405
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,220
Simply because I wouldn't know how to really evaluate it

406
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
I wouldn't know if it was doing a good job or a bad job

407
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,700
But I think it would be super important if you were in a rover

408
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:04,740
the other thing that I think that is really helpful to minimize traffic is if you can get your

409
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,980
Certain parts of

410
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:14,780
Data that you want to send over the internet not coming from your hotspot and my understanding is that the rover live tracker

411
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,940
That isn't using

412
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,460
Your cell phone or a hotspot or anything thing like that?

413
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,380
It's actually updating Jupiter broadcasting comm slash rover that it's updating that live on its own, right?

414
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,380
Yeah, they it's using silver cloud and silver cloud has some

415
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
fee associated with it, but

416
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,260
In in all practical purposes, it's just using GPRS, which is like, you know old slow

417
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,620
Lots of coverage but not at all in Montana, right? Yeah, not in all Montana

418
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
Well, in fact, where was the dead spot you were noticing?

419
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,620
I'm just when I was watching you come across the border you disappeared until st. Regis. See that's a bummer

420
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,580
But yeah, it's but the nice thing about it is it's a self-contained unit. It has GPS in there

421
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,540
It gets our elevation in there. It does all of that on its own and it uses its own cellular connectivity

422
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,540
So I don't have to worry about any data usage

423
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,620
Now the cool thing about that is if if you were better at math than I am

424
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,780
You could actually figure out based on how far you're going from one place to the other what your speed is

425
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:17,780
And then you could do some more math and you could figure out even if the even if the device isn't updating you if it

426
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,400
Drops off the map for a little bit. You could figure out about where you are, but people can follow you all the way

427
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,180
From Seattle all the way to Grand Forks and when you get to Grand Forks

428
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,580
We're gonna have a meetup and we're gonna have there's gonna be a big party in Grand Forks. That's what's gonna happen

429
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,820
Yeah, we're gonna have a meetup. We are and and the thing is some people might be thinking

430
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:41,180
You know, I've gotten all sorts. You would not believe the questions. I've gotten Chris people are asking me things like

431
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:46,900
You guys have electricity up there. Do you guys it's amazing. You have internet there. How do you have running?

432
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,020
I mean like people there's a guy asked me about an outhouse like really no, we have plumbing. Come on

433
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:56,460
This I mean, it's not a third world country. It's we live in the United States. I mean, it's it's a city

434
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,260
It's just like Arlington. It just you know a little colder and a little further away and there's not much around

435
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,860
There's some cows and it's really flat, but it's a city

436
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,660
And so you're gonna find out exactly

437
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,580
What a party is when?

438
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,600
When Chris gets here to Grand Forks, I think tentatively it's scheduled for Sunday

439
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,620
The Sunday that Chris is gonna be here which this this coming Sunday at 7 o'clock p.m. Now that time is a little bit flexible

440
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
obviously

441
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,540
I didn't talk to Chris about it

442
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,620
Albert just asked me if if this would work and I'm like, yeah, sure when we can change it

443
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,020
so if if there are some people because I imagine it's gonna be a

444
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,320
Slightly smaller group than in some of the other larger cities if there's anyone out there that

445
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,820
Wants to come to the meetup and and Sunday is a bad day or Sunday at 7 is a bad time

446
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,920
Just get a hold of us go over to there's a form. There's no well, there's a forum thread there, too

447
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,260
So you think you can use the contact page, but there's also the forum thread at meetup, which Albert's monitoring

448
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,620
That's not that time should work for us and I think we're planning to do last Friday still so that she yeah

449
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,020
Yeah time, but yeah that the other thing too

450
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,660
By the way, I'll just mention is if there's other people along our route that want to meet up

451
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,580
You can use that forum there Albert's watch watching that. In fact, why don't we can we pull Odyssey down here?

452
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,260
I don't know if we can or not. But yeah, hello. Hello, mr. Westress. So

453
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,960
Did you want to mention anything about the meetup page?

454
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,420
I was just gonna say the meetup form you're monitoring that if people along the way want to meet up or if people need to make

455
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Modifications that's a good way to get a hold of you, right?

456
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:23,300
In fact meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting. He just opened up the Grand Forks meetup page right now

457
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,420
So if anybody is gonna be in that area and would like to meet up with us

458
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,060
I go to meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting. We have two RSVP right now not enough

459
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,940
Not enough mana and those that link will be in the show notes, too. So if

460
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,400
Somehow that's not if meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting isn't easy enough to remember

461
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,180
Denny Milligan shown it. So one of the things is

462
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,380
Chris and I have been working back and forth on

463
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,580
Getting a mobile studio and and getting this, you know

464
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:56,040
The tracking thing set up and there there's all these different moving parts that make it possible for him to do shows from the road

465
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:02,140
but I think that I think one of the biggest things that he was worried about definitely the biggest thing I was worried about is

466
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
mobile connectivity and

467
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:11,720
The if you're looking for good mobile connectivity you want to look at something like ting if you go over to last dot tinged

468
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,460
I'm sorry is

469
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,660
We're at Linux dot ting.com, right? That's the that's the link for this show

470
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:22,380
We get Linux dot ting.com, which if you think about it is way better than last dot ting.com branding standpoint

471
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,380
It's like the coolest URL ever

472
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:30,180
But Linux dot ting.com you go over there and you can pick from a variety of devices now

473
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,420
I have had ting actually the first week that Chris ever

474
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,300
Announced that that ting was a supporter of the show. I was in bed

475
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
It was like 3 in the morning and I was I was watching

476
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:46,840
Linux action show on my laptop and he started talking about ting and as soon as I heard the ad read

477
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,580
I'm like, oh wow that that sounds like something I should be interested in so I

478
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,620
I get up and I go over to my desktop where I had all of my I have all my bills and I'm doing the

479
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:00,700
Little calculator and my wife looks up and she goes what on God's green earth are you doing at 3 in the morning?

480
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,420
And I'm like, I'm signing up for a new cell phone service. This is amazing

481
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,780
And so I sign up and I get there their cheap little phone

482
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,220
which is only like I think it was 40 40 50 bucks at the time and they still have cheaper phones like that and

483
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:18,020
But a couple weeks later I had gone to a Linux convention Linux fest Northwest and we were in

484
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,020
We were in

485
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,500
Bellingham and

486
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,340
Myself my regular cell phone died. And so all I was left with was my ting phone

487
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:34,140
And so ting kind of saved the day that day and ever since then I then then I switched to an actual smartphone and

488
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:41,260
Then I started buying more and more phones to add them onto the ting network. So I have my dad

489
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,820
I have my mother. I've got my sister. I've got my wife. I've even got a good friend of mine

490
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:51,180
That's that's all I'm on my my aunt is all of my ting account. And the reason is because it's so cost-effective

491
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,420
it's gonna be

492
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,180
my bill ranges from like $18 to

493
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,900
I'd say 35 40 at the absolute at the at the absolute most

494
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,380
Of course, I haven't looked as I've added as I keep adding people on that that number sure to climb a little bit

495
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,180
But the nice thing is you only pay for what you use

496
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,300
So if you're the kind of person that doesn't make any phone calls like my sister doesn't she texts and she used the Internet?

497
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,380
But she never actually makes any calls. She's not gonna pay for minutes

498
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:25,140
On the other hand if you're the kind of person that is really really really good at making at finding alternative ways to make calls

499
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,980
So for example, I use my phone on Wi-Fi all the time

500
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:34,800
So all of my calls are going over data because I'm using sip except it's that's actually being transmitted over Wi-Fi

501
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,660
So I'm not using minutes and I'm not using data and all of my text messages are being sent over Google Hangouts

502
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,240
So that's not using any data and ting is completely cool with that

503
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,040
So go over to go over to linux.ting.com and pick something out

504
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,300
You're gonna be really happy that you did Chris has I think you have you know, what you have three ting devices in your in your RV

505
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,320
To maybe he's got a hotspot and he's got a and he's got a phone

506
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,080
At least and probably a couple more

507
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,600
So the first story we want to talk about and I'm really interested to see what the mumble room thinks of this

508
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,280
we have

509
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,520
It as as some of you know Chris is coming here to look at my automated house

510
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,220
I have automated my house. And in fact, my automated house is actually just one on the market today

511
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,520
but there was a story about a gentleman who

512
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,680
Pioneered a smart home and then his smart home actually ended up with the denial of service. Oh, I love this story

513
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:38,700
Yeah, have you seen this the challenge of the futurist pioneer is being patent zero for a future day headaches in 2009 Paul Rouse

514
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,040
a computer science professor from the Free University of Berlin

515
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,900
Built Germany's first smart home

516
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,820
Everything in the home was connected to the internet so that the lights television heating and cooling could all be turned on and off from

517
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,220
Afar even the stove oven and microwave could be turned off in Rojas computer

518
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,940
Which prevented some potential panic attacks about leaving the appliances on after he exited the house. This sounds like you know

519
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,460
This sounds like you very much. So in fact, I have such a you know me

520
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,100
I have such an absent-minded memory that things like this

521
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,460
become huge to me the ability to walk into my house and go did I remember to turn that on or did I remember to

522
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,900
Turn that up and then you add to that my incessant laziness of doing repetitive tasks that I think are a waste of time

523
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,420
So for example when I walk into a room

524
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,780
I think the light should just come on because we have these things called motion sensors and it should know that I'm in the room

525
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,460
And if I'm in the room

526
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,900
I want light and I just I find the the concept that I should have to walk over to a specific area of the room

527
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,740
And hit the wall randomly numerous times until I find some sort of tactile device that I can then

528
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,420
Flip up to make the room illuminate and then the room illuminates at a hundred percent brightness

529
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,460
Which I think is total overkill it just it just seems antiquated and ridiculous to me

530
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,780
So yes, this is very me

531
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,140
But one of the last things that were connected to his house were the locks now

532
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:56,980
I do have my locks automated automated locks Rojas bought in 2009. We're still sitting in a drawer waiting to be installed

533
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,420
I was afraid of not being able to open the doors Rojas said in a phone interview

534
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:06,460
Now about two years ago Rojas Rojas house froze up and stopped responding to his commands. Nothing worked

535
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,780
I couldn't turn the lights on or off it got stuck

536
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,260
He says it was like a beach ball of death begins spinning on my computer, except it was my entire home

537
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,700
Now this is my wife's worst nightmare right now. So she's listening. I'm gonna get killed when I get home

538
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,340
Because this is what she's worried about

539
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,580
It wasn't quite it wasn't quite as bad as a nightmare on the connected home Street dream dreamt up by wired last year

540
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
But it was a fictional smart home's obsolete

541
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,320
Technology gets loaded with viruses and malware and starts misbehaving and uploading naked photos of its owner

542
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,300
Rojas a professor who specializes in artificial intelligence knows his way around the network well enough to cure his own home

543
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,580
And when he investigated it turned out that the culprit was a single connected light bulb

544
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:53,160
I connected my laptop to the network and looked at the traffic and saw that one unit was sending packets continuously said Rojas

545
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,980
He realized that the light fixture had been burnt out and was trying to tell the hub that it needed its attention

546
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:04,540
To do so it started sending continuous requests that had overloaded the networking and caused it to freeze

547
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,300
It was a continual denial of service attack. He says

548
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,760
the light was performing a

549
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,700
DDoS attack or a dos attack on my smart home to say change me Rojas change the light bulb and the problem was fixed

550
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,740
So a couple things come to mind first of all

551
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,860
I think that when people automate their house their houses

552
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:30,420
You have to be first of all aware that you are taking technology and you are putting fundamental

553
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
aspects of your life on

554
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:39,460
The line and so when you your ability to get up and shower in the morning your ability to turn

555
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,880
To turn on to turn at the television to watch things all of that

556
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,020
Is it becomes reliant on your computer system?

557
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:56,260
And if there's anything we know about computer systems working on computer systems, is that can we can we just stop right here?

558
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
Because this is exactly

559
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:05,700
Exactly my big hesitation even as a fan of technology and and and as somebody who wants to implement some of these things

560
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,660
I start to think to myself, you know, like for example, I mean I hate to be this guy right now

561
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,820
But here in in the JB rover, you know what I like

562
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,260
I like that every single light has its own individual power switch

563
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,100
I like that my water in my shower has a manual cutoff switch that I can hit

564
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:28,940
I like that every single thing has its own individual control point and they're all manually operated

565
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,260
You know what else I like for some reason I can't tell you why but for some reason I like the ability to turn

566
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,780
My water heater on and off with the flip of a switch in my kitchen or my water pump

567
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,220
Like I like knowing that my fridge can be turned on and off like with these switches here

568
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,700
like I like having manual control over all of this and then here's the other thing Noah is I like to be able to

569
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:54,860
visually look at the position of that physical switch and I like to know by physically confirming the way it looks what the state of

570
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,340
That object is and all of that's also taken away from you when all of this stuff is automated

571
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:07,460
So I'm not actually I'm not able to quantify with the advantage of the totally automated home is other than I can do crap

572
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,660
To it remotely, but that seems like a total

573
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,140
total

574
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,440
You know niche niche use case

575
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,120
So I'm hoping to change your mind on that and I think I'll be I think I'm on relatively solid ground to do that

576
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,640
Very very few things in my house are connected to the internet at the very most

577
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,920
They're connected to the LAN and some of them aren't even connected to that a lot of the system

578
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,120
I'd say the majority of the systems are tied together with

579
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,120
something known as normally closed normally open and basically the idea is you have a series of contacts a series of

580
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,560
screws and

581
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,480
dip and either a set of contacts are closed meaning there is a piece of metal that is going between them and

582
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,280
Electricity can flow or the contacts are open meaning there is no piece of electricity and and and electricity cannot flow

583
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,680
I'll give you an example your garage door opener is a normally open circuit

584
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,480
Normally the wires are separated when you push that little button to open your garage door

585
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,640
What you're doing is shorting those two contacts together and that tells the motor start the motor up open the garage door, right?

586
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,200
Now most of the systems in my house the door control system the security system

587
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,280
the

588
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Even yeah, even the light system

589
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,320
most of those are powered by this by this idea of contacts and so

590
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,200
It's a very rudimentary way for one system to talk to the other and it's very very reliable

591
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,400
It's very very I think I can say it's efficient as long as it's all in one room

592
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Obviously if you're gonna put control

593
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,880
Points all over the house that would you know that would limit its efficiency

594
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,120
But right now there's just wires that go from one system to another and the whole system works yet

595
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,720
It really can't be compromised unless you have physical access to it and I have made a I have made a

596
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,600
Strong point not to connect my stuff to the Internet and that's why I've shied away from things like the nest thermostat a lot

597
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,320
Of people have asked why don't you have a nest thermostat?

598
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,580
Well, the reason is I don't like the fact that it relies on a service

599
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,380
I don't like the fact that it talks out to the Internet

600
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:59,280
I don't like the fact that Google is going to start recording what temperature I like my house that I don't want any of that

601
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,480
I just want the ability for the thermostat to change the temperature depending on if we're in or out of the house and

602
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,560
There are certain things like the lights like the lights and stuff

603
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,600
Which is nice to be able to control from a smartphone, but really I don't need to control that from outside the house

604
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,060
I am a little worried about leaving an appliance on or something like that

605
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,440
But the security implications and the fact that it opens it up to basically the security implications

606
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,040
I guess that's what here's how you sell me on this and I and I am willing to admit that I would have to be

607
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,320
The biggest idiot in the world to be sitting here in Montana on the way to your house to see your automated house

608
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,840
And I would have to be the biggest moron in the world to say I'm not willing to change my mind on this because I'm driving

609
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,900
Halfway across the United States of America to see this

610
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:52,200
However, what I will tell you is where I sit now is the only way this seems feasible to me is if I could have

611
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,920
Like a one new rack mount style Linux powered rig that everything was wired in over

612
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,600
Ethernet or something into this thing and this was a central hub and I had to have a connection to that and then that

613
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,920
That orchestrated everything for me. I mean if it was like

614
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,920
if it was like as appliance level as installing an alarm system in your home or

615
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,160
Installing like a sprinkler system or an air conditioner. That's the level of appliance. The home automation has to be for me to buy off

616
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,120
how about when you're walking into your house and

617
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,720
You want to give your nanny a key to the house?

618
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,240
And so you give her a key to the house

619
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,240
but she could take that down to Walmart and she could duplicate it right and the other thing is your nanny really only needs to

620
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,440
be there between the hours of 8 and 6 p.m. Because that's when

621
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:39,560
Your that's when mom and dad are gone at work and that's when the kids need to be watched after it

622
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,880
There's no reason for her to come into your house at 2 in the morning, right?

623
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,520
and so my access control system allows me to

624
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:53,020
Authorize a key fob and I hand it to somebody and if they I can tell them that they can come in one time

625
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,440
Any hour they're choosing I can tell them that they will come in between these hours on these specific days

626
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,280
or I can tell them they have free access to the house until I decide that they don't and so if at some point I

627
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,960
Have no problem giving you a key to my house Chris

628
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,600
And if at some point we part ways and you think I'm gonna I'm gonna drive all the way back to Grand Forks, North Dakota

629
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,600
I'm gonna sabotage Noah's house. Guess what by the time you get here your key

630
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,560
I just I log in and I shut it back off and now you can't get back into the house

631
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
additionally because it's a proximity system I

632
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Have a lanyard that hangs around my neck when I have my hands full of groceries or full of boxes

633
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,880
All I do is just swing the lanyard. It hits the side of the house and the door opens

634
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,000
Those are the kind of automation things that I think that there are very little detractions from I don't really see a downside to it

635
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,440
And I see a ton of advantages

636
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,040
So I'm leveraging the advantages of technology to make my life

637
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,880
easier as same thing with the lights coming on when you walk into my house or when you disarm the security system or when the

638
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,720
Little transponder in my car detects that I've my cars pulled up in the driveway

639
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,840
The entry lights come on and that is to me. There is no disadvantage to that happening

640
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,600
It just saves me that the hassle of having to walk into my house

641
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,700
well, I tell you I'll give you a scenario that does kind of that has crossed my mind is

642
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:09,620
JB one it would be nice to be able to have to somehow grant access for Wes to be able to say here Wes

643
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:14,500
Here's a token you can use Bluetooth on your smartphone and now the door will just automatically unlock for you when I'm not there

644
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,820
That sounds great

645
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,260
Yeah, that's the kind of thing that would be kind of nice

646
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,140
I don't know Wes

647
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,180
Have you have you thought at all about I know you kind of got a new place and when you're moving in have you thought?

648
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:28,340
Out all about home automation and like Hughes lights and any of this kind of stuff when you're moving in you're looking at setting things up

649
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,820
Definitely, you know a big one is I work kind of weird hours as does my wife and we have two dogs

650
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,540
So we've we've been looking at a system where the dogs could be let out and let back in and then maybe once they've come

651
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,340
Back in not let out again. So we're definitely interested in that kind of automation

652
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,380
That's yeah. Yeah that for pet owners and you're working that makes a lack

653
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,780
That's a that's a use case that makes a lot of sense to me

654
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,980
Wes have you seen these pet doors that have a little it's you know

655
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:57,660
A lot of people will put pet doors in their in their garage and so that the animal can get in and out by itself

656
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:04,660
But the problem is that creates a potential security hole pun intended for unauthorized people to crawl through the doggy door

657
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:10,180
Have you seen these little things that the dog wears a little RFID collar and then as the dog approaches the door it unlocks the doggy

658
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:14,780
Flap the dog can go out the dog can get in but other people can't those are exactly the kind of things

659
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:21,540
We're looking at we'd like to maybe experiment with making one, you know open source and easily hackable, but we haven't got that far yet

660
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,660
yeah, yeah, I the

661
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:31,620
Animal seem like anything that my line is I have a couple of hard lines in the sand one is I won't use something that

662
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,660
Requires a service or a company to stay in business to continue using it

663
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,940
totally agreed and

664
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:42,020
The other thing is I try and stay away from is things that require the internet to work if you turn the internet off in

665
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,180
My house all of my stuff would still work. My doors would unlock my lights would come on

666
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,060
Everything would work just fine with or without the internet

667
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,780
No, have you had any total failure problems like with this light bulb scenario?

668
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,980
the

669
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,340
closest I had to a total failure was we lost power for a couple days in a row and

670
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,820
During that time the the so there are electromagnetic

671
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,860
Locks that lock the doors and so if they're a fail what we would say a fail safe system

672
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,780
It's as opposed to a fail secure system

673
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:16,620
In other words if it loses power altogether the door defaults to unlock not locked, right?

674
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:23,100
And that's a safety concern because if I can't I want to be able to get out of my house, right? Yeah, it was definitely so

675
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,680
what I have done is there is a battery backup that will that will automatically kick in should the

676
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,820
Power die and it'll power the house up to 24 to 40 some hours. It was electromagnetic

677
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,740
yeah, so because the electromagnetic locks draw very very little power and so

678
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,860
But once I exhausted more than a day or so

679
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:47,460
the battery started to die and so what I ended up doing was I I used a

680
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:55,700
Junction box into the electrical panel so I could switch from the shore power of the city over to

681
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:00,740
Essentially what amounts to an extension cord that hangs off the side of my house, which was plugged into a generator. Awesome

682
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,260
Yeah

683
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:05,420
So I started the generator up and I just flipped those switches and then I was able to set

684
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:10,900
The I was able to switch over and run off of my off of my own

685
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:17,460
Off of my own power. Do you have any old-style keys at all? Or is it all completely digital?

686
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:24,620
No, there is the I we left the traditional locks simply for appearance sake Oh

687
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,100
Yeah, really? Yeah

688
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:32,140
Well when it's kind of weird if you come up to the house and there's there's just a plate over the deadbolt and you need

689
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,740
A handle to you know to open and shut the door so that you'll see locks. They're just they're keyed on both sides

690
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,620
So there's no way for somebody to lock me out of my house

691
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,620
That makes sense. Yeah, I'm really excited to see this Noah. Yeah. No, I think you'll be impressed

692
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:53,260
But before I move on is there anyone in the mumble room that has that has thoughts or feedback about the about the automated house

693
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,300
actually you

694
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,100
earlier you were talking about how the negatives about it and

695
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,980
I was already excited and you start talking about the negatives and you convince me I didn't want it and then you convince me

696
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,980
Again that I do want it. Oh good. Oh

697
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:13,620
good, so the mostly the stuff that you were talking about like the doors unlocking automatically, I've seen some some stuff like the

698
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,540
Africa I think it's called the YubiKey

699
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,500
It's like that you is it not the YubiKey

700
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:26,620
But it's Yubi and it's basically like a a deadbolt that you tap your phone to it and it works

701
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:32,180
But it requires the internet. So if you actually had something that already does that without any internet, that sounds awesome

702
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:37,020
Yeah. Yeah. Anyone else have any thoughts either positive or negative?

703
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:45,060
Yay or nay for home automation. Hey, no, how many how much research did you put into this because it sounds like you looked into

704
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,060
Ambitious nuts and bolts on this, you know, I really did and so what it comes down to is

705
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,400
I do research in a very strange way and probably

706
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,860
Probably not very well supported by a lot of I love it already

707
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:04,120
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna say Chris. You know what I'm gonna say. I do research it. No, no, no

708
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,460
I buy it. I see if it works. Oh, yeah, you buy it

709
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,300
And here's what here's actually what you do know is you buy it you do you do some search?

710
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,620
Maybe that you do initial obsessive phase that involves YouTube and lots of googling forum readings

711
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,860
Reddit and then you get a very modest very average reasonable

712
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,860
Very very good starter edition and then you realize okay

713
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,420
This is either something bad or this is something good

714
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,620
And if it's something good

715
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,940
Then you have to buy the next better version because you can't have the crappy version you got to have the good version of it

716
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,180
Right and we're gonna go into the details of exactly what the system is and exactly how it works

717
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,580
I don't want to give any of that. I don't want to give too much of that away

718
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:47,100
But yeah, I basically I bought I bought a bunch of different systems. I tried a bunch of different things

719
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,020
I saw what works. I saw it didn't work. And the one thing I walked away with is

720
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:58,060
Mess tech mesh technology is garbage this idea that one thing is going to repeat a signal to another thing is gonna repeat a signal

721
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,220
to another thing is just a totally inefficient use of

722
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,260
Radio bandwidth and it's just a disaster and does not work reliably

723
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:11,800
Anyone who's used x10 knows exactly what I'm talking about and not that it's mesh, but it feels like a bad science project

724
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,300
It does not feel like yeah, it does not feel like like like an automated home

725
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,420
Anyone else have any thoughts?

726
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,540
Yeah, I think he's got some now

727
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,740
What do you do in the case of say like rodents getting into the wires or chewing them up?

728
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,460
You know what happens then just out of curiosity. Yeah, what do you do?

729
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,700
No, cuz if something or yeah or any kind of like degradation or something like that

730
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:35,860
That would be horrible because like I said, everything is interconnected via wire

731
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:40,100
So if wires get broken or cut or chewed or anything else bad things would happen

732
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,380
The wires control guy on speed down. Yeah

733
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,980
All of the wires were in the ceiling

734
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,660
So I guess there's a couple that are in the walls that go down to the various panels and stuff

735
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,400
But the most critical wiring is in the ceiling and then the things that go

736
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:59,060
From the security system and stuff like that. I won't go into too much detail, but they're not exposed

737
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,380
So it's not well, you can't just cut them, you know

738
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,500
No, it's not all the wiring can be replaced

739
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,680
What you really got to do if you're smart is you need to have that backed up and maybe you have it backed up

740
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,660
Off-site on your own droplet. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no kidding that so I don't use I said all of my home automation stuff

741
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,640
Isn't connected to the internet

742
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,860
But you better believe that mice my home server and my file server and everything else that runs on my network is connected to the internet

743
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:30,740
And a big thing that I've been playing with lately is MB and you know how I'm running MB is on a digital ocean droplet

744
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,220
No kidding. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's how I set it up. And that's how I'm running

745
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,180
And of course, I'm running it on a sensible distro, which is sent us

746
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:42,860
If you if you head over to digital ocean comm and use the and use the promo code D

747
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,860
Oh unplugged all lowercase all one word

748
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:50,100
You'll get $10 credit and you can fire up your own digital ocean droplet now

749
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,060
$10 to some people might not seem like a lot of money

750
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,020
But when it comes to digital ocean, that's two whole droplets

751
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:01,100
You can have two servers for a month on that with with that $10 promo code. I

752
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,940
actually once I got hooked on digital ocean, I actually had to request that they expand my

753
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:14,700
My droplet limit because they limit you to 25 droplets and I have exceeded 25 droplets

754
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,020
No, actually you were in the Seattle area when you had to do that. It was hilarious. Yeah, I think so

755
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:23,300
Well, here's the thing digital ocean has won. They have made me a ton of money

756
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:29,820
I mean they have they have they have revolutionized my business because they essentially usually what happens in business is

757
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:37,820
You hire somebody that heads up a project and then they they take that project and then deliver a profit and loss statement

758
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,620
And figure out how they're gonna make money and all that stuff

759
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:46,900
Digital ocean essentially did that for my business what they do is they allow me to set up inside of their beautiful dashboard

760
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,860
The ability to spin up servers on the fly and I have clients all the time that call and say hey

761
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,340
This isn't working that isn't working just last week. I had a client called me up

762
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:58,140
She said our EMR system our electronic medical records

763
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,340
The thing that we use for our patients is not working

764
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,980
We need you to come fix this for so I go over there and their server is totally shot

765
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:08,460
Now a couple years ago, I would have had to tell her that we would have to order a server from Dell

766
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,300
It would take five the three to five business days

767
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:15,360
Unless they wanted to pay for expedited shipping and expedited processing in which case I could get it there in maybe a day or two

768
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:21,420
But they it would cost them an arm and a leg and then she tells me they're actually looking at switching software to something else

769
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,500
So I said hey, I got an idea. I got a great deal for you. We'll rent you a server for 20 bucks a month

770
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:31,460
And of course, it's only costing me five. So the my profit margin is built in there

771
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,220
yeah, and you know what honestly to like

772
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:39,760
There was a there was a time and a day where I worked for a company that did this and they would do it

773
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,740
For like three hundred dollars a month the same thing

774
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:47,620
And so really it's it's you know, the other thing that's really awesome about that Noah, and I know you know this

775
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,180
But of course you could then just once if like they ever wanted to move on or if they wanted to manage it themselves

776
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:57,060
You could just transfer it to them and we've done that and DigitalOcean is really really good about

777
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:03,740
About helping you move one server with no no downtime. No loss of no loss of no loss of uptime

778
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,540
They'll move it from one as they call it profile to another profile

779
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,380
And so if they want to take control of that server

780
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:12,860
They're more than welcome to do it and actually for the first time we went the other way where

781
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:18,180
We had a client that we had set them up with their own account and their own server the whole nine yards and eventually they

782
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,480
came back and said hey

783
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:25,220
We would actually really appreciate it if you could manage this because it's getting to be a lot for us to do and so they just

784
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,540
moved it over to our account and we just kind of took over and

785
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:33,900
We've been managing it ever since and it has worked awesome. So head over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code

786
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:41,700
Do unplugged all lowercase to get $10 and spin up your own Linux rig. I love it

787
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,000
I thank you digital anything to use DigitalOcean. Oh, yes. I love DigitalOcean. I use it a lot. Yeah

788
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,100
Mm-hmm. I usually mostly use it was for VPN work and tunneling around the internet

789
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,380
Oh, that's very good use for DigitalOcean. Awesome. Very nice

790
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,260
so

791
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,420
one of my all-time favorite distros

792
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:05,100
In fact, I'd say it still stays as my favorite distro is fedora and fedora released fedora 23 beta edition

793
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,740
And I have not had a chance to play with it myself

794
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:14,300
but reading through reading through this release from fedora magazine org seems like

795
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,060
They've got some pretty cool stuff that that's coming out now

796
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:22,460
One of the things I've noticed of the last couple releases of fedora is it seems like they are not making

797
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,900
They're not like plowing through making headway and sweeping changes

798
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,580
It seems like they're they're kind of trying to stabilize and try to polish things up

799
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:35,980
That's not so much the case with the with of course their their new installer package manager

800
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:39,660
So there's there's a couple things that have been new in the last couple releases

801
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,700
But it seems like 23 is shaping up to be a really really polished

802
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,300
Linux distro and the other thing I like and I've said this before and I'll say it again

803
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:53,580
I like the direction they're going with these with this workstation idea this idea that you can actually use

804
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,860
Fedora in production and I think that there's a big

805
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,180
Misconception about using fedora in production. I

806
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,460
I've obviously used it on my laptop and on my desktop

807
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:09,500
But I guess in the past I would have been hesitant to hand it to a client or somebody that wasn't overly familiar with Linux

808
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,620
To use yeah, you know has it have you is it just me or does it seem like the fedora project?

809
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:19,260
Also is changing in the way they message about asking for help with the betas

810
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:25,980
It seems to be that they're not what they're encouraging users to use beta more, but they're also at the same time

811
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,180
They're saying use our betas, but use it to help us find problems

812
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:33,020
So, you know, it's like be very aware of what you're using it for in a much more

813
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,940
They did a last release

814
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,260
But I really feel like they're doing it a lot in this release and now from a selfish standpoint

815
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,740
No, because I'm sitting right here in front of my XPS 13

816
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:44,180
I got to say the improvements that they say with Wayland and we've talked about this before on unplugged

817
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,780
Is the mixed high DPI support?

818
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:54,900
So those of you who don't have high DPI at the moment if you have a Linux rig that has a high DPI display and

819
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,140
You want to hook up a secondary display?

820
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,740
That secondary display also runs in a pixel doubled mode

821
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:07,220
So you get essentially half or more worse resolution

822
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:14,780
So the only way I've actually made this usable on my XPS 13 is I have a used Apple cinema 30-inch display that I use

823
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:21,940
As a second display and then I get a semi like reusable like the telegram app takes up half the screen. It's it's awful

824
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:27,820
Wow, it's super weak. Yeah, it's not usable. So having mixed high DPI support is a huge deal

825
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:31,720
Now you're gonna have to use Wayland to get that now, let's let's be let's be fair about this

826
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:38,640
This is a short-lived problem because eventually I my personal belief is my personal prediction is within

827
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:46,060
We'll say three years. Everything is gonna be high DPI. So I think that I think that this is a short-lived problem

828
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:52,360
I think that in a couple of years where every monitor that you buy will support this natively and we we won't even need to

829
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,940
It'll be it will seem like it will seem like complaining about not having a VGA port on a computer

830
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:00,280
And I know there's gonna be somebody out there that says I have to have my VGA port

831
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:06,120
But but until that time until we reach that point, I guess if you had a high DPI

832
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,560
Display on your laptop and you didn't have a high D and you don't have mixed high DPI support

833
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,600
That would be a real problem. Yeah, but you're right. That's like a limited time issue. I see what you're saying

834
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,520
Yeah, it's not gonna be a big deal

835
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,680
Okay here speaking of something that feels like something maybe more down the road and I'm sure it's not gonna work for a lot

836
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,760
Of hardware. I don't have a lot of high expectations for this particular bullet point in the feature list

837
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,120
But this is what they say the software application is smarter

838
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:34,080
And it now has the ability to update system firmware

839
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:38,060
We've talked about this before but system firmware updates through GNOME software to me

840
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,200
I seem like a big deal that to me is like that's like

841
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,680
MacBook

842
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:51,120
Level like, you know Apple sending you a UEFI firmware for your MacBook update and you get update through the software center now

843
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:58,880
With GNOME software. I'm sure the initial support is going to be limited but you're gonna be able to update system firmware through

844
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:03,180
GNOME software under Fedora that feels like a super integrated

845
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,920
2015 consumer experience to me and hopefully now if someone will and hopefully now if someone will you know

846
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:13,220
They're like taking the lead here. So if people do want, you know to better support firmware updates with Linux

847
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:16,020
They have a project they can go to and get it integrated right away. Yeah, good point

848
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:22,060
Yeah, what took him so long is what Anthony says what took him so long. Yes. How about exactly? What do you guys think?

849
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:29,820
Anyone's system the system firmware stuff like how like what exactly is it offering to update? Is it UEFI stuff?

850
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,900
I'm not exactly sure when they say on the bullet point here

851
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,820
They just say system firmware now when I we covered it before in the past

852
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:42,260
I looked into it and it was essentially like anything any hardware that can distribute a free open source firmware

853
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:46,060
Could potentially if they package it up correctly get updated through this

854
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:49,700
I don't think it has to be anything in particular the key there though

855
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:55,700
Right is if it it's if it has proprietary blobs if it if it if it's something that is, you know

856
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:00,100
Proprietary it's not gonna work through the system and if it's something where they don't I don't know exactly

857
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,900
But if they don't take the prep work, it won't work either

858
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,500
So I would imagine it's fairly limited

859
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:10,600
But then again if you want to be known as the best Linux Wi-Fi card or the best Linux

860
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,520
Video capture device or something like that

861
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,160
Then maybe you're the vendor that goes above and beyond and starts to support the system before somebody else does

862
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,120
Yeah

863
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:24,320
So, you know, it'll be interesting do we I didn't pull it up here

864
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,400
When is the when they usually do here we go. Here's a release schedule

865
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,600
Do we know when the actual when the at 123 will actually be out?

866
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,120
they just say October and

867
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,640
They say October in the list, you know

868
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:42,920
And I the reason why I hate to say more specific than that is because it doesn't and when's the last time a fedora release

869
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,320
Didn't get bumped a little bit. Never never it always does but you know what I support that

870
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,600
I support that decision because I would rather them take an extra month an extra two months and fix the stuff that they're holding

871
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,560
The release rather than just put it out there and say oh, we'll patch it there. We'll update it

872
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,160
No, just if it takes an extra month or two, that's fine

873
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:04,720
The way I do fedora releases and this is not a hit on fedora. This is I think this is just good practice

874
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,560
I have a machine that I use daily and then I have another machine that I use

875
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,000
You know kind of at night just to kind of you know, check my email and do stuff like that

876
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,600
I will usually install the latest version of fedora on that machine and then run it for a month or two and make sure that

877
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,160
All the kinks and all the bugs and and all my software works and on all that stuff on

878
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:31,320
It first before I actually move my daily driver over to it and I think that's a good way to do it

879
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:37,240
You know, what strikes me about the fedora project really is and I I mean

880
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,640
Maybe maybe he just successfully has his he batted his eyes at me and he impressed me

881
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,640
but I talked with Matthew Miller at Linux con and

882
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,940
You know, I really liked sort of and actually what I forget Noah who the other gentleman we were talking to from Red Hat

883
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:58,380
But he was he was talking about some of the things that fedora project and it may be even more so Red Hat have worked on

884
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:04,260
That they are unable to really advertise because it would actually expose them to greater risk

885
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,020
So I don't even want to go into too much detail here because this was a private conversation

886
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:11,820
But what they told me was essentially there has been major accomplishments. They have made

887
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:15,860
That they don't really advertise and I bet this is true for a lot of companies

888
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,400
I bet this is probably not a Red Hat specific thing

889
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:26,300
It's probably true for Intel and canonical and a lot of different companies that they make these legal battles or they they they resolve these

890
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,340
Issues, but the reason you can't talk about it is because if you say

891
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:32,580
Let's just say it's the ability to burn a CD under Linux

892
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:35,940
Let's just say it's like there was some code that had to be licensed to do that

893
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,540
And if you if you announce that you licensed it

894
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:43,980
Then you're essentially exposing yourself open to potential lawsuits down the road

895
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,740
so you don't say anything even though it was a major benefit to the desktop and

896
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:52,340
That's that is one of the things that when I look at Fedora

897
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:56,220
I like a lot about it is I like the people behind Fedora

898
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:00,060
I like the people leading Fedora and I like the company support supporting Fedora

899
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:03,300
That's one of the reasons I was at Ubuntu user for a really long time too. So

900
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,100
Fedora 23 coming out in October. That's sort of like

901
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,780
Interesting the major topic the takeaway for me is man

902
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,220
Fedora is looking really compelling and and you got to have some perspective when I say this because

903
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:19,460
You you do a snapshot of I don't know five six years ago

904
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:22,020
And I might have been one of the biggest Fedora haters around

905
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,420
I mean I even a year ago

906
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,860
I didn't really think it was that practical of a distro until until 21 started coming out

907
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:33,140
Then I started changing my tune and I guess for me what and I it's willful ignorance

908
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:36,300
I guess is what it was because I had started with Red Hat and

909
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,540
Then I had moved in for to Fedora and I'd have been using it since Fedora core 1

910
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:48,060
so I had just I had just learned to deal with some of the shortcomings of Fedora and I just I was like it for

911
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:52,340
Me it wasn't Oh Fedora doesn't do these things and those other distros do for me

912
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:57,500
It was just my computer doesn't do those things and and that's it's a good thing

913
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:03,700
And it's a bad thing on what it's a bad thing because I think I was I think I was unaware of how powerful Linux really

914
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:08,100
Was but I think it's a good thing because it allowed it allowed me to have an appreciation for

915
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,980
for to appreciate Fedora for what it was and

916
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:17,620
As you as you as you pointed out the company behind Fedora is so great

917
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:21,380
I have a large respect for Red Hat even more now after having visited with them

918
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,980
I mean, let me tell you the people at Red Hat. They are some really authentic live Linux loving folks and

919
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,180
I'm I'm trying to think it was it was it at the was it at the after-party?

920
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:38,780
Yeah, that you were talking to. Yep. Yep. Okay, and so I I think I know who that was

921
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:43,980
But yeah, but but yeah, you can tell from talking to him, right? He's a very authentic guy

922
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,300
He's he's he's he it's it's not just a show and it's not a tagline

923
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,660
Those are core beliefs to people like that

924
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:56,900
And yeah, and also I wouldn't just say that I would also say some serious like perspective on the community and on the landscape

925
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:02,940
And and not just like a lot of times when you talk to people they have a very very strong

926
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,860
Corporate bias, you know, they they see the world through a corporate lens

927
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,100
I'm sure that's the case for Red Hat employees too

928
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,820
But when we were having, you know with 20-minute casual conversation

929
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:16,420
it was really I got the sensation that he had a broader perspective and

930
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:21,780
And what was nice about that is two other Red Hat employees walked up and they also gave me that same impression

931
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:25,740
They have the corporate perspective and then they have the broader open source perspective

932
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:29,580
And that I found very refreshing. Yeah, and they're the first people, you know

933
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:34,700
I walked in there and I was talking about how how much I appreciated their training program and

934
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:41,940
They talked about and I asked them I said tell me what advantages Red Hat offers over its competitors

935
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,980
And none of them could answer the question all of them looked at me and they went

936
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:48,460
You mean like the other people in the community? We all kind of work together

937
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:53,460
I mean, I mean there's some things that canonical does that we use and we do a lot of stuff that canonical uses

938
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,000
but I don't I guess we don't really have a competitive thing as we

939
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,680
We just make what we need and we do the work and we support the project

940
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,660
It does help when you are standing on stacks of billions of dollars

941
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:10,540
It does but my point is they don't they don't say they don't say we're standing out

942
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,100
We have the the financial resources to make this project

943
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:18,740
Succeed and so that's what we leverage over these other companies. They don't view it that way

944
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:24,300
They just view it as a contribution that everyone can benefit from and the thing is I

945
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:28,380
Mean to some degree. I appreciate where they're coming from to some degree

946
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,420
I sometimes I think they're short-selling themselves because I when I went through the Red Hat training program

947
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,420
I was absolutely blown away

948
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:40,720
the fact that I was being tested on real hardware with real problems save the internet because I know we disagree on that point but

949
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:47,700
The way that they the way that the training was conducted the fact that the instructor was using a Red Hat machine the entire

950
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,340
Time all the notes were available to us in

951
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:55,980
Open office like it's it's the little things like that that just made it if you were a Linux user and you wanted to be

952
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,700
Immersed in Linux you could do the Linux training now these days

953
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,900
owning a full-time business

954
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:07,560
There's something that nobody ever tells you about owning a small business and that is when you go into business for yourself

955
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:15,440
You have the ability to you might be a really good electrical person that electrician and you can run electrical wires

956
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:19,920
But if you're gonna go into business for yourself you actually have to know the business side of it, too

957
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:25,000
And the thing they don't tell you about that is that business side of it takes a ton of time and so now I just I

958
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,680
Don't have the time to go for a week off to a Red Hat training course to get certified in in in the latest

959
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:32,680
In the latest Red Hat certification

960
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:38,200
But what I do have time for is late at night in two of the morning in my skippy sitting down with my laptop and going

961
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:44,120
To Linux Academy now Linux Academy if you use the if you use the URL Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

962
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,360
You'll get 33% off and let me tell you I actually paid full price

963
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,920
I think the first time I signed up because I didn't know about the program

964
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:55,400
I didn't know about the promo code and I thought that was a good deal. So 33% off. That's a huge deal

965
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:02,780
Now they are they're actually working to to help find you a job help get you into the career space and you

966
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:06,520
Linux Academy comm they'll be willing to help you with that. I

967
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:12,040
Actually am just getting ready to take my Red Hat 7 certification

968
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:17,520
And in the past the past couple versions of Red Hat what I've had to do is drive the nearest training center is Minneapolis

969
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,240
So that's a four-hour drive for me actually closer to five probably and when I get to Minneapolis

970
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:27,280
I have to rent a hotel that's money. I'm not working. So that's money. I'm paying to eat out every day

971
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:33,360
That's money plus I'm paying for the course and let me tell you while the courses are absolutely top-notch and I absolutely love them

972
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:38,740
They're expensive and so that's money and then I have to actually pay to take the test and then of course the gas to go

973
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,000
back and forth

974
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,920
With Linux Academy. I'm doing it for literally a fraction of that price and I can I can I can get certified

975
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,920
In the next version of Red Hat all I can't actually take the test

976
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,360
But I can do all of the prep work and learn all of the material right on their website now the other thing

977
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,600
I really like about

978
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,280
Linux Academy is the concept of the snippets

979
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:02,880
When I first got into when Ralph 7 first came out

980
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,000
The first thing I had to do was learn how to support it for clients. I didn't care about certification

981
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,880
I didn't care about what was gonna be on the test. What I wanted to know was the practical advice

982
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:17,000
How can I actually make this work and Linux Academy worked with me on that and said these are these are the five or six

983
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,840
things I need to know and

984
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,840
so they

985
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,920
And so they said here I told them these are the five or six things

986
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,840
I need to know and they said here's how much time you need to allocate and here are the things that modules that you need

987
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,840
To go through and and learn this stuff

988
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:30,440
Yeah

989
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:36,560
That helped me that when I when I saw like when I was trying to decide if I'm gonna take on Ruby or Python and being

990
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,600
Able to put both of them into a four hours or five hours or six hour perspective

991
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,040
I know I've mentioned this before Noah

992
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:48,360
But to me that is like goes from this big really weird like concept that I'm gonna learn a programming language

993
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:53,440
To I'm gonna spend five hours doing a thing and that made it much more approachable now

994
01:11:53,440 --> 01:12:00,120
Think about that if I had told you Ruby is a really cool language and your your troll up in the upstairs

995
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,800
Your live-in troll says that you should learn Ruby

996
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,920
Would you have taken time out of your week and paid money to go to a course to learn programming or would you have?

997
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,280
Simply said hey, you know what? I'm not a programmer. I don't have time for this. I'm running a podcast network

998
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,000
I have three kids. I'm trying to launch new show. I have all these things going on

999
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,720
I don't have time for that

1000
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,480
But then if you if then if you say well

1001
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,160
Here's I want you to open your laptop and instead of watching TV

1002
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,520
Click around through this right and you'll learn how to program right jeez anyone can get on board with that

1003
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:32,640
And you know if you're somebody like me where sometimes your your version of playing gaming on your computer is actually like tinkering with your distro

1004
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,240
Or messing around with your computer Linux Academy also scratches that same itch

1005
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,240
Yeah

1006
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:45,680
So so yeah Linux Academy dot-com slash unplugged Linux Academy comm slash unplug because then you'll get the automatic discount

1007
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:51,780
Yeah, 33 percent. That's a heck of a discount. I know you know that number isn't accidentally picked. I don't think I think it had special meaning

1008
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,600
hmm

1009
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:00,960
Okay, so we were gonna talk this week about the the automatic like block backup system wimpy was trying that out

1010
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,520
However, I don't see him in the room. You know he's on wireless connection, too

1011
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,180
So I have to be gentle with him

1012
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,800
I can't give him a hard time if he can't make it that's that seems legit

1013
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:13,480
So I thought I would talk a little bit just for a moment then about the last couple of weeks

1014
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,800
there's been a pretty important topic to me, and that's taking things offline and

1015
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:23,400
Pretending like I'm online just sort of like that could be a lot of things like anything from search to

1016
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,320
media content or things like that and

1017
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,960
I've I've kind of have a couple of different ideas in mind, but

1018
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,480
Since I'm on the road. I thought maybe specifically I'd talk about ideas

1019
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:40,240
I had for the rover and Noah bad news some of it involves project time when I get to your place

1020
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,760
Oh, that's what you're talking about. That's great news, dude. I know I'm excited

1021
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:49,680
Listen anytime somebody's willing to let me drill holes and take parts off, and I'm just kidding, but I

1022
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,240
I'm all over doing project. I think it'll be fun

1023
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:57,480
Yeah, no, I think it'll be fun, and you know what the great thing is here's what Chris's answer every time

1024
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:01,320
I I'm like oh, you know we have we have this problem where we have this here's his answer

1025
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,640
It's become kind of a joke. It's all show content. That's right. That's you're gonna get to see it

1026
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:10,040
That is very true. It does even even when my well my rings on the side of the road

1027
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,600
It still ends up in being a show content, so

1028
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,480
West have you continued to work with MB? I mean you still set it up

1029
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,360
What are your thoughts couple day or I guess maybe a week and a half since we?

1030
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:26,160
First talked about two weeks three weeks as we first talked about it and a week since we first recorded our segment any follow-up

1031
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,160
thoughts

1032
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,520
You know I'm still fairly impressed

1033
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:38,120
I've been adding more content using you know file bots been working great the directory structure hasn't been too onerous at least for my personal

1034
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:38,880
collection

1035
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,880
And honestly I've been pretty impressed. You know a lot of that credit goes to f of M peg

1036
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,320
But I built it on a rather

1037
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,480
Let's say it's not generously spec'd it'll be upgraded at some point

1038
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:52,760
But you know I'm loading it down pretty good transcoding 1080p streams and hardly hiccup

1039
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,160
I will say sometimes when you need to jump around in the video that can be a little laggy

1040
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,840
But once it picks up it seems to be continuous, so I'm having great time

1041
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,960
Well, I think I'll be oh yeah

1042
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,440
I was kind of that was kind of that's where I'm at too is I think I'm thinking about doing the donation once I get

1043
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:10,720
Back from the road trip if I have the funds, but I was telling Anthony before we went on the air

1044
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,440
Right where he's sitting right now or perhaps where I'm sitting

1045
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:18,960
I'm not sure so one of the cool things about the current rover setup is the mobile studio all

1046
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,520
Collapses down and it goes underneath the seat that's at the depth of like the dinner table

1047
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,800
So I'm able to completely just get rid of all of this when we're driving and it's all safe

1048
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:34,440
And it all fits under the seat, but there's another seat where we have that same storage area now. It's a very nice storage area

1049
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,440
It's mostly filled with toilet paper at the moment

1050
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,740
Truth be told the essentials exactly

1051
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:47,080
But I was thinking there is a storage compartment in the side of the RV that is sort of lined up with where that seat is

1052
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,860
At and if I were to fill that storage compartment with a bank of batteries

1053
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,260
I could then put an inverter underneath that seat

1054
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:56,900
I could then put a NUC and a NAS under that seat and a router and

1055
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:01,340
Then when I wanted to charge that bank of batteries because it would be in that storage compartment

1056
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:09,020
I would simply open up that storage compartment and then run the solar chargers to it charge over solar or whatever the source power would

1057
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:14,260
Be and then have it come back into the inverter right here underneath your butt. Basically. Does that seem solid to you?

1058
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,300
That seems very solid. Now. What do you think Noah? Is this an impossible task?

1059
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,420
No, I don't think it's an impossible task

1060
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:23,420
The only thing I want to add to that and I you I'll be completely honest

1061
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:26,260
You kind of lost me in the middle of that when you're describing it

1062
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:32,180
but the only thing I would add is I would want somehow your battery bank inside the camper to be connected to the battery bank on

1063
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:39,660
The front of the camper and the reason I say that is because the front bank of the camper is what's tied into the charging

1064
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,960
Inverter of the camper as well as the charging connector that goes into your truck

1065
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:48,220
So anytime you're plugged into shore power or anytime you're plugged into your truck

1066
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:53,340
I would think you'd want all the batteries available to charge as much as they can right that is true

1067
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:58,220
Yeah, that is a good point. I was actually thinking about running as so I had two ideas

1068
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:03,900
So I was thinking I could tie it into the main trailer power system and then I would have the advantages of shore power

1069
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:08,620
Charging that battery bank. I would have the advantage of lighting up all of the AC outlets in here

1070
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:11,700
And I would have the advantage of trickle charging while I'm driving

1071
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:12,460
however

1072
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,260
I

1073
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:20,360
Could also use that as a separate isolated power system that just powers all of the computer gear essentially all of the studio gear all

1074
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:26,900
Of the Linux server stuff and all of that that has its own separate source of power that is all completely off of the RV

1075
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:29,540
System, so they mean there's two ways to go both have their downs and ups

1076
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:35,860
Well, it sounds like you're you're developing quite the list. I know that when I did my RV

1077
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,660
It took me a good two years

1078
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:43,140
To flush out all of the things I wanted to do and and then I would do some of them and then I would go

1079
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,300
Back and redo. I'm curious. Have you come up with that?

1080
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,180
Have you have you done anything that you said that you've now after living in it?

1081
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:52,540
You've said well actually if I had that to do that over again, I would do it this way instead

1082
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:59,780
Yeah, I mean this this this battery bank that I'm talking about is probably the biggest thing actually is now that we're here doing shows

1083
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:05,580
And I'm sitting here watching my both my both my laptops. I'm sitting in front of me are down to 40% battery and

1084
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,500
Just you know this is

1085
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,480
And I think okay this this power thing

1086
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,580
Here's what we're doing to save money to be honest with you is we're boondocking a lot more is

1087
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:24,380
We're kind of just we're finding places that have good cellular coverage and we're staying there and they don't necessarily have power hookups

1088
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,460
Which means we're running off the battery a lot more

1089
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,980
Do you?

1090
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,460
You don't you have that thousand trails membership that gets you free camping at places

1091
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:36,020
If there's one along us 90, but there's not

1092
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:42,340
There's nothing along us. This is Montana. There's not much out there. Trust me. Yeah, that's really something

1093
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:48,980
No, well a boondocking is kind of fun, and if you think about it really boondocking is the best way to test your your true

1094
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:50,540
offline ability

1095
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,020
Because you're you're literally reliant on nothing

1096
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:58,300
Yeah, just for those of you who are not familiar with the term because before I knew anything about trailers and RVs

1097
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,300
I didn't know what the hell boondocking was it is

1098
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,020
Like it's basically a fancy term of dry camping

1099
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:08,980
It's it's a trailer or an RV where you live off the grid you still have power because you have your furnace you have your water

1100
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:13,540
Tanks you have your you have your your your your sewage tanks, and you have propane

1101
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:18,300
So you can completely be self-contained and you can go anywhere and basically live off the grid

1102
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:19,940
And you call that boondocking a lot of times

1103
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:26,540
It's urban camping is another term people call like you know and and some places like Walmart's and yes

1104
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:32,460
What cracker barrels and a lot of other places all you know they actually like it because they want you to be their customer

1105
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:35,580
And so it's it's it's an interesting culture there

1106
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:41,540
And we've been we've been meeting different people and they've all been really cool and every single one

1107
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:46,580
Has a different technology implementation and we walk around sometimes some of the different parks

1108
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:51,260
And we're checking out like the different antennas that they have hooked up and some people have like flat ones in their window

1109
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:56,660
Some people have big ones they have out in their yard that are wired into their rigs and all of these people are coming with

1110
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:01,740
Different technology solutions. It's it's not it's the it's not like these are technology dead spots

1111
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:06,460
There's a there's a lot of different ingenuity going on here and a lot of maker stuff. I'm seeing that's really cool

1112
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:14,660
That's awesome. The the the concept of see and in the thing is my next goal is to get you involved with ham radio because

1113
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:18,140
It ties in so nicely with the concept

1114
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:22,700
well from with the concept of open source with the concept of maker with the concept of

1115
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,180
You know doing everything yourself

1116
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:29,620
The one thing that you you are somewhat reliant on right now is connectivity to other places now

1117
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:32,900
It's not ham radio isn't necessarily gonna help you with the broadcasting side

1118
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:38,980
But it would definitely help you if you ever wanted to get a message from one person to the other and you didn't have cell phone

1119
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:43,580
Service, you wouldn't need it. I don't know what what kind of like I'm gonna have to be honest, but I'm willing to try

1120
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:50,340
And I and I think that as you I think that as you continue to move towards this idea of wanting control over your own

1121
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:55,460
Every end of it like you were talking about controlling every individual like controlling when the water heater is on and when the water heaters

1122
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:00,780
Off that kind of intense control intense flexibility and intense self-reliance

1123
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,500
Just goes like just dovetails perfectly with ham radio

1124
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,080
The only thing I'm you know

1125
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,860
when I do all of this is my my default right now would be like use arch for all these different little machines to run these

1126
01:21:11,860 --> 01:21:16,340
Different things and the only thing is is I'm just not sure that's gonna work in an offline scenario

1127
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,340
So that's one thing I'm revisiting

1128
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,940
And there's some stuff that I have to kind of reevaluate when I think about some of this

1129
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:26,340
It's like how would I really do this if I have to actually be offline could I take an arch box offline?

1130
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:31,180
And if I go offline is it only offline for two three weeks at a time is maybe a week at most

1131
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,100
But then if I go can I go somewhere I can get a lot of updates

1132
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:39,240
There's little things like that when using Linux that are different than using some of the other commercial operating systems

1133
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:45,340
But then the flip side is I have the main thing that I need and that is the ability to live offline on my own

1134
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:48,160
No subscription necessary and like we were talking about the beginning

1135
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:54,520
I'm not gonna also be victims of marketing whims of these different companies. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a big one

1136
01:21:54,520 --> 01:22:00,540
Right is it well, I guess that goes back to I guess that goes back to my thing of just anything that requires a company

1137
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,060
or a service

1138
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:06,140
Yeah, I know. I know you always make that point Wes. Are you so Wes?

1139
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:07,420
Where do you fall on this?

1140
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:11,860
So Noah's kind of coming down on the lines like he won't even get a Roku for his house because he doesn't want to be

1141
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,100
Tied to the Roku service and this is one of the reasons he's a big Linux fan, too

1142
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:20,320
Where do you where do you fall on like West stuff? That's like dependent on a third-party service to continue to function long-term

1143
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,020
You know, I'm definitely skeptical as well

1144
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,140
I I do use some of them, you know

1145
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:28,900
My some of my family members have smart TVs and I've set up some streaming to those and that kind of thing

1146
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:29,740
But you do, you know

1147
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:31,060
You have to be very aware that

1148
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:36,340
You're kind of just risking the time thing as soon as that platform decides to stop supporting the service you happen to use

1149
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,020
You're you're out and it'll be an anachronism before

1150
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:43,420
Your take on this too because I have a whole nother complaint when it comes to smart TVs

1151
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:47,420
Smart TVs are these devices that even if LG stays in business

1152
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:50,780
Which I think they will and even if they continue to support their platform, which I think they will

1153
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:55,740
the fact that those apps constantly get updated, but the hardware is stuck and

1154
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:00,660
Instead of replacing with the Roku we're talking about a 30 40 50 60 70 dollar box, right?

1155
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:04,180
When it comes to the TV right now, we're talking about I mean

1156
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:08,020
I've paid a couple hundred dollars for for free for any decent TV

1157
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:12,060
And if you buy a real big one in your basement, and you're looking at twelve thirteen hundred dollars

1158
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,540
you know how mad I'd be if in three years I

1159
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,060
go to take that out and

1160
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,900
Or I go to I go to update it and I realize I can no longer open Netflix on my smart TV

1161
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:22,340
Yeah

1162
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:29,540
Because the ARM processor in it is not capable of running the newest version of Netflix because they've literally quadrupled in speed in four years

1163
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,220
That is definitely the stage that technology is at

1164
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:39,580
Yeah, so I mean that and that's that's not specific the Roku where you gain some solid ground Chris and where I don't really have

1165
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,300
a leg to stand on is

1166
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,780
It principally I think I'm on safe ground

1167
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:49,060
But the problem becomes that the Roku is such a cost-effective device that it literally becomes

1168
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,520
Almost disposable, you know when you're talking about, you know

1169
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:56,880
You've said this and I think you're right when you're looking at 50 or 60 bucks anything under 100

1170
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,920
Really if it gets you a couple of years it served its purpose you what I mean

1171
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:06,140
You got your use out of it and then you can go get some I think that's why the Chromecast is so successful because it

1172
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:10,060
Is you know, it's so cheap. Even if you can't do everything with it. It does enough for it. So I know

1173
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:17,740
Right. Yeah, the other thing about that but again, so and the Chromecast I come I become conflicted on I had we had a

1174
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:18,900
meeting room

1175
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:25,060
For a client and what they wanted to do was they wanted to obviously project from their laptop up on onto the screen

1176
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:29,200
So we had run an HDMI cable in the wall while the room was being built and all that stuff

1177
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:34,480
Do you know what turned out to be a way easier solution was putting a Chromecast in there and now every

1178
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,540
Guest that sits down even if there's like six of them in a room

1179
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:43,940
They can take turns who is sharing their screen up on up on the Chromecast and that was I mean

1180
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:46,660
It was thirty freaking dollars. It required no actual

1181
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,620
Wiring we didn't have to do anything in the walls or anything like that

1182
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:57,100
It was brain-dead simple to set up and it's actually worked super well on the flip side of the coin if Google ever

1183
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:59,420
decides not to support the Chromecast which

1184
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,940
Could be next week for all we know

1185
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,580
Not only not only are they out there there, you know 40 bucks for the Chromecast

1186
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:11,020
But now they're out of solution now the thing that they were relying on to be able to get stuff up on this meeting room

1187
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,380
TV is is host and I guess that's what kind of bothers me

1188
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:17,140
Yeah, I have a personal example

1189
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:21,980
We were looking to use a Groupon has some software where you can have like kind of point of sale displays where you can set

1190
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:26,340
Up links for various Chromecasts and have a web interface where you can manage what each Chromecast is displaying

1191
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:31,300
So you can kind of easily easily change them and we were looking to use that at work for looking at graphs and that kind

1192
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:35,140
Of stuff but you know where you what you get with the convenience you lose in the custom

1193
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:40,800
Ability, so we're looking to use at the new Ethernet adapters that they have but a lot of the security implications

1194
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:44,520
We just couldn't you know, we have to use Raspberry Pi's because you can't lock down a Chromecast, you know

1195
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,620
You just don't have the option if you if they lose power. They instantly come back as a wireless access point

1196
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:52,960
Yeah, so what what what you've you've you've done that with a Raspberry Pi

1197
01:25:53,760 --> 01:26:00,300
We're implementing something that will be essentially the same but we don't get to take advantage of Groupon's awesome open-source project unfortunately

1198
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:04,280
All right. Well, that's cool. There was I don't know if you caught in in Linux action show this week

1199
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:08,860
There was a guy that was talking about the fruit party and how you can how everyone names their

1200
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:13,120
Everyone names their mini little computer after some form of a fruit. That's awesome

1201
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:19,220
So Chris any other final thoughts of of using Linux offline

1202
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,500
No, I think I'm gonna something I'm gonna reflect on some more

1203
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:27,500
Because we are about to go through unless I'm wrong Anthony pretty much

1204
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,260
The most of the rest of the stretch in Montana is gonna be offline, right?

1205
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:36,500
I don't know once you get past Billings. It's gonna be pretty rough. Yeah, and Billings is our next destination

1206
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,500
So I think so we'll see

1207
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:42,160
So I'll probably have some more thoughts after that and I'll say

1208
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,540
Also this if you want to follow the destination as long as we have some level of connectivity should be able to over at Jupiter

1209
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:54,480
Broadcasting comm slash rover and I don't know if I'll be able to post updates as often since we'll have limited connectivity

1210
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:58,420
But you can also find a link to the playlist over on the rover webpage and we just posted one last night

1211
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:03,120
We have now have seven seven of the rover logs go check those out and new patrons

1212
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:08,940
Also some exclusive stuff over at patreon.com slash today some really cool personal touch just for you

1213
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,700
All right

1214
01:27:11,740 --> 01:27:13,740
Well, that'll bring us to the end of this week's episode

1215
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:16,980
Join us at Jupiter broadcasting comm

1216

1217
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,980
You

1218
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:02,380
Well for flying by the seat of our pants I wasn't too bad no, I think that went pretty good good job sir

1219
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:07,740
Good job. No, you're awesome. Yeah. Well, here's the thing you should I'm gonna take a picture when I get done

1220
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,740
of what this room looks like I

1221
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:16,660
It has been fun like I was literally walking why is it every every 15 seconds I'd look around and I'm like

1222
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:18,660
Oh, I have to do this or I have to get that done

1223
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,660
Yeah, I

1224
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,820
You were quick on the quick on the telegram though. That works pretty well

1225
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:31,540
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I have I have one computer that's dedicated to tell the past him. You've lost me. You've lost me

1226
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,260
No, you haven't lost me. I'm here. Sorry. Okay, great. Sorry about that. I

1227
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:39,580
Yeah, I have I have one computer that's just dedicated to to telegram

1228
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:44,400
So that computer that had one laptop that was set up and I'm like, this is just the computer

1229
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,580
I'm going to use to communicate with people. So

1230
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:53,280
I hear that there was a Skype out yesterday and that has thrown a serious wrench into your plans of

1231
01:28:53,660 --> 01:28:57,380
Doing a mobile studio on Skype. Yeah, man. That was awful

1232
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:04,860
We were all wired in sounded actually really good and I had good connection and then I was able to log in the studio

1233
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,620
Thankfully after a little while I was able to get connecting the studio and talk to the live stream

1234
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:12,180
But for a while, I thought it was like I thought it was an issue with the connectivity

1235
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,780
I thought it was an I didn't know what was going on because I figured it was on my end because I'm in the mobile

1236
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,220
Studio, so it must be my fault that I can't get logged into Skype

1237
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:24,140
Yeah, but you you and so and so somewhere along the lines you were like this just isn't gonna work, huh?

1238
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:29,060
Well about 50 minutes after the show was supposed to start we decided to bail

1239
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:29,620
Yeah

1240
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:33,460
So basically we kept trying to push it kept trying to push it and I just you know

1241
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:38,540
And I had to vamp for 15 minutes on the live stream while I'm waiting for Mike to try to get connected

1242
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:42,300
You know, I have to be honest with you. I have a new I started my newfound

1243
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:47,480
appreciation for what you do for a living back when we were at the back when we were itself and it's like

1244
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:51,220
I don't think I really don't think people get it

1245
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:53,060
Like I think as as a viewer

1246
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:56,780
I think I had like a general idea of kind of what I've kind of what you did

1247
01:29:56,780 --> 01:30:00,900
But you don't really get it until you're like you're gonna sit here and talk for six hours and come up with something

1248
01:30:01,300 --> 01:30:04,780
Something to say and it actually has to be something pseudo interesting to keep people listening

1249
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:10,020
And then while you're doing all that you also have to handle the chat room and do all the auto stuff and then deal with

1250
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:15,380
People complaining and people that need you for different things. And yeah, yeah, it's fun. It's good times. Yeah, it's good times

1251
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,700
All right. Do we have a title? Everybody gotta go to JB titles calm?

1252
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:23,980
Calm. Yeah, so what do you what? What do you do Skype goes out? Well, you switch to mumble

1253
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:29,180
So this whole show was powered by mumble. It was yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's right. We nothing escaped anywhere

1254
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,220
Everything is mumble. Yeah. Yeah

1255
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:35,620
So the chair was complaining about audio a lot and hopefully it's better in the post edition, but hey

1256
01:30:35,620 --> 01:31:05,220
At least we used open source mumble for the whole thing
