1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
We are wading into a territory this episode where we're going to have a little tough love

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,380
to share about the Linux desktop.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:10,780
So I thought maybe we'd actually start by acknowledging there's a lot of places where

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,780
it's working really great.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,760
Google's in-house Linux is a great example of this.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,140
We recently covered on Linux Action News some changes that they're making.

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,160
Lots of shops like Red Hat and many, many, many others run Linux as their daily driver.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,340
So do we.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,540
So today's episode might have a little bit of tough love, but if you're feeling down,

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,780
we'll have a link in the show notes.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:38,180
You can read all about the inside story on Google's home-grown Google desktop operating

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,520
system.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,360
This is one we got to get you to try, Brent.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,720
Is it publicly available then?

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,560
No, that's why it'd be a really great episode.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Oh, yeah.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
You want me to infiltrate.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm all for it.

19
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Brent goes undercover.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:01:04,900
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,900
My name is Chris.

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,580
And my name is Brent.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,860
Hello, Brent.

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,000
It's just you and me this week.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,420
I almost said, and my name is Wes.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,660
Good to confuse everybody because Wes is out on assignment doing something awesome, I would

27
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,660
assume.

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
As always.

29
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
Yeah.

30
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,660
Whenever he's not with us, he's still doing awesome stuff.

31
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,640
Well, coming up on the show this week, is the Linux desktop hard to love?

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,980
Are there just compromises that we make on a daily basis to use it?

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,700
We'll talk about some of the tough spots there.

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,780
We'll respond to a thought provoking article that was recently posted this last week.

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,440
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks, and a lot more.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,660
So before we go any further, I'm just going to say hello to Carl.

37
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,100
Hey, Carl, in the virtual log.

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,100
Howdy.

39
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,880
We've got some folks in the quiet listening too.

40
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,960
But we're recording this early on Thursday, not our normal Sunday time.

41
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,520
And we decided that we would do this about 17 hours ago as we go live.

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,260
So we didn't have any heads up.

43
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,140
But I promised the kiddos that we were going to the beach this weekend and that it would

44
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,420
be a dad doesn't work weekend.

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,960
So we got to rearrange everything.

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
That's a big promise.

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,580
That only happens a few times a year, right?

48
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,580
I know.

49
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,880
They've been asking for weeks, giving me the full on dad guilt trip every Sunday morning.

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,180
So I figured, you know, I'd have to give eventually.

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,580
So that's what we're doing this week.

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,160
So we're here.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,300
We're doing it on a Thursday.

54
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,820
But I still want to say a big good morning to tail scale.

55
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,140
You know, tail scale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

56
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,760
It's one of the best VPNs in the game.

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,660
You can get set up in minutes on just about any device, mobile device, arm device, arch

58
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,140
box, red hat box, get it for free for up to 20 devices when you go to tailscale.com.

59
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,920
We love tail scale.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,560
So yeah, we are on a Thursday.

61
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,900
So we're a little out of sorts.

62
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,900
But we did want to remind you we have the London meetup just days away as this episode

63
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,780
goes live.

64
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,740
Keep an eye on that meetup page.

65
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,460
As the time gets closer and closer, you never know what could happen.

66
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,820
Brent's down there at operation center one, you'll be one of the first people you'll be

67
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,300
reporting on the scene remotely today.

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,420
We check in on the London meetup to make sure it's actually still happening.

69
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,080
All reports are London meetup is still go green light, green light.

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,180
Thank you, Brent.

71
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,780
Keep us informed and stay safe.

72
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,620
Back to you, Chris.

73
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,860
And the West Coast meetups are getting serious, seriously serious.

74
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,860
I got my wife Adia now in the West Coast crew chat room.

75
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,060
She's chatting with people about locations.

76
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,380
If you are on the West Coast, check out meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

77
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,240
We got a bunch of meetups coming up and we got a chat room in there where maybe some

78
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,980
pictures of Levi got posted.

79
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,700
Oh, those are worth seeing.

80
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,900
I think we're actually considering doing one of the meetups at a dog park so people can

81
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,400
bring dog goes if they want.

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,620
That is a great idea.

83
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,020
Yeah, not just dogs, but humans, too, can go, but you don't require a dog to be there.

84
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
You can.

85
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
You can.

86
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,980
Levi's a community dog, you know, I don't own that dog.

87
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,340
That dog just lives with me and he'll hang out with whoever he wants to hang out with.

88
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
You know it.

89
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
I do.

90
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,140
I was just I was just picturing drone chasing at some recent events that we were at a couple

91
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
of years ago.

92
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,700
We were at Linux Fest Northwest and we were doing a big barbecue.

93
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,940
I mean, no exaggeration, hundreds of people were at this barbecue we were doing.

94
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,220
Yeah, lots of brats.

95
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,660
Yeah, lots of brats at the front of the line.

96
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,340
And we had a couple of folks there.

97
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,540
Jeff was probably one of them with racing drones.

98
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,380
And Levi successfully managed to leap up in the air and pluck a drone out of the sky.

99
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,820
And then he ran around very proud.

100
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,140
And I had just the luck of timing.

101
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,420
I had the first person goggles on when he did it.

102
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,580
So I got to see from Levi's perspective is and he had the camera pretty well placed,

103
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
right?

104
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
So I could see where he was going.

105
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
It was hilarious.

106
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,580
So he does make a meetup a little bit more fun.

107
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,860
And then lastly, we're putting the word out.

108
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,580
We'd like your ideas for the best used or cheap, super cheap Linux PC build.

109
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,900
So something pre-built could be used or something from like PC part picker or whatever that

110
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
you put together.

111
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:24,320
And I'm thinking like sub $300 would be great, but with a couple of requirements, it needs

112
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,860
to be good enough for most day to day casual work, you know, web browsing, office work,

113
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,000
that kind of stuff.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,420
And ideally, it could be a computer that lasts a couple of years.

115
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,400
So send us your PC part picker links or eBay links or whatever you might have out there.

116
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,980
And if we get a really interesting build idea for like a really cheap usable Linux PC, I

117
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,860
might pick one up and give it a review here on the show or build it, whatever it is.

118
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,860
If there's a good one, if there's an interesting one that seems like it could have a practical

119
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,720
use, I think I'd like to come up with like if you're looking for a $300 ish PC to run

120
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,260
desktop Linux.

121
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
Go look at this, right?

122
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,480
I just want something we could recommend to people that we can vouch for.

123
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,500
So I'd love to get your ideas.

124
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,620
You can boost them in or go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

125
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,780
I'm wondering, Brent, if you have any suggestions just off the top because you kind of can live

126
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,700
in this area sometimes for weeks, years.

127
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,840
It feels like my normal lifestyle.

128
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
Your comfort zone.

129
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,380
What are you hoping to get out of it?

130
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,980
Like how long will you use it for the review?

131
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,600
Is there some other purpose that might be a long term thing, you know?

132
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,380
Can you set some more boundaries for us?

133
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,980
Well, after we're done, I'd like to give it away for somebody to use as their Linux PC.

134
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,280
But I kind of want to be able to say, hey, if you're on a tight budget and you're looking

135
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,760
for a desktop computer, we recommend this.

136
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,940
Here's an episode where we talked about it, that kind of thing.

137
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,820
I'm just looking for something to just sort of, I guess, help us get an idea of what is

138
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,900
acceptable performance at what price point when you're looking at the Linux desktop.

139
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Where is that right now?

140
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,380
What are you getting for around $300?

141
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,380
What can you get?

142
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,300
Do you remember back in the day, some of the netbooks were that recommendation?

143
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,160
I mean, I don't think they are anymore, considering no one makes them, et cetera, et cetera.

144
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,400
You know, for years and years, you've seen me with this computer.

145
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,880
I used the ThinkPad X220.

146
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,120
It's mildly portable, but that would be my temptation.

147
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:26,580
You can go to eBay and find lots and lots and lots of variously configured X220s that

148
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,620
are still, some of them, in very good shape.

149
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,060
They were, I think, leased quite a lot to large businesses, and so there are just hordes

150
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
of these things.

151
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,780
And they're a great computer.

152
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,340
It's one of my favorite keyboards of all time, actually.

153
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,900
These days, whenever I'm using a laptop, I always wish I had that keyboard.

154
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,740
And the thing's not too bad in terms of performance.

155
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,340
You can squeeze in 16 gigs of RAM in that thing.

156
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,220
It's not officially supported, but I've done it for years, and it works perfectly fine.

157
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,280
You're not gonna get away with lots of processing power, but for doing some, you know, light

158
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,080
browsing, you can't have 28 tabs open or 100 like I used to.

159
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,260
But I think a few tens of tabs, you'd be fine.

160
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,460
The other nice thing is if you're a slight tinkerer, you can get parts for this thing.

161
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
Like, crazy.

162
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,980
Some people even put, like, modern motherboards in some of the X220 and X230 chassis, if that's

163
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,940
your kind of crazy thing.

164
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,180
That may run the cost up a little bit, but I think you could get some of these for as

165
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,660
low as, like, $75 if you already have a hard drive to throw in it, and SSD all the way.

166
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,260
That's an interesting idea, right?

167
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:43,380
Get like a $75, $100 ThinkPad, and then replace the disk, replace the RAM, maybe even replace

168
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,380
the screen.

169
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,780
I don't know how far you could take that and how much time people would want to dedicate

170
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
to it.

171
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:54,660
I will say the screen on that laptop is fairly easily replaceable, but I have an X250 beside

172
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,140
me here, which is probably a little bit more than you're like, but these days it might

173
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,560
be around the $300 mark, actually, that you might be able to find used.

174
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,900
And Alex and I bought a screen for this thing because I, as a photographer, wanted an IPS,

175
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,560
and I think it was like $100 at the time, a few years ago.

176
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,180
And the replacement was the easiest thing I've ever done on a laptop.

177
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,740
It was like, take the bezel off, just kind of clip it off, throw the screen in there,

178
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
and then put it back on.

179
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,740
And you're done.

180
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,020
I think gaming's probably obviously eliminated in this area.

181
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
Yeah.

182
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,660
No, no, there are plenty of games like Pong will play just fine.

183
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,180
And okay, all right.

184
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
Maybe Race the Sun.

185
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,100
I'm trying to think now, I think I may have played Portal at the time on that laptop.

186
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Really?

187
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,020
I believe that I may be mistaken.

188
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,940
So don't take that 100% accurate, but perhaps.

189
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,100
I think the X220, and there's probably other ThinkPads out there, I think that's probably

190
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,180
going to be the number one recommendation as a ThinkPad.

191
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,940
And I'm not opposed to that at all.

192
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,460
If somebody has like a specific recommendation, that would be my preference.

193
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,860
I was picturing when I was talking about this, either something that would be built or rebuilt,

194
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,660
or something that'd be like all parts, and then you assemble it yourself.

195
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,260
I feel like that's the only two ways.

196
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,420
It's either going to be something like a laptop or a used desktop.

197
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,780
One of the things, because I was checking around before I put the links in the notes

198
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,580
and stuff, and I saw a couple of batches of Dell Optiplex type desktops that were like

199
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,780
a corporate deal that they were getting rid of, and they had like 45 of them.

200
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,980
You buy the whole lot or what?

201
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,100
No, no, no.

202
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,820
But I thought, okay, they were like 280 bucks, and they had an i5 in them, and they had eight

203
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,740
gigs of RAM, and they had a spinning rest drive, but I thought, you know, for under

204
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,060
300 bucks shipped, that's not a bad deal.

205
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,620
So it depends on like when you're buying, too.

206
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,380
If you buy at the right time, when a company is in the process of offloading, you can get

207
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,680
a good deal.

208
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,220
And when they're that cheap, too, it's like in a business, sometimes it's nice to buy

209
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,220
a couple of extra spare parts, and then you have a couple of spare rigs for either Frankensteining

210
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,220
parts out of, or just full-on swapping when you need to.

211
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,820
The more you talk, the more questions I have for you, Chris.

212
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,060
I take it power's not an important thing?

213
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Not for this one.

214
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,380
I could see doing a power-specific build, most performance for the watts kind of thing.

215
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,540
But no, on this one, I'm thinking just price and longevity.

216
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,820
Oh, longevity.

217
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
That's a good one.

218
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Okay.

219
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Right.

220
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,400
Because if you're budget-conscious and you're getting a machine now, you're probably not

221
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,100
going to be in a position to replace it in a year, maybe even two.

222
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
You're talking lightning nodes, right?

223
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,060
Isn't that what we're getting to?

224
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,780
I'm curious, like how come you didn't mention the Pi yet?

225
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,740
It seems like it might fit in that world a little bit, but yeah.

226
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,220
Yeah, I think that's a good thing to clarify.

227
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:54,740
I feel like the Raspberry Pi is just on the other side of unusable, like as a desktop,

228
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,020
your only desktop, your main machine, I don't think it's fast enough.

229
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,500
Not even with like a SSD USB drive, I just don't think it's fast enough yet.

230
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,460
And not for years either, you know, two, three years.

231
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,940
Maybe the Pi 5, maybe with different storage, eMMC or something like that.

232
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,860
And you know, depending on who's getting this, x86 has a big compatibility factor.

233
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
That's very true.

234
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,220
And it's something I don't always think about.

235
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,180
So I think x86 for this experiment, although I could see doing a separate one for ARM as

236
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,180
well.

237
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,020
Now will whichever computer this is mysteriously get filled with JB stickers?

238
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
Maybe.

239
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
That'd be fun.

240
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
That'd be fun.

241
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,300
Let me throw a few on there.

242
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
We got some old ones here.

243
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
All right.

244
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
You know, throw a bunch of those on there.

245
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Yeah.

246
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
All right.

247
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
So send us your suggestions.

248
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,660
linuxunplugged.com slash contact or you can boost in a link or a suggestion.

249
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,380
We'd love to know what you think might be good enough for day to day desktop Linux on

250
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,940
a budget.

251
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,380
linode.com slash unplugged friends.

252
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,460
Linode is where it's at, man.

253
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,540
That's where we've been hosting everything for the last couple of years.

254
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,620
And Linode is a great combination of performance, price, support, industry, adoption.

255
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,460
I mean, really, this is a great combination of all the things.

256
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,260
I wouldn't really host anywhere else, to be honest with you.

257
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,060
I mean, why would you host anywhere else?

258
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
It's crazy.

259
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
It's crazy out there.

260
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,260
You look at these crazy hypervisors that are creating these specific esoteric technology

261
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,140
stacks that they just want to lock you into and they have their own verbiage and their

262
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,420
own training materials just to learn that one platform's way of doing things.

263
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Who does that serve?

264
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,620
It doesn't serve you and it doesn't serve your business.

265
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,340
Linode has been in this for nearly 19 years and their mission has remained unchanged.

266
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,620
They just try to make cloud computing accessible and affordable to just about anyone.

267
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,340
So when you go to linode.com slash unplugged, you get $100.

268
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,040
That's $100 you can try things with, really kick the tires and see what it's capable of.

269
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,820
And if you're listening to this while we're recording and you're down in the LAX area

270
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,460
at scale, Linode is at booth 211.

271
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
That's right.

272
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,740
Jay the Linux guy and Gardner Bryant are there too.

273
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,260
You can go say hello to the Linode crew at booth 211 at scale.

274
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,940
If you're at scale right now though, I got a little bit of FOMO.

275
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,940
I got a little bit of FOMO if you're down there.

276
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,940
Go say hi.

277
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,940
Go say, Chris says hi.

278
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
You agree?

279
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,620
A little bit of FOMO for not being at scale right now?

280
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Oh yeah.

281
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,540
I have never been.

282
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,180
And I feel like that's a shocker.

283
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,380
We need to make that happen maybe next year.

284
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,260
The only thing better than going to scale is getting a hundred bucks.

285
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,900
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100, support the show and go try it out.

286
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,420
They're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there that want to lock you into their

287
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,420
crazy platforms.

288
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,740
They got the best support, 11 data centers around the world.

289
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
They're great.

290
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Try them out.

291
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,900
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

292
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:04,100
Well this week we're looking at an article that I think, um, gets our ponderings happening

293
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,220
quite a lot.

294
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,860
The author calls themselves TDARB or Brad Taunt for the normals.

295
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,060
He describes himself as a user experience designer with over 12 years of professional

296
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:25,060
experience with a strong emphasis on creating intuitive interfaces with a focus on accessibility,

297
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,620
performance and minimalism.

298
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,700
And I also noticed Chris, he does mention the Ottawa senators in his bio.

299
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,420
So that gets my Ottawa Canadians kind of.

300
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Interesting.

301
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
I did not notice that.

302
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,420
Mm hmm.

303
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Comradery going on there.

304
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:45,180
So I've, I already, um, have a big heart for TDARB and the title of the post that we're

305
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,820
looking at, the Linux desktop is hard to love.

306
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,820
This one hits a little close to home, you know, just right there in the title.

307
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,720
It's a hard desktop to love.

308
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,020
It implies that takes a little bit of work to be in this relationship with the Linux

309
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,700
desktop, right?

310
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,420
It's just kind of, uh, I can't completely disagree because behind the scenes, I know

311
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,420
and we talked a little bit on the show, I think you've been having some strugs with

312
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,580
your high resolution monitor settings and stuff like that.

313
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,580
You're kind of, you're getting that experience that I've had where you've got a couple of

314
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,480
monitors hooked up to a desktop rig with an NVIDIA card and it's just a crap shoot when

315
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,900
you wake that thing up from sleep.

316
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Yeah.

317
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,160
You know, I think one advantage that I have running these ancient, well supported machines

318
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,460
is that I never run into some of this hardware stuff, right?

319
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,640
And so now, um, I have the great fortune of using a computer that has all sorts of different

320
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,500
types of stuff connected to it.

321
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,420
And, uh, it turns out that's kind of problematic and I, you're right.

322
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,940
It has been an eye opener for me because I thought we were further along than this in

323
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,220
a sense and that really makes me a little bit sad actually.

324
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:58,340
So it feels challenging and that title, man, did that ever cause me to pause and reflect

325
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:05,580
a little bit and, uh, I think come to some sobering reality perhaps.

326
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,420
So the author starts with what Linux gets right.

327
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:14,180
Complete user control, the ability to drastically change your desktop UI between GNOME and KDE

328
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,300
and XSE and all the others.

329
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:22,380
Overall, pretty welcoming communities, especially in the right areas and generally pretty good

330
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,020
documentation really, especially if you're sticking to your Ubuntu's and your Fedora's

331
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,980
and stuff like that.

332
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:36,220
And the author adds, quote, these things make Linux a solid experience overall, but not,

333
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,220
not a great one.

334
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,060
Like that stuff, he says, doesn't make up for the rough edges where, where it falls

335
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,300
down a little bit.

336
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,460
As for what it gets wrong, I think that's exactly what we want to chew on today.

337
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,240
Um, it seems like there's a little bit more than we might want to admit to.

338
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,740
So he starts with the overall OS cohesion.

339
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,220
He describes it as Linux lacking a consistency throughout the entire design.

340
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,580
And I think Chris, you might agree that sort of makes sense considering all of the choices.

341
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,660
Like if you have all these choices for which desktop UI you're going to choose, um, I think

342
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,620
that, uh, presents a cohesion challenge, uh, wouldn't you agree?

343
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,940
Yeah, I think so.

344
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,420
Um, especially when you look at things like you've got electron and you've got GTK and

345
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,540
you've got Qt and you've got all these other things, but this is a problem that isn't unique

346
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
to Linux.

347
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:30,180
I think it started in a worse spot on Linux, but I think all of the other OS's Mac and

348
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,060
windows specifically, I think they have been drifting towards this for a decade.

349
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,760
And I think it's getting pretty hodgepodge everywhere.

350
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,860
Can you like give an example?

351
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,620
I haven't been on those other two platforms in quite a while, so I'm curious what you've

352
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,620
seen recently.

353
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,540
Well, Slack, for example, Slack doesn't look like any native toolkit on any desktop, windows,

354
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,540
Mac or Linux.

355
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,540
Right?

356
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
That's true.

357
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
And Slack is used by millions of people, right?

358
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,540
Same with discord, telegram, none of them use the native control elements of the platform.

359
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,940
And yet there you'll find them on all of the VS code is another great example, right?

360
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
Super popular.

361
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,620
It's even kind of crazy, especially in the VS code example, like they have a native desktop

362
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,140
that they could sort of aim for, but no.

363
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
Yeah.

364
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,940
These are things that I complained about for years on Coder Radio.

365
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,260
It just come just groused and groused and groused.

366
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,540
And here we are now, nothing ever changed, it seems, but that's curious to me because,

367
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,020
you know, you're describing a particular applications, but I think with on the Linux side here, we're

368
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,860
talking about the whole, the whole operating system really, and that feels a little bit

369
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,860
more problematic.

370
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Yeah.

371
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,440
I do think it is a little bit deeper on Linux because you'll even notice this if you use

372
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,800
FreeBSD for a little bit, FreeBSD, even at the command line feels more cohesive.

373
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,880
It feels like the tools because they are, are all made by the same people in the same

374
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
team.

375
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,160
And you get a little bit more cohesion from the bottom all the way up.

376
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Linux lacks that.

377
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,820
When you live every day in a complete GTK or cute environment, when you drop to the

378
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:06,100
command line, those different free software apps are made by different individuals with

379
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,740
different design choices and different philosophies on how to build applications and different

380
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,620
things that they think are important to document and different flags and different ways of

381
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,860
implementing those flags.

382
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:23,500
And all of that stuff is kind of inconsistent in Linux, but feels more, in my opinion, more

383
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,760
organic, more like real life, like that's how things are in the real world too.

384
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,800
You interface with lots of vendors, different products, everything's a little bit different.

385
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,180
Every surface has a different texture, everything has a different sound, right?

386
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,580
That kind of fragmentation is just sort of organic in the evolved world.

387
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,980
You know, he also continues making a point about distro packages and snaps and flat packs

388
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:51,260
and all the various options there and how from a user perspective, it's just not as

389
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,940
smooth as it might be on something like the Mac, for instance.

390
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,780
Yeah, he says it's kind of overwhelming for the average computer user.

391
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,380
You know what, Brent?

392
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:07,160
I am surprised that the multiple package format debate has become something that normal folks

393
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,020
that are looking at Linux from the outside have attached to.

394
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,320
I didn't think it would register.

395
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,580
It just seemed like an internal debate, but at the end of the day, your software gets

396
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,420
installed and however your software manager is doing that is just an implementation detail.

397
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,780
And I didn't expect it to be something that surfaced up to people who are evaluating Linux

398
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,820
from the outside, but yet we see it come up over and over and freaking over again.

399
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,340
I am personally exhausted by the package manager and package debate and all of that.

400
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,940
I am exhausted by it.

401
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,500
And yet if you go on YouTube right now and you search for like Linux package manager,

402
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,500
there's probably a couple hundred videos that were made in the last couple of months about

403
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
the topic, right?

404
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,940
It's brought up right here in this blog post, there's too many formats, but I don't believe

405
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,940
it.

406
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,460
I just can't because nobody complains that there's too many different shift knobs from

407
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,060
all the different car manufacturers.

408
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,740
Nobody complains that there's too many gas station brands.

409
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,020
At the end of the day, you're still getting gas in your car, you're still shifting.

410
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:13,260
What does it matter as an end user if it was a Snap, a Flatpak, or a Deb, or an RPM?

411
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,900
It has some ramifications, but it honestly just seems like something that only the computer

412
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,860
gigs would care about, but I don't know, maybe that's the type of person who's evaluating

413
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,860
Linux right now.

414
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,860
So perhaps it is an issue.

415
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:30,020
I think one of the things about these modern package management ideas in Flatpak, Snaps,

416
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,860
et cetera, is it kind of early days for them.

417
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,340
It's only very recently that it feels like something like Flatpaks have been stable enough

418
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:45,260
to be the main way to deliver software to a distribution, and we visited that just last

419
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,940
week with Silverblue, and you said you had mostly a really great and smooth experience,

420
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,020
so I wonder if a lot of that user's latching on to the various package methods is just

421
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,340
born out of that transition?

422
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,020
Yeah, it's a problem for today, but one that it feels like there's just no way this isn't

423
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,900
solved in 10 years, but who knows?

424
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Who knows?

425
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,620
But from a new user's perspective, I just don't quite buy it yet that it's a big problem.

426
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,800
Assuming they're using graphical tools, all that is sort of not even obvious to them what's

427
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,420
happening in the backend, unless you're really paying attention.

428
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,220
There's another area in here that he gets to, kind of touches on cohesion, kind of touches

429
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,260
on UI design, and I think it really is a symptom of fragmented desktop environments.

430
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:39,660
He criticizes both Bluetooth, Bluetooth setup, printing, adding printers, managing printers.

431
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,980
He's like, it's bad still.

432
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,740
It's really bad.

433
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,100
Not in my opinion so bad if you stick with Plasma or GNOME.

434
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,940
They manage this stuff pretty well, but I'm curious what you think.

435
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,700
What's your impressions of adding things like printers or Bluetooth devices to a Linux device?

436
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,740
Has this been a big problem recently for you?

437
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,780
Well, I'd say as far as Bluetooth devices go, I have not had any very Linux-specific

438
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
issues.

439
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,820
Linux itself has its whole host of issues that I don't think we'll touch on today.

440
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,580
But that for me, in my personal experience, has been fairly smooth, and I'd be curious

441
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,340
to hear your experience, Chris.

442
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,860
Yeah, I mean, mostly I kind of have phased a lot of Bluetooth out because it was kind

443
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,740
of crappy for years, and I just sort of over the years just said, all right, I'll either

444
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,900
go wired or RF.

445
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,420
But I asked Wes because he works all day with Bluetooth headphones.

446
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,780
He does meetings, he listens to music, he streams podcasts from his Linux desktop.

447
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,420
I think he got like some of those well-known Sony noise-canceling earbuds.

448
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,700
So I asked him before he left for a special assignment, and he said that he does think

449
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,620
it used to be a bigger issue, and that really, Apple deserves credit here for having Bluetooth

450
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,260
pretty much figured out on their own devices, so that kind of adds pressure.

451
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,300
Like they set the goalposts there.

452
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,580
But over the years, things have gotten better, and then when you combine the underlying Bluetooth

453
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,140
improvements with PipeWire, Wes says that he feels like things have gotten significantly

454
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
better.

455
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,500
He's improved a lot.

456
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,880
There's some trade-offs.

457
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,660
The Mac experience is absolutely good, but honestly, the Linux experience has gotten

458
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,980
great and it gives you more control.

459
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,620
He also likes the fact that he has the option to mess with codecs and such, so he can kind

460
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,860
of dial in how it sounds in his headphones, which he can't do on the Mac side.

461
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,580
That's actually kind of nice.

462
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,140
You did ask me as well about printers, and I got to say it's the total opposite story

463
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
there for me.

464
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,300
I have successfully installed many printers on family and friends and my own systems,

465
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,100
and it never has been a smooth process.

466
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Not once.

467
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:42,660
It always involved deep diving into ancient blog posts that hint at possible solutions,

468
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:49,320
or for instance, Brother printers have pretty great support, except you need an application

469
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:56,100
from them, which is a terminal command line-based tool that works sometimes, most of the time,

470
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,220
but it's like an 80% kind of thing and they can be super finicky.

471
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,180
So I kind of cringe every time I need to install a printer, to be honest, and I try to get

472
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,700
away from it for that very reason.

473
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,900
So I could feel, as someone in an office situation, that might be a totally different story.

474
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,800
It's fair to say, if you buy your printer with Linux compatibility in mind, you shop

475
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,140
with Linux compatibility in mind, when you get it home and plug it in, it's going to

476
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
be fine.

477
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
It's going to just work.

478
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,980
Even if it's a network printer, he specifically criticizes network printers.

479
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,100
If it's a Linux compatible printer, i.e. there's a driver for it and all that stuff, it's going

480
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
to be just fine.

481
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,220
For years now, I've just auto-detected my wife's desk jet that she bought, what I need

482
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,420
to print occasionally, and I just, at that point, I open up a print wizard and it just

483
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,020
auto-detects the printer and I add it to my system and I print, and it's been as bad as

484
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,940
simple as it gets for a long time.

485
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,680
You got to buy for compatibility.

486
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,220
You got to buy for compatibility, just like you do with the Mac.

487
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,740
You got to buy for compatibility with the Mac too.

488
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,860
It's no, I mean, maybe there's more options, but not really, not when it comes to printers.

489
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,580
And so, is it a compromise?

490
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,160
Yeah, I think this is where he's got us a little bit.

491
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
It is a compromise.

492
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Same with scanners.

493
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,000
I'd be buying for compatibility.

494
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,380
You know, again, is that a compromise?

495
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,920
Sure, but it's one I'm willing to make to have a computing environment that works the

496
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
way I need it to.

497
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,700
Just like if I was a Mac user, I'd be willing to buy a Mac compatible printer.

498
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,140
A lot of people in our community and people who just need to get things done have recently,

499
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,820
especially with the M1 stuff, moved to Macs full time.

500
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,780
And I know you've been playing with one recently.

501
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,300
Is it the same experience these days as it used to be?

502
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,780
Like are you feeling like, like printing, for instance, there's cups under the hood

503
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,980
on both systems, but does the Mac just do something that's a little bit better for instance?

504
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
I don't know.

505
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,980
I can't really speak to that.

506
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,180
I haven't used a lot in those situations, but it feels about the same.

507
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
You know, you need to print.

508
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
Oh, okay.

509
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
Well, I don't have a printer at it yet.

510
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,460
I don't have a printer at it right now.

511
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,380
And you go through a wizard and auto detects the dang thing and then you're done.

512
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,740
It's like almost the exact same process.

513
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,580
It's just a matter of if, is there a driver?

514
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,460
I think where the Mac, maybe, although this is just me guessing has a leg up is there's

515
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,460
probably more vendor direct software that you can install on your machine, but I hate

516
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
all that stuff.

517
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,460
That stuff's all garbage.

518
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,460
So.

519
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,180
I mean, that touches on, you know, one advantage that the Mac has, which is a dedicated set

520
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,700
of hardware.

521
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,700
When you think of Linux and how many pieces of hardware Linux desktop supports, it's actually

522
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,540
quite a feat of engineering if you think about, you know, those ancient devices that I was

523
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,760
talking about earlier, the X220s, et cetera, right up to the modern, modern stuff we're

524
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
buying these days.

525
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,020
And it's even more impressive when you think about ARM and RISC and PowerPC and just all

526
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,380
the architectures that Linux supports as well.

527
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,380
It's even more impressive.

528
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,780
I think it's important to pause there and to really extend gratitude for that.

529
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,540
It's sort of an amazing feat of engineering when you really, really think about it.

530
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,220
And Mac OS falls apart real quick on a Hackintosh.

531
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Non Mac hardware.

532
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,900
I did that for about a week one time.

533
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,140
I don't know how long you lasted.

534
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,060
Well, I had to do it for a couple of years for at least a year, you know, for a while

535
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,620
back back in the battle days of live streaming years ago, years and years ago.

536
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,540
You know, it's just so taped together.

537
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:15,980
It's so built on a whole like card of house assumptions, Mac OS, it's a good OS until

538
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,140
it's outside its comfort zone and then it just falls apart.

539
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,820
The thing is, is that's not something most users ever really have to experience.

540
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:30,260
And Linux does such a remarkable job considering the range of hardware it supports and the

541
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
drivers that it has to be able to support.

542
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,780
You know, he's right in the sense that you're going to get 100 percent hardware compatibility

543
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,180
when you get a Mac or if you get a Surface with Windows.

544
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,940
But I actually feel like we're doing pretty good as far as Linux first hardware choices

545
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
go these days.

546
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,980
Feels like 2022 is a better year than it ever has been.

547
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,660
Yeah, I certainly, certainly agree there.

548
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,580
It feels like it's almost hard to choose these days.

549
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,220
And I think we have a little bit of feedback coming up in that regard.

550
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:06,580
One thing I'm noting that is lacking from this conversation, both his article and our

551
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,020
conversation here is nobody's mentioned Windows anywhere in this.

552
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,620
That seems like a data point to me.

553
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,440
I think in part it's because he's looking at it from an enthusiast standpoint who's

554
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,540
probably moved on from Windows, maybe, I don't really know.

555
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,620
Could be that, you know, that developer market, they tend to either buy Linux or Macs unless

556
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,060
their work requires them to use Windows.

557
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,380
There is that aspect of it.

558
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,380
Maybe you're right.

559
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,060
Maybe, maybe Windows gets some of these things better.

560
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,440
My sense is that not really, though, sort of the same struggles, maybe a wider range

561
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,060
of printers that are just going to work.

562
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,700
But also you're going to have a wider range of crap software that gets installed.

563
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,020
It's like the worst of all worlds, perhaps.

564
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,260
You know, Chris, one reason I was on the Mac for like, I don't know, five years or something.

565
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,080
Now this is slightly outdated information.

566
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,920
But one of the reasons I did move away from it was I always felt as though I was running

567
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:04,180
up against that wall of what the Apple folks expect you to be doing with your computer

568
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,300
versus what you actually want to be doing.

569
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,700
And it seems totally fine if you stay within that realm of, hey, here's what we think you

570
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
should be doing.

571
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,100
And we've really thought out the design of how that flow works.

572
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,740
But as soon as you try to do something a little different or start tinkering or something,

573
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,740
I feel like it's a real struggle.

574
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,220
Or at least the system gets a little bit in your way.

575
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
Maybe it's different these days.

576
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,660
I mean, some developers love the Mac, and I acknowledge that my information here is

577
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
quite outdated.

578
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,180
I'd be curious to dive back in and give it a shot for a little bit.

579
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,020
But has that been your experience recently?

580
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,340
Yeah, I feel like that characterization is mostly accurate.

581
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,940
It's a sandbox, and you're expected to play within that sandbox.

582
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:52,940
And my conspiracy bacon is it's going to get even worse, not better.

583
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,480
Because if you look at where Apple's going with the Apple Silicon, they're really building

584
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:06,820
in a lot of purpose-specific co-processors, things that are physical chips on their SOC

585
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,100
that do one thing.

586
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:14,000
And they do that one thing really, really fast to offload it off of the general CPU.

587
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,520
And it requires a whole set of software stack support and all that kind of stuff.

588
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,820
So it's kind of something that Apple can be uniquely good at, is they can ship a new co-processor

589
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:28,040
in an SOC, and at the same time, they can ship an update to the OS that enables support

590
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,980
for that SOC.

591
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,640
And it's neat, and there's going to obviously be advantages.

592
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,620
But what it also does is it boxes you in.

593
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,420
It means that when you go outside of one of those specific co-processors, you're just

594
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,720
going to be on the general CPU.

595
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,720
And in a way, that's going to also kind of create this environment of, well, the Mac

596
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,380
is really good at some things, but there's other things where the Mac kind of lags behind

597
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,520
at and it's not so good at.

598
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,620
And we're going to see that kind of shake out over the next couple of years.

599
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,660
But I think that will add to the sort of sandbox feeling of the Mac platform, where over on

600
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,940
the x86 side, you're going to absolutely get co-processors, and you're going to get things

601
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,940
like that.

602
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,820
But it won't have that sandbox feeling.

603
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,900
You can take advantage of it, or you can't.

604
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
You don't.

605
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,740
There's lots of ways you can solve that problem on the PC platform.

606
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,500
And do you think that's the cost of rapid evolution and innovation?

607
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,740
Is this kind of narrow view, narrow perspective, and sort of ignoring all this other stuff

608
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
for now?

609
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,380
Yeah, I think, too, it's probably just an area where they can compete where other manufacturers

610
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
can't, really.

611
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:37,220
Intel could add a co-processor for ProRes decoding or H.264 accelerated decoding.

612
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,020
But how many applications would get updated to support it?

613
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
One or two?

614
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
Right?

615
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
Maybe.

616
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
Maybe.

617
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,460
But on the Apple side, they could update the entire stack.

618
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,100
The flip side of that is they own that entire stack.

619
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,860
If they don't make the app, or they don't add the feature you want, you don't get it.

620
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,900
And there's nobody in the market that can create it.

621
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,940
It's just the way it is.

622
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,360
I think after reading this article and really pondering the facts, I think the big question

623
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,460
that comes to me, and I'm curious about what you think, is what do we do about it?

624
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
What's the next step?

625
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,100
What are we hoping?

626
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,300
Do we want this to change?

627
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,860
Is this just the way it is?

628
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,100
Is there something we can do to help things out?

629
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
What do we want from it?

630
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,220
I've been trying to think about that, too, and I know one thing, obviously, that we can

631
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,540
do as users is we can file bug reports, and we can get involved in the conversation, and

632
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,700
we can say, hey, this is my hardware stack, and this is the problem I'm running into.

633
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,340
So we can absolutely do a lot more of that.

634
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,340
But I also think over time in Linux, it's been so amazing as these problems have gotten

635
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,340
solved.

636
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:44,300
We're about a year away from all of the issues you're having right now with your Nvidia card

637
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,420
from probably being solved, right?

638
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:52,540
I think a big part of it is you're dealing with a really cranky driver stack there.

639
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,300
If you had maybe all Intel graphics or all AMD graphics in that PC, you probably wouldn't

640
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,560
be having these multi-monitor refresh rate issues that you're having with those weird

641
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,740
artifacts and whatnot.

642
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,060
And in a year or so, the Nvidia driver will be open source, and I have seen a lot of remarkable

643
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,780
things happen in desktop Linux, you know?

644
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,300
Wi-Fi was a huge thing.

645
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,620
When we got Wi-Fi sorted out, that was a game changer.

646
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:23,900
That used to be such a pain, like an incredible pain, and a showstopper for some.

647
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,260
And when we got that solved, it felt like, wow, we've really reached a milestone here.

648
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
This is big, right?

649
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,500
But I remember when we found out that the Nvidia driver was going to get open sourced

650
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,320
and it was coming and it was going to be about a year's worth of work, I remember thinking

651
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,220
right then and there, like, this is like the last really big desktop problem that remains

652
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,540
to be solved.

653
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,980
Because once you solve this, a lot of the little issues that you're experiencing and

654
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,340
other people are experiencing just start to go away.

655
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,780
It'll take a little bit of time, but we're so close.

656
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,860
And so ultimately, you know, you look at it and you think, maybe the kernel team strategy

657
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,060
has been rock solid all along.

658
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:08,100
You know, they just held the course, they didn't compromise, and the end result is we're

659
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
going to get open source drivers.

660
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,940
And you look out there and I think, really, the last thing standing that would really

661
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,420
make this one whole suite package would be ZFS.

662
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,020
It's so true.

663
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
It's so true.

664
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,020
Yeah.

665
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,340
The author didn't even touch on file systems, right?

666
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,420
No, but man, that's a whole other bag of tricks.

667
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Yeah, yeah.

668
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
It'd be great to see.

669
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,140
And maybe one day, you know, I mean, if we're seeing Nvidia doing about face, maybe Oracle

670
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,180
could do it.

671
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,500
Is this a new, like, mid-year prediction?

672
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,540
Is that what's coming out?

673
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,600
It's a summer prediction, Brent.

674
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,980
It's a summer prediction indeed.

675
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,540
Get it in and lock it in right now.

676
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,900
I'll link to the article.

677
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,940
I think it is worth a read.

678
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,100
It's worth considering this stuff as Linux users, especially those of us who go on the

679
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,820
air and say, yeah, you should do this Linux thing.

680
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,340
It's great.

681
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,300
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

682
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,140
Go get started with a free trial for yourself, for your team, or your enterprise at Bitwarden.com

683
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,620
slash Linux.

684
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:10,120
This is the easiest way for you or a business to store sensitive data and sync it securely.

685
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,400
This is a great tool.

686
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,220
And of course, Bitwarden is open source.

687
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,060
It's trusted by millions of individuals, teams, and organizations out there for any kind of

688
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,340
sensitive data, like your passwords.

689
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:25,420
It's a great way to get started for onboarding employees or getting started on an open source

690
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,420
team.

691
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,740
Like here at JB, you get on board, you get access to Bitwarden.

692
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,040
I love the features they've been adding too.

693
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,380
In just the last couple of months, my Bitwarden has gotten better and better.

694
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,500
The username generator is fantastic.

695
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,740
I don't know how I never thought of this, but it's just absolutely brilliant.

696
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,100
Why not have a unique password and username for every site and service you use?

697
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,640
And their mobile app is really great.

698
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,140
On iOS, the face ID integration is just fantastic.

699
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,620
If I want to get on a website or log into an app, it just like scans my face I'm in.

700
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,740
On Android, they've got quick account switching right there at the keyboard where you're entering

701
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
the password.

702
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,980
They support all the bio authentication over there as well.

703
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,060
And there is a large community always available to help if you ever get stuck, plus they've

704
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,080
got support as well.

705
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,640
And then there's a lot of other nice features baked in.

706
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,420
As you start using Bitwarden, that you discover and you think, what was I doing before this?

707
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
What was I doing?

708
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,980
An animal, that's what I was doing.

709
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,120
And you probably know somebody out there who's not using Bitwarden.

710
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,580
Maybe it's your team or your company, maybe it's the project you're working with.

711
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,180
They could probably use a little Bitwarden, you know what I'm saying, a little upgrade

712
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
to their security.

713
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,220
Go try Bitwarden right now at bitwarden.com slash Linux or send that link to a friend,

714
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,180
a family member or someone at work that needs to do this.

715
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,740
It's probably like the number one thing you could do online to increase your security

716
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,820
is use a really great password, use a unique username for every website, every service

717
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,320
you use online.

718
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,860
And you can do that while supporting the show and getting the best password manager in the

719
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,860
business.

720
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,680
So go to bitwarden.com slash Linux to grab that and support the show.

721
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:05,520
Try it for free for yourself or a team at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

722
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,060
We got some more great feedback this week.

723
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,620
So thank you for everyone who sent some in.

724
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:15,140
I had a hard time, you know, choosing some for this episode just to keep it keep it small.

725
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,540
But those those others will follow next time.

726
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,020
David wrote in about Silverblue.

727
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,780
I think we got quite a bit of feedback on Silverblue, right, Chris?

728
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,100
Oh, we sure did, Brettly, from all kinds of means and methods.

729
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,980
It means either we did good things or we did bad things.

730
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,940
David writes in about Ansible, using Ansible, because I mentioned, hey, it'd be lovely to

731
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,780
have some declarative configuration in there.

732
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,340
David writes, Hey, guys, I really appreciated the Silverblue segment you did.

733
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,580
One thing that I wanted to highlight is that it's possible to build a Silverblue workstation

734
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,880
up with Ansible, just like you declaratively build it up on Nix.

735
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,940
This is the solution that I've adopted.

736
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,180
And my daily driver has never been this solid, and I can reproduce it at a moment's notice.

737
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,020
I got to say, that is a very obvious way of doing it.

738
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:06,080
I passed over that when I mentioned it on last episode, and I'm happy to be corrected

739
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,220
because I think this is a wonderful way to accomplish that.

740
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,220
So thank you, David.

741
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,180
It's like peanut butter and jelly.

742
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,700
Joe writes in with Chrome on Silverblue and toolboxes.

743
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,700
Love the episode on Silverblue and good tip on updating Flatpak to allow for Chrome.

744
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,780
I've been experimenting with Toolbox to just install RPM downloads.

745
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,300
I tested it out using Chrome.

746
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,180
It's a bit slower to start than Flatpak, but it definitely works, he says.

747
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,460
That may be useful.

748
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Cheers.

749
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,940
Toolbox is a great, great tool.

750
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,620
We linked to Distrobox in last week's episode where you can get toolbox-like capabilities

751
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,040
on any Linux desktop environment.

752
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,820
But what I love about it is somebody who's trying out apps all the time, because I can

753
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,740
trash a toolbox environment, like all kinds of crazy dependencies, all kinds of crazy

754
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,700
libraries, whatever, and then just blow it away.

755
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,620
And my system goes about just like everything's totes fine.

756
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,140
And the cool thing they're doing, the clever thing they're doing in the background is they're

757
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,340
doing some mount magic so it looks like you're on your local file system, but you're totally

758
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,060
isolated in a protected system.

759
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,460
I feel like we're living in a really great time.

760
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,260
There's so many options to get stuff done.

761
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
It's amazing.

762
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,900
Jordan also wrote in, hey Chris, I heard you had trouble with tailscale on Silverblue.

763
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,700
I use it on all of my RPM OS tree based systems by just adding their yum repository to my

764
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
system.

765
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,700
You can add any RPM repository to your system and get updates and such that way.

766
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,700
Works great.

767
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,940
I got that tip a few times and I wasn't sure at the time we were recorded, so I didn't

768
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,300
say anything, but I thought maybe it was possible that space would get overwritten when I did

769
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
an update.

770
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,700
I don't want to say it on air, but then I heard about a hundred times afterwards, it's

771
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,180
totally fine.

772
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:50,060
So basically what he's saying is I could just add a tailscale repo to my Silverblue install

773
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,060
and then just install it with RPM OS tree.

774
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
No bigs.

775
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,060
That would be pretty straightforward.

776
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,300
Yeah, but I think you touched on something there, like we're looking at quite a different

777
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,540
paradigm and it seems like you paused a little bit and said, well, is the old way of doing

778
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,060
things going to work just as I expect here?

779
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,900
So I think that's a question worth asking and apparently the answer is yes.

780
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,460
At least for tailscale.

781
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,460
All right.

782
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,460
I think you got to take this next one.

783
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,060
I think you know what's going on with this next one.

784
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,540
Brent wrote in and it reads Brent and I had a chance to chat a bit when you guys were

785
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,660
all in town at the last rally meetup.

786
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,180
I'd like to offer to take Brent out to dinner and show him around town a bit while he's

787
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,180
here again.

788
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Wow.

789
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,860
How about, what about I'm just stuck up here in Seattle.

790
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Nobody's getting me dinner.

791
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
No, that's great.

792
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
That is really great.

793
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,860
Are you going to do it?

794
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Oh yeah.

795
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
So Brent and I had a good time.

796
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,660
I mean, anytime I meet someone named Brent out in the wild, which doesn't surprisingly

797
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,540
happen that often, Chris, I would imagine you meet quite a few Chris.

798
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:53,980
But every Brent I've met has been handsome and really kind and gentle and just an upstanding

799
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,980
citizen.

800
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,140
So Brent, I'll take you up on your offer for sure.

801
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,060
Boy, not as Chris as we are a bad batch.

802
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,580
The whole batch of us, I tell you what, no, they sure are.

803
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,060
Most places I've ever worked at, there's been a minimum of five Chris's.

804
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,300
Oh my goodness.

805
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,060
Uncle Nicky writes in and he says, Hey guys, I don't know if you're aware of this, but

806
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:18,900
the Dell XPS 13 developer edition has quietly been pulled from Dell's online store.

807
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,820
I'm looking for a good laptop for my PhD work.

808
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:27,000
And because of all the great reviews of the XPS 13 dev edition or over the years, I decided

809
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,220
this is the way to go.

810
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:33,540
But lo and behold, when I went to Dell's website, the XPS 13 developer edition is listed as

811
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,820
no longer available.

812
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:41,580
Oh, he says, I hope this is just a case of them removing the product listing before introducing

813
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,580
new hardware.

814
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,580
Hmm.

815
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,340
You know, I am not sure exactly what is going on here.

816
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,100
I haven't heard anything from our contacts at Dell, but I did notice a change in their

817
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,380
language.

818
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:59,180
I've noticed that they're now saying the Dell XPS 13 has been certified for Ubuntu as in

819
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:03,980
like just the Dell XPS 13, the main one, just the regular one you buy.

820
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:07,180
They're just saying now certified for Ubuntu.

821
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,740
I don't know if maybe that's the change, but I actually would be a little bit sad if they

822
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,380
were no longer making a Linux specific Dell XPS.

823
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,860
I think that'd be a loss.

824
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,180
But I wonder if there's an advantage there, you know, is it just, and I haven't looked

825
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,220
into this and it's worth doing once we get off air here, but is it just going to be a

826
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:29,980
dropdown on the regular XPS that you can just choose Ubuntu, for instance?

827
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:34,380
That wouldn't be maybe an acceptable compromise, I would think.

828
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,500
Although maybe it comes with a little bit less, you know, Linux happy PR.

829
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,500
Yeah.

830
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,740
It'd be unfortunate if it's like, no, you just get it with windows, but just wipe it.

831
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,740
It's fine.

832
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,740
It's fine.

833
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,740
Yeah.

834
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,740
That would be a shame.

835
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:50,480
I agree completely.

836
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,780
And now it is time for the boost.

837
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:01,740
Dev writes in with our first boost, 1,853 SATs, he says, 1853 is the year Isaac Stevens,

838
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,900
the first governor of Washington was elected into office.

839
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,900
Now you know.

840
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,300
I love the reasons for the boosts.

841
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,560
I have to regret to inform you that I will be stopping my core subscription because I

842
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,580
just don't really have a lot going on currently, but I do have a wallet of over 50K SATs.

843
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,900
Feels wrong to just give them all at once when I could boost in historical facts instead.

844
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:20,900
So please advise.

845
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,900
That's wonderful.

846
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:28,940
You know what, now if you keep boosting and we like hearing from you, I'd like feedback.

847
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,880
I always appreciate the thing about the boosts because I always appreciate when they get

848
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,820
us talking about something we didn't plan on talking about.

849
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,020
You know, the other thing about the boosts is they help keep our compass aligned towards

850
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,020
the audience.

851
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,560
They make the audience the number one customer for the show, for the network.

852
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,300
And so keep it coming.

853
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,700
I'll let you decide on how to do it, but keep it coming.

854
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,540
Sir Lurks a lot wrote in.

855
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:57,660
You know, that's a memorable time when Sir Lurks a lot boosts in two days ago, one thousand

856
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,660
three hundred thirty seven SATs.

857
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,660
Nice.

858
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
B-O-O-S-T.

859
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,660
They're right.

860
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,900
I know you're looking for good warm up songs for the pre show.

861
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:13,940
Someone is story in the Matrix lab lug room suggested Axel F. Famous from the Beverly

862
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,380
Hills cop movies with Eddie Murphy.

863
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:22,260
I thought that was a great idea and search for remixes when I came upon Crazy Frog.

864
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,700
How oh how could I forget about Crazy Frog?

865
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,900
That video went so viral back in the day and the Crazy Frog version has great build ups

866
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:37,380
at different points and it makes perhaps a good contender for the warm up music.

867
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,980
I'm not doing Crazy Frog.

868
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,620
I'm not doing Crazy Frog.

869
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:45,380
I did play it and I thought, you know, it does have good energy.

870
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:52,020
It does get your, you know, your toes tapping, but it would be such an earworm for the audience.

871
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,340
I think people would hate it.

872
00:46:53,340 --> 00:47:07,900
So but Axel F. does have a lot of what makes Crazy Frog good.

873
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:22,620
It's just so 1984.

874
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,420
You know, it's so it's so classic.

875
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,740
I think it needs a bit more cowbell to be honest.

876
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,740
Yeah, it could.

877
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,740
You know what?

878
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,740
I agree, Brent.

879
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,420
A lot of things could use more cowbell, though.

880
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,980
They're just not hearing us.

881
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,980
Guess what?

882
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:36,900
Lurkslot comes in with a double boost.

883
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

884
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:49,380
With fifty three thousand two hundred and eighty sets.

885
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,140
A couple of gallons for Brent's gas tank.

886
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,940
My first computer was a Commodore 64.

887
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,940
Nice.

888
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:01,300
You know, you could use the poke command directly to set values into a memory address specifically.

889
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,740
Sixty three to eighty is the memory address used to set the border color on the screen.

890
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:12,620
And since Brent will be crossing borders, that is the inspiration for the SAT numerology.

891
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,980
Wow.

892
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,860
That is wonderfully geeky.

893
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,140
I really, really appreciate that.

894
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Lurkslot.

895
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,140
That's great.

896
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,140
Totally nailed it.

897
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,860
I don't know how many liters that is for my tank, but I really appreciate it.

898
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,860
And also as a little tidbit, Commodore 64 was my first computer, too.

899
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,860
Thanks, Dad.

900
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:31,860
Aww.

901
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:39,340
Well, as it turns out, Sir Lurkslot did a triple boost.

902
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,340
Triple boost unlocked.

903
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:44,220
One thousand three hundred thirty seven sets.

904
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,220
Leap boost.

905
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:53,220
Can you use the Nyx package manager on top of Steam OS such that all your custom apps

906
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,220
are done via Nyx?

907
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,340
Then when you update Steam OS, you can quickly redeploy all your apps via Nyx configuration.

908
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,700
I'm still new to the whole Nyx OS concept myself, so I'm not sure if home manager might

909
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:09,420
work here, but I would appreciate if this worthy question could get answered by someone

910
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,400
more Nyx experienced.

911
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
We could try this.

912
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,860
I was already wondering this myself, Lurks.

913
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:20,680
Yeah, we'll try to get the Nyx package manager, not Nyx OS, but the Nyx package manager running

914
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,520
on top of the Steam OS image.

915
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,220
I think it could work if I can keep it all contained in my home directory.

916
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,900
I think that could do it.

917
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:34,340
I'm really curious for this update and are you going to rope Wes into doing this with

918
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,340
you?

919
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,780
I think I feel like I should get into some trouble together.

920
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:43,220
Rose Deer boosted in two days ago with three thousand three hundred and thirty three sets.

921
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,220
Boost!

922
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,620
Now this is a feature request.

923
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:50,220
Please remove the matrix registration info for the JB server because it recommends currently

924
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,260
to create an account, which we're not allowing.

925
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,980
We should make a GitHub thing about that.

926
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,500
I'm taking full responsibility for this one because, wonderfully, several months ago I

927
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,300
wrote a ticket about this very thing.

928
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,780
Hey, we need to change that.

929
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:07,380
And then we got very, very, very, very distracted by the new Hugo website that we're building

930
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,740
and the community has been amazing there.

931
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,460
And I've been so overwhelmed with just keeping up with all the activity that even though

932
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:18,100
I may have assigned myself to that ticket, I haven't actually done it in far too long.

933
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:21,980
So that is completely my responsibility and I apologize.

934
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,420
I will get right on it.

935
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,820
But that new site is coming along.

936
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,820
It's very impressive.

937
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,820
Yeah, it is.

938
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:35,860
Ibuki wrote in two days ago two thousand one hundred sets coming in hot with the boost.

939
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,860
I love that one.

940
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,860
You got me every time with it.

941
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,860
I know.

942
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:39,860
It is the best.

943
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:44,420
You should make other lotteries for similar initiatives and make the tickets have a price

944
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,500
like ten thousand sets, say, just like a regular lottery.

945
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,900
It could be another way of sustaining JB.

946
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,260
We're talking about the JPO lottery, which is up right now at Linux unplugged dot com

947
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,260
JP.

948
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,260
Oh, no, that's required.

949
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,940
But you do need to be in the area or be able to get yourself in the area.

950
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,540
That's kind of required.

951
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:06,340
We do have a limited slots and we'll be running a lottery on that to give away those spots.

952
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,660
Yeah, I don't know.

953
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:13,060
I could definitely see one day I was trying to do like a fundraiser for some initiative

954
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,500
or some show we want to launch or some other open source project.

955
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,500
I don't even know how we would ever do that.

956
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,620
You know, that feels like we give it some special thought.

957
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:28,700
We may have our first prize, which is your custom built, old, perhaps old, the used machine

958
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,700
here.

959
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,700
You get on my used crap.

960
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,700
All right.

961
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,500
Well, a row writes in 15 hours ago.

962
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,820
I don't think that's how you say it with a row of ducks.

963
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:41,540
I'm a duck, D-U-K duck loaded with talent.

964
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,700
Two thousand two hundred and twenty two stats.

965
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,180
Number of blue sounds like a good option to manage my family devices.

966
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,660
I'll see if it can cut down on my quote support tickets.

967
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,660
Thanks for the show.

968
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,660
I agree.

969
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,660
I had the same thought afterwards.

970
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:58,780
I was like, this could be the desktop environment I deploy for family.

971
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,580
You know, I did hear some feedback about that when I was doing research that it was a perfect

972
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:08,140
friends and family distro for those who want to support them a little less.

973
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,580
It's not that we don't want to support you.

974
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,860
It's just that, you know, we're busy.

975
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,860
Yeah, right.

976
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:18,060
Dragon's wing boosted in nine thousand and one sets.

977
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,540
It's over nine thousand.

978
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:24,520
I would like to introduce you to the over nine thousand boost.

979
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,960
If you don't know, shame on you if you don't know.

980
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:34,940
It's a reference to Dragon Ball Z, specifically the scene where I'm going to show my not knowing

981
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,940
this in this one.

982
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,940
Here we go.

983
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,460
I wish you were reading this one.

984
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,740
I'm right there with you.

985
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:40,740
No, I don't.

986
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,740
I don't.

987
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,740
I don't know anything about Dragon Ball Z.

988
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,740
I apologize.

989
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,940
Bronze Way guide, please write in with all your corrections.

990
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,340
I will read every one of them.

991
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:57,620
They continue specifically the scene where the gator checks Goku's power level and yells,

992
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,860
it's over nine thousand.

993
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:02,540
It's over nine thousand.

994
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,620
If you YouTube that scene, there are quite a few funny lines that would be funny to hear

995
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,780
on the podcast when a nine thousand and one boost come in.

996
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,580
Also funny side fact, Oprah was trolled back in the day by someone and she said over nine

997
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,060
thousand on the air without fact checking anything.

998
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,060
Well that's special.

999
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,100
I love that.

1000
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,100
That's great.

1001
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,420
Thank you, Bronze and Wing.

1002
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,420
That's fantastic.

1003
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:30,620
We also have a couple of thank you boosts that came in.

1004
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:36,220
One thousand sats from Neural P, 33 sats from Texas Comrade, and an announcement.

1005
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,980
We'll be raising the sat limit to one thousand sats to get your message read on the show,

1006
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:45,820
just to keep the boosts segment at an appropriate length, at a manageable length, but we'll

1007
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:51,340
be reading all of them and we may occasionally promote a sub one thousand sat boost if there's

1008
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,340
a great message in there.

1009
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,460
If you'd like to send us a boost, support the show, keep the podcast independent, and

1010
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:01,140
take advantage of a free peer-to-peer open source value network, go grab a new podcast

1011
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,140
app at newpodcastapps.com.

1012
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:07,220
There's a whole lot of open source and free software happening right there too.

1013
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:12,500
Like one of our favorites, Podverse, which will be embedded into our new website is a

1014
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:20,900
totally GPL podcast player that even has a F-Droid app store entry, iOS version, a web

1015
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,900
version.

1016
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,580
Podverse is just absolutely fantastic.

1017
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:29,380
Fountain FM as well, very good, and on iOS, if you like CarPlay, Cast-O-Matic can't be

1018
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,380
beat.

1019
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,740
If you just want to do it by the command line, boost CLI to get your geek cred up, because

1020
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,860
we'll call that out as well.

1021
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:37,820
Newpodcastapps.com for all of that.

1022
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:43,500
And with that, we do have ourselves some picks, Brent.

1023
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:49,100
So everybody from time to time probably wants to take advantage of a little bit of cheap

1024
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,300
cloud storage, right?

1025
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,740
A Google Drive, your drop-bizzles, you know what I'm saying?

1026
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,940
Drop-bizzles is my favorite.

1027
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,260
It just can't be avoided, Brent.

1028
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,180
These are massive companies, their services are wide-reaching, and they can be a great

1029
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,100
way to send files to people.

1030
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,940
So that's where our app pick comes in today.

1031
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:10,020
It's called CryptoMator, and it's the old kind of crypto, the one that involves file

1032
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:13,020
encryption, you know, the way it should, the way the term should be used.

1033
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,020
Oh, that one.

1034
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,460
I forgot about that one.

1035
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:20,820
With CryptoMator, it will create encrypted volumes or archives on cloud storage for you.

1036
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,060
So you can place your files in there, and then it will encrypt it locally before it

1037
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,620
uploads it to cloud storage.

1038
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,740
You get what I'm saying here?

1039
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:32,860
So it's a way to take advantage of cheap public cloud storage, but have your files encrypted

1040
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:38,180
locally on your client before they're put there, and then it gives you a UI to manage

1041
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,380
all of that.

1042
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,660
And then to make it even easier, you guys, it's available as a flat pack on Flat Hub

1043
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,740
as well.

1044
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,660
But in the example here, they have it attached to OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, and Next

1045
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,740
Cloud, and then it's just managing the security for the encryption on all of those.

1046
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,860
That is so great and very impressive.

1047
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:03,620
I have recently, so this is a bonus pic, I've recently been using our clone, which accomplishes

1048
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,860
a very similar thing.

1049
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:11,100
No fancy UI, well, there's a UI, but it's not quite as fancy as what you were just describing.

1050
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,100
And it works great.

1051
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:16,620
But this sounds like maybe a little bit of an upgrade there, or maybe a simpler implementation

1052
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,620
perhaps.

1053
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,460
I think both those are great, great choices.

1054
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,700
Yeah, I think it probably is a little bit simpler.

1055
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:26,940
It has a pretty clean, minimal UI, uses AES 256-bit encryption.

1056
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,260
I think it's just really nice and simple.

1057
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,580
It is available for other platforms, too.

1058
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,660
I'm just looking at their website right now.

1059
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,920
It is GDPR compliant as well.

1060
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,340
And they have an independent security audit that's been conducted on the two that they

1061
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,180
have the results publicly available.

1062
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,180
That is something.

1063
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:45,300
Man, you've got my like curiosity ears tingling.

1064
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,300
So thank you.

1065
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,780
We'll have a link in the show notes or you can go to cryptomator.org or just search for

1066
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,260
cryptomator on Flat Hub.

1067
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,260
That's all over there.

1068
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,860
Well, I think that's it.

1069
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:58,460
We'll we'll be back live on our regular Sunday time with the next episode.

1070
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,800
This is just sort of a last minute special.

1071
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,540
So that way I can treat the kids to a nice weekend at the beach.

1072
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:08,300
So I appreciate you rearranging your schedule at the last minute there, Brantley.

1073
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,300
Well, you're welcome.

1074
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,300
Good show.

1075
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,300
You're welcome.

1076
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,300
It's good having you here.

1077
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,300
Appreciate you.

1078
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,300
And you know what?

1079
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,300
Wes will be back.

1080
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,300
He'll be back.

1081
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,300
So if you're a big Wes fan and you missed him, don't worry.

1082
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,300
He'll be returning.

1083
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,540
And, you know, otherwise, that's it.

1084
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,540
We're just about done here.

1085
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,460
So I'll just give you the last bits of information you need to know.

1086
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,580
You can go to LinuxActionNews.com to get a little more show.

1087
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,060
We cover the news there.

1088
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,180
And there's always a lot going on.

1089
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,060
It's kind of like a companion to this here episode.

1090
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:35,460
And then we'll be back to our regular live schedule on Sundays at Jupiter.Tube at noon

1091
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,380
Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern.

1092
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,380
See you next week.

1093
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,940
Same bad time, same bad station.

1094
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,740
And then links to what we talked about today.

1095
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:51,020
Well, you can find those over at LinuxUnplugged.com slash 469.

1096
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,100
And I'd like to take a moment and thank our members, UnpluggedCore.com.

1097
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,300
Our members give us the ability to say no to the craziest kind of sponsors that want

1098
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:04,540
to give us big special deals, quote unquote, this last email we got.

1099
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,700
You wouldn't believe the things they want us to sell.

1100
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,500
It was so bad.

1101
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,700
And our members let us say no.

1102
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,180
We get to say no and wait until the right company comes along.

1103
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,500
UnpluggedCore.com if you'd like to join that and get the show ad free.

1104
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
Thanks so much for joining us.

1105
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:44,540
We'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1106
00:58:47,500 --> 00:59:01,340
How are you doing over there, Brent?

1107
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:07,580
Yeah, I was thinking I actually think it's responsible of us to just apologize slightly

1108
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:14,920
to listeners for maybe having lowered down the slight intelligence and style quotients

1109
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,920
this week.

1110
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,220
I mean, Wes isn't here, so we're trying to keep up his end of things, but right without

1111
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:25,700
Wes, like our style goes down a notch because he's always here with like a really good looking

1112
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,060
hat, maybe a scarf in the winter.

1113
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,060
That's it.

1114
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:32,920
Those shoes, those shoes he wears, always, always smart shoes, always smart shoes.

1115
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,340
The scarf helps with audio quality, you know, it absorbs sound.

1116
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,340
Yeah.

1117
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,740
So I apologize if that feels like it's missing this week.

1118
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,580
Yeah, it's weird, right?

1119
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:46,140
And then like, who am I going to go grill with after this, myself?

1120
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,280
Do you have the sous vide set up yet?

1121
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,740
He usually takes care of that, right?

1122
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,740
No, that's his job.

1123
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,740
Oh, no.

1124
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,740
He didn't set it up last week for you?

1125
00:59:51,740 --> 01:00:12,340
I think I'm only going to have his chips.
