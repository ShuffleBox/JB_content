00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 164 for September 27, 2016.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's changing up the format a little bit.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
By throwing your usual hosts out, and taking over by taking calls.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The phone lines are open to be a part of the program. It's a free call, 1-877-347-0011.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The number again is 1-877-347-0011.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So this is a special edition of the Linux Unplugged program.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Typically we meet as a virtual Lug, a virtual Linux group that comes together to discuss Linux.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This week we're going to be changing it up a little bit.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you listen to our new show User Era, that's a show hosted by Chris, myself, and Rekai the Beard.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We talk about everything. We talk about life, and technology, and Linux.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Last week we were having a discussion about how we could improve the network.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
One of the things that came up is, for the longest time Chris has wanted to host, or at least have the network host, a call-in program.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
One of my long-time passions for a long, long time has been, I want to help people get started with Linux.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You see, back in 2009, December of 2009, that was a big year for me.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Les Brown, the Breitmotivator said, people change when they say, I've had it.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I had one of those moments. I had one of those, I've had it moments.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I reached my lifetime limit of how much Windows I could take. I couldn't install one more driver to a Windows box.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I couldn't add one more Windows computer to a domain controller.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I reached December of 2009. I said, I'm done. I'm done working on Windows.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A lot of people said, you're an idiot.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There are practical reasons why Windows needs to remain in the workplace.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If you think you're going to go out and start a company and service only Linux machines and recommend to people that they only install Linux and that they don't ever use Windows on the bare metal, you're ridiculous.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That can't be done.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
In fact, the number one hindrance I had to switching myself to Linux and starting a company in Linux is people telling me that it couldn't be done.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
People kept saying, you're arrogant.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A couple of years in, it started to work out.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then people said, you treat Linux like a religion.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You need to be more practical. You need to be more reasonable.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can't treat operating systems like that.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think part of me just realized, and it's really in the last couple of years, that that's why AltaSpeed has never lost a customer since 2009.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Because when clients switch to us, they know that we understand it's not just an operating system.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's where the pictures of your kids live.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's where the video of your children's birth lives.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's how some of you make a living.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's how some of you have entertainment after you get home from a long, hard day of work.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You don't want to fight with your computer.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There are some people that live out in the middle of nowhere, and the computer is their lifeline.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's their emergency communication.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
After years of people telling me you can't start a business on Linux, and after years of people telling me that you're too arrogant and you're too single-minded, you need to be more reasonable.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now people are asking, how'd you do that?

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How are you making so much money installing Linux and switching people to Linux?

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How are you doing that?

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And so this hour of the Linux Unplugged program, we're not going to have our typical discussion format.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We're going to be taking questions.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You can ask a question by calling 1-877-347-0011, and I'm going to try and answer those questions.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now, those questions can be general questions about computers.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They can be Linux-specific questions.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
They can be business questions.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Anything that's on your mind as it tangentially relates to Linux and open source and business, we'll throw that in there, you can ask.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And if I can't answer the question, if I don't know the answer, we have standing by our Linux Mumble Room, which are the people that usually meet here every week to have a discussion.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So I'll say, hello, guys.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How are you?

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's the Mumble Room.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's good to have you guys here.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you so much for being part of this inaugural program.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Glad to be here.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm hoping you guys can help me.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now, one small little technical issue I'm juggling is that the machine that the phone machine is connected to is actually the same machine that the Mumble Machine is on.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And so I have to bounce between the Mumble Room and our phone lines.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And so hopefully the Mumble Room will be a little patient with me as I make those jugglings.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But yeah, I'm encouraging everyone to call and ask a question or tell us about your experience on Linux or, you know, something that's worked out with, you know, worked out very well for you.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So joining us, starting off is Ben from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has a question about Awesome Window Manager in Arch Linux.

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Hi, how are you, Ben?

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hi, how are you, Noah?

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey, good.

67
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Thanks for taking time to be here with us today.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So tell me a little bit about Awesome Window Manager.

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You've been trying that out, I take it.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes, and I sent you a pic on Telegram of the error I'm facing.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's based around Lua, which is a stripping language of sorts.

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I have been trying to get this particular theme that I showed you the crash on to work.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I downloaded it from GitHub.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I did a git clone, et cetera, the past main and whatnot.

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And when I load up, I keep getting that error over and over and over again.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I contacted the developer of the theme.

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He is a heavy as heck user of Awesome.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And he wrote the theme, and I said, you know, dude, can you take a look at this for me?

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And he did.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He was stumped as to what was going on.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I was like, oh, okay.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So I was like, okay.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He most likely said it's the piano bar stuff in the theme.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I opened up the config file, took a look at it, and I was like, okay, what the heck is this?

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, yeah, I'm not sure exactly how to fix it.

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I kind of called in today to see what your suggestion would be.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sure.

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Or Chris's or whoever is hosting with us.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because truthfully, you know, I looked at that theme over and over again,

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and even my friend Jamie tried to come by and look at it, and he didn't know what to do.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So I was like, I don't know if I should look at another theme or, you know,

93
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I just wanted to ask my question because, you know, I haven't dabbled much with Awesome,

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and I'm sure you guys haven't either.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But I just wanted, you know, to get your advice and, you know, to see what could possibly be done.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sure.

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And that's what I did because, you know, I just – I've been dabbling with this for weeks,

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and I just couldn't figure out, you know, what in the world to do because how – I just, you know –

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, no worries.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let me ask you this.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you have a copy of that script that you could send it – you said you sent it to me on Telegram?

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I sent you the picture, yes, but I can send you the GitHub link to it as well.

103
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's fine.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, that would be great.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And actually what I might do is I might throw that up into our –

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, are you communicating with me on Telegram or are you in the chat room?

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can send it to you on Telegram.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Give me just one second.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, no worries.

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And what I'll do is I will throw that into the chat room, and I'll have our chat room and our

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
mumble room take a look at that script, and somebody there might be able to dig in.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You got it?

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, sure.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Not a problem.

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, I've got you on Telegram, so –

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, perfect.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let me get that over to you, and I'll see what they tell us.

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sounds good.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, what I will do is I will – obviously that's going to be a script-specific question, so what

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll do is I'll throw that in the chat room and see if somebody there can't help you out with that,

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and if they find an answer for you, then I will respond to that in Telegram, and of course we'll

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
post that answer in the show notes of this week's episode.

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So thank you very much.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I thank you for the call.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We really appreciate having you.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
1-877-347-0011.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's the number to call.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We're going to answer your Linux questions.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Linux questions, technology questions, or business questions.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All of the above work.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And joining us now is – who do we have here?

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We have – we have Roller?

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Am I pronouncing that right?

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Roller?

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, and I'm Paulson Pfeiffer in the IRC.

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, cool.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, thanks for being here with us.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How can we help today?

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So I'm just calling to see if anyone's using Mageia.

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I switched to Mageia when Mandriva died, and that was sad for me because Mandriva was the

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Linux that I knew – I grew up on.

142
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So is Mageia still good for Linux?

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let me ask you this.

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What are you trying to do with it?

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I was just actually using it as a desktop just to do my office and just documents and

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
just normal stuff on.

147
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let me ask you this.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What led you to Mageia to begin with?

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So when I was way younger, before I even knew anything about computers, my oldest brother

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
came from Portland, Oregon, where he was doing his – he was getting his PhD.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So he ran the computer lab up there just voluntarily, and he learned all these different cool tricks

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
about Linux, and he had a LAN party with Mandriva in Utah, and we had tons of people show up

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
from, like, Idaho and all over the place.

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They showed up at his office, like, his practice for his chiropractor stuff, and they all came

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and it was really cool to see everybody, like, not really know very much, and he just showed

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
up here.

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Here's, like, six different DVDs, and we're going to start installing them and see what's

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
going on and, you know, work through strange issues.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Sounds like a man after my own heart.

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So you're basically looking for a general office use kind of a Linux distro.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, and by using it for general office stuff, I ended up deciding that, you know, I really

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
want to know what's going on behind the scenes, but I never really had a chance to learn that

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
before, so when I tried to dig into it, I found FreeBSD and, you know, forked off that

164
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
way.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Gotcha.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Well, I'll tell you what I would start with.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I might start taking a look at Ubuntu Mate.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Have you ever used Ubuntu Mate or played with it?

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No.

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I've just been, I went straight from Mageia to FreeBSD.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I'll start with this.

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If you're looking for a general office distro, I might stick with something like Ubuntu Mate

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
because it's going to be a really nice, stable, clean, very polished operating system based

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
on Linux, and you're going to be able to do a lot with that, and I'll tell you why I would

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
choose a Linux distro over a BSD distro.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You know, the BSD guys, they're great guys, and they have a really great competitive product

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
out there, and I think that there is something to be said about the community, the BSD community,

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
because they don't bicker as much as a lot of the Linux guys do.

180
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I think they have a much more cohesive product, but a lot of the day-to-day stuff, the reason

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
it works on BSD is because it's using a lot of the tools that we built on Linux, and then

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
they're just kind of importing those, and so you kind of shorthand yourself from a desktop

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
perspective if you're trying to do a lot of day-to-day things on BSD, and I use BSD all

184
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the time in data centers when it comes to things like FreeNAS.

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think it's a great choice there.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
As far as a desktop distro, I might look at something like Ubuntu Mate.

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Now, if you want to dig in a little bit deeper, if you don't just want to stick the flash

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
drive in, install, and be done, if you want to dig a little deeper, what you might consider

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
doing is playing with something like Arch, but Arch can be a little rough to get started

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
with, and so what I would recommend is taking a look at a distro called Antragos.

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Have you heard of Antragos?

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Uh-uh.

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, so Antragos is a distro of Linux that is – it is essentially Arch.

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Arch is basically you build everything yourself.

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You choose what the web browser is.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You choose what the file manager is.

197
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You choose what the mail client is.

198
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It doesn't assume anything, and that's great for learning how things work because

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you really have to dig in, and you – I remember the first time I used Arch, I had

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to load the application that I needed to read a fat file system, and it was just – it

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
was a very enlightening thing because it was a sobering thing because it was just something

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I had taken for granted.

203
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When I stick my SD card in there, I can read files off of it.

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Now I have to go – I had to learn about what program specifically allowed me to read

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
that.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Now the nice thing about Antragos is it holds your hand a little bit.

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
When you first boot into the installer, it will ask you.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It will say, which of these web browsers would you like?

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Would you like Chrome?

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Would you like Firefox?

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Would you like Thunderbird?

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Would you – and yeah, and it kind of walks you through, but it has enough pain that you

213
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
have to – it forces you to learn a little bit at a time.

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Right.

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Does that answer your question?

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah.

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

218
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's great.

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's what I stuck with BSD for was because I started to find where they were hiding all

220
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
the documentation.

221
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Obviously, they have a handbook, so they're not really hiding it, but once I started finding

222
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
where they were putting it all, I was like, oh, wow.

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Someone's taken a lot of time to write this all down.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I should read it.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Exactly.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Exactly.

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, yeah.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I would suggest you give Antragos a try.

229
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Take a look at that and see how that works for you.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,720
If you don't mind, if we ever do this again, I'd love to hear back from you.

231
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,240
Either you write in or give us a call back, like I said, if we do the episode again because

232
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,000
I'd love to hear how that works out for you.

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,760
Now, on Sunday on the Linux Action Show, we talked about a story from Lenovo.

234
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,400
The story, if you hadn't heard, Lenovo – well, what we reported on Sunday and what actually

235
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,340
happened, there was a little bit of clarity that has now come to light.

236
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:51,420
That clarity is that Lenovo – as far as the story went on Sunday, Lenovo made a computer

237
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,320
and just basically intentionally decided for it not to run Linux.

238
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm assuming that Ryan from Lawrence, Kansas, that is what – I'm assuming that's the

239
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
premise of your call, right?

240
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Correct.

241
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Hey, no.

242
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Hey.

243
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Nice to talk to you.

244
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Yeah.

245
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,240
Great to talk to you.

246
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
What were your first thoughts when you first heard about the Lenovo story?

247
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,280
Well, first off, I'm a little bit biased.

248
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
People should know me from the show.

249
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:25,900
It's me, Ryan, from System76, but it did really bother me when I considered what the

250
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:32,840
implications of that Lenovo story were because people started coming out and saying, well,

251
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,560
it's not really Lenovo's fault, it's Intel's fault, and so we shouldn't be raising our

252
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,720
pitchforks and going after Lenovo.

253
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,760
But that story struck me totally different because it means that not a single person

254
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:56,840
over there gave enough of a shit about Linux users to be like, hey, we should test another

255
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,120
operating system on this.

256
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,520
So let me give you some – let me give you some clarification, see if this changes your

257
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
opinion at all.

258
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,640
What was reported on Sunday was that Lenovo made a computer that simply didn't work

259
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
with Linux.

260
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,160
In fact, what it actually is, Microsoft came to Lenovo and said, we want you to custom

261
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,380
build us a laptop that meets these specifications.

262
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,700
We want better battery life.

263
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,780
We want better performance.

264
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,780
We want better cooling.

265
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,780
We want software RAID.

266
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,200
We want all these things.

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,000
And Lenovo said, okay, and took one of their existing model computers that you can buy

268
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,800
at Best Buy and install Linux on and it will work fine, and they took that model and they

269
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,760
called it the Signature Series and customized it for Microsoft, gave it to Microsoft, and

270
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,600
then Microsoft sold it through the Microsoft online store.

271
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,680
That specific computer has AHC turned off by default and so you can't install Linux

272
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
on it.

273
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,400
So my question is – my question back to you is, is that really what we're that upset

274
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,960
about is that a computer custom built specifically for Microsoft and sold only in the Microsoft

275
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,600
store and an alternative that is the exact same model computer but is more widely available

276
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,120
and that one is available to install Linux, do we really have that much ground to be upset

277
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
about?

278
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:19,760
I think that my feeling on it is pretty straightforward.

279
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:26,400
This is only a problem because people who wanted to run Linux bought a computer and

280
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:34,080
they just assumed, you know, Lenovo is a good brand, in the past I've been able to install

281
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:43,120
Linux on their machines fairly easily and so I'm going to buy it.

282
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,560
I see where you're coming from.

283
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:57,160
It does kind of bother me though that there's a – I guess if it's made to run Windows,

284
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:05,080
well that's – I guess that's perfectly fine, you know, it just – since the revelation

285
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,400
I would hope that it's updated to say, you know, something along the lines of somewhere

286
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,720
in the documentation will not run a Linux operating system.

287
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,280
Yeah, I mean I think that buyers have the right to be informed for sure and I definitely

288
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,360
I thank you for the call.

289
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,160
I think that they have the right to be informed.

290
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,340
I just – I question if – and I'm the first person to say that everything should

291
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
run Linux.

292
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,760
If I bought a computer it's running Linux or I'm not buying it but I think when you

293
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,320
go so far out of your way to make such a niche system for such a niche purpose, I feel like

294
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,080
there is just – I just have a hard time getting completely bent out of shape and maybe

295
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
that's just me.

296
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
Maybe I need somebody to switch me more to Linux, make me more hardcore than I already

297
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
am.

298
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Frank is with us from Stanford, Connecticut.

299
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Hi Frank, how are you?

300
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm good now.

301
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
What's up?

302
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Hey, thanks for calling in today.

303
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
How can we help?

304
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,400
So sort of two questions but different.

305
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,800
First one, so over the years I've collected enough hearts to sort of want to build a storage

306
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
server.

307
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Got the easy part done.

308
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
A bunch of hard drives.

309
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,520
Kind of need a controller for them and I know that's the tricky part especially if you're

310
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
looking at CSS.

311
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,960
So I'm trying to figure out how to pick the right, you know, hard drive controller,

312
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,840
host host controller for about eight spinning disks, pair each like they're western digitals

313
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
but yeah.

314
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Sure.

315
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,400
So you're looking to build an entire file server?

316
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,680
Yeah and I've sort of got it in my head that quite possibly it may end up serving duty

317
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,440
also doing VM work but main purpose is file server.

318
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,640
So I already have a chassis and hard drives.

319
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,680
So the chassis already had a motherboard but it's still old so I'm going to replace it

320
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
anyway.

321
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
Sure.

322
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,040
But my big one is like well I've got eight drives and how the heck do I get them, you

323
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:02,040
know, talking to the motherboard and patch experiences, you know, get a dedicated card,

324
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,960
you know, something that hopefully doesn't do RAID or at least presents the drives to

325
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,760
a problem with ZFS so it presents all the drives to ZFS and it can do its, you know,

326
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
wonderful magic.

327
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,160
Well I'll tell you what I did, Frank, is I had a, I just, I actually just got that building

328
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,560
a file server in December and what I ended up doing was I bought a case that actually

329
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,160
had a hard drive controller built in.

330
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,720
Now as you pointed out, that backplane that connects all the drives then reports as individual

331
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,000
SATA drives to the motherboard so there's a little PCI card that goes in the motherboard

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,920
and that connects to this backplane and then those drives go in and then they're reported.

333
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,720
Now there's a couple of nice things about that setup specifically.

334
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,840
One is when I was looking for a motherboard I could just shop for the best possible motherboard

335
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,600
and as long as it had a PCI slot I didn't have to count SATA ports.

336
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,760
The second thing that's really nice about it is because all of the hard drive controlling

337
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,480
mechanisms are handled on the chassis itself and on the controller itself on the case,

338
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,640
I can do things like hot swaps.

339
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,320
I can pull the drive out, put another drive in and let it rebuild, that kind of thing.

340
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,520
And I will find, I can find a link for you and throw that in this week's episode show

341
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
notes.

342
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
Would that help?

343
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
That would be great.

344
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Yeah, cool.

345
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,400
Well thank you very much and I thank you for the call.

346
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,440
Really appreciate having you.

347
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,680
The number again, 1-877-347-0011, you give us a call and we will talk about Linux or

348
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,200
business or computers or all three.

349
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,700
We love chatting and this is a super fun program.

350
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,120
Like I said, something a little different but I think it's fun.

351
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
I think it's going well.

352
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,960
We're going to have to make some changes to the audio setup I think because of the call

353
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,280
quality and people, as I'm moving on from calls, people are thinking I'm hanging up

354
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:49,320
on them and of course it's difficult to patch both the mumble room and the callers.

355
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,440
My good friend Sean from Washington is calling.

356
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
Hi Sean, how are you?

357
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,160
Hi Noah, how are you doing today?

358
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Excellent.

359
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
Thanks for taking the time to call in today.

360
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
How can we help?

361
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,460
So I have some friends back in Phoenix and they're starting a company and they're building

362
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,460
a web application.

363
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:10,080
It's going to be on Linux, use open source like Django and Ansible.

364
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,040
My question would be what kind of business or technology advice would you want to give

365
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,000
them like small business just starting up that you wish you could have given yourself

366
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,480
when you were first starting Alterspade?

367
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,840
I'll tell you the first thing I would tell myself is grow slowly.

368
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,960
I actually – I probably erred – at first I erred too far on the side of growing too

369
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,560
fast and then I erred I think a little bit on the opposite of that of growing too slow.

370
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,240
So I'd say just take it one step at a time.

371
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,380
The practical ramifications of starting a business are pretty simple.

372
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,480
You can open up a checking account in your own name using your own social security number

373
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,320
and you simply open the checking account with letters DBA, that means doing business as

374
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,340
and then the name of whatever you want to call your company.

375
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,300
What you do is every time you do work or any time profit comes or any time money comes

376
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,280
in from that business, in this case web application, you put the money into that checking account

377
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,160
and the only checks that – and all the money from the business goes into that checking

378
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,280
account and only business expenses, only things that are directly payable from the business

379
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,880
come out of that account.

380
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,520
Then at the end of the month what you have left by definition is profit and so you can

381
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,460
take that money home.

382
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:25,040
You set aside a quarter of that to pay your taxes with and now you have money to spend.

383
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,000
That's the practical tactical part of getting the business up and running.

384
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,920
Now as far as advice like big picture type advice, one is I would stay away from any

385
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,400
sort of debt.

386
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Debt in business is super, super risky.

387
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,420
Business going into business, small business in and of itself is risky and so going into

388
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,920
debt while you're going into business is all the more risky.

389
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,880
The second thing I would say is the more you can increase your profit margin, the more

390
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,200
you can get the spread up, the better the business is going to be.

391
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,660
One of the ways that I have found to make AltaSpeed remarkably successful and why our

392
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,400
profit margins are larger than many of our competitors is because we leverage very cost

393
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,360
effective technologies and so instead of buying a $10,000 Cisco IP phone system, we are running

394
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:18,800
free PBX and we have inexpensive SIP compatible standard phones that I bought used off of

395
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,200
eBay and open source and Linux is a really great way to increase that spread, to increase

396
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,480
that profit margin, you can gain a lot of traction if you leverage that software that's

397
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
available to you.

398
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,080
Another way we do it is we don't buy Microsoft Office.

399
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,800
We don't own a single copy of Microsoft Office.

400
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,820
We don't own a single copy of Windows 10 and so every computer that we issue to an employee,

401
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,140
we're not paying that license fee.

402
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,120
We're not paying that yearly fee to Microsoft.

403
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,800
We're using LibreOffice because it can do all of the things that Microsoft Office, whether

404
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,820
or not people want to admit that and so we do and all those things together have added

405
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,080
up to a significant spread in our profit margin so we're fundamentally able to make more

406
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,980
money and the third thing, if there's only one piece of advice that anyone would listen

407
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,280
to me from business, it would be make sure that you're putting a tremendous focus on

408
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,920
integrity because if customers see you serving them well, they are more than happy to write

409
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,800
you a check for appreciation.

410
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,160
If you go into it with the heart of I just want to make a lot of money, I just want to

411
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,680
do a lot of things to make a lot of money, that's where I see a lot of people get themselves

412
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,200
into a hurt because you start to lose sight of what's really important, that is you want

413
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,960
to be helping and serving other people well.

414
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,760
Does that answer your question?

415
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
I think I'll…

416
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Absolutely, that was really helpful.

417
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
Cool.

418
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
And thanks again for calling in.

419
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
It's really great to talk to you.

420
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,920
Sean and I met actually in a hotel at like three in the morning.

421
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,840
It was at Linux Fest Northwest a couple of years ago and we just started talking about

422
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:51,400
Linux and Sean is a great guy and has a very successful career in Linux and we've been

423
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,280
friends ever since and so it's really good to be able to chat with him for a little bit

424
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,880
if you caught the familiarity there.

425
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,280
Who do we have here?

426
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Frank from Canada.

427
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
Hi, Frank.

428
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
How are you?

429
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
Oh, hey.

430
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
This will be our first international call.

431
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
How can we help today?

432
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Okay.

433
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:26,880
I bought a new computer finally about a year ago, an i5 with a 970 Strix Asus video card.

434
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,400
In short, when I install NVIDIA drivers, the reboot goes from about 15 seconds to about

435
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
three minutes.

436
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:42,520
I've tried this on Kubuntu 16.04, Mate and Neon.

437
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,400
Does it sound familiar at all?

438
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
It does.

439
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
It sounds very familiar.

440
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
I'll tell you what.

441
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,720
I have not had any luck shorting the boot time with Ubuntu.

442
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:03,200
I had a very nice, very powerful Linux laptop and I had the stock driver, just regular driver,

443
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,760
and that thing booted in like four seconds flat.

444
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,120
I mean, it was incredible and I think part of that was it had an M.2 drive in it.

445
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,800
I loaded the NVIDIA driver on that thing and it slowed down to probably, I mean, at least

446
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,000
30 seconds, if not more, from a cold boot.

447
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,200
I mean, it was absolutely unbearable.

448
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,760
Part of it is I didn't care a whole lot because I'm not one of those people that shuts his

449
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
laptop down.

450
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,640
I just close the lid, let it go to standby, and then I bring it back up.

451
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,180
Lately, actually, with 16.04, there's actually a new bug.

452
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,920
If you have a Skylake machine, there's a bug with the NVIDIA driver where if you try to

453
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,520
encrypt the hard drive, you can't use the NVIDIA driver, it just won't boot.

454
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,700
It gets to the desktop and then it just, you get that little brrm and then you try and

455
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,960
log in and then it just goes back to the brrm and you can't log in.

456
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,960
The only luck I've had with getting faster boot times and using the NVIDIA driver is

457
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
using Antragos.

458
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Have you ever heard of Antragos or played with it?

459
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
Yeah.

460
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,360
No, never played with it though.

461
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
Okay, so...

462
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,480
Is this exclusive to 16.04?

463
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
As far as I know...

464
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,760
I've got a 14.10 machine and it reboots like, quickly split.

465
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,080
Yeah, I don't have any 14.10 machines.

466
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I have a 14.04 machine, that same thing, it's very fast.

467
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,280
As far as I'm aware, it's a 16.04.

468
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,120
Here's another thing you might try.

469
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,360
A lot of the issues that I've had in 16.04, namely wireless, because we all know that

470
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,760
wireless doesn't work in 16.04, have been actually fixed by Ubuntu Mate.

471
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,960
You might try Ubuntu Mate and see if that doesn't fix the NVIDIA driver problem.

472
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,600
I don't actually have...

473
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,680
Most of my Mate desktops are machines that are a little underpowered and so that's why

474
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,240
I'm using the Mate desktop to begin with.

475
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,760
I don't have any NVIDIA cards that are installed in any Mate boxes, but I would give that a

476
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
shot.

477
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
I would give Ubuntu Mate a shot and see if that doesn't fix your problem.

478
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,400
If that doesn't fix your problem, then I would start looking at Antragos.

479
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,880
As I was explaining to a guy earlier today, Antragos is basically as easy to use as Ubuntu,

480
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,080
but has all of the power and stability and flexibility of Arch.

481
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,120
Does that help you?

482
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
So you're using YUM instead of APT?

483
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,080
You're using actually Packer, P-A-C-K-E-R, instead of APT or YUM.

484
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,320
The command line syntax is a little bit different because there are flags.

485
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,480
For example, when you go to install, like if you're installing on Ubuntu, it would be

486
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:29,200
apt-get install Firefox.

487
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,560
In Antragos, you would type something like packer-s and then you would search for something

488
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
like Firefox.

489
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm sorry, small s, capital S will search, just a small s will install.

490
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
You can actually...

491
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,120
I have a cheat sheet.

492
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,320
If you head over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click on the contact link up at the top bar,

493
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,040
and click on Ask Noah and shoot me your contact information so I can get in contact with you.

494
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,040
I actually have a little cheat sheet that I use when I first started using Antragos

495
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,680
on the how do I get commands going, how do I get things started, how do I install things,

496
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,960
how do I remove things, those things.

497
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,320
I'd be happy to send that over to you if it helps you.

498
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
Okay.

499
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,160
So I just find that on the Jupiter Broadcasting website?

500
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Yep.

501
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,800
jupiterbroadcasting.com, up at the top, click on contact and then Ask Noah.

502
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,680
Now he brought up something kind of interesting.

503
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:30,320
We were talking a little bit ago about 16.04 and computers that don't run stock, aren't

504
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,800
designed to run Linux, and so they've had all of these little weird things.

505
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,520
One of the things that I should have asked Ryan about this while he was there because

506
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:45,160
he works for System76 is they have some pretty amazing machines that just work right off

507
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,240
the bat with Linux.

508
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,040
And so they actually, my Oryx, even though 16.04 is problematic, they were actually able

509
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,360
to fix a lot of that, and it is super appreciated, and that's not even a sponsor spot.

510
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,760
That's just how cool they are.

511
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,320
They just do that thing all on their own, and it's amazing.

512
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,640
Okay.

513
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Let's see here.

514
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
Who do we have here?

515
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,920
Next, we have Eric from Indianapolis.

516
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,000
Eric, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

517
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Hello, Noah.

518
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,880
Great to talk to you.

519
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
Great to talk to you, too, sir.

520
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
How can we help?

521
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,840
So I'm a fellow podcaster myself, and I want to start starting it back up, and I want to

522
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,720
do some interviews, kind of like what you guys have been doing, and I've heard great

523
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,080
things about podcasters, so I want to give that a shot, but I also wondered if there's

524
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,760
an easy way to share my desktop with the person I'm interviewing so that we could like go

525
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,720
over some websites or some programming code, and if Meet.jitsi might be a good fit for

526
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
that.

527
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,880
Yeah, actually, Meet.jitsi has a screen sharing app, so there's a couple different ways you

528
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,160
can tackle this.

529
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,640
The first way is a lot of people use Hangouts.

530
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,340
Now, they've discontinued Hangouts on Air, but to the best of my knowledge, that regular

531
00:31:53,340 --> 00:32:00,960
Hangouts is still a thing, and there's a disproportionate amount of people that are doing internet communication,

532
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,760
voice communication, video conferencing over Hangouts, and that is perfectly accepted.

533
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:09,800
Basically, what Chris does, you have to understand something about Chris, guys.

534
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,920
Chris goes and finds whatever everyone else is doing, and he says, how can we do it just

535
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,920
a little bit better?

536
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,280
How can we get our video quality a little bit higher?

537
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,720
How can we get the audio quality a little bit higher?

538
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,960
It's that little bit of extra silver lining, which is why Jupiter Broadcasting remains one

539
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:35,940
of the largest, best networks out there, and I'm just getting messages, yes, regular Hangouts

540
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,520
is still a go, so that's one way you can do it.

541
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,600
The second thing you can do is Meet.jitsi, which does have a screen sharing ability.

542
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,560
Now, I've not tried it myself, but everything else in Meet.jitsi has worked so well that

543
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,880
I'm going to go ahead and stick my neck out for them and say that I bet it will work just

544
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
fine.

545
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,960
The third thing you can do, and how we do it at Jupiter Broadcasting, is there are these

546
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,320
small little USB devices that you can buy from a company called Madwell, M-A-G-E-W-E-L-L.

547
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,900
They're about $300, and they're on Amazon, and basically what it is is an HDMI capture

548
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,600
card that plugs into USB natively compatible with Linux.

549
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,560
It actually presents itself to the system the same way a webcam would, a video for a

550
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,240
Linux device, V4L, and the nice thing about that is you can pull it into any piece of

551
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
software you want.

552
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,760
You can pull it into OBS if you're doing podcasting, you can pull it into VLC and record,

553
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,120
you can pull it into, I mean, you name it, if Linux can see it, you can pull that device

554
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
in.

555
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,200
One of the things that I have done is if I am conferencing with somebody, I will take

556
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,720
my laptop, which has an HDMI out, plug the HDMI out into the Madwell in, plug the Madwell

557
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,200
back into my laptop, and now one of my second display, quote-unquote, becomes a captured

558
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,480
thing that I can send out of a Skype window or through OBS or through Hangouts or whatever.

559
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,040
It just becomes another video input.

560
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,080
So that might be something you could take a look with.

561
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,560
Any one of those three sound like they might work for you?

562
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,120
Yeah, definitely.

563
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,600
I think the Meet.Jitsi one might be the simplest.

564
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,920
I think my question was I would have to make sure that they're on mute on Meet.Jitsi so

565
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,960
that Zencastr doesn't have a conflict with that, right?

566
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,880
Yeah, both of them you can shut off, various parts of it, so you can disconnect, you can

567
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:26,040
turn off your camera, you can turn off your microphone or whatever, so you can kind of

568
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,240
pick and choose which parts you want to pull from various services, yeah.

569
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Okay.

570
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,360
Yeah, I think I'll try that first, but then if that doesn't work out, I like the idea

571
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,080
of having the hardware capture device, and my primary device for recording it would

572
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:47,280
be a laptop that's ironically a Lenovo ThinkPad even after all the crazy crap that's happened

573
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
with Lenovo lately.

574
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,000
But it's been a rock-solid laptop for recording.

575
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,920
I was able to take it to a conference and did some interviews there on site with a lot

576
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:03,680
of the equipment that you guys have recommended, like the Electrovoice microphone, the PreSonus

577
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
USB mixer.

578
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,080
It's been really well done, so thank you guys for recommending such great hardware.

579
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Yeah.

580
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

581
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Thank you very much for the call.

582
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,080
I appreciate having you.

583
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,720
I tell you what, those PreSonus stuff, that's what I'm using right now.

584
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:26,200
I have a RE20 and I have a PreSonus audio interface, and that thing is sweet, absolutely

585
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,680
sweet and works very, very well and is actually pretty cost-effective, all things considered.

586
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,560
We've gotten to a point where you can get a pretty decent audio setup in almost no time

587
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
at all.

588
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,400
One of the things I was doing was a couple of days ago, I was on Facebook, and this guy

589
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,640
is challenging me to switch him to Linux.

590
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,160
He's kind of like taunting me.

591
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,120
And eventually, it got to a point where I said, listen, I drove all the way to West

592
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,800
Virginia and that guy was already switching to Linux.

593
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,640
And so if you think I won't come to wherever he is, I won't tell you where he is, but if

594
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,320
you don't think I'll come to, and then I said his location, then you're dead wrong.

595
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,600
And joining us right now is Chris from West Virginia.

596
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Hey, Chris, welcome back.

597
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Hey, Noah.

598
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
How you doing?

599
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Long time, no talk.

600
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
How have you been?

601
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
How's that school going?

602
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,600
How are those kids working out?

603
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,600
All those kids are surprising me every day, how fast they take to it, what they've done

604
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
with it.

605
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,940
And the high school has already purchased, well, they've already got the purchase order

606
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,360
going to purchase the machine so that we can start doing it there.

607
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
That's awesome.

608
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,360
So I'm really excited to see what those high school kids can do because they are just,

609
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,700
what they do with what they've got, if you recall, seeing what they had.

610
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,080
They do amazing things with what they have.

611
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,800
When they get OBS and Linux going, they're going to knock the socks off of me, I'm sure.

612
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,160
That is definitely awesome and thank you very much for what you're doing.

613
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
How can we help today?

614
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,120
Well, I actually have two questions.

615
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,680
The first one is really small, if you don't mind.

616
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,880
From a business standpoint, you know that I'm trying to start my own and that seems

617
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,720
to be moving right along.

618
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,680
How well does Simple help scale when you're talking large number of computers, say multiple

619
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
thousands?

620
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,680
Do you have that many?

621
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,720
Have you seen that?

622
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,080
I have not used it at the scale of thousands.

623
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:24,440
I will tell you that their sales team seems to have no concerns selling it as a large

624
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,480
scale solution.

625
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,960
So I certainly wouldn't be hesitant.

626
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:38,300
I'll tell you, if I was really worried about it, if I had like 10,000 people and I absolutely

627
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,320
had to have control of all those computers, at some point it does make sense to go and

628
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,280
take another look at TeamViewer.

629
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,440
Neither of them are open source.

630
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,640
I don't think you're really giving up a whole lot one way or the other.

631
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,560
My memory serves, the way that TeamViewer licenses is per technician.

632
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,960
So I think it's kind of expensive, it's like $1,500 or $2,000 or something like that.

633
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,080
But you could install, theoretically, and at least my understanding is you could install

634
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,400
all 10,000 computers on TeamViewer, you would just be the only one to control it.

635
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,240
So the cost goes up as you have more technicians, not necessarily as you have more clients.

636
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Does that make sense?

637
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Yes.

638
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,960
To toot my own horn and say I'm going to have thousands, that's, yeah, I'm shooting for

639
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
the moon there.

640
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,200
I don't know about that.

641
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,320
But I think that as you get into it, I think you're going to find that if you go out there

642
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,280
with the right attitude and you serve people well, and you're willing to charge a fair

643
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,200
price and do good, honest work, I think you're going to have people flock into you.

644
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,560
I would not be surprised if you have a thousand people that you're going to need to support.

645
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,720
Well, I do support somewhere in the neighborhood of 7,000 computers in the county school system.

646
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Exactly.

647
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,920
We have a proprietary Microsoft thing.

648
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:57,640
The second question, from your standpoint, how do you convince a business owner, let's

649
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,040
say you've taken on a new client and he's a small business owner, I don't know, say

650
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,360
five machines.

651
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:13,800
And from your perspective, how do you convince him that Linux is a better a better fix for

652
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,800
his business?

653
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,240
I mean, you and I, and most of the people listening obviously, know that it's probably

654
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
the better choice.

655
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Sure.

656
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,220
But if I'm a small business owner and I've been using Microsoft and QuickBooks for five

657
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:34,400
plus years and it's just working for me, and you present this to me in my eyes, oh my goodness,

658
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,440
I've never heard of this, this could possibly destroy my business, I don't know what makes

659
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
that sale.

660
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,360
So what I do is I approach every client with the assumption that the client is smarter

661
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,480
than I am and they know better how their business works than I do.

662
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:57,440
And then based on that, what I do is I make my sale catered around what is going to benefit

663
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,040
them and what is going to be in their best interest.

664
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,440
Now, I'll stop and tell you, I don't waste a whole lot of time trying to, my grandma

665
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,920
used to say those who are, what's the phrase, those who are convinced against themselves

666
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,800
remain of the same opinion still, something like that.

667
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,680
You can't, if somebody is dead set against something, sometimes you're just not going

668
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,200
to convince that person.

669
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,640
They want to be stuck in the mud, they want to be ignorant, and sometimes you're just

670
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,140
not, there's just not much you can do for those kind of people.

671
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:35,200
And when we do initial consultations, consultations, seems like that sometimes, when we do initial

672
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,940
consultations, one of the things that we mandate from our clients, and I've turned clients

673
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:45,960
down for this, is they have to be willing to allow us to make technical decisions where

674
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,600
we feel strongly see it fit.

675
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:55,440
And you know, if I am not, I am not going to be someone's paid monkey hands.

676
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,180
If you want somebody to walk in there and just do the work that you want, you want done,

677
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,440
there are plenty of companies that'll do that.

678
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
That's not us.

679
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,080
We craft solutions for people.

680
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,640
We craft cost-effective solutions without compromising quality.

681
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,240
That's what, if you call our 1-800 number, that's the message that we'll read.

682
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,400
It'll say we provide innovative solutions without compromising quality.

683
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:18,200
We take the same quality that you would get from a Wirecast machine with a $4,000 Mac,

684
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,600
and we will build the exact same quality machine.

685
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,160
It might look a little different, might behave a little different, but you're going to

686
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,020
get the same result, except we're going to do it with Linux, and we're going to do it

687
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,420
for a tenth of the price.

688
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,600
And if you don't want that kind of solution crafting, we are not the right fit for you.

689
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,600
So to some degree, you have to decide as a business owner, how do I want to sell myself

690
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,160
and what kind of clients do I want to work for?

691
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,680
And then once you have that decided, then you go in and you start looking at the advantages

692
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
to them.

693
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,680
So I'll give you an example.

694
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,320
We had a church that was broadcasting using a, it wasn't Wirecast, it was an alternative

695
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,360
software, and basically we went in and said, hey, listen, you're doing this wedding.

696
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,600
This is coming up in a couple months, and you're going to be using this software.

697
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,440
And the problem is, this really isn't up to being able to switch cameras.

698
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,960
It didn't have enough horsepower to handle the amount of video inputs we wanted.

699
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,400
So, you know, we can throw together a box for you for a tenth of what you paid for that,

700
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,800
and we'll be able to stream that out.

701
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,200
You'll be able to stream 1080p because they were using standard definition.

702
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,840
You'll be able to use USB cameras if you want like a camera angle of the drummer, you want

703
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,440
a camera angle of the worship team or something like that.

704
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,560
It's going to be really cheap to get additional camera angles.

705
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,360
Plus, we can take your existing video camera if you want to use it, it's SD, but we can

706
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:34,880
apply it, we can use a converter and pull that in because that lens shot all the way

707
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,840
down the sanctuary and hit the podium, and they spent a lot of money on it even though

708
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
it wasn't HD.

709
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,160
Really, people aren't watching to get high video quality, right?

710
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
They just want to see the service.

711
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,280
In this case, it was these people were getting married and they wanted their family to be

712
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,220
able to watch from the East Coast.

713
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,760
And so we said, we can do all that in a much more cost-effective way, and we will increase

714
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,880
your ability to grow and expand.

715
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,880
And that resonated with them because then they saw and they said, oh, we could spend

716
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,940
less money and we could get more, and that's something that any business owner is going

717
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,940
to understand.

718
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,920
And you have to remember, for the most part, businesses are actually easier to switch than

719
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,200
people are to Linux.

720
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,200
They really are.

721
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,000
And the reason is because businesses have a common denominator, and that is their bottom

722
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
line.

723
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,880
At the end of the day, they just want to make money.

724
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,920
I have yet to meet a CEO, I have yet to meet a president, I have yet to meet a general

725
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,520
manager that really cares what software is running on his computer.

726
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,560
What he does care about is that that stupid thing stays running 24-7, that those employees

727
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,880
know how to use that computer system, that somebody is going to be available to him when

728
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:46,320
something goes down and get it right back up, and that that machine is going to function

729
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
in their environment.

730
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:52,480
And if it meets those four or five criteria, I have yet to meet a business owner or a business

731
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,120
manager that really cares one way or the other.

732
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,440
And so, we actually just got done doing some kiosks, actually, and this might be a Runs

733
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:07,120
Linux this coming week, for an amusement park that needs to sign these liability waivers.

734
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,320
It was an easy sell for Linux because the cost of buying an actual computer with a Windows

735
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,960
license and site kiosk on top of that was going to be $700, $800, and to be able to

736
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,600
do that with Ubuntu Mate, a Firefox in kiosk mode, and Intel Nux was a tenth of the price.

737
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,400
So my suggestion is, and I thank you very much for the call, my suggestion is look at

738
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,980
what the business is going to benefit from, what things, if you were that business owner,

739
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,580
the whole moccasin thing works really well here.

740
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,200
Take a look at if you were in their moccasins, if you ran that business, what would make

741
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,720
you want to switch to Linux, and is Linux appropriate for those people?

742
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,440
Because sometimes, you might run into a place where you say, listen, they're an all-Windows

743
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,320
shop, Microsoft, for example, people that work on Microsoft Office, if they came to

744
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,640
me as a client and said we wanted to switch to Linux, we want to use Linux, we want to

745
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,940
see what Alterspeed could provide for you, I would tell them we're probably not the technical

746
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,080
solution provider for them.

747
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,640
I'd be honest with them.

748
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:07,060
If your job is to support or run Microsoft Office, you're probably not going to be very

749
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,960
happy when I set you down with LibreOffice, nor are you going to be very effective to

750
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,400
your clients.

751
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,960
And so, you know, there are just some situations where people are just stuck in, I want to

752
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,840
do XYZ and I'm going to do XYZ.

753
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,320
Now, don't confuse that with Microsoft couldn't run Linux.

754
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,540
It's not that Microsoft couldn't get word processing and spreadsheet calculations and

755
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,800
PowerPoints done in Linux.

756
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
They absolutely could.

757
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,640
They just choose not to do that.

758
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,560
And they make choices that make it necessary for them to run Windows.

759
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,820
But I've yet to ever meet a business that if they wanted to run Linux, that it wouldn't

760
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,880
save them money or save them resources.

761
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,960
Now, somebody I haven't talked to in a while, this name popped up and this is really cool.

762
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Elijah from Idaho.

763
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Hey, Elijah.

764
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
How are you?

765
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Hey, no, I'm doing pretty good.

766
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
How about you?

767
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I'm doing excellent.

768
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Thanks a lot for calling in today.

769
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
How can we help?

770
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Awesome.

771
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,280
Okay, so I've got a couple questions and they're really similar to each other.

772
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:07,000
On my home network, right now we're just running a super cheap $20 Linksys router that I want

773
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
to replace.

774
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,760
Now, I'm wondering, would there be any real difference between putting in a PF Sense based

775
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,000
router or one of those Ubiquiti Aero S routers?

776
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,560
Is there any real difference between like the firewall and that kind of stuff?

777
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,320
So they're targeted at kind of different markets.

778
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:34,940
PF Sense is a really great solution if you have a very large enterprise and you need

779
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:42,280
a very large, powerful level or layer three device, edge device that's going to do something

780
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,280
for you.

781
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,840
In those cases, PF Sense make a lot of sense.

782
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,480
I have a couple of concerns with PF Sense.

783
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,800
The first is I try to stay away from computers when I can, as weird as that sounds.

784
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,860
But traditional x86 computers that aren't appliances, like actual computers that are

785
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:04,480
just being purposed for something, even if it's by a company, I've never had an appliance

786
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,480
like device fail.

787
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,600
I've never had a router fail, never had an access point fail.

788
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,080
I'm sure they do, but at the scale that we work at, I've just never seen it.

789
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,680
I have, however, had servers fail all the time, especially if those servers have spinning

790
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,680
disks in them.

791
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,680
I've seen them fail a lot.

792
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,160
In fact, you basically count on it.

793
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,400
We actually swap all of our spinning disks.

794
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:29,560
And so the idea that I would take my entire network and base it on a single device that

795
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,280
I know is, especially if it has a spinning disk, I know is going to go out in a couple

796
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,640
of years, that has always made me very nervous.

797
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,760
The second thing is that you can't buy a PF Sense for more than a handful of manufacturers.

798
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,000
So a lot of people just end up building them themselves.

799
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,160
That's not a bad way to go.

800
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,480
And I have a file server that I built myself and put FreeNAS on, so I suppose in that regard

801
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,480
it's kind of the same thing.

802
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,520
But you have to remember, when your edge device goes down, you have taken a lot of stuff out.

803
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,880
So then that brings us to Ubiquiti.

804
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,680
Now, Ubiquiti makes great stuff, and we have a ton of Ubiquiti stuff, and I love Ubiquiti.

805
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,720
I can't say enough good things about Ubiquiti.

806
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,160
It's amazing.

807
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:13,360
All that said, the things that I like about Ubiquiti are that they are heavily centrally

808
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:19,200
managed and controlled, which when you're managing a lot of sites is very, very helpful.

809
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,160
When I think about my edge device, I mean, everything that passes through my network

810
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,380
is eventually, if it's leaving, the network is going through that edge device.

811
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:36,120
And so I become very, very picky at what device I'm going to essentially trust to keep my

812
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,680
network safe from outside intrusions and allow any of my personal traffic, encrypted or otherwise,

813
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
to leave through it.

814
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,120
And so a device that is centrally managed and a device that goes up to this controller

815
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,080
and stuff, that has always made me a little bit nervous.

816
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:56,680
Now, I understand that the newer versions of the edge routers, they can function completely

817
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,680
autonomously.

818
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,480
I can play with one, I think, itself.

819
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,160
And it's just a little web interface and you can control it and do everything that way.

820
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,480
And so it's definitely not a bad way to go.

821
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:12,320
Personally, I have invested so much time and effort into Microtech that I have a hard time

822
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,480
dragging myself away from those.

823
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,800
You can get RouterOS as a standalone distro and play with it and learn it.

824
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:25,440
And then you can go buy a $35 router that has all of the features that the enterprise

825
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,160
grade ones do, and then some.

826
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,000
And then when you decide you need to move up and you've learned that interface and you've

827
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,840
learned the web interface or you've learned the command line interface or however it is

828
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,780
you want to manage it and you want to move up from that.

829
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:41,060
Now you can go buy a $10,000 Microtech or whatever the largest one is, as a 4U monster,

830
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,840
and that is more like a computer thing, and you can go put that in some large business.

831
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,840
But guess what?

832
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:49,500
You're still using the same web interface that you used on the $35 one, the same web

833
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,660
interface, the same CLI interface that you used on the distro that you just loaded into

834
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,920
VirtualBox.

835
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,280
And that is very compelling to me.

836
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,360
I don't know if either of those, I don't know if I made a very good case for it or not,

837
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,340
but does that kind of answer your question or does that give you some insight or some

838
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,340
things to think about?

839
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,340
It does.

840
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,340
It does.

841
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,340
That's great.

842
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,340
Thank you.

843
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,720
And one other real question that's pretty similar is a local business hired me on as

844
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:20,320
their tech guy, and it's a local small business and they need to make sure that their network

845
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,420
for that business is secure.

846
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:27,980
And along with that, the guy wants to become PCI, I think it is, or PCI compliant.

847
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,320
And so would a microchip router that you're talking about, would that do that for them?

848
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,320
It would.

849
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,120
Basically what they're looking for when they talk about PCI compliance is you essentially

850
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,500
want to have two networks.

851
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:44,620
You want to have a public network that is giving Wi-Fi to people or whatever it is,

852
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,240
and then you need an admin network that is just for the business.

853
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,760
So we run into PCI compliance issues all the time at hotels.

854
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,700
They have a single network and then they just let their guests go on their Wi-Fi network.

855
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,460
You can't do it that way.

856
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,220
Now there's a couple different schools of thought.

857
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:02,060
I personally totally separate the networks.

858
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,020
I come in at the CABA modem.

859
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,260
I go into what I call a WAN switch, and so I just plug the CABA modem straight into a

860
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,260
WAN switch.

861
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,440
I take two feeds out of that and I go to two entirely separate edge devices.

862
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
I have two microtechs.

863
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,520
I have an admin microtech and I have a guest microtech.

864
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:20,240
And then from there, those networks are entirely different, are configured entirely differently.

865
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:26,340
And the thing is, the guest network sits physically outside of the firewall.

866
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:30,340
So there is no, oops, I had them on separate VLANs, but I accidentally tagged this port

867
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,780
and now they're joined together.

868
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,460
There is no, oops, I had a firewall rule separating these two networks, but I accidentally disabled

869
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,460
it or deleted it because I was troubleshooting.

870
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:44,300
No, they're two physically separate devices that sit physically apart from one another.

871
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,020
And then the downside is, of course, one is they are paying for two routers.

872
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,700
And the second disadvantage, of course, is that we're managing two devices.

873
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,360
But in the long run, I think that's a way better way to go.

874
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:59,860
The only downside to doing it that way, or the only problem with doing it that way that

875
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,720
I've run into is every once in a while you run into an ISP that won't assign you more

876
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,140
than one dynamically generated address.

877
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,060
And so then they have to pay for statics.

878
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,540
Typically that's not the end of the world because if you're doing anything remote, you're

879
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,060
going to want static assigned addresses to those edge devices anyway, because if you

880
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,700
ever need to make a change to them, it's really nice, especially in your case where you live

881
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:23,060
out in the boonies and you're commuting into work, very, very nice to be able to just SSH

882
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:28,060
into those things and restart them or make changes to them versus having to actually

883
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,460
drive out there.

884
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:34,460
But most of the ISPs that I've worked with, if you just put in a switch to the cable modem

885
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:40,340
and it will split out those two connections and give you a dedicated guest side and a

886
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,980
dedicated admin side.

887
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,980
Hey, great question.

888
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,100
Thanks a lot for calling in.

889
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:52,060
A couple minutes left in the show if you want to call in 1-877-347-0011.

890
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,060
That's the number to call.

891
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:58,380
And we're talking about Linux and technology and of course, personal life and business.

892
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,020
Now, hey, Ashley from Ottawa, Canada is joining us.

893
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,580
Hi, Ashley, how are you?

894
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,580
Not too bad.

895
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,340
Hey, Nolan, long time listener, first time caller.

896
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,340
All right.

897
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,340
How can we help today?

898
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:14,780
I'm not sure if it's Linux Unplugged or Linux Action Show.

899
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:20,060
You guys mentioned that if you know most of what, not obviously as much as you or your

900
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,140
co-worker know, but if you know most of what you guys are talking about, they should be

901
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,020
working with Linux.

902
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:33,660
I just got accepted to college for CompTIA certification and stuff like that.

903
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,900
They're trying to push Windows and I really just want to work with Linux.

904
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:45,020
Do you suggest just going to Linux Academy or getting in material and stuff like that

905
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:50,780
and studying for your certs as a way of getting into Linux itself, like the industry?

906
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,780
Sure.

907
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,340
I think that anytime you look at spending any kind of money, especially something like

908
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,660
college, you have to look at it as an investment.

909
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:03,480
What you look at anytime we do an investment is we want to look at the return on our investment.

910
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,880
If I buy a laptop for my business, if AltaSpeed writes a check for my laptop, we look at the

911
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,780
return on investment for that laptop.

912
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:16,120
If we spend $1,000 on that laptop, will it fundamentally enable me to make more money

913
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:19,340
than it costs thus by returning on its investment?

914
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,060
The answer unequivocally is yes.

915
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,940
The more places I can get work done, the more efficient I am, the more money this place

916
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,940
makes.

917
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:29,980
That's just the way it works.

918
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,460
We want to look at the return on investment.

919
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,220
If you look at college as a return on investment, you say, how much money am I spending?

920
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,220
I'm spending $30,000.

921
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,140
I'm spending $50,000.

922
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,580
What am I getting for that $50,000?

923
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,500
Well, a couple of things.

924
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:49,300
If you want to work in large corporate environments, a lot of those places, you want to get your

925
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,700
foot through the door if you don't have a degree.

926
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:56,540
They'll just ask you, they'll say, what's your after high school experience?

927
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,940
If you don't have something to put on those lines, they don't even look at your resume.

928
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,940
The second thing we can get from college though is real skills that are applicable in the

929
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:10,680
workplace that will fundamentally make you better at what you do.

930
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,680
I have a degree.

931
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,680
I went to school.

932
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:17,220
I learned things in school, both on the business side that let me sit down and look at our

933
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:20,940
books and I can instantly get a picture of what my company is doing, as well as on the

934
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:26,620
technical side, I learned networking things and subnetting and stuff like that.

935
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,460
When I went into the industry, I could walk in and I already had an understanding of how

936
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,820
some of those things work.

937
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,580
Is that saying that you have to go to college to work in IT?

938
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,380
No, no, it is not saying that at all.

939
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:44,880
In fact, arguably more people are hired and the preference in this industry is on certifications

940
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,820
and being current because one of the big things that I see that drives people out of the industry

941
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:53,620
or that doesn't get them hired is people will walk into a job interview, but they'll walk

942
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:57,500
into a place that they want to work at and they'll sit down there at their, their, their

943
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,340
resume and they'll say, yeah, I learned Red Hat five.

944
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,460
Okay, great.

945
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,300
So we're using Red Hat seven soon to be eight.

946
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,300
What do you know about Red Hat eight?

947
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,980
Well, I don't know anything about Red Hat eight, but I know Red Hat five that's useless.

948
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,900
That's useless to me as me as an employer.

949
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
That's a useless thing to me.

950
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,800
I would much rather have somebody sit down at my desk and say, listen, I don't have any

951
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,180
formal education.

952
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:25,660
What I do have is a passion to learn and I have gone to Linux Academy and I have studied

953
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,980
the material that's there and I am very comfortable in making things happen.

954
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:35,660
I am very comfortable in achieving the goals that Linux Academy has set up and if you give

955
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,020
me a production environment, I can go out there and I can do the kind of work that you

956
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,020
need me to do and you let me work for a couple of weeks free and I'll show you, I can make

957
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,020
you more money than I cost.

958
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,660
I'll hire that guy in a heartbeat.

959
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,100
In a heartbeat I'd hire that guy.

960
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,220
I can't speak so much for Canada.

961
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,600
I would assume it's similar to the US, but in the US most people are not working for

962
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,960
large corporate firms.

963
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,380
Most people are working for small business and small business cares way more about can

964
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,060
you get the job done than they do about what your formal education is.

965
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,380
So what I would encourage you to do is I would sit down with a guidance counselor at the

966
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,780
school or I would look through some of that material or the courseware and I would say,

967
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,300
is any of this material valuable to me in the workplace and is it something that I can't

968
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,620
get other ways and if the answer to that question is yes and if the answer to that question

969
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:26,460
is I need to know Cisco networking so that I can go get this job making $70,000 a year

970
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:32,220
and so if I spend $30,000 I can make $70,000, well that would be a good return on investment.

971
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:37,480
If you go to college and you say I want to go learn about Linux server administration

972
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,740
or maybe you go and learn about Windows system administration because that's where the next

973
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:45,420
job is and that's how you put food on the table while you work towards the goal.

974
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,580
Taking a step back so that you can take a step forward in the future, that's an okay

975
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,580
way to go too.

976
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:57,220
Is that something like because you're a huge Linux enthusiast and I'm the same way but

977
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:02,580
would you suggest doing that like actually taking the time to learn the Microsoft stuff

978
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,100
just to put food on the table until you can get into Linux industry?

979
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:13,660
No I guess I wouldn't suggest, I mean I'll say this, I will do whatever it takes to feed

980
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,400
my family before I let them starve so if I mean I'll work at McDonald's before I let

981
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
my family starve.

982
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,460
Whatever, that said I think that the paradigm that you have to either work for a company

983
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:28,020
that uses Windows or use Microsoft products or you won't have a job, I think that's a

984
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:32,060
false paradigm because so many people are hiring Linux people right now.

985
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:37,240
In fact we have people from Linux Academy that are coming and saying we want to hire

986
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:43,980
people from your audience because your audience is smart and talented and we have other employers.

987
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,980
There was a guy just wrote in I think three weeks ago, four weeks ago he wrote into the

988
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,480
Linux action show and he said I am looking to hire some Linux guys and we're dry.

989
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,060
We cannot find Linux guys so can you give me some contact information for some Linux

990
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,580
guys and so I made a plug in here and people that wrote in their resumes I forwarded off

991
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:00,580
to him.

992
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,580
I remember that show yeah.

993
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,200
Yeah so I mean there are very much people looking to hire Linux guys and they're so

994
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,260
desperate to hire Linux guys they'll even hire them remotely.

995
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,680
They don't even care if you move they just want Linux guys so I think you can easily

996
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:18,280
make $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year working in a Linux career but I guess what I was saying

997
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:23,660
was if you have to take a step back, if you take one step back so that you can take a

998
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,020
step forward that's an okay thing to do.

999
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,300
You just want to make sure that you're moving in a direction that you're comfortable with

1000
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,380
because if you're like me and you don't want to be working on Windows for the rest of your

1001
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:37,980
life and I started working on Linux, I started working on Windows in a help desk and it about

1002
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:42,060
drove me crazy and you don't want to be that guy.

1003
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,540
You don't want to be myself 10 years because you about want to kill yourself.

1004
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,620
So yeah but does that answer your question?

1005
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:52,340
Yeah it does and yeah you guys are like rock stars to me so keep up the good work.

1006
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,340
Awesome.

1007
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:54,340
I enjoy listening to your show.

1008
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,620
Well thanks we really appreciate having you and thank you very much for the call.

1009
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:06,220
Just a couple minutes left if you want to get in 1-877-347-0011 let's see here who

1010
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,220
do we have here.

1011
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,660
I'll tell you let's just stop here and talk about Linux Academy right.

1012
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:22,500
Linux Academy is interesting in 2016 that I would get that call.

1013
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,460
I would get the call where somebody is talking and I have to think about it to give them

1014
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:31,540
an answer mind you where I'm asking do you want to spend $15 a month or do you want to

1015
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,740
spend $30,000 a year?

1016
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:39,620
And if you spend the $15 a month in about 6 months you have a reasonable chance of obtaining

1017
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:43,900
the same skill set as somebody who spends $30,000 and goes to a liberal arts education

1018
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,900
system.

1019
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,280
Of course you're not going to be liberally arts educated you're not going to take basket

1020
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:55,460
weaving and music therapy and whatever other classes you got to take to actually get a

1021
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:59,180
whatever else you have to take to get you know the degree but you're going to learn

1022
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,820
the same skills and those skills are valuable in the marketplace.

1023
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:07,980
And it gets even cheaper if you are a Linux unplugged listener because we have a code.

1024
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:15,100
If you go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged they're going to knock a couple bucks off.

1025
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:20,320
And I have done all of my education in the last two years strictly through Linux Academy

1026
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:25,940
and I'm comparing that to doing actual like Red Hat classes.

1027
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,420
I've done both and I know which one I like better.

1028
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:34,740
I like being able to sit in my skippies at night drinking a Coke watching the Linux action

1029
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:41,380
show but that's a self-serving I don't watch myself but watching TechSnap and doing

1030
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:45,860
Linux Academy on my computer in their you know bite-sized pieces.

1031
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,780
It's a really valuable way to get an education and I said it on last and somebody was bringing

1032
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,860
it up here.

1033
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:55,500
You don't have an excuse not to have a good Linux job.

1034
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,100
You don't have an excuse not to be doing what you love.

1035
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:03,540
That's an old quote right you do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life.

1036
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,580
Honestly I swear to God I don't feel like I work guys.

1037
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,220
I don't feel like I work at all.

1038
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:13,400
I feel like I wake up every morning and I get to go out and play with Linux all day

1039
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,820
every day and part of that is because I have the skill set to do it and part of having

1040
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,260
the skill set is going to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

1041
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,900
And while we're talking about advertisers I'll just tell you something.

1042
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:33,060
It makes me so irritated and sick when I see people that complain about advertisers.

1043
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:38,420
I was listening to a radio show I recently got back into Sirius XM and I'm really following

1044
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:45,080
the political election and in this election or in this show this guy is talking and he

1045
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:51,820
makes this beautiful point about the Constitution this absolutely stellar pinpoint perfect point

1046
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:57,340
about how we need to we need to get to a point where we all agree on the rules to which we're

1047
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:02,100
going to govern society and it just is a beautiful point I just I was so interested in the show

1048
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,320
and I was so interested I'm like that's a great point and then he goes have you upgraded

1049
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:12,500
your underwear lately and I went say what you know I did one of those one of those you

1050
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,780
know German Shepherd cockeyed you know the tilt the head thing what and I'm like what

1051
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:21,780
what did he just say underwear have you upgraded your underwear lately let me tell you about

1052
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:27,780
underwear blah blah blah and then he goes into this ad and all I could think about was

1053
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:34,520
my god that man just took X amount of dollars and then talked about underwear on his political

1054
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:40,300
show because somebody paid him to do it that is such a weird thing and it is so jarring

1055
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:45,300
and weird that I don't even want to listen to the rest of the program because he's talking

1056
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,140
about underwear and it has nothing to do with the program and frankly I don't really want

1057
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:52,420
underwear advice from a guy I'm listening politics which just doesn't make any sense

1058
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:58,500
right if you guys could see I mean you know how valuable Chris's hair is and he pulls

1059
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,320
half of it out stressing over which advertisers is he going to take on the network he is he

1060
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:08,740
is anal retentive when it comes to who he will allow to advertise on the network and

1061
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:15,960
it is it is so the process the way that Jupiter broadcasting is does advertisers is so much

1062
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,580
different from every other show I have listened to it is unbelievable it is absolutely truly

1063
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,340
unbelievable and the way that it works is he goes and finds products and services that

1064
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:31,140
serve him well and that he's been using for years and have provided him great value and

1065
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:36,300
then he goes and says you know be really great if I could go tell the audience that wants

1066
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,340
to hear my opinion on technology because let's face it the man is pretty well versed in technology

1067
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,940
he spends every waking minute researching reading or trying technology says I'm gonna

1068
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:50,700
go share those opinions with people and because he's not an idiot he capitalizes the heck

1069
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,320
out of it because you would do that right if you have an educated formed opinion that

1070
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,280
is a positive you know reflection of a business and you're going to go give that that opinion

1071
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,980
on air you might as well get paid for it you just that's just that is a that is a basic

1072
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,420
fundamental function of business is when you're good at something you don't do it for free

1073
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,340
and the fact that people find a way to complain about that is unfreaking believable to me

1074
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:18,260
it is unfreaking believable that people have the audacity to complain about it what's

1075
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:22,180
further unbelievable is that the same people that complain about the ad reads are not the

1076
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:27,380
people that are on the patreon contributing to patreon if you want to not hear ad reads

1077
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:31,860
on the shows then the patreon should be like double or triple of what it is because this

1078
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:36,960
network has to be funded somehow and right now those advertisers are funding that network

1079
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,060
and by the way those advertisers are providing an extraordinarily valuable service that you're

1080
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:46,860
lucky to know about I was before I got on this before I walked up those stairs down

1081
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,660
this hallway and sat down in this chair to do this show today I was in the middle of

1082
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:55,500
troubleshooting when I've had the worst week of my life this week as far as all to speed

1083
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:00,220
troubleshooting goes because we've had a ton of like nitty-gritty problems that I had that

1084
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:06,020
require my attention and I don't like to do that I like to I like to be the the you know

1085
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,220
the manager I like to sit and have the text go out and do the work and then I just kind

1086
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,140
of check things off make sure that things are going smoothly occasionally I poke my

1087
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:16,520
head in something that I find fun this week it hit we've been so busy I've had to devote

1088
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:21,860
my energy to fixing dumb little problems that I don't want to be fixing and just before

1089
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:25,980
I got up these stairs and sat down to do this program I had just finished setting up a new

1090
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:32,100
phone server for someone and I didn't have time I didn't have time to go provision an

1091
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:38,220
actual box and set it up coordinate all that stuff and so I took a snapshot of a of a stock

1092
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:43,100
phone system that I have set up with generic extensions and I used their imaging thing

1093
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:49,820
to create a droplet from that image and I had a phone system up and running from start

1094
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:55,100
to finish with the trunks configured the whole nine yards in like 30 minutes I mean it was

1095
01:06:55,100 --> 01:07:00,720
absolutely unbelievable and using the code do unplugged you're going to get ten dollars

1096
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,300
off your Linux rig so in this case is a five dollar rig I'm gonna get two months of that

1097
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:09,100
file server for free or I'm sorry phone server for free I won't even pay for it the fact

1098
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,620
that I'm telling that the fact that we have to explain why this is valuable to you that

1099
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:18,900
you can I'm charging that client by the way seventy five dollars an hour and we build

1100
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:24,660
based on a templated thing so if it to set up a phone system from scratch I don't know

1101
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,900
what exactly it comes out to be but whatever that is whatever that time thing is that's

1102
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:33,180
what we build the client and then when we go back if I can find a way to shorthand that

1103
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:38,060
and shorten that up a little bit guess what maximizes my profit maximizes my spread and

1104
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:42,400
I make more money doing that I'm doing and all of those innovations are happening because

1105
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,700
of digital ocean not because of anything I'm doing it's because of what they're doing

1106
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:53,700
and I'm able to resell absolutely incredible just absolutely unbelievable so there there's

1107
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:58,620
my rant for for advertising I'll tell you something else too but just before I'm done

1108
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:04,180
I'm almost done but before I'm done my phone I am leaving for I'm leaving for a for an

1109
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:08,620
international trip I'm gonna take my ting sim out I'm gonna put go buy an international

1110
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:12,980
sim I'm gonna put it in my phone and then I'm gonna have phone service wherever I am

1111
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:17,380
because that's going to be because I because ting doesn't charge you for what you don't

1112
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:26,780
use and so you can go to you the the ability to just pay for what you're using the ability

1113
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:33,740
to own your own device is unbelievable and it's the same appeal as Linux it's the same

1114
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,020
appeal as being able to own my own computer and doing what I want with it now I've extended

1115
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:44,980
that to my phone I just I it is it just it makes my brain hurt to think about like why

1116
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:49,180
this is controversial why we have to explain this to people why that's not like painfully

1117
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:54,200
obvious that this is like an amazing thing but if you think if you're one of the people

1118
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,380
out there that say oh they just do those ad reads because they they pay the network you

1119
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:03,980
are a hundred percent wrong it has that that is that is a very small fraction of what contributes

1120
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:07,740
the it's the complete other way around we serve people by providing them with valuable

1121
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:12,260
information and we happen to find a way to capitalize on that and I'm not done yet I'm

1122
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:16,980
almost done but not quite done yet one last thing the other day I was driving out to my

1123
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:24,180
buddy's house and I were having a conversation about phones and he's talking about how he

1124
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:31,320
bought this phone on on his whatever network and now he wanted to get a different phone

1125
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,460
but he wasn't sure if he wanted to stick with the same service provider and he's like well

1126
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,020
I'm trying to decide what service provider so I can decide what phone to get and I'm

1127
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,620
like that doesn't make any sense dude just buy the phone you want and then put it on

1128
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:44,180
whatever service provider you want you know I'm used to ting he says no I can't do that

1129
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,260
this one only activates here this one only activates there and I'm like listen dude here's

1130
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:52,660
what you do you go to eBay and we bought him a Nexus 5 and he got it for like $85 and he

1131
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:59,060
activated that sucker on ting now what I do is I actually keep ting sim cards on me at

1132
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,940
all times so I can give them out to people so I end up ting sim card we activate it and

1133
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,940
he went over to linux.ting.com and that got him the promo code he was able to activate

1134
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:13,060
his phone on the ting network now the great thing about that is because I know that he's

1135
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:17,500
going to end up sticking with ting because the fastest way to decide to stay with ting

1136
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,740
is to go try somebody else and then you realize how much more you pay or how crappy the service

1137
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,940
is and then you come back so I if he wants to leave though he's not locked into ting

1138
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:31,300
he can go over to AT&T or he can go to T-Mobile or he can go to you know name a GSM provider

1139
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:35,940
you can go to those those places and then when he either gets sick of paying $190 a

1140
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,380
month for his phone service or he doesn't have reception anywhere then he'll decide

1141
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:46,820
to come back to ting so linux.ting.com you'll save a couple bucks and you will own your

1142
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:51,580
device you will own your service you'll only use for what you pay you go on a trip out

1143
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,380
of the country you don't use your phone for a couple of days then you don't pay for

1144
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,980
those couple of days only pay for what you use linux.ting.com that's all I have to

1145
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:05,140
say about that okay Zachy was on hold but you got you got dropped there and you have

1146
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:12,960
a question about setting up your wireless yes so I'm about to purchase a Toyota motor

1147
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,380
home that I'm gonna strip out and redo and I want to make it smart I travel up and down

1148
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:27,980
the coast from Oregon down to Arizona and what I want to do is make it so I can park

1149
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:34,500
like you know like in a Walmart or wherever and hook up to their wireless network but

1150
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:41,060
not have to hook my devices up directly have my own like separate wireless internet inside

1151
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:47,420
the vehicle okay the audio cut out of the last can you give me that last little bit

1152
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:55,860
again okay what I want to do is set up a wireless basically have Wi-Fi boosters on the outside

1153
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:01,100
of the mobile home gotcha so that way I can have my own network on the inside and don't

1154
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:06,540
have to hook my devices directly up to their system or go into the building it gotcha there's

1155
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,140
a great device for doing something like that called the cradle point and basically what

1156
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:15,260
the cradle point is is it is a hardware device that connects to a wireless network and then

1157
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:20,740
has its own router built in and then its own access point built in and so basically you

1158
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:25,260
can connect it via hardline or via Wi-Fi to any network you want and all of your devices

1159
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:29,780
connect to it and then it becomes your router and edge device and all that stuff and then

1160
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:34,820
your connection to the internet it can be either wireless or wired it connected whatever

1161
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:38,780
you want so if you're you know you're mooching off the neighbors that would work Chris for

1162
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:42,500
example uses the cradle point in his RV so when he travels from RV park to RV park he

1163
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,460
connects the cradle point then to whatever the wireless system is there or if he's parked

1164
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:52,820
at JB then he plugs in but all of his devices inside just talk to that cradle point would

1165
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:59,020
that ends would that would that help you yeah that would help me quite a bit and I just

1166
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:05,420
want to let you know thanks for all you guys do I ended up finding a computer in the dump

1167
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:12,180
and I switched it over to Linux that was like my first step I had an expired Windows card

1168
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:17,620
and then I went and purchased a couple elite books and they're running Linux mint beautifully

1169
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:22,660
so I just want to thank you for all that you do and keep up the good work cool well we

1170
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:27,940
really thank you for the call and I appreciate having you it it is a lot of fun I can honestly

1171
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:35,100
say this might be one of the most fun things I have ever done on on the network is doing

1172
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:40,220
these calls hanging out I love I love answering questions and the thing is people are asking

1173
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:48,860
me for my opinion today and I have to tell you I am an expert on my opinion I I know

1174
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:52,840
everything there is to know about my own opinion it's it's kind of incredible but but this

1175
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:57,440
has been a lot of fun and I really appreciate you guys taking the time to call in and hopefully

1176
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,140
we were able to provide some meaningful answers to you I'm gonna take a couple more calls

1177
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:08,340
I'm gonna go to is it Goffin from Chicago no Gorin Gorin hi Gorin how can we help hi

1178
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:13,340
nice to meet you finally over the phone long time listen the first time call I do shoot

1179
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:19,140
you guys an email every once in a while I hope I'm not bothering you too much no no

1180
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:26,900
I don't have a question so I do run a small I think consulting I support local small businesses

1181
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:33,820
use Linux distros made mainly for phone systems and file servers and stuff so I do wonder

1182
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:40,740
what can you recommend is like customer database it doesn't have to be fully open source it

1183
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:46,100
doesn't have to be fully free I'm fine with the you know a small monthly charge so I can

1184
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:51,460
keep track of all my customers and then all the hardware that I have installed at their

1185
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:56,100
network a lot of credentials for servers for searches access points and stuff like that

1186
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:03,540
sure so what you're looking for is is what's known as a CRM or customer relation management

1187
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:13,380
CRM and there's a couple of them out there there's there's also ERPs that are out there

1188
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:19,500
I actually am just it's funny you asked this it really is because I actually was just taking

1189
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:27,180
some time to investigate this for myself basically we have we have breached the end of what I

1190
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:33,980
think we can reliably provide for our for a meaningfully provide for our customers I

1191
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:38,100
think we are serving them as as good as we can possibly serve them they don't have a

1192
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,620
need that goes unmet there we have a we have a 120 minute response time and so things are

1193
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:46,500
going great and so my next thing is now I want to help more people I want to expand

1194
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:52,060
out I want to do more remote management I want to I want to do Wi-Fi more hotels and

1195
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:57,580
part of that is going to involve provisioning if you will a sales team I need people that

1196
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:02,420
will go out and sell these products in addition to me because I need to spend my time working

1197
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:05,900
on the actual business and so I need people to continue sales and continue to move the

1198
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:09,500
business forward but I also need to because I'm a control freak whatever you want to

1199
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,140
call it I like to keep track of all these things and I like to have a I like to wake

1200
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:17,460
up and sit down in my office and I like to have an idea of at least an idea of what all

1201
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,460
of the people that work for this place are doing because after all my name's on the

1202
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:25,540
building I want to know and so I have looked for a CRM and basically what I've come down

1203
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:33,500
to is ZURMO it is an it is an open source CRM that is completely web-based so you could

1204
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:37,340
spin this up on something like DigitalOcean and it would cost you practically nothing

1205
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:43,100
and this will allow you to track your customers track your sales and and so basically what

1206
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,280
we are going to use it for is we are going to use it to focus on customers because one

1207
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,900
thing you have to you one thing you have to get right there's a difference between serving

1208
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:55,320
somebody and annoying the heck out of them if you if we go into a hotel and they have

1209
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,360
crappy Wi-Fi and so they are losing hundreds of dollars a month or thousands of dollars

1210
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:04,100
a month because these days Wi-Fi is just as critical as hot water and we go into that

1211
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:08,440
place and we say for five thousand dollars we will go through and we will increase your

1212
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,620
revenue by two thousand dollars a month because you're gonna have that many more guests because

1213
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:17,940
your guests demand Wi-Fi if we can do that that is not bothering somebody that is not

1214
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:24,980
selling the that is not the that you know the the the the stereotype of selling somebody

1215
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,420
something it is it's serving somebody and we are taking we guess we're gonna get paid

1216
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:33,900
for our efforts and but we are going to make you more money than than we cost you there's

1217
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:38,260
a difference between doing that and then just cold calling places and saying hi I'm Noah

1218
01:17:38,260 --> 01:17:41,700
with all the speed and I want you to buy my Wi-Fi you know that that is not a that is

1219
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,260
not helping that just annoying somebody and so there are little things you can do for

1220
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:49,380
example you know you you when you go in and talk to somebody you say well how do I you

1221
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:52,180
know can we follow up can we follow up in a couple of days can I give you a call if

1222
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:56,700
they say yes then you're that does not bothering somebody's not harassing somebody to call

1223
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:59,700
them back two days like you said you were going to do and follow up with them and if

1224
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:04,080
they say we're not interested then you know you move on but we need a way to track who

1225
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:08,180
has been called who hasn't been called because sometimes you walk into a place and you say

1226
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:12,140
I'll do X Y Z and it'll cost you X Y Z and they say yeah that's great and now they're

1227
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:15,580
waiting for you to come in and do the thing that you promised to do and so you need a

1228
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:19,260
way to track that and so that's kind of what we're doing at the CM does that sound kind

1229
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:23,980
of similar to what you're looking for yes I was hoping that I see a web-based CRM would

1230
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:32,180
be the solution I tried some of them and VMs on my VM host at home like the VTiger sugar

1231
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:38,140
CRM and some others but most of them look like way over complicated for for my basic

1232
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:43,280
needs at the moment so yeah I haven't came across dermal but I'll be definitely installing

1233
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:47,340
it tonight and I'll check it out sure yeah check out check out Zermal I think you'll

1234
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:52,220
find that's that's a pretty decent one to go to and it's definitely the one that Alta

1235
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:58,880
speed is going to look at and I will follow up as either an app pick or as maybe a show

1236
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:05,020
episode idea about that later hey if you haven't heard we do this show every week or Chris

1237
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:13,140
and Wes do the show every week this week they're out on location filming interviews so they're

1238
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:17,340
not here so that's why I'm filling in and we would like your I would like your opinion

1239
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:22,780
I would like to know how you thought this show went if you like this segment if you

1240
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:27,480
want us to do this kind of episode again Chris and I are talking about spinning this off

1241
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:32,500
as its own show it would be a call-in show I assume that I've done an okay job hosting

1242
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:37,820
it and that he would let that continue but that's basically what we're looking forward

1243
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:42,420
to and we need to know so head over to Jupiter broadcasting comm click on the contact link

1244
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:47,180
choose Linux unplugged from the drop-down menu and let us know what you think mostly

1245
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:53,340
just as this is a show this is not going to replace unplugged we I sorely sorely apologize

1246
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:59,180
to our mobile room for the I was told early on in the episode that basically they can't

1247
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:03,300
hear what's going on from the from the calls there's no way to tie those in so I need to

1248
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:09,860
have a bigger mixer to make that happen and but we we very much value your contribution

1249

1253
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:34,540
that I'm the co-host of the Linux action show that's every Sunday mornings at noon on Sundays

1254
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:40,540
that's Pacific time a special thank you to Rekai our video editor Michael tunnel our

producer and everyone in Jupiter broadcasting who makes this show and every other show on

1256
01:20:45,420 --> 01:21:15,380
the network possible and we'll see you back here next week.

1257
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:58,420
All right now that that is over I am let's hear to do I didn't here's the thing if I

1258
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:01,660
would have seen somebody from Germany anyone that's calling especially from Germany I would

1259
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:11,240
have taken idea to do here we go Jay hold up let's see what's up Jay Jay from Germany

1260
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:17,340
do I have you me hi I'm sorry I'm glad you said something in the chat room I the thing

1261
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:22,740
is it doesn't tell me I have to I it the way that it works it doesn't go in in any specific

1262
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:26,780
order just kind of goes in the order that people called in and I've got like 15 calls

1263
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:31,540
in 15 calls that I haven't gotten to but we're like we're literally 40 minutes over what

1264
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:35,100
the show is and Rekai still has to edit this thing and get it out so I had to wrap it up

1265
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,420
but I will answer your question now that we're now that we're off and I'm done recording

1266
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:46,220
how can we help okay thanks I just wanted to ask how much pain is it changing from one

1267
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:54,180
main Linux distro to another so are you locked in like with Microsoft or is it harder or

1268
01:22:54,180 --> 01:23:03,300
less hard because I fear I'm currently locked into the Ubuntu system yes so I you know it's

1269
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,060
funny it's it's really interesting you ask that because I have actually just gone through

1270
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:11,980
that this week I have switched from an Ubuntu based distro over to enter goes and what I

1271
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:19,620
have found was that it actually isn't that bad most especially when you go from a very

1272
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:23,780
well-supported Linux distro to another very well-supported Linux distro you don't run

1273
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:27,860
into a lot of pain it you know anything that's available in Ubuntu is pretty much available

1274
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:31,400
enter goes now where it wouldn't be so smooth is if you went from something like Ubuntu

1275
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,500
to Fedora I love Fedora I think Fedora is a great operating system I think Red Hat is

1276
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:41,220
the best Linux company out there and if that's not clear let me say that again I think Red

1277
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:48,380
Hat is the best Linux company out there but I don't think that they're I don't think that

1278
01:23:48,380 --> 01:23:54,380
they have a desktop offering that that fits exactly what I'm looking for these days and

1279
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:58,540
that is that a rock-solid desktop operating system that's designed for a business class

1280
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:05,140
system that I don't have to do anything with for a couple of years but even knowing that

1281
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,860
even knowing that how much I love Red Hat the company and I've been a Fedora user since

1282
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:14,860
version one there are some things that I just never could get to work right in Fedora GNS3

1283
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:19,740
which is a network simulator when I was doing my networking certification would not run

1284
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:25,380
in Fedora so I had to run Ubuntu in a virtual box inside of Fedora to run GNS3 yeah I know

1285
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:30,020
it's ridiculous right that might change now but KVM yeah yeah but five years ago six years

1286
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:34,980
ago that was the case GNS3 would not run Harupad the to the rest of my knowledge it there is

1287
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:40,060
no precompiled binary for there's no there's no RPM or it's not in any repo you have to

1288
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:46,020
extract and and you know and run the the actual binary so if you go to an uns you know a less

1289
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:52,460
supported less used Linux distro you might run into some of that but yeah if you stick

1290
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:58,780
with main distros I don't think you're gonna have a problem at all so no problem switching

1291
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:02,740
to arch not at all now I think you're gonna be fine in fact I think you're going I think

1292
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:09,260
you're gonna find that your your experience is a lot smoother on arch so it's just going

1293
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:17,260
to be a reinstall and copy files or could I do this even in a more or less hot like

1294
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:26,140
state where I install the new system onto the old one well I don't know that you can

1295
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:32,260
cop you know if it's just a folder full of binaries it would it'll probably run and if

1296
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,180
you copy over something like your home folder you might keep your bookmarks and stuff like

1297
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:41,220
that in general I would probably expect to have to reinstall your programs and reconfigure

1298
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:45,560
things I don't know that you're going to be able to quite that seamlessly smooth over

1299
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,940
but what I guess what I mean is all your programs are going to be available if you have any

1300
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:52,420
database files or or personal files you'd be able to back those up and restore them

1301
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:56,180
without any problem things like your Firefox bookmarks or Chrome bookmarks or something

1302
01:25:56,180 --> 01:26:00,860
like that yeah you could move a home folder over that wouldn't be a problem but yeah I

1303
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:05,160
don't think you're just going to be it is possible Google actually swapped their Red

1304
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,380
Hat servers for Ubuntu without ever even turning them off they literally swap like one file

1305
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,700
at a time yeah yeah and they made a presentation about it and it was wicked cool so it I'm

1306
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:18,260
not saying it can't be done it is definitely possible it's probably ten times more work

1307
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:21,920
than it would be just to back your stuff up and reinstall but I don't think you're going

1308
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:34,660
to find that to be overly burdensome.
