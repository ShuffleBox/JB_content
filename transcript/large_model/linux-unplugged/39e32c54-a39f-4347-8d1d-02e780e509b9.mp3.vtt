00:00.000 --> 00:14.200
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux podcast.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
My name is Chris.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
My name is Wes.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.040
Hello, Wes, you handsome bastard.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.360
You know, this episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, the leader in learning for the

00:21.360 --> 00:23.440
Cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.360
You know, they got them hundreds of courses and thousands of them hands-on labs.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.560
So go get certified.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.280
Go get hired and get learning at cloudguru.com.

00:31.280 --> 00:35.800
Today on the show, we find out the latest developments in WireGuard.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.640
What the heck is going on with WireGuard?

00:37.640 --> 00:41.760
Turns out a lot, and our favorite VPN just got even better.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.280
Jim Salter joins us in just a bit to chat about that.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.400
Plus we have some community news.

00:47.400 --> 00:53.480
We have pics, we have feedback, and even more, including one, Mr. Brent.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.480
Hey, Brent.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.480
Well, hi, Chris.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.960
You're joining me right here right now.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.160
You know what we need to do?

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
What is that?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.240
We need to say time appropriate greetings to that virtual log.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
Hello.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.240
Hello.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.240
Hello.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.640
Hello, everybody.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.640
Thank you for joining us.

01:08.640 --> 01:12.720
I don't really know how many are in there today because we are remote on the road.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.760
So I'm not actually looking at the Mumble Room right now.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.200
Sounds to me like a whole fluffle of them.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.200
I go with a fluffle.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.520
I could definitely go with a fluffle.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.640
Yeah, I could see that.

01:19.640 --> 01:20.640
Yeah.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.040
So Brent and I are here in Salt Lake City right now.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.800
We're on the road trip, you know, winding our way out to Denver.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.600
We just had our first meetup in Salt Lake City, and it was great.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.280
It was really good people.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.720
There was all kinds, all walks there.

01:33.720 --> 01:37.400
And I don't know, it just turned out even better than I think we expected.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.500
I was really impressed with how many people showed up.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.960
We didn't really have final numbers.

01:41.960 --> 01:42.960
That's kind of how it goes.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.400
But we had to keep adding tables as people walked in.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
It was really great.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
Yeah.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.540
And we had, well, we had security analysts there.

01:48.540 --> 01:52.680
We had software developers, engineers, people that were just learning about Linux and were

01:52.680 --> 01:53.960
curious about the Linux community.

01:53.960 --> 01:55.960
I mean, it was, it was pretty nice.

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
It's wonderful.

01:56.960 --> 01:57.960
It was.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.880
And Brent in the entire time has been crammed in here with the family in Lady Joops, where

02:01.880 --> 02:03.120
we are recording right now.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.640
I think that's Uncle Brent to you.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.640
That's right.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.640
Yeah.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.640
Yeah.

02:07.640 --> 02:08.720
Especially after you went to war in the pool recently.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
I think I lost.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.720
I'm not sure.

02:10.720 --> 02:11.720
You always lose, Brent.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.280
When it comes to that, you just pay for it later.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.280
But I'm curious.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.280
So how has it been?

02:17.280 --> 02:20.800
I, you know, I thought maybe you were a little crazy coming along with us because there's

02:20.800 --> 02:27.000
a, you, me, the wife, three kids and a dog in this a 37 foot RV right now.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
It's true.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.760
Now looking back, I think I should have thought about it a little bit more, but I will say

02:32.760 --> 02:33.760
so.

02:33.760 --> 02:34.760
Yeah.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.760
Day one and two was like heavy learning curve for how to do the RV life and I kept getting

02:40.760 --> 02:46.640
tips from everybody and the kids are great at saying, no, no, you got to do it this way.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.640
They're experts.

02:47.640 --> 02:48.640
Yeah.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.640
They're pros now.

02:49.640 --> 02:54.160
But we're in, I don't know even which day we are, it was day five, seven, seven, six,

02:54.160 --> 02:55.160
seven, something like that.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.160
Yeah.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.120
I feel like we've got this amazing routine, you know, when it's like, okay, lights are

03:01.120 --> 03:02.120
out soon.

03:02.120 --> 03:06.160
It's everybody just kind of buzzes around and nobody has any questions.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.320
It's just like autopilot.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.780
You've gotten some quintessential RV life.

03:09.780 --> 03:14.360
You've gotten the campground experience where we've had a very, very, very loud campground.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.780
You got some off-grid boondocking experiences where we're going off of battery.

03:18.780 --> 03:21.160
You even had the, oh crap, we got to pull over.

03:21.160 --> 03:26.760
There's a horrible windstorm situation where we were in Jerome, Idaho and the winds were

03:26.760 --> 03:30.900
getting up to 25, 30 miles per hour and we just decided to pull over and spend an evening

03:30.900 --> 03:32.720
in a parking lot at a Shell station.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.800
I would say we made the best of that situation having those, what we grilled a bunch of tacos

03:36.800 --> 03:37.800
and stuff.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.800
Yeah.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.800
That was actually one of my favorite nights.

03:39.800 --> 03:44.440
It's been pretty great because I've got Brent following behind me in the focus and so I

03:44.440 --> 03:49.840
can like relay messages to Brent like, I can be like, hey there Brent, we're going to pull

03:49.840 --> 03:54.240
over here in a couple of minutes, so keep an eye out for the next exit.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.280
10-4 there Jeeps.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.280
And that's been pretty great.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.360
So we got the two-way radios.

04:00.360 --> 04:05.000
And so we were in Idaho and I had to radio Brent, I had to say, I think we're going to

04:05.000 --> 04:07.440
pull over, we're going to fuel up and we're going to check the weather because things

04:07.440 --> 04:08.840
are getting pretty bad.

04:08.840 --> 04:13.200
And we parked for a bit and we just couldn't get any information.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.800
We just couldn't figure out what was going on.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.260
Idaho kind of has like stuff spread out all over different web pages.

04:20.260 --> 04:26.360
So eventually I was relieved when we found the ultimate Idaho resource.

04:26.360 --> 04:32.000
It turns out there's a Drive Idaho podcast that is done by the transportation of Idaho

04:32.000 --> 04:34.160
and it's all about Idaho's roads.

04:34.160 --> 04:38.280
Hello and welcome back to the Drive Idaho podcast.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.440
I am your host, Vincent from Bully.

04:40.440 --> 04:45.400
I am the Chief Communication Officer for the Idaho Transportation Department and the Idaho

04:45.400 --> 04:46.880
Transportation Board.

04:46.880 --> 04:51.360
It is my pleasure to host these podcasts now for three years.

04:51.360 --> 04:56.720
In season three, this is episode number seven, Boy How Time Flies.

04:56.720 --> 05:02.000
Three years of the Idaho Drive podcast or Drive Idaho podcast and every episode is packed

05:02.000 --> 05:05.520
full of insightful information that really had us riveted while we were trying to figure

05:05.520 --> 05:07.680
out if we could survive on the road.

05:07.680 --> 05:14.040
And one of the things we've been using most recently is ultra high performance concrete,

05:14.040 --> 05:20.600
which is very strong concrete, almost has the strength of steel.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.640
And we've been using that innovation recently.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.640
Yeah.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.440
So you don't want to miss that kind of stuff.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.380
That was really helpful.

05:29.380 --> 05:30.440
So we just didn't know what to do.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.580
We couldn't get any information.

05:31.580 --> 05:32.580
We didn't know what was happening.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.400
We had the wind forecast and they all looked bad.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.680
So we spent the night there and I think we made the right decision.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.040
Yeah, it did seem like the right decision.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.500
And now we know about the Drive Idaho podcast.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.180
So now we've got something to listen to.

05:43.180 --> 05:46.920
And then just this morning, Brent made a special JB breakfast out on the griddle because of

05:46.920 --> 05:48.360
course we brought the griddle with us.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.920
Got to have a griddle on board.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.440
That griddle has been pretty priceless.

05:52.440 --> 05:56.160
I think all of us were a little groggy this morning, so I thought I'd make a special breakfast.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.620
And I think, well, how was it?

05:58.620 --> 05:59.620
It was delicious.

05:59.620 --> 06:06.400
Not only was it packed with protein, but you cooked it in the shape of the letters JB between

06:06.400 --> 06:08.240
the bacon and the eggs.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.320
So that made it really special.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.320
You should post a picture.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.180
It was pretty good.

06:13.180 --> 06:16.120
So then this is our last show that we're recording in Salt Lake City.

06:16.120 --> 06:18.820
Then we hit the road onto Denver.

06:18.820 --> 06:21.640
We'll have that meetup in Denver on August 20th.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.640
That's going to be huge.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.260
We're going to have folks from Linode there.

06:24.260 --> 06:29.160
They're going to be giving away hardware and prizes and gift certificates for Linode services

06:29.160 --> 06:32.040
or whatever you want to call that credit, I suppose.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.040
It's going to be huge.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.560
Plus we're going to have drinks and food.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.980
I heard we're going to have many of our friends there.

06:36.980 --> 06:41.800
Some people from the Ubuntu desktop team, some people from elementary.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.080
Obviously System76 folks are going to be there.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.080
Who else?

06:45.080 --> 06:46.080
Rumor has it.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.080
Rumor has it.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.080
We are probably going to even be joined by other guests that I can't remember at the

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
moment.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.600
That's how you keep it secret around here.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.240
You tell Chris, but he won't remember.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.240
That's very true.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.000
Wes is going to be there.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Alex is going to be there.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.600
That's going to be protein and cheese.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.600
Yeah, absolutely.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.920
So that's going to be a lot of fun too.

07:03.920 --> 07:10.200
But let's talk about who's here right now because Cassidy and Daniel Foray from elementaryOS

07:10.200 --> 07:16.120
are joining us and they have some really particularly fantastic news.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.940
Guys, congratulations on elementaryOS 6's release.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.940
That's super exciting.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.940
Thank you.

07:21.940 --> 07:22.940
Thank you.

07:22.940 --> 07:23.940
Thanks.

07:23.940 --> 07:27.200
So I feel like this has been one that we've been waiting for for a while and there's like

07:27.200 --> 07:33.380
so many things we could talk about, but I think the one that I'd like to start with

07:33.380 --> 07:36.740
and I don't know which one of you wants to take this, but could you just tell us a little

07:36.740 --> 07:41.240
bit about the new touchpad gestures that are supported throughout the OS?

07:41.240 --> 07:42.320
Yeah.

07:42.320 --> 07:50.000
That's thanks actually to a lot of work from Jose Exposito and also from some of the work

07:50.000 --> 07:53.580
that Purism has been doing with Lib Handy.

07:53.580 --> 07:58.480
So we had some like really great community and upstream work that kind of came in at

07:58.480 --> 08:03.760
the right time and we were able to take that and integrate it really well and so we have

08:03.760 --> 08:09.540
gestures not just at the window manager level where we can do things like one-to-one multi-touch

08:09.540 --> 08:16.000
gestures to get into the multitasking view or pinch to zoom or you could do push and

08:16.000 --> 08:21.120
pull to zoom with multiple fingers, stuff like that, but we're also using Handy to get

08:21.120 --> 08:23.840
gestures inside applications as well.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.120
So you can do things like two fingers swipe to go back, navigate in system settings or

08:28.120 --> 08:31.840
in web or in a bunch of other places throughout the OS.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.280
Man, it's so smooth.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.280
It's so slick looking.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.600
I mean, I experimented with an earlier version of it, not even the final version and was

08:39.600 --> 08:42.640
just so, so happy with how that all worked.

08:42.640 --> 08:47.880
Cassidy, I know also this has sort of been the accumulation of a lot of the thinking

08:47.880 --> 08:53.000
and work around dark theming and can you explain to us how dark theming now works in elementary

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
OS 6?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.120
Because I'm not necessarily going to have every app that's dark, right?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.120
Yeah.

08:58.120 --> 09:03.080
So we've been really careful to do an opt-in dark style.

09:03.080 --> 09:08.880
So by default, you can choose it in the system and all your system maps and the default apps

09:08.880 --> 09:13.000
and things like the panel and doc will switch to a dark style, but we're not going to force

09:13.000 --> 09:16.960
a dark style on third-party apps because they might have custom styles.

09:16.960 --> 09:22.120
They might be forcing a specific text color and switching the background out to dark would

09:22.120 --> 09:23.540
make it unreadable.

09:23.540 --> 09:28.740
So we ensure that app developers can opt into that through a really simple system API.

09:28.740 --> 09:32.600
And we're also working with the free desktop community and other desktops like Gnome and

09:32.600 --> 09:37.360
toolkits like GTK to ensure that that can be supported across desktops as well.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.760
Like a real standard or something.

09:38.760 --> 09:39.760
Yeah.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.560
It'll be a standard where, you know, theoretically a cross-platform app like Firefox or Chrome

09:43.560 --> 09:48.520
could even hook into that and use the same dark style like they do on other platforms.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.520
Oh boy.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.600
I hope that takes off.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.840
That really seems like that's the great way to split that problem where some developers

09:54.840 --> 09:58.580
are concerned that you're forcing a style onto an application so it won't look correctly.

09:58.580 --> 10:02.480
But this kind of system, this sort of opt-in system, that just seems like a great way to

10:02.480 --> 10:03.480
do it.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.960
I know there's also just, there's so many things we could talk about here.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.680
I love the new accent colors, the way they look and the way they affect everything from

10:10.680 --> 10:15.240
like your suggested action buttons to tech selection and all of that.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.840
Such a nice subtle, subtle effect.

10:16.840 --> 10:17.840
Yeah.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.840
It looks so sharp.

10:18.840 --> 10:20.360
It just really pops.

10:20.360 --> 10:24.120
There's also though a couple of shifts in applications.

10:24.120 --> 10:30.920
I think this is where we're seeing a big embrace by the project around Flatpaks and how Flatpak

10:30.920 --> 10:32.400
security is going to work.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.640
Can one of you guys talk to that a little bit?

10:34.640 --> 10:39.360
Because one of the things I noticed is there's that new permissions view in system settings

10:39.360 --> 10:43.800
that will show you, I think, I haven't tried this yet, but I think what it does is it kind

10:43.800 --> 10:47.360
of shows you what each portal Flatpak apps have been granted.

10:47.360 --> 10:50.360
Like it's a centralized place for people to view and manage this.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.360
Yeah.

10:51.360 --> 10:56.920
We really embraced Flatpak in a big way and we're trying to build like a complete story

10:56.920 --> 11:01.240
around Flatpak and not just like, Oh, we're shipping a couple of Flatpak apps.

11:01.240 --> 11:06.640
But like you said, with managing permissions and the entire app center publishing flow

11:06.640 --> 11:08.280
is all built around Flatpak.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.380
Now we provide a Flatpak runtime for developers to target.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.120
And also we ship our sideload app.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.880
So our sideload method for elementary OS is Flatpak apps.

11:19.880 --> 11:24.760
And we tell people, you know, Hey, you can download Flatpaks from Flat Hub or from wherever

11:24.760 --> 11:26.900
else, you know, people might be distributing them.

11:26.900 --> 11:31.400
So we're really trying to embrace like this entire Flatpak model.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
Yeah.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.240
I mean, this is such a great example of when you guys do something, you really go all the

11:36.240 --> 11:37.240
way.

11:37.240 --> 11:42.760
It just feels integrated and it feels like it's just completely like a complete solution

11:42.760 --> 11:44.520
with that extra system setting in there.

11:44.520 --> 11:50.400
I know that Mail has also seen a total rewrite for elementary OS 6 and there's also a new

11:50.400 --> 11:51.400
tasks app.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
Yeah.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.900
Online accounts is another big one that we've been looking at and there's been a lot of

11:56.900 --> 12:05.160
work from our community upstream and evolution data server to help make it easily consumable

12:05.160 --> 12:08.440
with Vala and improving the language bindings.

12:08.440 --> 12:13.280
So we were able to take that work and then completely rebuild Mail around evolution data

12:13.280 --> 12:15.340
server and this new tasks app.

12:15.340 --> 12:21.260
And we completely rebuilt all our online account stuff around hooking accounts into evolution

12:21.260 --> 12:22.260
data server.

12:22.260 --> 12:27.080
So we've really got this great foundation now to be able to start going a lot deeper

12:27.080 --> 12:32.000
into online accounts and to do that work upstream.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
That's awesome.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
That's great to hear.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.300
Now, you know, you know, I got to ask, let's talk about release timeline.

12:37.300 --> 12:40.040
Some people have been waiting for a long time to see this release.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.240
How do you guys feel?

12:41.240 --> 12:42.240
Did you hit the mark?

12:42.240 --> 12:47.320
What, did it take longer than you'd like to see or is there really no expectation here?

12:47.320 --> 12:48.520
What's your thoughts on that?

12:48.520 --> 12:49.520
It's been a long road.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.720
Like, I mean, we said in our announcement blog post, like there was a whole global pandemic

12:53.720 --> 12:59.840
dropped on us in the middle of development, which definitely affected the timeline a bit.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.400
But you know, we've always been about when it's ready rather than a hard release date

13:03.400 --> 13:05.320
and we want to make sure we're getting things right.

13:05.320 --> 13:10.000
I know this cycle we had a lot of really big features like the multi-touch and like flat

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
pack and rewriting, not just our packaging for our own apps, but rewriting the whole

13:16.000 --> 13:19.800
backend for App Center itself for how developers submit their apps.

13:19.800 --> 13:23.500
So there was a lot of work that went into it that had to be done.

13:23.500 --> 13:27.600
And I think given that, given all the circumstances, I think it came out at a good time.

13:27.600 --> 13:32.400
It definitely seems like the features that have landed here are kind of the kind of features

13:32.400 --> 13:39.000
that check my boxes because what I feel like I'm sort of noticing is a slow increase in

13:39.000 --> 13:41.600
what I can customize throughout the distro.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.600
Yeah, absolutely.

13:42.600 --> 13:46.360
There's, you know, there's always, people will always say, you know, elementary OS,

13:46.360 --> 13:47.360
you can't change anything.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.940
You can't right click on anything.

13:48.940 --> 13:51.920
You can't customize your theme.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.820
And you know, there's trade-offs for all of those.

13:53.820 --> 13:58.080
So we've introduced a lot of these options into elementary OS in a way that's well supported

13:58.080 --> 14:02.300
where, you know, users can make their operating system and their computer feel like their

14:02.300 --> 14:07.200
own, but also we don't have to support every possible combination of settings.

14:07.200 --> 14:10.580
So it's always a balance and we're definitely able to move in the direction of offering

14:10.580 --> 14:12.240
more options, which is really nice.

14:12.240 --> 14:14.260
Yeah, that stands out, I think, about this release.

14:14.260 --> 14:18.280
You can tell that the whole team's been weighing and thinking carefully about a lot of these

14:18.280 --> 14:19.280
things.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.420
You know, clearly like the dark style, it's something that's been on a lot of folks' minds

14:21.420 --> 14:25.160
for a long time, but it seems like the project didn't really want to jump into it without

14:25.160 --> 14:26.480
having properly thought that through.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.280
And I think that shows in the user experience.

14:28.280 --> 14:33.260
Yeah, I think that's kind of something that's a theme for us is we're not always necessarily

14:33.260 --> 14:37.680
the first people to do stuff, but when we build a feature, we really want to make sure

14:37.680 --> 14:41.880
that we do it in a way where we can really stand behind it and believe in the direction

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
we took with it.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.520
Man, I am so excited for you guys.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.760
I know the community is really looking forward to this.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.760
The hype was real.

14:47.760 --> 14:53.240
I checked in on Reddit last night on the elementary OS, I've read it and people were piecing together,

14:53.240 --> 14:57.000
reading the Twitter feeds, trying to figure out how close it might be.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah, that's always fun.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.700
Yeah, it was good fun.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.160
It's an interesting problem as a completely open source project.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.160
Everything we do is open source.

15:05.160 --> 15:10.880
We even had the copy for the website on our GitHub profile like days ahead of time, and

15:10.880 --> 15:14.000
we want to be completely transparent, but also we want that hype and that excitement.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.600
So it's always fun to see what people pick up on.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.800
Well, congratulations again, and we'll have links in the show notes if people want to

15:21.800 --> 15:23.560
go grab it and support the project.

15:23.560 --> 15:27.520
I think this is a great opportunity for people to kick in and help with the future developments.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.320
And then we will also have a link to this blog post that Cassidy put together that is

15:32.320 --> 15:36.440
a monster post.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.040
There's so many more things we didn't even get to.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.880
I don't know, do you guys feel like we missed anything pretty critical that we should mention

15:42.880 --> 15:43.880
on the show?

15:43.880 --> 15:47.920
Because I feel like the blog post itself has got another 10, 15 things we didn't even touch

15:47.920 --> 15:48.920
on.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.160
Yeah, I mean, we could probably do a whole show if you want to do a whole show just about

15:52.160 --> 15:53.160
the release.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.160
Yeah.

15:54.160 --> 15:59.440
No, I think the other really big one is we put a lot of work into the installer and kind

15:59.440 --> 16:00.920
of the first run experience.

16:00.920 --> 16:07.180
And so we hope that that helps people that are installing for themselves, but also provides

16:07.180 --> 16:11.640
a better experience if they're installing to give a computer to somebody else or help

16:11.640 --> 16:14.320
us with OEMs that are distributing.

16:14.320 --> 16:19.440
So I think that's a lot of work going in there to make it so that it's a lot easier for people

16:19.440 --> 16:21.440
to install and get elementary OS pre-installed.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.440
Yeah, great.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.720
I'm glad you mentioned that because I do remember that was a point during the beta to have people

16:25.720 --> 16:26.720
test that.

16:26.720 --> 16:31.000
And that seems like a lot of work went into that and it was a very impressive experience

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
when I tried it.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
All right.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.040
Well, thanks for coming on and telling us about the new release.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.040
Congratulations.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.840
And now go get working on the next one.

16:37.840 --> 16:38.840
For sure.

16:38.840 --> 16:39.840
Thanks for having us.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
Thank you.

16:40.840 --> 16:50.080
All right, now, just a really brief deck update because, you know, it is Steam Deck time,

16:50.080 --> 16:51.080
right?

16:51.080 --> 16:52.840
Which is something that I hoped we would not be seeing.

16:52.840 --> 16:59.400
It seems that Valve is working to make sure that Windows, even more recent versions of

16:59.400 --> 17:01.560
Windows, will run on the deck.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.920
Yeah, this is a little disappointing to us Linux diehards anyway.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.440
But it's a bit trickier than it might seem because Microsoft's recent push for a more

17:10.440 --> 17:16.080
secure platform means that there's that whole secure boot and TPM 2.0 requirement if you

17:16.080 --> 17:20.240
want to run Windows 11 without any tricks anyway.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.720
Now this does include the AMD desktop Ryzen 3000 series.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.300
It's got the TPM.

17:25.300 --> 17:30.920
That's based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture, just like the APU in the deck.

17:30.920 --> 17:35.240
But the support for that TPM actually working in the way Windows wants it to requires some

17:35.240 --> 17:36.240
BIOS support.

17:36.240 --> 17:39.880
And that's something that Valve and AMD are currently thinking through.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.320
Yeah, and it sounds like they've already got Windows 10 up and going on it.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.320
Of course.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.520
It's just really about getting Windows 11.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.300
Is this a fatal mistake?

17:48.300 --> 17:52.040
It's kind of like undercutting your platform's best chance in a way.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.840
Well, I mean, how could they not though, right?

17:53.840 --> 17:57.880
I mean, at the end of the day, to be pragmatic, you want people to buy the hardware, you want

17:57.880 --> 18:00.480
them involved in your platform and Steam runs great on Windows.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.800
So yes, I think to some extent, right, it does dilute the message.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.440
But could they really have not done this?

18:05.440 --> 18:06.440
I'm not sure.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.720
Yeah, and I guess it's another feature in that box, right in that checkbox, you know,

18:09.720 --> 18:13.040
it says, hey, I've got, you know, Windows support when you're looking at all the features

18:13.040 --> 18:17.000
of the various competitors, I suppose it's a feature.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.200
Is all your favorite proprietary software?

18:19.200 --> 18:22.260
I think that was the downfall of the Steam machines and not complete downfall.

18:22.260 --> 18:25.140
But I think it contributed to the failure of the Steam machines is that people could

18:25.140 --> 18:28.160
buy them for cheap and then throw Windows on them.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.920
And it just didn't move the needle for Linux gaming.

18:30.920 --> 18:33.880
So it didn't encourage developers to port native games.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.600
And now here we are in a world of Proton.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.400
The other thing I'm curious about is how it's going to run on the system.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.160
You know, if you throw Windows on there, is it all of a sudden going to bog it down in

18:42.160 --> 18:43.160
some way?

18:43.160 --> 18:45.480
That's not the experience they expect.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.820
It also seems like this time around, they've switched where the effort is right before

18:48.820 --> 18:51.880
they were trying to build a platform on Linux, which required buy-in.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.520
And now they're just they're bypassing that, right?

18:53.520 --> 18:54.520
They're not.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.240
I mean, yes, they want developers to better support Proton.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.280
But it seems like some extent they've acknowledged like, well, we're just gonna have to do it.

18:59.280 --> 19:02.720
If we want Proton, if we want to run on Linux, we're going to do the work to make it work.

19:02.720 --> 19:03.720
Yeah.

19:03.720 --> 19:09.260
Well, we can probably guess why Valve rebased Steam OS on Arch from Debian.

19:09.260 --> 19:10.740
But maybe we don't have to guess.

19:10.740 --> 19:12.640
We don't have to guess any longer.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.640
Isn't that nice?

19:13.640 --> 19:18.440
A gamer, one of the lucky few, I know, not us somehow, who recently went to the Valve

19:18.440 --> 19:19.440
HQ.

19:19.440 --> 19:25.360
Well, there spoke to a Valve designer, Lawrence Yang, who noted, so Arch Linux, one of the

19:25.360 --> 19:27.360
main reasons, and there's a couple.

19:27.360 --> 19:32.560
But the main reason is the rolling updates of Arch allows us to have more rapid development

19:32.560 --> 19:33.560
for Steam OS 3.0.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.040
We were making a bunch of updates and changes to specifically make sure that things work

19:37.040 --> 19:43.360
well for the deck, and Arch just ended up being a better choice.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.440
Linode.com slash unplugged.

19:45.440 --> 19:49.080
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.280
And of course, you go there to support the show.

19:51.280 --> 19:55.160
Linode is where we host everything now, and they've really been focused on making it the

19:55.160 --> 19:59.400
absolute best Linux experience in the cloud for 18 years.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.920
They're independently owned, and that's what they have been doing.

20:01.920 --> 20:07.320
That means things are fast, like the rigs, the networking, the dashboard, even the customer

20:07.320 --> 20:08.320
support.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.740
Linode really has the best human customer support, and you can get them by phone, ticket,

20:11.740 --> 20:13.520
or even on social media.

20:13.520 --> 20:18.120
Our most recent Linode deployment has got to be probably our colony tracking server

20:18.120 --> 20:19.360
that we're using for this road trip.

20:19.360 --> 20:25.600
I have a client that runs on my phone, and that pings own tracks running on Linode every

20:25.600 --> 20:29.240
time the phone detects a certain amount of movement.

20:29.240 --> 20:34.320
And then own tracks renders out an embeddable web view, and we are displaying that over

20:34.320 --> 20:38.760
at colonytracker.live, all running on top of Linode.

20:38.760 --> 20:43.480
The entire stack, heck, pretty much the entire business is running on Linode while we're

20:43.480 --> 20:44.480
on the road.

20:44.480 --> 20:48.080
I had to offload a bunch of stuff into the cloud from my local server, even what I've

20:48.080 --> 20:52.560
relied on for years, just because I was having stability issues.

20:52.560 --> 20:56.200
You can build from their marketplace as well, like with one click deployments and get going

20:56.200 --> 20:57.800
really quick.

20:57.800 --> 21:02.440
That's nice, but you can also DIY if that's how you prefer.

21:02.440 --> 21:07.160
You can also create your own images, and then they even have community scripts, stack scripts,

21:07.160 --> 21:11.120
that sometimes even have multiple distributions you can choose from.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.520
There's a lot of options.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.600
So that's why I think the $100 is great, because you can go over there and really experience

21:16.600 --> 21:17.600
it.

21:17.600 --> 21:22.240
Get that visceral Linode experience, if you will, DIY it up if you like, or deploy from

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
the marketplace.

21:23.240 --> 21:26.240
They've got 11 data centers around the world you can choose from.

21:26.240 --> 21:30.600
So that $100 means when you go over there, you're really going to kick the tires, but

21:30.600 --> 21:33.200
you got to go to linode.com slash unplugged.

21:33.200 --> 21:37.520
That's how you support the show, and that's how you get the $100 in credit.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
Try it out.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.520
Experiment with something.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.960
That's how I got started, and that's how I got hooked, and I didn't even have $100 credit.

21:42.960 --> 21:47.280
I tell you what, I did it on my own dime, and I stuck with it, and I love it absolutely.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.960
I can enthusiastically recommend them to you.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.680
I have no doubt you'll find something to do over there to deploy, to test, and even to

21:53.680 --> 21:54.680
enjoy.

21:54.680 --> 21:59.040
So go try it for yourself and support independent content like this here program, and get $100

21:59.040 --> 22:02.000
in credit for yourself for 60 days on a new account.

22:02.000 --> 22:07.880
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.520
Well with you on the road, Chris, we've really been putting our WireGuard setup to the test.

22:12.520 --> 22:17.000
I mean, this weekend we were recording LAN and having no ends of trouble with our usual

22:17.000 --> 22:20.720
tools establishing a good connection that we could actually record over, but always

22:20.720 --> 22:23.080
the first thing we try is WireGuarding back to the studio.

22:23.080 --> 22:27.640
Yeah, it's like this, maybe it's a carrier problem troubleshooting step, and it actually

22:27.640 --> 22:33.160
works sometimes as we just kind of bypass filtering and use WireGuard, and I'm using

22:33.160 --> 22:37.560
it right now to pull up the mixer and control the mixer in the studio for the remote production

22:37.560 --> 22:41.240
that we're doing, because it all streams through the studio even when we're not there, and

22:41.240 --> 22:44.800
the way we connect back to that to do that is over WireGuard.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.960
So to say it's mission critical would be an understatement, and there's been some updates

22:48.960 --> 22:54.320
recently, and something that Wes and I have been kicking around digging into is, is there

22:54.320 --> 22:58.480
an improvement in the state of management tools, because WireGuard itself is kind of

22:58.480 --> 23:01.600
a lower level technology, right?

23:01.600 --> 23:05.440
It's an enabler, but you need kind of some user space applications on top of that to

23:05.440 --> 23:06.440
manage it.

23:06.440 --> 23:07.440
Well, yeah, right?

23:07.440 --> 23:10.400
I mean, what happens when you dump water all over your computer and then you need a new

23:10.400 --> 23:12.680
WireGuard key given to you, right?

23:12.680 --> 23:14.560
Too soon, dude, too soon.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.040
And as you say there, WireGuard is great, but you kind of just get some command line

23:18.040 --> 23:19.040
tools.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.040
There's like wg-quick for the command line, you can do systemd services, but you still

23:22.040 --> 23:25.040
got to manage all the peers and stuff yourself, you might be running scripts, you might forget

23:25.040 --> 23:28.240
exactly what you need to do if you don't use it all the time.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.440
And we were kind of early on the WireGuard thing, right?

23:30.440 --> 23:33.600
We were compiling the module, we were using it before, you probably should have used it

23:33.600 --> 23:34.600
in production.

23:34.600 --> 23:39.200
But that meant there wasn't really a rich set of tooling ready to go to help us kind

23:39.200 --> 23:43.440
of do the next level of admin stuff for everyone that might need access to the JB Studio or

23:43.440 --> 23:45.760
just for our own personal stuff.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.760
That's changed though.

23:46.760 --> 23:51.720
I mean, wow, I was kind of just trying to do a little mini review of what are the available

23:51.720 --> 23:52.720
things?

23:52.720 --> 23:53.720
What's still being maintained?

23:53.720 --> 23:56.040
Because, you know, things pop up all the time, but they might be maintained for a year and

23:56.040 --> 23:58.240
then people move on to other tools.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.080
There are so many options now.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.620
Yeah, I actually wasn't even sure like what would be the right fit for us.

24:03.620 --> 24:06.600
Because like the web based stuff seems too much.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.400
But the command line based stuff seemed like it was too little.

24:09.400 --> 24:16.720
But I noticed that you found like, one, two, three, four different command line apps for

24:16.720 --> 24:20.220
managing WireGuard users and keys.

24:20.220 --> 24:22.280
Do you even feel like it's that necessary?

24:22.280 --> 24:26.960
I guess it's necessary if only one person on the team knows how to use the core tools

24:26.960 --> 24:30.240
and then you want other people to have the capability of managing it.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.840
Maybe that's where it becomes necessary.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.160
That's just it, right?

24:33.160 --> 24:37.200
We've kind of come a bit farther from everyone having to read the Arch Wiki article on how

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
to use WireGuard.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.980
I'll get it configured and understand like what the configuration files are.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.440
Now we've got clients for our phone, you've got QR codes you can scan, you know, that's

24:44.440 --> 24:46.720
the next level of user for WireGuard.

24:46.720 --> 24:52.340
And yeah, if you do have a setup where you've kind of got one person or a team of admins,

24:52.340 --> 24:55.900
you might want some helpers that can, you know, give you a list of stuff that all the

24:55.900 --> 24:57.300
keys that you've got.

24:57.300 --> 24:58.520
And there's a huge range here.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.200
Some stuff is just at the shell script, or there's a clever Perl script that uses the

25:02.200 --> 25:06.800
same configuration you've got with WG Quick, but lets you add comments and metadata and

25:06.800 --> 25:10.640
sort of query that as an information base in a way that you can't do with the standard

25:10.640 --> 25:11.640
tools.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.580
And then you've got stuff that sucks all that data inside of it itself.

25:14.580 --> 25:19.360
So some of its YAML, there's one called WG Manage, which has a snap and all the stuff

25:19.360 --> 25:20.660
stored in one YAML file.

25:20.660 --> 25:23.120
So if you like that, have at it.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.240
Another one I've been looking at in particular is called DSNet.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.140
And that's got kind of the same idea.

25:28.140 --> 25:30.000
It's all stored in a JSON blob.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.280
So that's one layer of how do you want to interact with it?

25:32.280 --> 25:35.440
Some of them have, you know, different styles of interfaces.

25:35.440 --> 25:40.440
And then some, like DSNet, well, they don't have a full true sort of GUI to do the admin

25:40.440 --> 25:41.440
side.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.100
They do have GUIs on the reporting side.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.400
It's got a sort of monitor for the actual server itself.

25:46.400 --> 25:51.000
So it'll show you the WireGuard send and receive traffic if you don't have net data installed.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.480
And it can make you a little handy HTML report of what all the IPs you have are, who's online

25:56.480 --> 25:57.760
or offline.

25:57.760 --> 26:02.040
And so this is more of a whole server infrastructure, not just a script.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.040
Yeah.

26:03.040 --> 26:06.960
And also like how much transfer up and down they're using with the description field in

26:06.960 --> 26:07.960
there.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.080
Now this is really cool looking.

26:09.080 --> 26:13.360
So this sits on top of DSNet and it generates this information.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.680
It's not part of DSNet itself.

26:14.680 --> 26:15.680
Yeah.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.880
So there's no, the monitoring is a side project by another individual, but it is, I think,

26:18.880 --> 26:23.720
officially, you know, the official monitoring dashboard for DSNet.

26:23.720 --> 26:28.040
So external, the HTML report, on the other hand, that's built right in.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.040
Ah, okay.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.040
Okay.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.120
So now talking about GUIs.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.160
So that was, those were command line applications.

26:33.160 --> 26:38.480
We'll have links to all of that with information in the show notes, like we do, but maybe we

26:38.480 --> 26:42.480
should just quickly talk about something that we used to use that we've kind of backed off

26:42.480 --> 26:45.560
on, but it's not necessarily a bad project and that's subspace.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.820
Yes, subspace.

26:46.820 --> 26:50.200
Just a simple WireGuard VPN server GUI, a web GUI at that.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.200
Yeah.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.200
And it looks pretty nice.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
It's kind of got what you'd expect, right?

26:53.200 --> 26:54.200
Just a nice little dashboard.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.480
You can see all your devices and it's got a little handy helper form.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.500
If you want to go add a new device, it can show you QR codes.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.280
We were excited about this because it kind of came out early.

27:01.280 --> 27:05.040
It was one of the first like really full featured and there was a service packing and they'd

27:05.040 --> 27:09.720
sort of put the stuff that they used for their own internal paid service out in the open

27:09.720 --> 27:12.200
source world, which is awesome.

27:12.200 --> 27:16.680
Unfortunately, it hasn't really been touched since then.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.080
And that was kind of the problem we ran into is it had a lot of good ideas, but not everything

27:20.080 --> 27:21.080
was fully fleshed out.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.920
And I'm not sure if that was just, you know, it had been a code dump over the wall or they

27:24.920 --> 27:29.000
were still working on that internally, but in any case, it meant it was just sort of

27:29.000 --> 27:30.320
half finished.

27:30.320 --> 27:34.520
And there's downsides when you go with some of these more complicated systems is all the

27:34.520 --> 27:37.760
data lives in its own custom config.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.340
And that meant if there were problems with subspace, like we've been doing a bunch of

27:40.340 --> 27:44.640
updates on our scheduling arch based server, and at one point there were some issues with

27:44.640 --> 27:49.240
mismatch versions from what the subspace container was built on and what the host was using.

27:49.240 --> 27:52.040
And that meant I had to go muck around with all the internals and it wasn't as easy.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.960
I would have liked to just be able to like pull all the keys out or add a new key by

27:54.960 --> 27:57.320
hand on the command line if the GUI wasn't operational.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.720
Yeah, maybe not as big of an issue on an LTS version of Linux.

28:00.720 --> 28:04.040
Yeah, that may have been better, but I don't know that that's really how we want to operate

28:04.040 --> 28:05.040
our server necessarily.

28:05.040 --> 28:09.600
I think we like moving ahead and that would have felt like a workaround to this project

28:09.600 --> 28:13.160
not really keeping up with the state of WireGuard and the kernel as well, I think.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.040
We wanted something that was a current base.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.160
Yeah, exactly.

28:16.160 --> 28:21.480
Now in a development I had missed out on, there is now an actively maintained community

28:21.480 --> 28:22.480
fork.

28:22.480 --> 28:26.560
It's in the subspace community named GitHub Organization, which is pretty fitting.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.600
And it looks like they're just carrying on development.

28:28.600 --> 28:33.040
So maybe, maybe one option I didn't expect for us to have is to just try switching to

28:33.040 --> 28:34.760
that and see if we like it.

28:34.760 --> 28:35.760
Hmm.

28:35.760 --> 28:36.760
Okay.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.760
That's really interesting.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.040
I definitely have to read up on that after the show.

28:39.040 --> 28:44.120
There was other GUIs you found and this all gets kind of confusing because the names are

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
not great.

28:45.120 --> 28:49.240
Like what I liked about subspace is that's a name that that sticks in my head.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.500
It makes me think of Star Trek.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.500
That's not going anywhere.

28:51.500 --> 29:01.360
But then we've got projects are named like WGUI and WireGuard UI and WGEasy and it just

29:01.360 --> 29:05.840
kind of all blurs together and they're all separate GUIs all kind of trying to accomplish

29:05.840 --> 29:06.840
the same thing.

29:06.840 --> 29:09.520
Did one of these stand out to you over the others?

29:09.520 --> 29:12.000
Yeah, it's tough because there's a lot of good options.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.040
And while I've played with it with most of these, I haven't used any of them really in

29:16.040 --> 29:17.040
anger, right?

29:17.040 --> 29:20.920
We haven't even actually decided what we're going to switch to if we do switch our solution.

29:20.920 --> 29:25.080
I'm tempted by DSNet so far if we don't go the GUI path.

29:25.080 --> 29:30.920
Both WGUI and WireGuard-UI seems like they offer a lot of the same functionality and

29:30.920 --> 29:35.820
pretty much all of these have Docker containers available and several of them are just a single

29:35.820 --> 29:37.080
go binaries you can run.

29:37.080 --> 29:41.760
So the setup should be easy, kind of just pops up a UI and just needs WireGuard installed

29:41.760 --> 29:42.760
on your host system.

29:42.760 --> 29:46.700
So to some extent, it might depend on what admin actions you actually do and how well

29:46.700 --> 29:51.560
that's supported by that particular container and if you like the way that the GUI looks.

29:51.560 --> 29:56.800
That said, there was one that stood out which is called Drago, a flexible configuration

29:56.800 --> 29:59.360
manager for WireGuard networks.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.480
And this has basically, it's trying to take things to the next level.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.640
It can show you the network topology.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.960
It can have overlay spanning networks, kind of approaching some of the ideas that we've

30:08.960 --> 30:11.840
talked about in Nebula, but it can do a whole lot more.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.480
It's got a rest API, automatic IP assignment.

30:14.480 --> 30:19.580
It's also a single binary lightweight and it's really meant to set up encrypted node

30:19.580 --> 30:21.200
to node communication.

30:21.200 --> 30:26.080
And that's where there's a whole other category of like advanced WireGuard tooling that didn't

30:26.080 --> 30:27.480
really exist before as well.

30:27.480 --> 30:32.800
Ooh, I love the way this displays the nodes that are connected to each other.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.960
We'll have a link in the show note where they have an animation that shows you the way they

30:36.960 --> 30:39.500
can visualize the network topology.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.800
That right there is so cool.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.920
But the overall UI does seem clean, seems really straightforward.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.400
And the fact that it's a single binary means it's going to be really simple to get up and

30:49.400 --> 30:50.400
get going.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.900
So that's Drago, D-R-A-G-O.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.820
And I agree, Wes, that does look really compelling.

30:55.820 --> 31:00.320
The only other direction I might suggest people consider going, and I think you might agree,

31:00.320 --> 31:04.640
if you've already got Home Assistant, there is actually a Home Assistant community add

31:04.640 --> 31:08.300
on to turn your Home Assistant box into a WireGuard machine.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.560
And it's essentially just using a container with WireGuard in it to do that.

31:11.560 --> 31:12.560
Yeah.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.560
I mean, why not?

31:13.560 --> 31:15.800
If you're already invested in Home Assistant, if you're not doing the kind of throughput

31:15.800 --> 31:19.280
where you might want to have this on its own dedicated box somewhere on your LAN, you

31:19.280 --> 31:23.560
just want an easy backdoor to some of your home stuff that might want to be trying to

31:23.560 --> 31:27.640
get it back door to your Home Assistant box anyway, this could be a really easy fit.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.920
Although I've got to say, I have not tried this one.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.360
No, no, I haven't either because I like to have it separated out.

31:33.360 --> 31:37.160
But I could see some folks that might want to just sort of combine everything right there

31:37.160 --> 31:40.240
and just have it all managed within the Home Assistant UI, which makes it pretty simple

31:40.240 --> 31:41.400
to add and remove the stuff.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.800
So I could see that.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.120
You've also found some more advanced options out there.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.680
Boy, we got a ton of resources for the show notes on this one.

31:49.680 --> 31:51.440
Seems like there's almost too many options.

31:51.440 --> 31:52.440
Things have really exploded.

31:52.440 --> 31:53.440
Yeah.

31:53.440 --> 31:58.560
So we've got that company tail scale, which has a sort of mesh wire guard proprietary

31:58.560 --> 31:59.560
offering.

31:59.560 --> 32:02.000
Well, they've got some of their stuff open source and someone's written head scale, which

32:02.000 --> 32:06.440
is basically a self hosted implementation of their backend control server.

32:06.440 --> 32:09.440
And then there's a whole bunch of different takes on sort of wire guard mesh networks

32:09.440 --> 32:13.560
at different maturity levels, including stuff for Kubernetes, or there's an interesting

32:13.560 --> 32:18.120
project called auto wire, which integrates with console as a backend and sort of auto

32:18.120 --> 32:21.040
magically give you a wire guard network.

32:21.040 --> 32:25.040
There's also stuff to integrate with OAuth 2 or even a little tiny rust tool wire guard

32:25.040 --> 32:29.760
dash P2P, which uses a distributed hash table sort of bit torrent style to help you set

32:29.760 --> 32:34.000
up peer to peer connections over wire guard.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
That's awesome.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Okay.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
All right.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.480
Now, I want to make a call out here while we're still talking VPN stuff, because we

32:40.480 --> 32:44.180
don't get to do this too often on the show, and we love to geek out about VPNs.

32:44.180 --> 32:49.720
If anybody out there is actively using Nebula in production, that's a VPN technology, a

32:49.720 --> 32:51.720
peer to peer network technology we've talked about before.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.040
If anyone out there is using Nebula, we'd love to hear just a little bit about your

32:55.040 --> 32:56.040
setup.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.760
You don't got to give away the secrets, but just tell us how it's working for you and

32:58.760 --> 33:02.600
how you're using it because we want to do a future episode on Nebula again.

33:02.600 --> 33:07.720
So go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and check out the links at linuxunplug.com slash

33:07.720 --> 33:14.120
418 for links to everything that Wes found and all kinds of additional resources.

33:14.120 --> 33:18.080
And if you're struggling to just sort of put all this together, I want to mention that

33:18.080 --> 33:22.360
our friends over at Cloud Guru have an LPIC-2 Linux engineer exam prep.

33:22.360 --> 33:27.640
Now, this is a course that's designed to cover all the objectives for the LPIC-2-201 exam.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.960
And this is going to give you a lot of good information, a lot of fundamentals, including

33:31.960 --> 33:36.440
how to do capacity planning, utilities and concepts that you should know and use for

33:36.440 --> 33:37.440
that.

33:37.440 --> 33:41.260
And when you've completed the course, you're going to be ready to pass the LPIC-2-201 exam.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.260
And that's pretty great too.

33:42.260 --> 33:46.080
It helps you get certified and helps you understand some of these fundamentals.

33:46.080 --> 33:51.760
We'll have a link to that or you can go to acloudguru.com for that kind of stuff.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.340
Now, we did get a chance to chat with Jim Salter.

33:55.340 --> 33:58.720
You guys probably remember Jim, he used to do TechSnap with Wes.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.280
And now he is on two and a half admins with Alan and Joe.

34:02.280 --> 34:07.000
He also writes for Ars Technica and he's been covering WireGuard for a long time.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.680
And so when some new features in WireGuard landed, we thought he'd probably be the guy

34:10.680 --> 34:14.420
to call up and get the scoop because he usually does a deep dive.

34:14.420 --> 34:19.640
But one of the big things announced recently is a massive improvement for WireGuard on

34:19.640 --> 34:21.040
Windows.

34:21.040 --> 34:26.120
My recollection, Jim, was that they had a user space Go version of WireGuard, but this

34:26.120 --> 34:27.600
is something totally different.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.600
Yeah, exactly.

34:28.600 --> 34:33.360
So, you know, since the earliest days, there have basically been two major implementations

34:33.360 --> 34:39.720
of WireGuard, the Linux in kernel and a user space that was written in Go, Google's user

34:39.720 --> 34:41.440
space programming language.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.700
And the Go version was kind of the portable one that, you know, would get run on other

34:44.700 --> 34:49.560
non Linux operating systems, or you could run it on Linux if, you know, for some reason

34:49.560 --> 34:51.480
you wanted nothing to do with kernel module.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.480
Client of last resort.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.480
Exactly.

34:53.480 --> 35:00.680
So like WireGuard Go is what you'll be using on FreeBSD or Macs or, you know, Windows up

35:00.680 --> 35:05.840
until now and most likely still now, but you have the option of instead using a proper

35:05.840 --> 35:09.440
in kernel implementation called WireGuard NT.

35:09.440 --> 35:13.720
And so I guess the big difference here would be that running it in the kernel is going

35:13.720 --> 35:14.920
to mean what?

35:14.920 --> 35:15.920
Better performance?

35:15.920 --> 35:17.720
Is it going to mean better stability?

35:17.720 --> 35:20.640
What are Windows users going to see as an improvement as switching from user space?

35:20.640 --> 35:21.640
Stability?

35:21.640 --> 35:22.640
No.

35:22.640 --> 35:28.340
The big things that you get are improved performance, and this isn't really confirmed like the extent

35:28.340 --> 35:33.620
of it, but just intuitively, you absolutely should be seeing lower battery usage as well

35:33.620 --> 35:35.320
on portable devices.

35:35.320 --> 35:38.440
Because what you're doing by moving the implementation in kernel is you're getting rid of all this

35:38.440 --> 35:42.280
context switching from user space to kernel space and back again.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.240
Normally when you're interacting with your network stack, by the time you say, you know,

35:45.240 --> 35:49.820
hey, I want to get all this data off this box and packets, everything goes into the

35:49.820 --> 35:51.200
kernel and it stays there.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.000
Like your whole network stack is in kernel from that point.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.380
So you just have the one transition.

35:56.380 --> 36:02.340
But when you're doing a user space VPN, whether it's WireGuard or whether it's open VPN or,

36:02.340 --> 36:06.240
you know, what have you, what you end up having to do is kind of pop in and out of

36:06.240 --> 36:07.920
kernel space, right?

36:07.920 --> 36:13.160
Because you've got some kind of a virtual network driver shim basically that just kind

36:13.160 --> 36:18.400
of serves to dump things onto the kernel side of it, but doesn't do a whole lot itself.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.320
And then you've got, you know, all the processing, whether it's the, you know, the crypto, you

36:22.320 --> 36:23.320
know, you have it.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.300
The majority of that happens in user space.

36:25.300 --> 36:30.060
Now that context switching, when you go from user space to kernel space and back again,

36:30.060 --> 36:32.000
that introduces additional latency.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.640
Now on the lower end, that's not going to be a big deal performance wise.

36:35.640 --> 36:40.720
Like you know, if you're only talking about a few hundred, you know, even even a gigabit

36:40.720 --> 36:45.480
on like most x86 systems, you're not really going to see a big bottleneck there.

36:45.480 --> 36:48.640
But when you start talking about the higher end, when you've got, you know, 10 gigabit

36:48.640 --> 36:53.780
or larger network interfaces, and you know, boxes with enough CPU to at least in theory

36:53.780 --> 36:57.680
be able to manage that, now you start talking about a really big difference performance

36:57.680 --> 36:58.680
wise.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.160
Well, we know how you love getting nitty gritty details there, Jim, I assume you whipped out

37:02.160 --> 37:04.640
some tools and did some performance benchmarking here?

37:04.640 --> 37:06.200
Well, yes and no.

37:06.200 --> 37:11.560
I did do some performance benchmarking, but I didn't try to test the 10 gig stuff.

37:11.560 --> 37:15.920
WireGuard creator Jason Donenfeld had some handy dandy screenshots to go.

37:15.920 --> 37:22.080
He was using Ether, which is a Microsoft offered tool pretty similar to Iperf 3, at least in

37:22.080 --> 37:26.240
the way he was using it, you know, to test sequential throughput.

37:26.240 --> 37:32.920
And he showed between two what used to be packet.net C3 small instances with 10 gig

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
interfaces.

37:33.920 --> 37:38.680
And the WireGuard throughput went from two gigs flat using the old WireGuard Go and Winton

37:38.680 --> 37:40.040
approach.

37:40.040 --> 37:44.480
And when he dropped in WireGuard NT with the same instances, you know, the same everything

37:44.480 --> 37:48.040
else, it went from two gigs flat to 7.5.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.040
Whoa.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.560
All right.

37:50.560 --> 37:54.560
So this I think we should probably stress because you did kind of touch on it.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.000
But this is still experimental right now for Windows users.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.680
Like it involves tweaking the registry.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.760
It's not quite ready for production, correct?

38:00.760 --> 38:01.760
Yeah, yeah.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.920
This is absolutely not ready for like real production yet.

38:04.920 --> 38:08.680
I mean, now, if you're somebody who's just got like a couple or three machines you want

38:08.680 --> 38:13.560
to keep connected and you know, you're like, oh, hey, well, if it if it looks good, then,

38:13.560 --> 38:18.000
you know, I'm ready to try it and see how it goes, then yeah, I think it's ready for

38:18.000 --> 38:19.600
you to jump in with both feet.

38:19.600 --> 38:24.960
But if you're talking like, well, I've got a network that like a bunch of people's productivity

38:24.960 --> 38:26.600
depends on this.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.280
Or if you know, even if it's a case of like, well, there's only two machines, but if this

38:30.280 --> 38:33.440
tunnel goes down between them, then like, you know, I'm gonna have to drive 50 miles

38:33.440 --> 38:36.600
to get things fixed again, then no, this is absolutely not for you.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.380
It's I mean, it's not even beta yet.

38:38.380 --> 38:43.560
This is alpha code at this point, which what that actually means is that, you know, the

38:43.560 --> 38:46.400
the features are pretty much all complete.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.960
But it's had very little testing, right?

38:48.960 --> 38:51.000
It's all about that next level of is it really robust?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.200
Is this going to work in real production scenarios?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.200
Exactly.

38:54.200 --> 38:57.400
And, you know, as long as we're talking about, you know, the reasons that you might not want

38:57.400 --> 39:03.000
to use this someplace where you can't afford to monkey with it yet, although I, I did some

39:03.000 --> 39:07.240
testing of it, and I have not seen personally any issues with it.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.920
And you know, I have seen these tunnels with, you know, many terabytes thrown down the pipe

39:10.920 --> 39:12.680
and no issues.

39:12.680 --> 39:17.160
The other big difference, because everything has been moved in kernel is that, you know,

39:17.160 --> 39:22.400
if you do hit a major bug, the consequence is not like my tunnel went down.

39:22.400 --> 39:25.600
It's my Windows box just blue screened, potentially, right?

39:25.600 --> 39:26.600
It's a crash.

39:26.600 --> 39:27.600
Sure.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.540
So with that in mind, these things are hard to judge.

39:29.540 --> 39:34.120
But for you personally, when do you think you would start deploying this thing for clients?

39:34.120 --> 39:38.160
How long is it before Jim Salter is going to advise clients use this over an existing

39:38.160 --> 39:39.960
VPN on Windows?

39:39.960 --> 39:44.840
In the absence of an overwhelming problem that one of those clients, you know, is reporting

39:44.840 --> 39:49.520
to me, I'm not going to be using it in production to support clients until Donenfeld says this

39:49.520 --> 39:55.920
is production ready, which I would guess now this is do not take this as like, you know,

39:55.920 --> 39:57.200
over informed.

39:57.200 --> 39:58.840
Like I got the scoop from the guy.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.360
This is literally just a guess.

40:00.360 --> 40:03.560
But I'm guessing, you know, somewhere along the lines of like a year from now, probably.

40:03.560 --> 40:04.560
Okay.

40:04.560 --> 40:09.160
And have you when you were doing research for this, have you gotten any sense if Microsoft

40:09.160 --> 40:12.680
is hip to this, what their sense of this is?

40:12.680 --> 40:16.040
If Donenfeld is maybe going to see somebody from Microsoft reach out, you got any idea

40:16.040 --> 40:19.520
what their reaction is to wire guard landing in the kernel?

40:19.520 --> 40:20.520
Let's put it this way.

40:20.520 --> 40:26.840
People eat my hat, your hat and the nearest MAGA hat available if they are not both aware

40:26.840 --> 40:27.840
and interested.

40:27.840 --> 40:28.840
Okay.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.360
It seems like they should be, right?

40:30.360 --> 40:31.920
Well, so here's the thing.

40:31.920 --> 40:36.640
I know they were absolutely paying attention when Donenfeld created Winton, which was,

40:36.640 --> 40:39.960
you know, the virtual Nick that lived in user space prior to this.

40:39.960 --> 40:40.960
Okay.

40:40.960 --> 40:45.440
He created that because he originally planned to use, you know, Microsoft built in VPN adapter

40:45.440 --> 40:52.000
technology and rapidly discovered that it really was neither modern enough nor suitable

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
for his tastes.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.960
And he already knew that, you know, he wanted absolutely no part of tap windows, which is

40:57.960 --> 41:01.160
the virtual network adapter that open VPN uses.

41:01.160 --> 41:04.600
So he created Winton, which is as simple as possible.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.600
It's a project that's actually, it's a separate project from wire guard itself.

41:08.600 --> 41:14.440
Winton is that lives for no other reason than to be as basic and, you know, broadly applicable

41:14.440 --> 41:15.440
as possible.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.600
A nice little primitive for doing this on windows.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.920
Yeah, this, this little primitive network shim that you can hook other things to.

41:21.920 --> 41:26.040
And that project already was successful enough that you actually have the option of using

41:26.040 --> 41:29.760
Winton rather than tap windows on open VPN now.

41:29.760 --> 41:34.240
And an awful lot of people have done a lot of testing that demonstrates open VPN throughput

41:34.240 --> 41:39.160
going up about a hundred percent when you shift from tap windows to Winton.

41:39.160 --> 41:43.640
And again, that's before you even get into the new stuff we're talking about with, with

41:43.640 --> 41:44.640
WireGuard NT.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.640
That's just wild.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.640
Yeah, it's pretty bonkers.

41:46.640 --> 41:50.120
So you asked earlier, you know, had I done any testing and I said, I hadn't tested the

41:50.120 --> 41:53.760
10 gigabit stuff, but we never quite got into what I actually did test.

41:53.760 --> 41:59.080
There was a nice little unexpected surprise that came about when Dun & Phil first started

41:59.080 --> 42:01.840
letting a few people test WireGuard NT.

42:01.840 --> 42:06.080
What they discovered, and this was not something that he had particularly expected or planned

42:06.080 --> 42:10.800
on, but some of these early testers reported, Oh, Hey, this resolves my WireGuard over

42:10.800 --> 42:11.920
wifi issues.

42:11.920 --> 42:18.120
And these weren't specifically WireGuard over wifi, but basically any VPN over wifi, you

42:18.120 --> 42:23.640
tend to get considerably worse performance over the VPN tunnel than you would moving

42:23.640 --> 42:28.200
the same data without the tunnel over the same wifi connection.

42:28.200 --> 42:34.120
And with the shift from WireGuard Go and Winton to WireGuard NT, some of his testers saw

42:34.120 --> 42:37.320
throughput increases of as much as double.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.040
So that was the thing that I tested because I thought, you know, that's going to be the

42:40.040 --> 42:45.480
biggest deal to like the most people who hear about this news, you know, outside like the

42:45.480 --> 42:46.480
corporate segment.

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
Right.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.560
You're not a big network engineer, but you might be using a VPN on your home network

42:49.560 --> 42:50.720
while you're trying to get stuff done.

42:50.720 --> 42:51.720
Right.

42:51.720 --> 42:53.960
Like who isn't using a VPN over wifi?

42:53.960 --> 42:55.320
Yeah, I hope.

42:55.320 --> 42:58.520
One of these days in theory, people will, you know, go to those, you remember those

42:58.520 --> 43:03.320
old school businesses that would they call them a hotels, I think, Oh yeah.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.360
You could like rent a place to lay your body for several hours.

43:06.360 --> 43:07.360
Yeah.

43:07.360 --> 43:08.360
Yeah.

43:08.360 --> 43:12.960
And they would offer you, you know, very dodgy wifi that you didn't necessarily trust a whole

43:12.960 --> 43:13.960
lot.

43:13.960 --> 43:14.960
So you establish a VPN across it.

43:14.960 --> 43:19.720
Well, anyway, I wasn't able to see those like super dramatic results of, you know,

43:19.720 --> 43:24.520
people saying, Oh, well, you know, my, my WireGuard throughput went from 50 megabits

43:24.520 --> 43:27.080
to, you know, like 200 or whatever.

43:27.080 --> 43:32.480
But with that said, I was able to confirm throughput increases of up to like 25%, which

43:32.480 --> 43:35.320
is not anything to sneer at.

43:35.320 --> 43:36.560
No, I'll take it.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.560
Yeah.

43:37.560 --> 43:43.560
So the, now this is not proven, but the most reasonable theory that I've heard anybody

43:43.560 --> 43:47.940
talking about, including Donenfeld about, you know, why the wifi performance increases

43:47.940 --> 43:54.560
with WireGuard NT over WireGuard Go is a packet aggregation, like specifically 802.11 packet

43:54.560 --> 43:55.560
aggregation.

43:55.560 --> 44:01.760
Now, if you feed your 802.11 device driver enough data at once, basically it kind of

44:01.760 --> 44:05.920
aggregates all that stuff out into a single burst that it can send out at one time with

44:05.920 --> 44:11.160
lower overhead and you know, less issues with like window scaling, you know, all this kind

44:11.160 --> 44:12.160
of crap.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.840
It's, it's just better, right?

44:13.840 --> 44:19.140
So the most likely thing that we can come up with is that what's happening is by keeping

44:19.140 --> 44:23.100
everything in kernel rather than doing all this constant context switching back and forth

44:23.100 --> 44:28.440
from user space to kernel space, what's happening is these packets are arriving in a timely

44:28.440 --> 44:32.440
enough fashion to the 802.11 stack that it can aggregate them all the same way that it

44:32.440 --> 44:34.920
would without the tunnel in the first place.

44:34.920 --> 44:38.520
Now the other thing about that is that means you're not just seeing a throughput increase

44:38.520 --> 44:41.520
on your own personal WireGuard tunnel.

44:41.520 --> 44:45.800
You would also be consuming less airtime to move the same amount of data, which means

44:45.800 --> 44:51.080
the wifi quality gets better for everything on that network, not just you and that one

44:51.080 --> 44:52.080
specific tunnel.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.400
Be a good neighbor, run your WireGuard in the kernel.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.400
Come on folks.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.600
Forget the neighbor, man.

44:56.600 --> 45:02.680
I mean, who's only truly stop and think about it, who only has a single device active on

45:02.680 --> 45:05.160
their own wifi in their home these days?

45:05.160 --> 45:06.160
I have a wish.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.160
It's not me.

45:07.160 --> 45:08.160
I'm sure it's not you.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.960
Chris, you only got one device over there on wifi?

45:09.960 --> 45:11.720
Afraid not.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.920
Not even in the RV, am I right?

45:13.920 --> 45:18.280
No, I think on average we have like 36 wifi devices in the RV.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.280
Exactly.

45:19.280 --> 45:23.640
So if you're moving data over a WireGuard tunnel over wifi, you're not just improving

45:23.640 --> 45:26.020
your experience on that device.

45:26.020 --> 45:30.120
When you shift to WireGuard NT and get more packet aggregation, you're improving your

45:30.120 --> 45:32.960
wifi for those 29 other devices as well.

45:32.960 --> 45:37.440
Well, while we're talking about complicated networks here, Jim, I'm curious, you know,

45:37.440 --> 45:41.040
we mentioned open VPN here and it's kind of the elephant in the room, especially for,

45:41.040 --> 45:42.520
you know, bigger deployments.

45:42.520 --> 45:46.060
People have been using it for a long time, have come up with ways of managing these deployments.

45:46.060 --> 45:49.600
And when WireGuard first hit the scene, I remember you and I talking about this promising

45:49.600 --> 45:54.260
technology, really nice, simple, clean, but I think having administration capabilities

45:54.260 --> 45:58.640
for it, actually managing all those connections was a bit of a to be figured out issue.

45:58.640 --> 46:02.120
And I'm wondering if you're using WireGuard in production with your clients, how are you

46:02.120 --> 46:03.120
actually managing it?

46:03.120 --> 46:06.700
Oh, God, yeah, I've long since replaced.

46:06.700 --> 46:11.720
So I used to have a fairly large monitoring network that, you know, all of my clients,

46:11.720 --> 46:15.500
server VMs and, you know, hosts and whatnot were connected to.

46:15.500 --> 46:18.760
So you know, we're talking like hundreds of nodes on this network, and they would all

46:18.760 --> 46:23.200
connect outbound to what amounts to a hub out in the cloud.

46:23.200 --> 46:27.320
And of course, if you know anything about network stuff, you know, that, you know, once

46:27.320 --> 46:31.060
you've established that connection one way, it doesn't matter which direction you established

46:31.060 --> 46:34.320
it, it's a two directional tunnel once it's been established.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.760
So you do it that way.

46:35.760 --> 46:40.200
And you can avoid having to, you know, set up, you know, NAT pinholes and like a million

46:40.200 --> 46:41.200
networks, whatever.

46:41.200 --> 46:45.120
But all that used to be with open VPN, and it worked.

46:45.120 --> 46:51.800
But unfortunately, every month, I was spending somewhere around five to 10 hours, basically

46:51.800 --> 46:56.520
reconnecting crash tunnels and, you know, trying to, oh, geez, don't get me wrong.

46:56.520 --> 47:00.800
I mean, I had watchdog scripts, right, that would like look for problems and try to automatically

47:00.800 --> 47:03.800
disconnect and reconnect and reestablish tunnels.

47:03.800 --> 47:10.920
But open VPN had so many interesting ways of crashing tunnels, that even writing watchdog

47:10.920 --> 47:15.320
scripts that would attempt to tear everything down to the bare metal and reestablish it,

47:15.320 --> 47:18.800
I just never could get past that, like five to 10 hours worth of, you know, there would

47:18.800 --> 47:22.920
be a few things here and there that I'd have to find an alternate way into and reestablish

47:22.920 --> 47:26.040
those tunnels, you know, by hand, you know, screwing around with it.

47:26.040 --> 47:31.320
Now, when I ripped all that out and replaced it with WireGuard, I went to zero hours a

47:31.320 --> 47:32.320
month.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.720
It's been more than a year now.

47:33.720 --> 47:40.560
And the average is zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero hours a month reestablishing

47:40.560 --> 47:41.560
collapsed tunnels now.

47:41.560 --> 47:42.560
Wow.

47:42.560 --> 47:45.440
And I have to imagine over the last year, VPNs have probably been more important than

47:45.440 --> 47:46.720
ever for a lot of people.

47:46.720 --> 47:47.720
Oh, God, yeah.

47:47.720 --> 47:48.720
So.

47:48.720 --> 47:51.840
So the first step for me was replacing my monitoring network with WireGuard, which

47:51.840 --> 47:53.680
was a smashing success.

47:53.680 --> 47:57.680
The next step, which is still underway, is, you know, all my clients who use open VPN

47:57.680 --> 48:01.520
themselves, like, you know, with their Windows laptops and whatnot to get into the office

48:01.520 --> 48:02.520
remotely.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.520
Right.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.520
Switching them over to WireGuard.

48:04.520 --> 48:05.680
We're about halfway done with that yet.

48:05.680 --> 48:08.000
And it has absolutely been a win.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.680
And are you finding any particular tools or making that easier or not to manage?

48:12.680 --> 48:18.480
The kind of scale that we're talking about here, there's really not a whole lot of management

48:18.480 --> 48:20.280
issue in the first place, right?

48:20.280 --> 48:27.720
You know, most of my clients are around, let's just say the sweet spot is like 20 to 50 employees.

48:27.720 --> 48:28.720
Sure.

48:28.720 --> 48:32.280
So the big boogeyman that everybody always wants to bring up with WireGuard versus open

48:32.280 --> 48:34.600
VPN is, oh, you can't have DHCP.

48:34.600 --> 48:36.040
Everything has to be statically addressed.

48:36.040 --> 48:37.380
And that's true.

48:37.380 --> 48:41.240
I've just never quite been able to figure out why I would care about that.

48:41.240 --> 48:47.200
I mean, you still have the same basic process of like you set up credentials for a new VPN

48:47.200 --> 48:52.140
user and you hand them to that user and they install them and off they go.

48:52.140 --> 48:54.140
That's still the process.

48:54.140 --> 48:58.360
I guess if you had like thousands of users and for some reason you wanted to not subnet

48:58.360 --> 49:02.080
enough space for them all to be connected at once, that would be an issue.

49:02.080 --> 49:07.740
But as it is, it's not that hard to just, I mean, they get an IP address along with

49:07.740 --> 49:08.960
their key pair.

49:08.960 --> 49:13.040
And when you revoke their key pair, you revoke that IP address as well and you can reuse

49:13.040 --> 49:15.120
that for the next new user that needs it.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.120
Yeah.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.440
It's been so great while we're on the road to use WireGuard.

49:18.440 --> 49:24.180
I use it every single day and I have really enjoyed your coverage over the years now of

49:24.180 --> 49:25.820
it specifically over at ours.

49:25.820 --> 49:29.000
And now you're sharing some of that on two and a half admins as well.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.040
And I just feel like you've nailed the WireGuard coverage over the years, Jim.

49:32.040 --> 49:35.400
So it was just great to have a chance to have you come on here and update us on this stuff.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.400
So thank you for your time.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.400
Thanks, Chris.

49:37.400 --> 49:42.480
There's some definite housekeeping that needs to happen around here.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.040
There is so much, so much.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.280
Brent, I mean, you're making a mess over here.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.280
I'm sorry.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.280
It's my first time.

49:48.280 --> 49:54.960
Actually, Brent, real, true, honest, no joke, Brent did our laundry for us.

49:54.960 --> 50:00.000
Brent went out and did our laundry and then he brought it back to the RV and like the

50:00.000 --> 50:04.120
rule breaker that he is, he line dried our RV in the campsite.

50:04.120 --> 50:08.400
Of course, he's a campsite, you know, he's a camping newbie, so he didn't know that's

50:08.400 --> 50:12.200
actually against the rules for whatever stupid reason they don't want you doing that.

50:12.200 --> 50:16.640
But I thought it was fantastic, so Brent's actually been helping keep it quite clean.

50:16.640 --> 50:20.960
But what we do want to mention is the meetup page at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

50:20.960 --> 50:26.060
will have our upcoming meetups there, like the one in Denver and the feedback page.

50:26.060 --> 50:28.880
That's at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

50:28.880 --> 50:32.080
And then I also want to mention the telegram group where we're sharing additional pictures

50:32.080 --> 50:36.520
and tidbits from the road trip, as well as just the conversation, always participating

50:36.520 --> 50:38.360
in and ongoing and whatnot.

50:38.360 --> 50:39.840
It's telegram.

50:39.840 --> 50:40.840
It's a real time chat room.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.120
I don't got to explain it to you.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.120
It's not new.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.320
Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

50:45.320 --> 50:47.320
Get up in that.

50:47.320 --> 50:53.120
Also the lup lug and it was getting some love, getting some love at our Salt Lake City meetup.

50:53.120 --> 50:55.380
The lup lug happens every Sunday.

50:55.380 --> 50:57.400
It doesn't matter where you are in the world.

50:57.400 --> 51:01.980
Every Sunday, the lup lug is happening and you can get in there on mumble using free

51:01.980 --> 51:05.520
software every single Sunday and hang out with like minded folks.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.200
Details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.800
It's noon Pacific time.

51:10.800 --> 51:14.240
But you can just go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar and you can get all

51:14.240 --> 51:15.760
of that in your local time.

51:15.760 --> 51:17.280
We do that for you.

51:17.280 --> 51:19.120
Robots do it for you, actually.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.400
Scripted robots.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.840
Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar for that.

51:22.840 --> 51:27.560
Well, I think it's time for a little feedback.

51:27.560 --> 51:33.340
Yann writes in, having bought an iPad two years ago and returned it after three weeks

51:33.340 --> 51:38.560
because it was just unworkably locked down and I couldn't stand the OS, I was a bit of

51:38.560 --> 51:41.760
a surprise to hear some of your opinions about it.

51:41.760 --> 51:46.480
Having tried to do even basic stuff like importing a CA certificate, it's just a pain in the

51:46.480 --> 51:47.480
butt.

51:47.480 --> 51:50.720
The system is so locked down that it just doesn't make sense for any kind of tweaker

51:50.720 --> 51:51.720
to use.

51:51.720 --> 51:55.040
I've since bought a Samsung tablet and they are really good.

51:55.040 --> 52:00.320
In my opinion, better than the iPad with respect to both media consumption and productivity

52:00.320 --> 52:04.280
or even something like drawing, especially price wise.

52:04.280 --> 52:08.160
And also if you want to make tweaks and modifications, you can have a Linux container system running

52:08.160 --> 52:10.680
on the tablet without an issue.

52:10.680 --> 52:13.800
Something that you'll probably struggle to do on an iPad.

52:13.800 --> 52:16.280
So maybe you guys should revisit this.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
Thanks in advance.

52:17.280 --> 52:21.440
It really feels like one of those, it depends on your use case, man.

52:21.440 --> 52:25.200
Like if your use case is running a container on your tablet, that definitely isn't the

52:25.200 --> 52:26.200
iPad for you.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.200
Right.

52:27.200 --> 52:29.400
No, it doesn't work.

52:29.400 --> 52:33.760
If your use case is maybe something more traditional, then I think the iPad is a really, really

52:33.760 --> 52:35.300
strong contender.

52:35.300 --> 52:37.880
This conversation is really in the context of the JingPad.

52:37.880 --> 52:41.520
The fact that the JingPad is out and it's looking like a pretty nice device.

52:41.520 --> 52:48.320
And so the question has kind of come up on the show, is it time to reevaluate our position

52:48.320 --> 52:49.320
on tablets?

52:49.320 --> 52:52.840
Because we've kind of written off the Android tablets and everyone on the show kind of just

52:52.840 --> 52:57.200
begrudgingly went, yeah, it seems like the tablet to get right now is the iPad.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.600
I think that's what inspired that email.

52:59.600 --> 53:04.040
And I guess this kind of drives the point that it really kind of depends on what you're

53:04.040 --> 53:05.040
using it for.

53:05.040 --> 53:10.040
I still think the iPad is a better tablet device because I want something that has a

53:10.040 --> 53:14.680
built-in LTE connection that's pretty reasonably priced and easy to connect to my provider

53:14.680 --> 53:17.280
and has support by my carriers.

53:17.280 --> 53:24.120
I want something that has the X32 edit app from Behringer, which is an app in the Apple

53:24.120 --> 53:27.400
App Store, and I want something that has WireGuard support.

53:27.400 --> 53:32.440
So that way I can connect over LTE, establish a WireGuard connection, and then control my

53:32.440 --> 53:34.520
mixer with the X32 software.

53:34.520 --> 53:41.160
The iPad happens to nail that job, and I don't think I could get it accomplished on the Jing

53:41.160 --> 53:42.160
Pad.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.860
Maybe I could on the Samsung.

53:43.860 --> 53:45.840
And so the question is, is it time to revisit this?

53:45.840 --> 53:46.840
I think the answer is yes.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.660
You know, you look at the Jing Pad, you look at what people are saying they're doing with

53:49.660 --> 53:50.660
different tablets.

53:50.660 --> 53:53.560
I think, yeah, the question is, do you have the money for it?

53:53.560 --> 53:57.480
And that's really the problem is you only have so much money to spend on these kinds

53:57.480 --> 54:01.040
of things, and you don't want to blow it on something that's going to turn out to be a

54:01.040 --> 54:02.280
crap device.

54:02.280 --> 54:05.480
You want to spend that money on something you're going to get years out of.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.480
Maybe you can hand it down.

54:06.480 --> 54:09.520
I can hear the pain in your voice, like maybe you've been through this before.

54:09.520 --> 54:13.160
Yeah, I mean, that's been a lot of my kids have hand-me-down devices.

54:13.160 --> 54:18.200
And when you look at the years of support you get with iOS, the pretty good app store,

54:18.200 --> 54:23.240
and the pretty decent performance, even from older tablets, it's a pretty strong value.

54:23.240 --> 54:26.120
But there are a lot of other great devices out there, like I've recently started grabbing

54:26.120 --> 54:29.440
some Fire tablets for some of my home automation stuff.

54:29.440 --> 54:33.120
And after you spend some time with them, you can actually turn them into decent devices,

54:33.120 --> 54:38.560
and they're at a way, way, way, way better price point than an iPad, or probably even

54:38.560 --> 54:40.040
the Samsung tablet.

54:40.040 --> 54:43.600
But I notice that you don't travel with a tablet.

54:43.600 --> 54:45.420
You just have the laptop.

54:45.420 --> 54:46.420
Never really appealed to you?

54:46.420 --> 54:47.560
Well, I think you nailed it.

54:47.560 --> 54:53.360
It's the combination of dedicating a certain amount of funds to a device that kind of,

54:53.360 --> 54:58.180
I guess when I really tried to explore them, they felt like they got old quite quickly,

54:58.180 --> 55:00.800
and they were locked down in the ways that I didn't appreciate.

55:00.800 --> 55:06.360
So for me, lightness and travel, of course, is another huge thing.

55:06.360 --> 55:09.080
Yeah, they all seem so limited, right?

55:09.080 --> 55:11.060
So then you're kind of just buying an appliance.

55:11.060 --> 55:14.780
You almost have to accept the fact that this is a limited device, and that's why I have

55:14.780 --> 55:15.780
a PC.

55:15.780 --> 55:16.780
It's interesting.

55:16.780 --> 55:20.920
I thought the tablets would replace my need to bring a laptop everywhere, but I haven't

55:20.920 --> 55:22.360
really found any success in that.

55:22.360 --> 55:26.920
And every time I kind of dabble in it, maybe I need to be more creative, perhaps.

55:26.920 --> 55:28.680
And I'm welcome to some feedback there.

55:28.680 --> 55:31.520
Just carrying one machine and it's a laptop seems like it works for you.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.360
Well, I bring small things, you know.

55:33.360 --> 55:35.320
It's only a 13 inch.

55:35.320 --> 55:38.920
You did hear me complain about the fact that that screen felt a little small, and I've

55:38.920 --> 55:45.480
noticed some users using their iPads as extra screens, which I think that would certainly

55:45.480 --> 55:46.480
appeal.

55:46.480 --> 55:48.880
So I have become re-interested.

55:48.880 --> 55:51.800
That goes back again to your use case, like if, yeah, do you want to use it as an extended

55:51.800 --> 55:52.800
display?

55:52.800 --> 55:54.040
Well, which tablet supports that?

55:54.040 --> 55:57.520
Yeah, I noticed you only have one sticker on that laptop, though.

55:57.520 --> 55:58.520
I mean, it's a good sticker.

55:58.520 --> 55:59.560
It's a Linux Unplugged sticker.

55:59.560 --> 56:03.600
But did you know we have a whole new batch of stickers over at JupiterGarage.com?

56:03.600 --> 56:08.520
And they're all taken from the high resolution, what's it called?

56:08.520 --> 56:09.520
Why am I blanking on it?

56:09.520 --> 56:10.520
Because I'm exhausted.

56:10.520 --> 56:11.520
It's hot.

56:11.520 --> 56:12.520
And I've had a cider.

56:12.520 --> 56:13.520
Album art.

56:13.520 --> 56:14.520
Yeah, yeah.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.520
But what are we?

56:15.520 --> 56:16.520
Vector art.

56:16.520 --> 56:17.520
The vector, the vector art.

56:17.520 --> 56:18.520
That's what I'm trying to say.

56:18.520 --> 56:19.520
Because it's super high.

56:19.520 --> 56:21.800
We're able to just do like really beautiful stickers at three different sizes.

56:21.800 --> 56:23.280
That's what I'm trying to say, Wes.

56:23.280 --> 56:27.200
And the other thing I forgot to mention last time, which is why I put this in the show

56:27.200 --> 56:33.320
doc to begin with, is if you get one sticker, additional shipping on the stickers is 10

56:33.320 --> 56:34.320
cents.

56:34.320 --> 56:37.720
So you could get yourself like a self hosted Dakota Radio or Linux Action News or Chris

56:37.720 --> 56:41.080
and the Badger or Linux Flies on Mars sticker.

56:41.080 --> 56:45.480
They're all over at JupiterGarage.com and they are awesome.

56:45.480 --> 56:49.760
Our members get a discount that is in your members info feeds and stuff like that.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.600
I think that's how it works.

56:52.600 --> 56:58.560
You may have heard in our chat with Jim that he mentioned an application he was using to

56:58.560 --> 57:00.680
benchmark his WireGuard connection.

57:00.680 --> 57:04.200
And we may have, we may have talked about this, but this is a pick that's so dang good

57:04.200 --> 57:06.040
we want to talk about it twice.

57:06.040 --> 57:10.700
And it's called Ether, a comprehensive network measurement tool.

57:10.700 --> 57:16.760
And it's by this upstart developer named Microsoft.

57:16.760 --> 57:21.320
And they've created, this Microsoft company has created this tool that you can run on

57:21.320 --> 57:24.520
Linux, you can run it on your Windows and on your Mac.

57:24.520 --> 57:28.680
And you give it a few flags and you're off and running and you get nice, really well

57:28.680 --> 57:33.720
displayed information about performance information, statistics, any errors that have been noticed

57:33.720 --> 57:35.880
by the system and all of that.

57:35.880 --> 57:38.320
I don't know, did you get a chance to play with this Wes, because I think we've actually

57:38.320 --> 57:39.640
talked about it once before.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.640
Oh, we have.

57:40.640 --> 57:44.420
It was actually a pick on Linux Unplugged episode 280.

57:44.420 --> 57:48.720
And funny enough, that episode is when we had just gotten back from visiting System

57:48.720 --> 57:51.660
76 in Denver way back in 2018.

57:51.660 --> 57:54.160
So it feels fitting to be revisiting it now.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.160
Wow.

57:55.160 --> 57:57.940
That is, that's serendipity right there, isn't it?

57:57.940 --> 58:01.780
You can tell something's on our mind when we're on the road and solid remote connectivity

58:01.780 --> 58:07.840
and figuring out what route and what connection is the best is on our mind.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.840
We're solving problems.

58:08.840 --> 58:09.840
Yeah, exactly.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.840
Right.

58:10.840 --> 58:11.880
And clearly we haven't figured everything out.

58:11.880 --> 58:16.280
We're still solving the same problems.

58:16.280 --> 58:20.280
As for Ether, if you already use Iperf 3, I don't know, you probably don't need this

58:20.280 --> 58:21.280
if you're comfortable.

58:21.280 --> 58:24.520
I think the value is they've got some neat thread based scaling so you can kind of have

58:24.520 --> 58:28.540
a single server and use that to benchmark a whole bunch of systems and it should scale.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.360
And it's just a single little go binary.

58:30.360 --> 58:33.840
So it's easy to run, especially because it also runs on Windows and Mac OS.

58:33.840 --> 58:37.080
So if you've got all kinds of different clients you want to benchmark, maybe this is the tool

58:37.080 --> 58:38.080
for you.

58:38.080 --> 58:39.080
Hmm.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.480
Very nice link to that in the show notes.

58:40.480 --> 58:44.480
All of those links will be at Linux Unplugged dot com slash 419.

58:44.480 --> 58:49.760
Wes, am I right that the next time you and I are doing a show, it's going to be together

58:49.760 --> 58:50.760
in Denver?

58:50.760 --> 58:51.760
Oh, I'm excited.

58:51.760 --> 58:52.760
Yeah.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.440
You get in early that morning too.

58:55.440 --> 58:58.720
So I guess that means you're probably just going to have to do all the show prep on the

58:58.720 --> 58:59.880
plane, you know?

58:59.880 --> 59:02.080
So I'm just going to assume you'll do all the prep then that week.

59:02.080 --> 59:03.300
So you're going to have that flight out.

59:03.300 --> 59:06.960
You know, whatever they've got in the magazines, I'm sure we'll have some mention of Linux,

59:06.960 --> 59:07.960
right?

59:07.960 --> 59:08.960
Yeah, probably.

59:08.960 --> 59:09.960
There's probably something in there.

59:09.960 --> 59:12.560
If not, we'll just, I don't know, we'll figure it out.

59:12.560 --> 59:13.920
I'm really looking forward to it.

59:13.920 --> 59:14.920
It's going to be fun.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.280
We don't even know where we're recording yet.

59:16.280 --> 59:17.620
We may do it in Lady Joops.

59:17.620 --> 59:19.420
We may be able to do it at System 76.

59:19.420 --> 59:22.880
Maybe we'll do it in the Airbnb if we can get in there that early.

59:22.880 --> 59:23.880
Who knows?

59:23.880 --> 59:24.880
But it's going to be fun.

59:24.880 --> 59:29.960
And then once we're all there, we're going to have a JB Airbnb where, well, we'll see

59:29.960 --> 59:30.960
how that goes.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.360
But we're all going to be in one spot.

59:32.360 --> 59:36.080
But we'd love to have you join us live just to experience that and see where things are

59:36.080 --> 59:37.080
at.

59:37.080 --> 59:38.480
You can do that over at jblive.tv.

59:38.480 --> 59:41.720
We do it at Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

59:41.720 --> 59:43.600
See you next week.

59:43.600 --> 59:46.040
Same bad time, same bad station.

59:46.040 --> 59:48.680
And there is a lot more going on.

59:48.680 --> 59:53.360
Of course, Self Hosted is going to be recorded on the road this week as well.

59:53.360 --> 59:54.360
So do your thing.

59:54.360 --> 59:57.760
Go over to the Twitter, follow the network at Jupiter Signal, get information on all

59:57.760 --> 59:59.480
of that stuff and future meetups.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.360
You can follow this here podcast at Linux Unplugged.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.360
Or if you don't do the Twitter thing, I don't blame you.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.380
You can just find everything we're doing over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.680
That's the main network website.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.280
And if you're not yet listening to Linux Action News, you're missing about 20 to 30 minutes

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.520
of what the heck is going on in the world of Linux every single week.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.680
And you probably should get tuned into it.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.880
Links to everything over at LinuxUnplugged.com.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:23.880
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:43.040
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:10.360
I think Levi has won Brent over a little bit, you know, because Brent came in kind of a

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.360
cat guy.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360
Not that he's anti dog.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360
I'm not trying to say that.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:17.400
But I feel like you came in and you just were kind of, you know, that's Levi.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400
That's great.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.520
It's really good to see Levi again.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.520
But then Levi started snuggling with you in the morning and then pretty soon you started

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:28.200
taking him on walks and the next thing you know he's spending the entire night with you.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.200
I feel like there's something developing there.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:34.400
Well, I think he's got this nice way of welcoming guests and he's totally won me over.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.640
That's for sure.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.640
It's pretty great to see.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.640
All right.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.640
JBtitles.com.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640
I don't think I started the titles.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.660
I don't because I couldn't get in the IRC room.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.240
So we'll just see how that goes.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.880
You know, it's a road show everybody.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:46.880
Don't worry.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.080
We've got a few titles listed under show not listed.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080
That seems appropriate.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:58.160
Oh man, I'm glad to be done for at least a couple of days until self-hosted because I

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.120
tell you what, it has been tricky doing this on the road.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.560
The connectivity has been really weird because we're kind of close to downtown Salt Lake

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:09.080
City which means sometimes the cellular networks are really kind of busy and there's a construction

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.120
project going on.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.440
There has been a concert.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.600
There has been people coming and going.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:19.360
Like even just during this recording there was planes taking off, motorcycles going by,

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.240
diesel trucks starting up, I mean the whole thing.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.220
It's been kind of a real juggle more so than I expected.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.440
So hopefully when we get out of here it's going to be in quieter territory.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:34.880
Salt Lake City has been very smoky so it hasn't been like the most like impressive experience

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.080
but I do want to come back and enjoy it sometime.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.760
This spot isn't bad if you were here to just enjoy the city because it's right next to

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760
the rail.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.960
I mean you can walk to the rail in like five minutes and it's close to everything.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.440
It's ten minutes to everything downtown and lots of good eating and all that kind of stuff.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.720
So I would totally recommend this KOA in Salt Lake City if you were an RVer and you were

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.840
coming here.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.960
But if you wanted to come here to record or work quietly it would probably look somewhere

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:17.280
else.
