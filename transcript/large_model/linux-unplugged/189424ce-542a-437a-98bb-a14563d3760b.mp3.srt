1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,480
Let's do an informal poll.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,720
Wes, when's the last time you updated your daily driver?

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,200
My daily driver?

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,520
Actually, this weekend. OK, pretty recent, pretty recently.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,000
What about you, Mini Mac? When's the last time you updated your daily driver?

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,960
Two days ago, I think.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,480
OK, what about you, Carl?

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,080
Yeah, probably about two days ago because Fedora tells me every time I go to shut it down, that I have updates.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,800
So I just check the box and then do it.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,320
Right. What about you, Neil?

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,240
I did it this morning because like Carl said, I was running out the computer.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,720
Wow. OK, so is there anybody in the mumble room that's been like a month or longer?

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,880
Anybody who's gone a while?

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,080
Nobody? That can't be normal.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:53,600
Hey, if you want a sample size of one of somebody who's gone a month or longer, when I had my office computer before it gave up the ghost after a series of rolling power outages that burned out my SSD, it would usually be about three to four weeks before I would get a chance to to do updates.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,200
There you go. But at home, I do it enough times and the computer freezes up enough times that I wind up

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
getting updates basically daily.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,160
Is that your Soos workstation or are you fiddling with it?

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,440
Hello, everyone, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,840
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,800
You know, there's a lot of possibilities for career in the cloud, but there's little time.

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,520
ACG's learning paths help you take the right course to prepare for architect developer security and many more high paying cloud jobs.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,040
Get hired, get certified, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,400
My name is Chris and my name is Wes.

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
Hello, Wes. We got a great show today.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,320
Today, I'm going to do I'm going to describe what I think is the perfect laptop for me for Linux.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:54,880
I ordered a ThinkPad X1 Carbon with Fedora preloaded on it, and I am going to give you my experience with receiving my first ever Fedora preloaded machine.

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:03,600
Why I chose this laptop, what the results have been, how Fedora fared on there, what I would do differently, and a little bit about the performance and the experience and all of that.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
But, you know, I've been looking at it, Wes.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
I've been thinking about it, as you know, since summer.

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,800
I've been thinking in December, right before the end of the tax year, a little holiday present for yourself, maybe.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
Merry Christmas to me, right?

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
So I thought, you know, I get myself something.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,960
And ultimately, it was a tough choice.

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:30,720
Wes was above and beyond, had to listen to me just go on and on about all my different laptop ideas and possibilities.

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,880
There really were. I mean, there's a lot of good options right now, which is both a good thing, but doesn't make the choice easy.

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,960
Yeah, especially when it's your own hard earned money that, you know, you don't you don't want to you don't want to spend that on the wrong thing.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,880
So we'll tell you about that in a little bit.

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,520
But before we get to that, we have some community news and all of that to get into.

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,600
So let's say hello to that virtual lug.

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,200
Time appropriate. Greetings, Mumble Room.

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Hola, Chris and Helen.

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Hello.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Good evening.

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Hello.

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Hello.

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,680
Somebody slipped the virtual lug a little caffeine before we got started, I think, or somebody on the pre show just got them all riled up.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm not sure which one.

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:14,440
Before we get into the community news, I want to remind everyone you have just a little bit of time to cast your nomination for the 2020 Tuxys.

50
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:26,120
Coming to an Unplugged podcast very soon, it is our best of 2020 voted by you and selected by our panel, and then we will be sending out little care packages to the projects that win your nominations.

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,760
There is just a little bit of time left.

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,720
Also would be then curious about feedback on what we could do to expand it next year, because this is a minimum viable Tuxys.

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,680
Yeah, we're just trying this out, you know, getting started with it.

54
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm already excited by the submissions that we're seeing, though.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Yeah, there's some good ones.

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,920
I think we've had we've had a couple of hundred submissions so far last time I looked in there, which is which now means it's officially entered the territory.

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,840
We're like, we're going to have to come up with a way to programmatically sort and go through this data.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,600
Yeah, we've got some work ahead of us now.

59
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
Look what we signed up for.

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Yeah, yeah, right.

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,920
But before we get to that, Wes, you know what?

62
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,520
You know what time it is.

63
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,160
Oh, yeah, I know that sound.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,880
It has been a long time since we have done an ARCH update, probably just about 40 days or so.

65
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
Yeah, I think so.

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:30,160
So we have committed when we deployed this ARCH server in production, which you should never do, but we did it and we committed to doing the updates live on air and owning if it bites us in the butt live.

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,240
And we won't cut it out.

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
We'll just do it.

69
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,880
So are you ready to kick this off, Wes?

70
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm standing by at the keyboard now.

71
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,760
All right, what kind of what kind of update load are we looking at?

72
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
Because it has been a while.

73
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,280
It looks like we've got a hundred and ninety two packages, total download size of seven hundred and fifteen megs.

74
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,520
That's total install size of nearly three gigs, but a net upgrade of just forty four megs.

75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,880
OK, now this server is even more important than ever because we have a much more hybrid cloud cloud approach.

76
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,520
We have a lot of stuff locally now trying to think if this is going to take anything out.

77
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
Is there a kernel update in there?

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, yeah, although we are we are on the LTS kernel still.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,480
So if there is here, let me let me give Pac-Man S.Y.U.

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,160
a go here and see what we got.

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,880
That's what my concern would be is especially and if there if there is a kernel update, we should make sure there's a CFS module in there.

82
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,480
Oh, yes.

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,880
Linux LTS five dot four dot eighty three dash one is what we're going to be running soon.

84
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,440
Oh, not five ten.

85
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,160
OK, because we have that because we you know, I mean, it's the brand new one.

86
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,920
Yeah, I know.

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,520
All right. Wes, you know what?

88
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Go ahead. Kick it off.

89
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,800
We'll get the updates going and we'll check back in.

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,960
Nothing like a live production server upgrade on air while you're recording a show that helps support your back end production infrastructure.

91
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,520
But I think Centos developers are I should say admins and developers kind of know how I feel right now.

92
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,560
Here we are one week in after Red Hat announced that Centos was shifting its focus to Centos stream,

93
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:11,720
that the traditional Centos releases would be wrapping up with Centos eight and that support would be ending at the end of December twenty twenty one.

94
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,600
There has been a gamut of reaction to this.

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm really proud of the analysis that Wes and I did in Linux Action News this week.

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,760
So if you want a lot of the details of functionally what's changed,

97
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,960
you can either catch last week's episode or get just the straight shot version in Linux Action News from this week.

98
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,360
That's one sixty seven. Thank you, sir.

99
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,800
But now a week in, we've had a couple of we have had a couple of contenders step up.

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,320
Rocky Linux enjoyed being one of the number one projects on GitHub over the weekend.

101
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,480
Rocky Linux is is proclaimed to be going to be a Centos alternative for the traditional release model.

102
00:06:47,480 --> 00:07:00,560
And Cloud Linux, while it seemed like they were initially talking with Rocky Linux, has now kind of stand out on its own with news that they were going to invest more than a million dollars a year into their Centos clone.

103
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,040
Whoa, that's a big commitment.

104
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:14,640
And they proclaimed that it would I guess they have it would be called Project Linux, not not not like Linux the way we would spell it, but L E N I X.

105
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,760
Yeah, that's an interesting name. But I guess Cloud Linux has been doing this for a while.

106
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:34,520
They've made a business of taking REL and Centos code and fine tuning it into Cloud Linux OS is a customized, high performance, lightweight Linux server for multi tenancy web and server hosting companies, something something they do themselves.

107
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:43,360
Project Linux will be a free, open source, community driven, one to one binary compatible fork of REL 8 and future versions.

108
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,120
So I guess they'll be just sort of continuing what they do internally and opening that up.

109
00:07:48,120 --> 00:08:05,880
Yeah, they even claim you'll get the ability to port what they say is an entire fleet of Centos servers with a single command, no reinstallation or reboots required, which, by the way, it's also it's also straightforward to switch to stream just sort of the same thing.

110
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,360
Yeah, sure is right. Which command will you choose?

111
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, and I think that that choice will say a lot. It seems like Cloud Linux is really stepping into play a little more than I kind of expected here.

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,600
But I don't know. I mean, is the difference is, you know, if stream is not that big of a difference, is that enough of a motivation?

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,800
I think that's yet to be determined.

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Listener Mike wrote into the show over the week.

115
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,680
He said, I listened to the last episode discussing the end of Centos as well.

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:37,400
I know it and the upgrade path that's available to Centos stream based on what those from Red Hat said on the show.

117
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,760
And what I read online, I decided I'd go ahead and try to upgrade my personal WireGuard Bastion VPS that I host on Lidnode.

118
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,880
Thanks, guys. From Centos 8.3 to Centos stream.

119
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:58,680
I thought, of course, a supported upgrade path on a mainstream distro couldn't possibly update the kernel without bringing along all of the appropriate Kmod packages for the packages that I have installed.

120
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:07,920
Well, imagine my surprise then when I realized that Centos stream didn't have the appropriate WireGuard Kmod package for the new Centos stream kernel after I upgraded.

121
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,400
This is behavior I might expect from Archer Gentoo.

122
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:19,640
I haven't used Red Hat to drive distros in quite a while, and I'm just disappointed that a purportedly mainstream distro that just made such a huge change doesn't control for this.

123
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:27,040
Maybe I'm missing something here on how yum and DNF work, but I feel like if a user had functionality installed like the WireGuard packages,

124
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,960
then a simple DNF upgrade should block from completing if the transaction would result in those packages no longer loading against the new kernel.

125
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,800
I realize I could have forced the kernel back to the old version, and I did confirm that it worked when I loaded that kernel,

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,240
but I was just so frustrated and annoyed that I blew the whole server away and just decided to replace it with Arch.

127
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
Well, that's no way.

128
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,880
That's actually what he says, which we're going to see.

129
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
We're about to do an upgrade, and we'll see if it pulls down the right modules.

130
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
I mean, we're building the ZFS DKMS module right now, so...

131
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,160
I mean, this is a tricky one.

132
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,200
See, what Mike hit here is, it's like why you always want something baked into the kernel whenever possible

133
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,080
and not have it be a module that gets built with like DKMS or something at install time.

134
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,000
The thing I would wonder is if maybe that just hasn't been packaged for stream yet.

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,120
Carl, is something like that possible where like a WireGuard module for the kernel just doesn't package in stream

136
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,440
because stream doesn't have a huge base right now of users?

137
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,920
So to be clear, WireGuard isn't shipped by CentOS Linux or CentOS Stream,

138
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,800
so these are all something third party that I honestly don't know exactly what the issue is.

139
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,280
If it is a DKMS thing, it could be a number of problems.

140
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,120
In reality, we know that anyone building against the kernel headers, they're going to have some challenges ahead of them,

141
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,040
and what's going to probably have to happen in a lot of cases is they're going to have to build packages that are for rel and clones

142
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,480
and then packages for CentOS Stream separately.

143
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,680
Right, and I bet WireGuard by December, by this time next year, I bet there will be WireGuard stream packages that are pretty easy to get your hands on.

144
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
Yeah, they seem to be pretty good about that.

145
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,440
Yeah, the WireGuard developer, he's actually already been in contact with CentOS Stream working on ways to get all of his builds working correctly,

146
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
so it is a known issue and we're working through it.

147
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,320
Is there an opinion at Red Hat that if you're dependent on kernel ABI stability, that you should just probably that is a use case for rel?

148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,280
I mean, if you ask the Red Hat business, you know, something like that, of course, they're going to say, OK, that's what they say.

149
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,880
Yeah, there's a there's this thing called the kernel ABI.

150
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,880
The Kabi is what some people will say it as, and there's a lot of documentation out there about what that exactly is.

151
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,040
But if you ever noticed that some kernel module that whenever you upgrade point releases on CentOS or rel,

152
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,960
that a kernel module requires an update at the same time, that's what that is.

153
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,160
That Kabi is usually stable within that point release, and then the next point release will get a new Kabi.

154
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,880
So that's some of those things that you have to work through, some of those details that are getting exposed to people now.

155
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,800
Right. Very good. Thank you for setting us straight on that.

156
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,320
Sorry to hear that Mike had trouble. I mean, there will be that's going to be what happens.

157
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,720
It is still a change, even if it's mostly a small change, but especially for I think, as we mentioned a little bit last week, you know,

158
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,840
long live system systems that have some third party modifications, customizations.

159
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,880
It might it might not be trivial. Hopefully, hopefully, though, it's all very doable.

160
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,920
One of the biggest third party Kmod providers out there for enterprise Linux is L repo.

161
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,560
And anyone that is frustrated by this, I would encourage you to get involved in that community.

162
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,680
They are working with us right now trying to make heads and tails of this and figure out what they need to do to provide a good,

163
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,880
workable solution that's easy to consume for people. And this is a great time to get involved with them.

164
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Good to know. I thought I'd do a little follow up on my matrix usage because we talked a lot about matrix on the show a couple of months ago.

165
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:56,480
I have been slowly using it more and more. I think I kind of slowed my roll when we got a lot of reports that people are having onboarding issues,

166
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,360
just figuring out how to get on to our matrix server and sign up through element that killed a little of your enthusiasm.

167
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:10,240
Yeah. And then element itself, while ultimately I think it's the most feature rich matrix client, it has a bit of a wackadoo UI.

168
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,520
It really does. It's I didn't really appreciate that until I started looking at other matrix clients besides element because like, you know, a web browser.

169
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,560
You can have you can have Firefox and Chrome and browse the web. You can have multiple matrix clients.

170
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:32,040
So I tried out Fractal, which is a GTK, simpler matrix client, and I think it supports lib handy, too.

171
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,480
So I think it'll rescale down to like mobile devices as well.

172
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,440
Oh, here. See, it's written in Rust. That's why you ran it. I got it.

173
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,840
I'm sorry, Wes. It was it was written in. What was that, Wes? What was that?

174
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,040
Rust!

175
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:51,680
That's right. You got to introduce it properly.

176
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,320
We have a system. You're right. You're right. This looks nice, though. Minimal, maybe, but clean.

177
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:05,040
Very minimal. It's but it's much more like an IRC client, and it just is way easier for my brain to navigate.

178
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,360
And it works great. It doesn't have all the features, but it works really well.

179
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,240
And it's really easy to get up and going. There's a flat pack available and there's others, packages and whatnot.

180
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:23,880
And then the other one I think I looked at that I didn't like quite as much Neko, N-H-E-K-O, Neheco.

181
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,480
It tries to kind of have a Discord like interface.

182
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,280
They say the motivation behind the project is to provide a native desktop app for Matrix, which I like that.

183
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,120
That feels more like a mainstream chat app.

184
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,400
So I think they're kind of going for a cross between, well, to me, it looks like Discord, Discord and Element.

185
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,280
And I had trouble getting this one running, so I just stuck with Fractal.

186
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,000
But that has made it a little bit simpler.

187
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,240
And then the other thing that has been kind of spurring more adoption on my part.

188
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,280
Is the audience still seems to be finding our Colony.JupiterBroadcasting.com matrix server.

189
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,880
So we still have people that are joining at a good trickle.

190
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:17,040
But additionally, I am seeing more and more open source projects that are setting up matrix rooms.

191
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:25,920
And I am really delighted to see that because there was a time where we were trending towards Slack for a lot of this stuff.

192
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,160
Oh, boy. Right.

193
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,480
And so it's really, really great to see kind of like how people started just spinning up rooms on FreeNode back in the day.

194
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,680
You're starting to see projects just spin up rooms on matrix.org.

195
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:49,480
And I went in and, you know, I've actually I've had more conversations with upstream developers in the last couple of weeks on matrix than I've probably had in the last year.

196
00:15:49,480 --> 00:16:00,360
I think because I had gotten so used to talking to these people in person that I hadn't really invested time in tracking all of them down virtually.

197
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,440
And then as they've now moved over to matrix and I've been moving over to matrix, I've found them again.

198
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,360
And it's like reconnecting with long friends and meeting new people. And it's been a nice experience on matrix.

199
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,520
So I just I haven't fully switched over. It's not my primary communications platform.

200
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,960
If you message me there, I'm probably going to take a couple of days to respond to you if I do.

201
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:31,560
But I like it more and more and I have a lot of long term hope for it as you know, as an open chat platform that that really offers so much more than than what any of the closed like Slack and teams could even begin to touch on.

202
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,360
That's just it. Right. There's a lot more potential.

203
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
And I don't know. Have you been checking in at all with this week in matrix?

204
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,840
No. Is that a podcast they have?

205
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,680
Yeah. I mean, it's like a weekly thing that they do update to the project.

206
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,160
This last one was a demos week.

207
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,960
Oh, it's like a blog.

208
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,640
Yeah. A blog and then a video, like a meeting that they do.

209
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:57,880
So you can hang out, watch that and then or, you know, just follow up after the fact like I end up usually doing and checking out all the cool stuff that they're working on like, hey, you know, I see you on Instagram sometimes.

210
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,400
Did you know there's a new bridge for that?

211
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,560
Are you telling me you've been geeking out on matrix and didn't tell me about it?

212
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Well, just trying to follow along, you know, I love the bridges stuff.

213
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,920
I love that it's all open.

214
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,000
I love that they're developing a whole bunch of clients and a whole bunch of servers.

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,240
Like, it just seems like there's there's a lot of investment.

216
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,640
And even if it is still not the king of all chat clients, at least in in UX at the moment, it seems like the bones are really good.

217
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,960
Huh? Yeah. Boy, I'm digging this week in matrix thing here.

218
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,760
They have they have this most recent one has a little bit on here about home server deployments.

219
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:37,360
You know, host is an operating system aimed for the simplest administration of a server that's been democratized for self hosting.

220
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,880
That's cool. There's some neat stuff in here.

221
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,200
Oh, yeah. Look, they even integrate with the element web bit, which we've been thinking about exploring, I think.

222
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,280
Oh, yes. For an embedded embedded chat.

223
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,640
Hey, put a link to this in the old show notes keys there, which are because already done.

224
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,480
That's great. Oh, and they got Docker arm images.

225
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,160
Watch out. Watch out, Raspberry Pi.

226
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,040
I figured you'd find that one.

227
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,040
I'm going to have a I'm going to have a matrix powered Raspberry Pi server soon.

228
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,320
All right, Wes, get your crack your knuckles because you know what time it is.

229
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,200
It is time for us to get back into the ARCH update.

230
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,120
How are we looking over there? We've finished our our DKMS.

231
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,880
The next question is, should we should we move on to our AUR updates or would you like me to reboot first?

232
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,360
I say let's skip the AUR updates. We can do those electively later.

233
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,160
Nothing too important in there.

234
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:35,600
I want to know if these core updates are going to cause the system to A not boot and B not get the file system mounted again.

235
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,520
This is the thing that I worry about. This is where I start to worry.

236
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,560
I got to pull up a ping here. Yeah, you tell me when you're ready.

237
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,160
I've got fingers over the button now. All right.

238
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,960
Do it. We'll do it. Here we go.

239
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,520
This is going to take a while because it's it's not the fastest booter out there.

240
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,560
I can't go on with the show. Oh, my gosh. OK.

241
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:02,760
All right. What we'll do is we'll keep it up in a UA tab and I'll just drop it down from time to time.

242
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,880
Oh, gosh, Wes. Really, this is ideal because now you don't have to ask me for an update.

243
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,800
You just you've got it right there. What have I gotten myself into?

244
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,920
What have I gotten myself into? I need to distract myself.

245
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,200
All right. We'll be back. We'll come back and look at it in a moment.

246
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,280
You keep an eye on it, right? Yeah, of course. All right.

247
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,880
Linode.com slash unplugged. This will make me feel a little bit better.

248
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,160
I love talking about Linode. They're our cloud hosting provider.

249
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,600
That's where we run things like our matrix server.

250
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,520
We run it up on Linode.

251
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,760
And the other thing that's really nice about Linode is if you go to Linode.com slash unplugged,

252
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,080
you get a one hundred dollar sixty day credit and you support the show.

253
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,920
But that one hundred dollar sixty day credit is going to get you really far because the prices are great.

254
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,240
I wanted to just go through the experience of setting up CentOS 8 and then converting it to stream.

255
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,280
And I suppose I could go through the hassles of installing software on my machine or, you know, virtualizing it.

256
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,360
But it takes me 10 seconds to get it up and going on Linode.

257
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,000
I tried it and then I destroyed the machine.

258
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,680
And I love using it for just quick little checks like that because you get great performance.

259
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,840
You get an IP address, you can connect to it.

260
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,280
And it's also just kind of rad to like have a system right up there that you then SSH into.

261
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,720
And you're like on the super powerful box from your remote machine and you're trying out something.

262
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
And then as soon as you're done, you just destroy it.

263
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,840
It's just it's a really cool sensation.

264
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,120
But maybe you want to build a personal portfolio or a blog or or host some holiday photos.

265
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,400
Linode has like a five dollar a month rig that would be great for that.

266
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,680
But if you want to deploy infrastructure for your business or your community, they have systems that are more than capable of that.

267
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,240
Dedicated CPU systems is what we use for our encoding.

268
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,960
They have systems with GPUs that you can load up like crazy.

269
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,520
They support all the different distributions you could possibly want to run in production.

270
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
And they even give you access.

271
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,960
They don't prevent you from getting in there and just re-imaging the disk yourself.

272
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,240
They got a guide on how to do that.

273
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,880
They know how all of this works.

274
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,280
They've been around since 2003, way before AWS.

275
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,520
And I love saying that because I'm so damn proud of them because I was, you know, that's how I got started in IT.

276
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,080
I saw where Linux was going.

277
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,840
I saw the problems it was solving.

278
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,520
And I kind of just hitched my way into that.

279
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:21,600
And I started replacing Windows NT boxes that were crushing with Linux boxes that would just come in and do way more work and could support way more users.

280
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,520
And it was so great to watch that technology develop.

281
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,040
That's where Linode was at back in 2003.

282
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,360
Their founders came together and built something around Linux.

283
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,320
And and now they're the largest independent cloud provider.

284
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,480
And you can get a one hundred dollars, 60 day credit when you go to linode.com slash unplug.

285
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,400
Go there, support the show and check it out.

286
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
I keep seeing people who try it out.

287
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,960
They're like, OK, I gave it a go.

288
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,040
I've been thinking about it, Chris.

289
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,760
I finally did it.

290
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,360
I see what you're talking about.

291
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,320
You know, we got an email into the show.

292
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,960
I'll have to share it with you in the future about their awesome support.

293
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,720
That's not something I touch on very often, but we got a really great email into the show about how fantastic their support is.

294
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,920
Go try them out. Linode dot com slash unplugged.

295
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,120
See what I've been talking about.

296
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,920
All right.

297
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:16,280
Before we get to the X1 carbon review, which I have sitting right here, I have the I have the keyboards turned on.

298
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,560
I can't really think about anything else, Wes.

299
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,160
I can't really. So we got to check back in.

300
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,880
It looks like it's just back online, I'm ssaging in right now.

301
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,400
OK, I'm going to check my pings.

302
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,480
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was down.

303
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,440
It was down basically for and all of our containers are back online.

304
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,280
No, really? That easy? Yeah.

305
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,160
They said it couldn't be done, Wes.

306
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,520
I mean, they've just started, so maybe some of them will have problems.

307
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,320
But once we get to this point, it's usually fine.

308
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,240
There you go, Wes.

309
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,840
Now, I suppose for, you know, for completion's sake, I should probably do some updates, right?

310
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,480
Yeah, sure. Go and do your updates.

311
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,080
I was mostly just wanted to make sure that that, you know, when we're doing the kernel upgrade,

312
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,160
I want to make sure that that ZFS file system now, huh?

313
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,560
Well, also here. So here's where it gets fun, actually, because we have the LTS kernel.

314
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,760
It meant that we could just continue.

315
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,120
You know, we didn't need a new build from ZFS to work with that new kernel.

316
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,160
Right. So that keeps it simple.

317
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,600
And I think that was honestly I'm glad we made that choice.

318
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,640
I think it just makes this simpler every time.

319
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
And it's not like we really need the latest kernel for this box anyway.

320
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,840
I see. So it wasn't a major version change of the kernel.

321
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,160
I got exactly.

322
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,120
But, you know, we talked about last week, two weeks ago, whenever that was recently,

323
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,040
that there's been the 2.0 release of open ZFS with all those new goodies that is now available in the AOR.

324
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,800
So we can do this whole cycle again and get brand new ZFS if you want.

325
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,280
Oh, my God. Why? What? What? Oh, my God.

326
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,520
OK, so you're telling me even though I just dodged a bullet,

327
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,680
there's another firing squad we could stand in front of and do it all over again.

328
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,680
If you'd like to or do it later, that's up to you.

329
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,080
Let's do it.

330
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,120
You know what, because I'm going to get on my soapbox here for a moment,

331
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,680
because everybody told us we couldn't use Arch in production.

332
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,560
And this server has only gotten more production.

333
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,760
It's only gotten more critical.

334
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,000
Has it been two years, Wes? How long is this install?

335
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,920
Do you have any idea?

336
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,320
No, that might not be the Arch install, though, right?

337
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,000
Because we were running it as Fedora.

338
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,720
Yeah. Yeah. Fedora for a bit.

339
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,040
So a year, maybe.

340
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,200
I think at least we'll have to do some spelunking in the logs after the show.

341
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,800
And we went we went over 40 days in between updates on that one by mistake.

342
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:37,400
And OK, I'm just saying people talk a lot of shit about Arch a lot,

343
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,400
but I don't know.

344
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,040
I mean, there it is working and we're doing it.

345
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,960
We're not we're not doing it properly.

346
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,360
We're not doing it as well as we possibly could.

347
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,560
And we're doing it like jackasses live on a podcast.

348
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,360
And it's still working just fine. I'm just saying.

349
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,440
I will say I do like even when we've occasionally had some troubleshooting

350
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,240
or things just going slowly that we were worried about.

351
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,520
It's nice that we set the system up.

352
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,400
It's really simple.

353
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,680
I feel like we have a good understanding of it.

354
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,800
So when we do have to do a little troubleshooting or reconfiguration,

355
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,200
it's usually not a big deal.

356
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,880
And when it does, Dianas will switch over to Centaustream.

357
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,080
Exactly. We've got a plan.

358
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,560
I don't know what we're going to switch over to,

359
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,400
but I am running Fedora on this ThinkPad.

360
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,960
And you know what?

361
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,080
Maybe maybe there's something there.

362
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,880
So if you have listened to my work over a decade,

363
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,200
you know that just about any time a vendor has come out

364
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,760
with a big splash with a new Linux product,

365
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,960
I inevitably have bought that thing.

366
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,600
It goes back to when System76 became a company.

367
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,520
I bought one of their laptops.

368
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,360
When Dell announced their very first developer workstation,

369
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,600
it was a tower.

370
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,560
I bought one of those.

371
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,080
You're not going to miss out on something like that, right?

372
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,680
One of my favorite computers ever, actually,

373
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,120
I still have it here in the studio.

374
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,240
It's just out in the living room, not hooked up to anything.

375
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,400
But it was a great little machine.

376
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,680
I even used it as a hackintosh for a little while.

377
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,680
When Lenovo announced consumer ThinkPads running Fedora,

378
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,840
which are now also available with Ubuntu,

379
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I knew there was a good chance I eventually

380
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,720
would end up getting one of them.

381
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,880
Because this entire time, whenever

382
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,240
I've been buying a machine preloaded with Linux,

383
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,440
God bless them, they've been with Ubuntu, which is great.

384
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,600
But this was my first chance ever

385
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,480
to get a computer preloaded with Fedora.

386
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,640
And I didn't just buy it because of that.

387
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,440
I did try to think about what I wanted in a laptop.

388
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,040
And I wonder if this maybe connects

389
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,120
with some of you out there.

390
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,680
I wanted my money, the limited amount

391
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,120
that I have if I'm going to spend it,

392
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,960
I want that to vote for Linux.

393
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,640
So regardless, I was going to buy something preloaded

394
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,760
with Linux.

395
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,080
If I'm spending that kind of money,

396
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,040
it's got to further that cause.

397
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,240
I also, maybe even more so than the average bear,

398
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
I want a laptop that I can load any distro on quickly

399
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,360
and often with very little minimal fuss.

400
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,240
That means everything needs to be upstream as much

401
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,880
as possible.

402
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,400
Fan control, screen brightness, keyboard brightness,

403
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,880
everything.

404
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,440
It needs to have Thunderbolt 3 and eGPU compatibility

405
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,320
because my work from home setup is all

406
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,840
based around a Thunderbolt 3 eGPU dock.

407
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,560
And my experience, my number one complaint with the ThinkPad

408
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,640
T480 that I used to have was the screen.

409
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,240
We got them with 1080p screens.

410
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,960
And Lenovo just didn't put a lot of effort

411
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,400
into that particular model screen.

412
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,680
It's always been a source of complaints.

413
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,800
So I wanted something with a 1440p screen,

414
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,960
or 2K as you call it.

415
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,760
And I highly preferred, though, did not require something

416
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,560
with LVFS support.

417
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Highly preferred, though.

418
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,080
Just about required.

419
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,080
And I preferred something I could pop the bottom off

420
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,840
and put a bigger disk in or put more RAM in.

421
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,240
Perks, if it was thin and light.

422
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,520
I want something thin and light.

423
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,840
That's why I have an eGPU.

424
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,520
Because when I want something powerful, I've got that.

425
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,640
And I'd like something that has solid construction,

426
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,720
high-end materials.

427
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,960
Right, if you're spending your own money here,

428
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,520
it shouldn't look clunky.

429
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,920
And a high-resolution 1440p screen, backlit keyboard,

430
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,400
and Thunderbolt 3 with eGPU support,

431
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,560
that is actually a very small overlap of devices.

432
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,880
That's what brought me back to the X1 Carbon,

433
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,760
is it has an optional 1440p screen.

434
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,080
It has Thunderbolt 3, works exactly like it did on my T480.

435
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
It's thin and light.

436
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
It has LVFS support.

437
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,600
And it ships with vanilla Fedora.

438
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,200
Not like an OEM version of Fedora

439
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,840
that's been patched for the sound card and the webcam

440
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,080
to work, but a vanilla version of Fedora 32,

441
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,840
actually, with high DPI mode turned on.

442
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,840
So on a 2K screen with high DPI mode,

443
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,240
that's really zoomed in.

444
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,480
200% is way too much on 1440p.

445
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,720
But it does ship with that.

446
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,600
And it's the GNOME version of Fedora 32, totally vanilla.

447
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,460
And it uses the Fedora OEM GNOME welcome experience

448
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,760
to get you going.

449
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,720
And then you're in, and you're off to the races.

450
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,600
And I thought that was fine, but I actually quickly

451
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,040
replaced that after a bit.

452
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,120
I want to keep it Fedora for as long as possible,

453
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,800
because this wasn't meant to run, in a way.

454
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,160
So I put Fedora 33 on there, plasma spin.

455
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
And everything just works.

456
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,600
I just formatted the entire disk.

457
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,680
Didn't care to keep any special partitions or anything.

458
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,140
I just blew away everything and put my own distribution

459
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,640
on there.

460
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,280
And absolutely everything works.

461
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,680
I have a hardware probe in the show notes,

462
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,320
if you want to see what this machine has in it.

463
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,760
It's a nice little box.

464
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,400
I like it quite a bit.

465
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
And the nice thing about this Linux hardware probe site

466
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,000
is it just tells you everything that the Linux kernel can see.

467
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,100
Yeah, bury your secrets for us here, buddy.

468
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,800
Everything, right?

469
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,360
It does an LSPCI, and it organizes it nice

470
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,400
in an HTML table for you.

471
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,400
It calls out that my fingerprint reader isn't currently working,

472
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,840
because I haven't bothered setting it up.

473
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,640
Everything that Linux sees, it's in here.

474
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
And Linux sees everything that's in this device.

475
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,520
I can even control the keyboard backlight level

476
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,840
using the plasma desktop lighting applet, where

477
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
you set your monitor brightness.

478
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
I can control everything on this laptop.

479
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,080
It sounds silly to be excited about that in one sense.

480
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,840
But I think, as someone who's been trying Linux laptops

481
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,360
for years now, that you didn't have to fuss with that.

482
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,920
There was no special arch wiki page

483
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,800
about how to find this driver on GitHub

484
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,300
and get it built and installed to make that work.

485
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,120
Awesome.

486
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,720
It's tricky buying a ThinkPad if you're not already convinced.

487
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,520
There's some people I talk to, it's

488
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,320
like that's all they would ever buy.

489
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,200
That's all they get is ThinkPads.

490
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,800
That's not me.

491
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
I'm not that guy.

492
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,440
I like to look at everything.

493
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,960
I consider the Galago Pro very seriously.

494
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,320
I considered the XPS 13 very seriously.

495
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,560
But ultimately, what won me over for the X1 Carbon,

496
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,200
besides the fact that it was preloaded

497
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,520
with Fedora, which I wanted that experience,

498
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,360
is it remains to be a very practical laptop.

499
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,440
It is so thin and so light that you

500
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,680
can't tell it's in your backpack.

501
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,560
So that's the kind of heaviness it is.

502
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,320
You don't know it's in there, it's so light.

503
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,640
But yet, somehow they've managed to still have room

504
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,680
for two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports and HDMI out.

505
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,920
And one of those ThinkPad dock connector things

506
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,720
that I'm not familiar with that goes over Thunderbolt as well.

507
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,200
Wow, yeah, those are some ports.

508
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,000
And you know what it was?

509
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,080
Keyboard is great.

510
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,000
The sound is adequate.

511
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,480
It's better than the T480.

512
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,440
And my overall experience with the X1 Carbon

513
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,840
is it's in the hands.

514
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,880
Everything kind of comes together.

515
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,440
The build, the weight, the quality that you can feel.

516
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,000
It's a very well-built product.

517
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,600
How does it do on the old one-handed carry test?

518
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,200
That was always one thing that kind of upset me about the T480

519
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,040
is just you could feel it, the whole system kind of bending

520
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,760
if you carried it just up by the corner.

521
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,200
So it's a much better chassis.

522
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,880
So this is their carbon fiber magnesium composite.

523
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,000
I mean, there's no flex in the body at all.

524
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
And it's light enough that you could just

525
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,880
pinch-hold it in the corner.

526
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,800
So what I'm doing right now, even with it open,

527
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,840
is I'm just holding it with my pointer finger

528
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,400
and my thumb in the corner.

529
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,640
And I'm bouncing it up and down.

530
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,320
It's so light.

531
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,920
And there's zero flex in the machine.

532
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,720
That's great.

533
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,360
It's really, really solid.

534
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,240
It really has kind of checked all the boxes.

535
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,360
It's, from a performance standpoint, I benchmarked it.

536
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,280
It's a little bit faster than the T480.

537
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,240
It's a notable improvement, but not a huge improvement.

538
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,880
The multi-core story is a bit of a dog's breakfast,

539
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,240
to tell you the truth.

540
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,760
It does OK in some benchmarks in multi-core,

541
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,520
but it doesn't quite do as well in other benchmarks.

542
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,040
But the single-core performance turns out

543
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,120
to be really fantastic, actually.

544
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,360
It benchmarks faster in single-core performance

545
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,600
than that giant Dell Xeon that I had in not too long ago,

546
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,440
about a month ago.

547
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Wait, really?

548
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,320
Yeah, the single-core is ridiculous.

549
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,760
Wow.

550
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,040
So I mean, that's kind of nice.

551
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,880
And I hooked it up to my eGPU.

552
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,880
And I'm running Plasma with Wayland,

553
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,840
hooked up to an eGPU, playing Red Dead Redemption 2

554
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,520
under Proton.

555
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,760
And it works great.

556
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,800
Actually, I haven't played for more than about 15 minutes,

557
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,240
because I didn't have time this morning, but it all worked.

558
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,080
I had a show to do.

559
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,080
But wow, yeah, that's a really good day-to-day.

560
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,680
Can you have a little fun before you

561
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,320
have to do some work test?

562
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:05,280
So my build, as I have it here, is the i7 4.9 gigahertz burst.

563
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,300
It has 16 gigs of RAM.

564
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,320
And I got it with a 256-gigabyte NVMe.

565
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,980
And I'm already kind of regretting that.

566
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,120
So my plan is to kind of just tell you guys

567
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,960
what this is like, having had this for about a week

568
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,560
and change.

569
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,320
It took forever, UPS is a bunch of dummies.

570
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,640
But then I'm planning to see if I can open it up and put

571
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,760
a little more RAM in, or put a little bit more disk in,

572
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
and see what it's like long-term to use it.

573
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,520
So I'll plan to follow up and do a long-term review.

574
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,180
This, I have to say, is probably one of the finest machines,

575
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,120
though, that I've owned.

576
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,560
And I am extremely happy with the purchase.

577
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,640
And it's small and light enough that I'm

578
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,320
using it in places where I was using an iPad before,

579
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
like the couch.

580
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,480
Now I'm just cracking out the laptop.

581
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,360
And I can then just wedge it in the cushion seat

582
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,280
when I'm not using it.

583
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,440
It works great for that.

584
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:04,200
The 14-inch screen with a 1440p resolution is a little small.

585
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,440
But under plasma, you can really have fine-grained control

586
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,360
over the UI elements.

587
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,880
And so I notched the fonts up a little bit.

588
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,640
And I have the scaling at 125%.

589
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
Because you can refine it.

590
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,480
So instead of being 200%, I just have it 125%.

591
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,560
And it's really at a spot where I like it.

592
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,500
I can fit a ton on the screen, especially in a web browser,

593
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,920
or in a text document, or in a terminal.

594
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,840
But I have everything just turned up just a little bit larger.

595
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,340
And it really complements the 1440p resolution.

596
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,240
And I think in a way where I probably

597
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,480
would not have been quite as happy under GNOME Shell.

598
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,640
Because I do not have some of the same knobs I can turn

599
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,240
that I do under plasma.

600
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,800
So just the extra configurability

601
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,360
of more precision on what your scaling looks like?

602
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,820
Yeah, there's just so many options.

603
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,360
Not only is there more precision with the scaling,

604
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,880
at least in Fedora here with the stock,

605
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,200
but I have so many more options for UI element control,

606
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,840
from the buttons in the title bar

607
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,760
to all the various different fonts that

608
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,680
can be set throughout the entire UI for all

609
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,960
the different little types of dialogues, and title bars,

610
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,000
and consoles, and all that kind of stuff.

611
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,800
So you can just notch it all up a little bit.

612
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,560
It's really easy to do so.

613
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,680
This is as close as I've ever felt to the metal with an OS.

614
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,840
Because the performance is great.

615
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,200
And it turns out multi-core is wonderful.

616
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,840
But a lot of stuff really benefits

617
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,240
when you have really good single-core performance.

618
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,840
Being able to burst to 4.9 gigahertz

619
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,400
means that things just fly, like opening up applications

620
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,900
and whatnot, just absolutely scream.

621
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,000
And all meanwhile, I just have access to everything

622
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,520
through all of the built-in things,

623
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,440
like in the plasma desktop.

624
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,860
There's no sensors that can't be detected.

625
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,120
It has no problem controlling screen brightness,

626
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,440
or no problem controlling volume and audio.

627
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,120
Everything just works absolutely perfectly.

628
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,260
And I'm expecting that updates will come down via LVFS

629
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,120
when they're available.

630
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,880
And if you're not looking for a system with a GPU or a 4K

631
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,280
screen, I haven't tried the 4K screen variant,

632
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,160
I think the X1 Carbon is really, really nice.

633
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,240
The only knock, and it's not really a problem for me,

634
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,800
because it's still a pretty nice upgrade from the T480

635
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,360
I was using, is that it's 10th-gen Intel processors.

636
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,520
I'd love to see 11th-gen, and I think

637
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,840
that might be where the Galago Pro has a leg over this.

638
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,640
But for me, it wasn't a deal breaker.

639
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,040
I absolutely would love it.

640
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,120
But when I need GPU power, I have an eGPU,

641
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,360
and that would be the primary thing you would get,

642
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,280
I think, in my opinion, by going with 11th-gen

643
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,040
is you'd get nicer graphics, a pretty notable upgrade

644
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,320
in the Intel graphics.

645
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,000
It would be nice to have that, but when I need nice graphics,

646
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,880
that's just when I go to the eGPU,

647
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,200
and I'm fine with that process.

648
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,320
So 10th-gen processors work for me.

649
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,920
Battery life has been pretty impressive.

650
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,960
It's not blowaway battery life.

651
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,800
It's not all-day battery life, but I actually

652
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,320
haven't drained it down yet, and I use it pretty consistently.

653
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,080
But I usually, around 30%, 40%, I plug it in,

654
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,160
and I'm probably getting at least four or five hours out

655
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,040
of the battery, which is plenty for me.

656
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,680
So it's reached the threshold of it hasn't been an issue yet.

657
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,120
And even when I've left it in my bag overnight,

658
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,800
and I open it up in the morning, and I need

659
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,280
to get some work done, I've still got

660
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,480
plenty of battery life left.

661
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,980
Yeah, that's the real test is, do I

662
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,840
notice that I have to constantly keep plugging this thing in?

663
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,480
Yeah, and I haven't yet.

664
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,820
And it's USB-C as well, so any USB-C power source I have,

665
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,280
I can plug it into, which I love that versatility of it.

666
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,780
So very, very happy with the purchase.

667
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,720
I was nervous as hell when it arrived,

668
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,360
because like I said, I'm not necessarily

669
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
sold on all ThinkPads.

670
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,980
I don't think Lenovo has been a great steward of the brand.

671
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,480
But some ThinkPads have really held up over time,

672
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,620
and I think the X1 Carbon is one of them.

673
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,260
And now I kind of see what everybody's talking about.

674
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,960
Really like it, and I'm very happy with my purchase.

675
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,480
This will probably be my daily Linux driver for a long time.

676
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,760
And it checks the number one box I

677
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,920
needed from a laptop from a functionality standpoint,

678
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,000
and that is just this sort of universal works with Linux.

679
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,200
Everything I load on it works, because we

680
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,440
talk about distros so much.

681
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,200
We try out different things so often.

682
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,120
I just want that variability removed.

683
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,640
I don't want to have to fight to get

684
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,520
anything working in the laptop.

685
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,480
I want to be able to focus on the distro.

686
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,440
And that's totally what this gives me.

687
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,400
Even if it's not blowaway performance,

688
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,000
it's good enough performance that I'm happy.

689
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,080
And I give it a big recommend if you're in the market.

690
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,360
Boy, isn't that tempting.

691
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,320
I mean, it's nice that we've got a solid set of options

692
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:47,560
in this higher end set of Linux laptops that just work.

693
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,240
Yeah, I think my overall config was pretty well under 2 grand,

694
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,200
but I'm not positive.

695
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,600
I can't remember now, because I ordered it a long time ago.

696
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,800
Well, what feels like a long time ago.

697
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,880
I ordered it two, three weeks.

698
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,600
I can't remember.

699
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,680
It's been a few weeks.

700
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,160
And then UPS actually got here pretty quick,

701
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,880
but then UPS took a week and a half

702
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,360
to actually deliver it to me.

703
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,960
They just kept missing me and screwing it up and taking it

704
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,040
to the wrong place.

705
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,200
And so that whole thing, it just sort of

706
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,660
made it feel like it took forever.

707
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,080
And it was really disappointing, because I was sitting there

708
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,200
waiting and waiting for it.

709
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,840
Because you get that new rig anticipation.

710
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,760
And then they kept blowing it and claiming

711
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,240
they showed up when they hadn't actually showed up.

712
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,720
All that was pretty frustrating.

713
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,360
But in the end, it was worth the wait.

714
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,560
And I've been really quite happy with it.

715
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,800
And I'm really impressed with how sturdy it feels,

716
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,560
for how thin it is, and all of that.

717
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,960
So it's going to take a lot of machine now to replace that.

718
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,640
It would really take quite the argument

719
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,120
to switch to something else now.

720
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah, no kidding.

721
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,640
I'll be excited to see how it performs in some upcoming

722
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,760
Distro reviews.

723
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,960
Guess we'll find out.

724
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,240
And Plasma, you know what?

725
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,480
I really think I'm happy with it.

726
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,560
Coming back to Plasma after spending the summer

727
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,760
and change the summer and fall on Gnome Shell,

728
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,720
coming back to Plasma, I feel like I've really

729
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,880
kind of got down tweaking it.

730
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,000
And so when you've got a desktop environment set up

731
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,160
the way you really like it, you've

732
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
got it with hardware the way you really like it,

733
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,240
and I'm really satisfied with Fedora on that machine so far.

734
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,680
And I think I'm going to try to keep it

735
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,260
Fedora as long as possible.

736
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,680
It's really checking all the boxes.

737
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,280
So it worked out well, right?

738
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,520
You've got a comfortable, well-provisioned home.

739
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,400
Well, let's do a little cleanup.

740
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,280
Got to get the boxes out of here.

741
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,920
And let's talk about the Luplug.

742
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,960
It happens on Sundays.

743
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,320
We do them at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern in our Mumble Room.

744
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,800
You can get information about that at linuxunplug.com.

745
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,680
And rumor has it that there will be some released recordings soon

746
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,480
of their talks.

747
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,780
And what Wes and I will probably do

748
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,640
is set up an RSS feed for them soon

749
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,720
that we'll be able to tell you here in housekeeping

750
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,640
that you can subscribe to.

751
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,440
And then when they have people come in and do

752
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,980
a talk about something, you'll be able to get access to that.

753
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,840
Stay tuned.

754
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,800
Stay tuned for that coming very soon.

755
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,320
In the meantime, we talk about feeds all the time.

756
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,960
We should talk about the all-shows feed.

757
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,160
Just get everything we make.

758
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,000
Coda Radio is back.

759
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,080
Linux Action News is fresh and new.

760
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,840
Covering stuff as it happens.

761
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,520
And then this show here.

762
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,260
And of course, of course, self-hosted every other week.

763
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,680
So it's not so much that it's going

764
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,840
to blow out your podcast player, but you

765
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,160
get all the shows we're producing right now

766
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,640
and anything new that comes along.

767
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,960
So go get the all-shows feed if you haven't yet.

768
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,640
We have that linked at the Jupiter Broadcasting website.

769
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,360
And a note about Coda Radio.

770
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,160
It has a new live time.

771
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,360
Coda Happy Hour now starts at 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern.

772
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,880
And then the show usually starts about a half hour after that.

773
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,040
I was playing a little cyberpunk on the live stream

774
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,360
and cracking jokes with the chat room.

775
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,400
It actually turned out to be a really great event.

776
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,640
And we're doing that now Monday evening as a chance

777
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,160
for people to hang out.

778
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,320
5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern at jblive.tv.

779
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,360
Join us for that, won't you?

780
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,080
Mr. Payne, why don't we do a little bit of feedback?

781
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,600
Do you want to take Rob's?

782
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,240
Oh, sure.

783
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,280
All right.

784
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,080
Well, Rob wrote in about the tuxes, actually.

785
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,600
And Rob's been doing his own version.

786
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,440
Hi.

787
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,480
I just wanted to share my picks for the tuxes,

788
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,360
but with a particular angle of an academic perspective.

789
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,400
And he links us to his blog post.

790
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,440
And he's got a whole bunch of picks for the academic tuxes.

791
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,160
I love this.

792
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,280
That's a great idea.

793
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,080
He forked it, and he made it his own.

794
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,640
If this is your area of interest,

795
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,120
we'll have a link to this in the show notes.

796
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,640
I like it.

797
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,760
He got to it before we did.

798
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:39,160
He took the idea and he ran with it.

799
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,960
That also serves as a nice little reminder

800
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,200
that the tuxes are closing soon, so you

801
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,400
have a little bit of time left.

802
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,800
But Marcus writes in with the best top tool.

803
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,080
And he says, I've been following your discussion on tips and tops.

804
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,920
Nice.

805
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,560
Different utilities with great interest.

806
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,280
I have to say, even though the various tops,

807
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,240
you've never really got to one that's the great, the best,

808
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,480
nothing that beats Glances in usefulness.

809
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,960
Glances not only shows more information on the screen

810
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,840
than any other utility I've come across,

811
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:11,880
it also color codes values, indicating problems.

812
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,760
It also provides you with a human-readable warning log

813
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,540
when it detects anomalies in your system.

814
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,280
I just thought I'd share this invaluable gem.

815
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,200
And he's right.

816
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,640
Marcus is totally right.

817
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,040
You know, it's been a long time since I looked at Glances,

818
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,720
so I went ahead and gave it a good old install.

819
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,760
And it does fit a lot on the screen,

820
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,800
and I do like the information and how it displays it.

821
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,200
Right, and it comes with a web UI.

822
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,440
That's awesome.

823
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,280
Plus, you can export to stuff like Influx or OpenTSDB

824
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,760
if you have other metrics you want and also want

825
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,160
a handy little feature like this.

826
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,920
And I feel like, I don't know about when you run the web

827
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,240
server part of it, but when you just run the command line

828
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,080
version, it seems like it takes less resources than bash top,

829
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,960
go top, bpy top, all the other tops we've been talking about.

830
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,520
You don't always see it at the top of the top.

831
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,840
Exactly.

832
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,000
It just seems to sit there.

833
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,600
At least Glances on the command line,

834
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,720
and it does fit a lot of information on there.

835
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,840
And I felt kind of foolish because I knew about it,

836
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,040
but you get these new and shinies on there.

837
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,120
I mean, bpy top is still, I don't know, it might look better,

838
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,200
but Glances might be the overall more practical tool.

839
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,600
Let's do another practical tool.

840
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,480
This is our pick this week.

841
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,080
This is something that Wes found.

842
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,960
It's called pbgoppy.

843
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,160
God damn it, Wes.

844
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,120
Hey, I just find the picks, I don't make sure

845
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,040
they're easy to pronounce, OK?

846
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,600
Yeah, pbcopy.

847
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,960
And if you've used a Mac, maybe you've, now I can't speak.

848
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,480
If you've used a Mac, maybe you've

849
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,000
used pbcopy, their little handy dandy pasteboard helper,

850
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,320
much like Excel or XClip on the Linux side of things.

851
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,920
Well, this is like that, except it's cross system.

852
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,040
So if you want to copy between machines,

853
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,760
maybe you don't want to have a full set up

854
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,040
of something like a barrier or synergy

855
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,920
or other solutions for this.

856
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,040
Well, maybe pbcopy is the tool for you.

857
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,200
You just get started by running pbcopy serve on one machine that

858
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,840
access the server, and then you just

859
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,000
define an environmental variable on other machines

860
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,500
that you want to talk to that server

861
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,360
so they know what server to point to.

862
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,480
And then you can pipe to and from pbcopy

863
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,440
and share between systems.

864
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
It's pretty easy.

865
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,120
And they have packages for just about anything,

866
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,120
or you can just go get and grab it.

867
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,680
It looks like it's really easy to get up and running.

868
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,800
And don't worry, it looks like there are some options.

869
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,840
I hadn't played with that yet, but you

870
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,420
can add authentication and end-to-end encryption,

871
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,560
if those are concerns of yours.

872
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,480
So I bet we could set up a WireGuard tunnel, right?

873
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,680
And then we could do it over the internet, too.

874
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,160
Yeah, we can just copy and paste to each other.

875
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,920
I mean, who needs a messaging platform anymore, Wes?

876
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,720
I like the idea of me constantly replacing your clipboard

877
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,960
with little surprises.

878
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,360
OK, maybe I don't like that.

879
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,840
It's like a clipboard stocking stuffer.

880
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,240
Let's talk about something else.

881
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,640
Let's talk about our core contributors.

882
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,080
Thank you to the Unplugged Core, unpluggedcore.com.

883
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,800
These folks help keep the show independent,

884
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,400
help us run with a reduced ad load.

885
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,140
They also get two feed choices, a limited ad feed,

886
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,680
with only the ads we're contractually obligated

887
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:25,400
to include, or a full firehose feed, all our screw-ups,

888
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,640
all the stuff that never makes it into the show, just a raw,

889
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,360
live feed.

890
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,120
Those are two feed options, and they're

891
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,640
available to our Unplugged Core contributors.

892
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,180
Thank you, everybody.

893
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,760
We really, really do appreciate your support over there.

894
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,560
Also, go find our sponsor, Cloud Guru, on social media.

895
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,000
They are at slash the Cloud Guru at YouTube, Twitter,

896
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,960
or Facebook.

897
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,000
You can find them anywhere over there.

898
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,760
Mr. West, what else?

899
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:50,760
Is there anything else we should mention

900
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,200
before we get out of here, besides the taxis?

901
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,520
Well, just that, unfortunately, we're still

902
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,400
compiling the ZFS module, so this one might have to wait.

903
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,160
But we can provide an update later.

904
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
I thought maybe we'd see if we make it to the post-show

905
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,280
and see how it goes.

906
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,640
But yeah, that's a big build.

907
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,840
That might be like we follow up next episode.

908
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
We've got the utils done.

909
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,000
We're just doing the actual kernel module itself right now.

910
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,560
Oh, really?

911
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,800
We'll see, yeah.

912
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,920
Almost there.

913
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,080
Do a reboot, test it out.

914
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,000
I bet it works great.

915
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,600
And hey, I'm excited for some of that new stuff in ZFS.

916
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,440
Yeah, we'll see.

917
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,600
If you'd like to join us live, we'd love to have you.

918
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,080
We do the show Tuesdays.

919
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,120
We do it at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

920
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,400
See you next week.

921
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,920
Same bat time, same bat station.

922
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,480
There you go.

923
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,800
The show is at Linux Unplugged on the Twitter.

924
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,120
Your contact, your feedback, that stuff, I don't know.

925
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,120
I don't know what you do.

926
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,600
I don't even know what I'm saying right now.

927
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,800
But we want your feedback.

928
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,040
That's what I'm trying to say.

929
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,960
Linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

930
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,480
You go stuff our box over there.

931
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,080
We got a form.

932
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,640
You fill it out.

933
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,200
It goes into a box.

934
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,560
We read it.

935
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,120
Makes for show content.

936
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,680
Do I need to explain it, really?

937
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,000
Why are you making me explain it?

938
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,640
This is awkward.

939
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,320
It's the end of the show.

940
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,880
And now this is what the end of the show is about.

941
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,320
I don't know why you did this.

942
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,960
Linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

943
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,640
Just go there so Chris can shut up.

944
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,960
Damn it, you know?

945
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,400
Just ruin the end of the show.

946
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,840
I hope you're happy.

947
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:16,200
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

948
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:50,480
All right, JBtitles.com.

949
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,400
I've been doing this for a long time.

950
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,000
So in my experience, you really kind of want to shame and give

951
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,480
the audience a hard time on your way out.

952
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,680
That's my pro tip to any podcasters out there looking

953
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,920
to copy my style.

954
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,120
Really give your audience a what for right at the end.

955
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,600
Chris, I feel like intuitively that's

956
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,240
the opposite of a good pro tip.

957
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,080
Oh, oops.

958
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,680
All right, well, let's go pick our title.

959
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,320
How's that build going there, Wes?

960
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,120
Good, just finished.

961
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,400
I'm going to install these new packages now.

962
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,000
All right, you let me know when we're going to do the reboot.

963
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,240
It's fun that this ZFS release includes Zstandard and then

964
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,320
also the package that it built while building it.

965
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:33,360
Wait, do we have to reboot for a file system upgrade?

966
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,040
Depends on how DKMS is configured in your distribution.

967
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,680
Oh, it's a new module too, right, right, right, right.

968
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,800
Most distributions do require that.

969
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,560
I mean, the main exceptions would be Fedora and Debian,

970
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,640
where DKMS will build against all the kernels automatically

971
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,960
and then reload the modules automatically.

972
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,000
But most distributions don't do that

973
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,960
because it's a pain in the butt to make

974
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,960
that kind of automation work.

975
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,040
I didn't want to put this in the official review,

976
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,280
so it feels like it's OK to say it now.

977
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,880
But I didn't think a Linux laptop could be this good.

978
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,280
And that's someone who regularly reviews the latest XPS, right?

979
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,960
I feel slightly insulted and hurt

980
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,520
that you think I couldn't produce a good Linux laptop

981
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,640
experience.

982
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,840
No, it's the absolutely nothing needs

983
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,560
to be installed to get it working.

984
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,080
There is zero vendor software on it.

985
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,440
And that's not something that appeals to everybody,

986
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,480
but it appeals to me.

987
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,360
There is zero penalty for wiping it and putting anything

988
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,200
I want on it.

989
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,760
That was a prerequisite for us working with Lenovo on this.

990
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:44,480
We worked very hard to establish this process of we

991
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,040
want the default base image that you download from Fedora

992
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,280
to be able to do all the same things as your OEM preload.

993
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,280
And what's great is it comes with Fedora 32, which

994
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,360
means, by now, everything.

995
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,440
Anything that just made it upstream for that release

996
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,240
or anything, it's just everybody has it now.

997
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,160
33 just runs fantastically on there.

998
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:03,760
Yeah.

999
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,880
I mean, we're not doing this in a way.

1000
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,680
We're not trying to do this in such a way

1001
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,720
where we have the, quote unquote, upper hand,

1002
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,000
as some other platforms tend to do when they're

1003
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,400
doing hardware enablement.

1004
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,160
We're doing this mostly because people keep asking for it,

1005
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,560
and they want it.

1006
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,040
And so that's why we're even doing this at all.

1007
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,280
Otherwise, I think, really, it wouldn't have happened.

1008
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,200
And the funny thing is, it wasn't even our side

1009
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,320
that asked for it.

1010
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,840
It was the other side, Lenovo, because their customers

1011
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,880
asked for it.

1012
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,880
So what I see is that a lot of big brands

1013
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,720
go with Linux and partner up and create one of their brand

1014
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,440
laptops.

1015
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:50,160
But what you also see is that KDE, for example,

1016
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,720
brought out their KDE laptop, and there

1017
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:57,560
are some others that, for example, use the Clevo.

1018
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,640
But what of those laptops have you tested and think

1019
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,800
were nice?

1020
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,080
Well, I mean, if you've tried anything from System76, Tuxedo,

1021
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,680
Slimbook, or others, they're all using the same Clevo shells.

1022
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,080
I mean, obviously, there's a slightly different mix

1023
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,280
of hardware components from time to time,

1024
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,600
but they're generally the same base thing.

1025
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,800
Yeah, I see a lot of Clevos.

1026
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,600
But what I also found, and I think

1027
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,840
that's also the one that KDE uses, is the base of Tong Feng.

1028
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,600
Yeah.

1029
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,240
But that's coming from Tuxedo.

1030
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:35,360
And so their design is the one that bases that.

1031
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:38,320
Where the X1 Carbon kind of, I think, has the edge

1032
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,080
is it has this really sturdy magnesium body, right,

1033
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,460
and carbon fiber, whatever the hell they put in there,

1034
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,360
space material.

1035
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:51,480
But just regardless, it has a very rigid build,

1036
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,640
but it's extremely light.

1037
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:56,960
And yet, the performance is, like in single core

1038
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,040
especially, competitive.

1039
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,800
And so that's where it's like, wow,

1040
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,120
so I've got this laptop that is 100% pure upstream.

1041
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,640
Everything is, every distro under the sun is supported.

1042
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,640
It gets update via LVFS, so I just have to support.

1043
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,920
Anything I install just has to support that.

1044
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,200
But additionally, it's not really compromised in any way.

1045
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,600
It's extremely light.

1046
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,680
It has quite good battery life.

1047
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,680
The performance is good.

1048
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:26,000
It gets that Venn diagram just in the right spot of all

1049
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,600
of those features that I like.

1050
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,880
Like for example, the new KDE laptop

1051
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,160
or some of the other higher performance laptops,

1052
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,560
they're just too big.

1053
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,760
They're too big.

1054
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,960
And this is just the right size.

1055
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,840
It's not too small.

1056
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,320
It's almost too small.

1057
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,520
And it's not too big.

1058
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,840
And it's just in that, for me, that perfect size

1059
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,440
where I could take it on an airplane,

1060
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,120
but I can also work on it all day.

1061
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,520
You can easily drag it forth back to the studio

1062
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,880
or the RV wherever you are.

1063
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,400
It's not just sitting on a desk all the time.

1064
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,640
You're actually taking it with you.

1065
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,960
Yeah, and really, there's no penalty for taking it with me

1066
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,360
because it's so light.

1067
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,200
It doesn't feel like there's a big penalty in my bag

1068
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
for carrying around this big, heavy.

1069
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,360
I really like that high-performance Dell laptop

1070
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,760
I reviewed recently.

1071
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,600
But man, could you feel that big metal chassis in the, yeah.

1072
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,920
You could feel the chunking.

1073
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,680
Yeah, you really could feel it in the bag.

1074
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,520
It was a notable, like the bag could be empty,

1075
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,400
and the bag was still heavy.

1076
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,920
Get a little sweaty carrying it.

1077
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:21,520
It's embarrassing.

1078
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,120
There's nothing but that laptop in the bag.

1079
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,440
It was still heavy is what I mean.

1080
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,240
It was notable.

1081
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,880
And this, I literally, for the first couple of days,

1082
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,160
was having to double-check my bag that it was in there

1083
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,120
until I just started accepting that, yes, I did, in fact,

1084
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,120
put it in there.

1085
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,400
When you look at Lenovo laptops and the design for them

1086
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,000
and how they're approaching this,

1087
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,040
they have the wherewithal to customize

1088
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,920
every layer of the hardware.

1089
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,160
And that's just something to appreciate

1090
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,280
because it's one of the reasons we like Apple computers.

1091
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,720
They have that flexibility, and they take advantage of it.

1092
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,600
Yeah, and you could see some of that same thing

1093
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,280
like in the XPS 13.

1094
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,800
It's got a very competitive design and chassis and screen

1095
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,080
because Dell has a little more leverage there when they're

1096
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,640
putting all the components together.

1097
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,760
Just a question, yeah.

1098
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,360
What's the noise level of that thing?

1099
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,120
Could you use it in the studio, just working with daily work?

1100
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,160
So a week into it, setting up my software,

1101
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,800
loading a bunch of stuff on there, even installing the OS,

1102
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,000
I didn't hear the fans until today

1103
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,600
when I was starting Red Dead Redemption

1104
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,760
and Steam does that thing where it pre-processes the Vulkan

1105
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,640
shaders.

1106
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,320
That was the first time I've ever heard the fans kick in,

1107
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,440
and it was not bad at all.

1108
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,040
It was very tolerable, and it was pushing it.

1109
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,120
It was really pushing it.

1110
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,200
Yeah, that's good because if I want to buy another laptop,

1111
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,920
I want to use it at quiet places, too,

1112
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,440
like a library or something.

1113
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,200
And if you have that van noise kicking in all the time,

1114
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,960
that's bad.

1115
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,720
But if the noise level is good.

1116
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,200
Oh, yeah.

1117
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,000
I would describe the vast majority of my usage with it

1118
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,320
as absolutely silent.

1119
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:01,080
The only downside that I have with the X Carbon, X1 Carbon,

1120
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,400
is the price point.

1121
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,160
Because yeah, the money you pour in at the beginning,

1122
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,640
you get back in the years.

1123
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,480
But not everyone has that kind of money

1124
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,080
for a start of the laptop.

1125
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,200
I hope I can upgrade the disk because I

1126
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,400
know it's cheap, really.

1127
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,200
It's soldered in.

1128
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,280
Yeah, what I did find is that all Lenovo platforms have

1129
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,760
soldered storage and RAM.

1130
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,880
Is there any openings on it?

1131
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,040
I hope there's something I can do.

1132
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,520
Jeez.

1133
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,560
Well, the nice thing is that with one specific model

1134
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,520
of the Tongfang that has a Ryzen 4000 in it,

1135
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:43,520
and they advertised the battery for up to 14 hours,

1136
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,160
and the whole unit is 1.5 kilograms.

1137
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:53,680
It is a 15-inch unit, but with 14 hours battery time,

1138
00:57:53,680 --> 00:58:00,800
and with an AMD 4000 in it, with an M.2 PCIe or SATA SSD.

1139
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,080
It's an amazing thing.

1140
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,440
And the starting price is from 835 euros.

1141
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,600
That's a great price.

1142
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,120
It is.

1143
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,160
It's fantastic.

1144
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,840
I did hear from one manufacturer building on top of that

1145
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,440
platform that it basically is super buggy with anything

1146
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,280
older than Linux 5.10, or sorry, not 5.10, 5.9,

1147
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:29,880
which is not a great place to be when basically no hardware

1148
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,760
that manufacturer, no PC manufacturer

1149
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,840
is shipping Fedora 33 out of the box, for example.

1150
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,680
Nobody's doing that.

1151
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,720
And I know of one that has basically,

1152
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,080
they disabled their Linux offering

1153
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,760
until they work with all the distros

1154
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,920
that they were working with to be able to get that working.

1155
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,040
Because it was doing things like random CPU lockups,

1156
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,520
bad battery life things, random fan speed ups and shutdowns.

1157
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,360
Jeez, not what you want on your dedicated Linux laptop, right?

1158
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,440
Yeah, and they were a dedicated Linux laptop vendor,

1159
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,040
and this was bad for them.

1160
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,640
And the problem was that they were

1161
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,400
trying to work with the Linux distro vendors

1162
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,960
and with the exception of a couple, which, you know,

1163
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,800
you can guess Fedora being one of them.

1164
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,200
But with the exception of a couple, basically all of them

1165
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,560
said, well, you're just going to have to wait until next year.

1166
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,080
So they pulled it.

1167
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,800
Fedora being pre-installed on this thing

1168
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,920
was definitely for me like, it's a perk.

1169
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,880
Because not only does it mark the first computer

1170
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,440
in my lifetime I've ever bought with Fedora loaded on it.

1171
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,040
So that's like for me, it's a nice milestone

1172
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,080
as a longtime desktop Linux user.

1173
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,840
But additionally, it was a signal to me

1174
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,440
that I could put anything I want on it.

1175
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,040
Because I recently had an experience with a laptop where

1176
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,240
when I installed anything but the stock image,

1177
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,720
I didn't have a sound card.

1178
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,720
And I just didn't like that restriction at all.

1179
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,480
And so by just having Fedora on there,

1180
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,360
sort of a vanilla Fedora at that,

1181
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,920
it just sent a signal to me that this

1182
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,680
was a machine that was safe enough to run

1183
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,360
any Linux I wanted on it.

1184
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,560
And I liked that too.

1185
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,800
And then there was just that kind of personal milestone

1186
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,880
of, wow, now I've bought a computer with Fedora on it.

1187
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,320
I mean, I remember when Fedora was announced, right?

1188
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,320
So it's cool.

1189
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,080
It's really cool.

1190
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,760
It's a connection back to it, yeah.

1191
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,920
It's very meaningful to me at this point.

1192
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,860
It's been 18 years since the Fedora project was announced.

1193
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,600
It's been 17 years since the first release of Fedora.

1194
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:25,440
And we're on computers.

1195
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,280
Yeah.

1196
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,280
Well, what I noticed is when I went to buy one,

1197
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,960
it said that the Linux version was like five weeks.

1198
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,280
And it said like the Windows version would

1199
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,280
take way less time to come.

1200
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,320
So I just ended up buying one and grabbing a USB stick.

1201
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,160
And that took, yeah.

1202
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,680
I mean, I've done that before too.

1203
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,520
That's how I got my-

1204
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,320
Yeah, but it's because the Windows and Linux versions

1205
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,640
are actually different hardware.

1206
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:50,480
Oh, really?

1207
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,720
They make some changes to facilitate all the upstreaming

1208
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,000
and stuff like that?

1209
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,840
Yep, so there's-

1210
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,920
Oh, because I'm like, I'm running my X1 here.

1211
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,040
Oh, it'll work with Fedora because Fedora is awesome.

1212
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,920
It'll work with Fedora because Fedora is awesome.

1213
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,400
But there were specific hardware changes made to the device

1214
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,400
so that it would be more optimal for running on Linux.

1215
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,720
So certain hardware features were stripped out

1216
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,600
or replaced with different components,

1217
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,880
like the choice of Wi-Fi modules is more restricted,

1218
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:23,900
things like that.

1219
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,320
There were specific changes made to the Linux version

1220
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,000
so that it would actually,

1221
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,680
you would have the experience that you had, Chris.

1222
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,280
Because I'm on ArcoLinux and Arch derivative

1223
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,520
and it works just fine.

1224
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,320
Did you just get an arch by the way in?

1225
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,640
Is that what just happened?

1226
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,160
Come on, kid.

1227
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,160
Anyway, so in all fairness and in practice,

1228
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,360
regardless of the Windows or Linux platform

1229
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,440
for the ThinkPad that you are buying,

1230
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,720
it both will work perfectly fine with Fedora.

1231
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,200
The reason why the Linux version of the ThinkPad hardware

1232
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,960
is different is not for Fedora,

1233
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,480
but for the other Linux distributions.

1234
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,820
All the hardware enablement has already been done

1235
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,640
for even the main platform as far as I'm aware

1236
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,080
with the exception of the Nvidia card,

1237
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,320
but that's because nobody could do anything about that.

1238
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:15,320
But the only thing where I'm always annoyed by

1239
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,240
is the horrible IO placement of some laptops.

1240
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,360
Like you don't place one of the most prominent

1241
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,480
USB connections on the right,

1242
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,800
almost on the front of the laptop.

1243
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,160
That's where my mouse goes.

1244
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,040
Explain to me why there are two USB-C ports on one side

1245
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,600
and none on the other for the X1 Carbon.

1246
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,760
You can't explain that.

1247
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,600
It's brain dead is basically what it is.

1248
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,400
I have an X1 Carbon Extreme and it's even worse.

1249
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,920
I want to charge my computer on both sides of the thing.

1250
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,320
I have an X1 Carbon Extreme and it's worse

1251
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,320
because all the ports are still on the left

1252
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,920
and there's more ports.

1253
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,520
You'll have to allow me to interrupt

1254
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,020
because as you probably recall,

1255
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,060
we have just done a ZFS update

1256
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,040
and Wes has rebooted the server.

1257
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,640
And it is still down at this time.

1258
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:08,480
Looks like it.

1259
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,300
Yeah, you should get a ping going.

1260
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,140
Do you have one up already?

1261
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, I got one going and it's not coming back.

1262
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:12,840
Oh, geez.

1263
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,680
It does take a while.

1264
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,760
I don't remember how long it took

1265
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,400
because we were distracted doing the show.

1266
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,720
ZFS takes a while to build

1267
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,240
and get started the first go around,

1268
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,440
especially since you did an upgrade,

1269
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,820
which means it's going to update the pool automatically.

1270
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:25,600
It's going to reset its settings.

1271
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,800
It's going to reload the configuration.

1272
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,200
Like there's a bunch of stuff that it does

1273
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,560
the first time after you do a ZFS upgrade.

1274
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,040
And see, this is how you know I work with ZFS.

1275
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,100
That's right.

1276
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,640
These super micro boxes take forever to reboot anyways.

1277
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:38,480
They really do.

1278
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,440
They're just slow too.

1279
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,480
Yeah, and super micro is a pain.

1280
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,960
Like it's, last time I had to reboot a super micro box,

1281
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
which admittedly wasn't that long ago.

1282
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,400
It was like a week or so ago.

1283
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,600
It took like a minute and a half

1284
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,600
to get through all of the firmwares

1285
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,160
before it got to the operating system boot.

1286
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,300
It's stupid.

1287
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,160
Wes, the host is back up.

1288
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,680
It's responding to pings.

1289
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,440
Okay, so now we'll see if it,

1290
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,760
how the actual boot goes.

1291
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,400
Do you want me to jump in or do you want to do it?

1292
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,780
No, you can do it.

1293
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,620
Okay.

1294
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,440
It'll take a little bit.

1295
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,280
My VPN's got to get reestablished.

1296
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,160
Yeah, I am logging in right now.

1297
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,040
Hitting mount.

1298
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,880
Huh.

1299
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,720
Oh, here we go.

1300
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,400
I think the Docker containers are just starting up.

1301
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,360
Yeah, it looks like,

1302
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,920
because I just saw a whole bunch of that start up.

1303
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,600
Yes, I see the ZFS mount points.

1304
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,120
Wes Payne.

1305
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,000
Boom!

1306
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,320
Wes Payne?

1307
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,480
Oh!

1308
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,360
You know what else I love about this is,

1309
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,560
in what is not a good idea,

1310
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,200
my VPN connection to the studio is through this box.

1311
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,320
Yes.

1312
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:36,360
So I'm caught off if it,

1313
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,980
I mean, Chris is there as a backup, of course,

1314
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,280
but I love that WireGuard just comes back up.

1315
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,840
Like I don't have to fiddle with anything.

1316
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,660
I don't have to change anything.

1317
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,500
It's like an interface.

1318
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:45,320
I can keep my ping going.

1319
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,980
It just, and once it's back up, I can SSH.

1320
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,960
Wes, this seems like a bad plan.

1321
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,520
We've got SSH tunnels and other things set up.

1322
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,560
Well, there you go.

1323
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,400
This soap box is getting a lot of use today,

1324
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,400
because look what our arch server just did!

1325
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Look what that arch server just did!
