WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.180
Do you guys smell that?

00:03.180 --> 00:04.360
Oh, it smells good.

00:04.360 --> 00:05.360
Do you smell that?

00:05.360 --> 00:06.360
Yeah.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.140
It's a new fresh version of Cinnamon Desktop, version 2.6.

00:10.140 --> 00:15.560
Now I wonder if Clem hates it when Michael Larbel does this, when he pre-announces.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.860
I gotta imagine if you've worked months and months on something and you want to make a

00:19.860 --> 00:25.400
big announcement and you want to drive people to your blog with screenshots and bullet points,

00:25.400 --> 00:30.360
you hate it when old Larbel here is watching your GitHub page, or maybe he's just watching

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
his forums.

00:31.360 --> 00:36.840
But whatever he's watching, Cinnamon 2.6 update was just tagged, the release version was just

00:36.840 --> 00:40.840
tagged on GitHub for Cinnamon, and it's a significant update.

00:40.840 --> 00:45.800
This one bakes in systemd support, which is pretty nice, panel support for multiple monitors,

00:45.800 --> 00:51.160
which my wife would kill for, and support for client-side decorations, which is becoming

00:51.160 --> 00:52.480
more and more common.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.200
I'm looking right here at Polari, which is a great IRC client off of my other screen.

00:57.200 --> 01:03.680
Needs client-side decorations, TweetDeck, or not TweetDeck, TweetBird, client-side decorations.

01:03.680 --> 01:06.960
So those wanting to grab Cinnamon 2.6, guess what, you gotta wait.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.440
Clem will have an update for you soon on the blog, but in the meantime, packages are gonna

01:11.440 --> 01:16.600
be hitting probably Arch and Linux Mint very soon, and then the other distros.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.440
I have a question for the Mumble Room guys.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.320
I don't know, I mean, you know, there's obviously you could just get Linux Mint, Cinnamon edition,

01:24.320 --> 01:28.720
but for some reason, doesn't like fedora and cinnamon sound like a super tasty combination?

01:28.720 --> 01:31.200
Does that sound appealing to you guys?

01:31.200 --> 01:38.680
Yeah, I guess, that whole thing.

01:38.680 --> 01:44.560
I have my own preconceptions of fedora, I guess, sometimes I've used it, and I have

01:44.560 --> 01:50.760
my own preconceptions of cinnamon, and I think that although they might complement each other,

01:50.760 --> 01:53.800
they might complement each other in the worst way I could think of.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.200
Oh, lay it down, what do you mean?

01:55.200 --> 01:57.200
Give me your wisdom, share it.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.720
Oh, whenever I've ever touched cinnamon, it's great, it's a wonderful feeling to stop, and

02:02.720 --> 02:03.720
other people love that.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.720
It has a great personality.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
I want to get that out first.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
Okay.

02:06.720 --> 02:13.760
It has a great personality, but the way it acts drives me insane, chews up so much RAM,

02:13.760 --> 02:19.520
it's crashy, you know, at least when I use it, I'll put that in front of it.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.960
Well I'll give you this, it actually has been a little crashy for me too, and a little memory

02:23.960 --> 02:27.200
hungry, but if I'm okay with restarting it, and you know, it's real easy to restart the

02:27.200 --> 02:29.480
cinnamon desktop, it seems to be okay.

02:29.480 --> 02:30.480
Absolutely.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.640
Yeah, that's the same thing, same thing with fedora, kind of, you know, seems to have some

02:34.640 --> 02:39.440
great stuff, but you know, a little bit crashy, a little bit odd things happen, really weird

02:39.440 --> 02:40.440
times.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
Wow.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.680
I think Ryan, do you want to defend fedora there, or were you just clicking your mic

02:45.680 --> 02:46.680
open?

02:46.680 --> 02:49.880
I was just accidentally clicking my mic open.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.040
Oh, I thought maybe you were so passionate about it, passionate, you were going to go

02:53.040 --> 02:56.720
down on the mat for fedora, but no, no, that's not the case.

02:56.720 --> 03:01.600
I actually see, here's the thing, here's why I said fedora and cinnamon, and I am, I'm

03:01.600 --> 03:06.240
not saying it's there right now, fedora 22 could be one of the first versions of fedora,

03:06.240 --> 03:10.840
maybe, we don't know yet at this point, that ships with like a really easy to get going

03:10.840 --> 03:12.960
with cinnamon setup.

03:12.960 --> 03:19.120
And I, starting with fedora 21, I feel like they crossed into, holy crap, this is like

03:19.120 --> 03:21.920
a legitimate, useful desktop.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.900
And there's things out there like fed up and fedora tweak and things like this that make

03:25.900 --> 03:30.460
it more usable, but, or corora, really.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.700
It's getting there though.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.760
It's really, really, really getting there.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.840
And while Ubuntu goes through this awkward transition where they're going to do Unity

03:36.840 --> 03:41.320
next and they're going to go to snappy packages and they're going to go to QML and QT for

03:41.320 --> 03:45.640
their desktop and they're going to converge everything, it's really nice to think that,

03:45.640 --> 03:49.360
boy, there's this Red Hat backed distribution, you know, Red Hat that makes all those billions

03:49.360 --> 03:52.040
and has actual sway in the market.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.920
There's this Red Hat backed distribution out there that could have cinnamon and gnome.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.640
And gnome is going to be the premier desktop, cinnamon is going to be a pretty solid choice,

03:59.640 --> 04:03.040
and corora is going to work on a KDE version for you.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.520
And all of a sudden I'm starting to look at fedora and I'm thinking, boy, if they just

04:06.520 --> 04:09.640
had a few more months of support or the community stepped it up like they used to do back in

04:09.640 --> 04:12.280
the day.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.720
Here's where I'm at, guys, and we're going to talk about this more in the show.

04:14.720 --> 04:20.400
This week I had a come to Jesus moment with Ubuntu and I said, get it off this machine.

04:20.400 --> 04:24.400
I'm not going to do, this sounds like I'm being a diva, but I'll explain more in the

04:24.400 --> 04:25.400
show.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.400
I'm not going to do another episode until Ubuntu is removed off this computer.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.200
And I said, check my contract, there's a clause in there.

04:31.200 --> 04:37.400
And Rekai came down here between Tech Talk today and Linux Unplugged and installed and

04:37.400 --> 04:41.420
enter gross with gnome three and on a system 76 meerkat, I'm going to give you all the

04:41.420 --> 04:43.920
details on why that is.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.320
But I look at this and I think we need another solution out there.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.960
And for me, it cannot be Ubuntu 14.04.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.480
It's not a usable solution.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.640
I'll explain more why later.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.220
And now what am I going to do?

04:57.220 --> 05:00.920
So my default is I went to arch.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.040
This is a daily media production computer.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.800
I do a daily show and then I have another show later in the day every single day.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.160
I don't know if I'm comfortable with it being arch.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.460
So far it's been more reliable.

05:13.460 --> 05:17.120
And so that's where I'm at, but I'm not so sure that's a solid statement on the state

05:17.120 --> 05:18.960
of Linux for media production.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.240
So now I'm looking at Fedora and I'm thinking maybe there's an opportunity there if some

05:23.240 --> 05:24.600
of these things are addressed.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.240
So I'm really excited about Fedora 22.

05:26.240 --> 05:33.120
I'm watching it very closely because my expectations and my needs from a competently backed Linux

05:33.120 --> 05:35.480
distribution are beginning to change.

05:35.480 --> 05:38.600
And so Fedora could fill that role pretty well.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.960
Can I chime in for a second?

05:41.960 --> 05:42.960
Cool.

05:42.960 --> 05:48.400
That's actually why I started talking to Aiki and getting interested in Solus because I

05:48.400 --> 05:56.180
was hoping to help build a distribution that I felt could actually not piss me off constantly

05:56.180 --> 06:02.240
and I hate to say that because I was a firm Ubuntu user for a really long time and I loved

06:02.240 --> 06:03.240
it.

06:03.240 --> 06:10.360
And then with every single new release probably I was actually okay with Unity and everything,

06:10.360 --> 06:15.440
but after 12.04 it seemed like every new release I was having more and more issues that I was

06:15.440 --> 06:20.280
like I haven't had these issues with some other distributions.

06:20.280 --> 06:25.320
I don't understand why this is supposed to be so stable when I'm having these problems

06:25.320 --> 06:31.600
and somebody was just telling me the other day about they tried to do an upgrade.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.920
They didn't have any extra crap on their machine, no extra repos.

06:35.920 --> 06:41.600
They tried to do a straight upgrade and it broke something and I was like yeah, thinking

06:41.600 --> 06:46.440
about it since you've said that I've never had an upgrade that has just worked under

06:46.440 --> 06:47.440
Ubuntu.

06:47.440 --> 06:52.400
I guess I just feel like there is a market opportunity for somebody to come forward and

06:52.400 --> 06:58.560
say establish Linux users, we're not going out to new Linux users.

06:58.560 --> 07:03.400
People that are professionals, people that are experts, establish long-time Linux users.

07:03.400 --> 07:07.560
Fedora has an opportunity to step up and say let us be your premier desktop platform and

07:07.560 --> 07:11.000
wouldn't that be great for Red Hat too because in that naturally within sort of channel those

07:11.000 --> 07:15.840
people into using things like Red Hat and CentOS on their cloud installations, on their

07:15.840 --> 07:17.560
deployments at work.

07:17.560 --> 07:23.560
It fundamentally is like planting the seeds to grow Red Hat's enterprise business by becoming

07:23.560 --> 07:25.040
the champion on the desktop.

07:25.040 --> 07:30.240
The fact that they bailed on it years ago, I was always shocked, shocked by that because

07:30.240 --> 07:33.560
that seemed like such an obvious connection and it's clearly one of the things that's

07:33.560 --> 07:39.360
helped Ubuntu dominate Amazon and Digital Ocean and Rackspace.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.800
One of the reasons Ubuntu does that is because a lot of those people are developing on an

07:42.800 --> 07:44.920
Ubuntu workstation too.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.920
Don't kid yourself.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.520
Red Hat blew it when they pulled the plug and said, ah, we'll let the community do it.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.520
But you know what?

07:50.520 --> 07:53.720
It turns out now Ubuntu is blowing it, right?

07:53.720 --> 07:57.520
And I'm not saying blowing it like they're making all these horrible mistakes and they're

07:57.520 --> 07:58.600
going to destroy everything.

07:58.600 --> 08:03.900
I'm saying blowing it like they're not paying attention for a few years and they could very

08:03.900 --> 08:07.200
potentially be working on maybe the most kickass desktop eventually.

08:07.200 --> 08:11.520
If they really pulled everything off and they had all these snap stuff and this transactional

08:11.520 --> 08:16.640
base update and they had everything that was converged and this great SDK for developers

08:16.640 --> 08:20.800
writing for Linux to target, like if they really pull all of that off, maybe it's the

08:20.800 --> 08:22.480
most badass Linux desktop.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.120
In the meantime though, it's a hot mess and it's a transition.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.320
And so there is an opportunity for Fedora to be like, hey, you know what?

08:29.320 --> 08:32.760
Long time Linux users, you want something you can rely on, you want something great,

08:32.760 --> 08:36.160
you want something that's taken advantage of the latest open source, Fedora's already

08:36.160 --> 08:40.400
known for all of that stuff, it just seems so perfect for them to just slip right in

08:40.400 --> 08:44.040
there and be that next spot everybody jumps to.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.560
Because it's not going to take like this huge rebranding, like it would take a massive rebranding

08:47.560 --> 08:51.920
from Andreeva, nobody takes OpenSUSE as serious enough on that scale, so that's not going

08:51.920 --> 08:52.920
to happen.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.320
And there's all these other distros out there like Arch or all of the other distros that

08:56.320 --> 09:02.960
are really great, like elementary, but they just don't have the momentum or the approachability

09:02.960 --> 09:04.520
that something like Fedora does.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.560
And Fedora has the great interface, they have a good installer now, they have a great community,

09:08.560 --> 09:14.040
they have fantastic documentation, they have Red Hat behind them, they just are not executing

09:14.040 --> 09:15.040
this.

09:15.040 --> 09:20.400
And I don't know what that barrier is, maybe it's impossible, but I think, I want it to

09:20.400 --> 09:29.200
be them, when it came time to reload this machine, I guess it's Arch.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.960
Because I can't think of what else is going to work better.

09:31.960 --> 09:37.080
And that is, to me, that's not a state of how awesome Arch is, that's not Chris being

09:37.080 --> 09:43.720
an Arch fanboy, because I didn't make that decision out of a point of fanboyism or out

09:43.720 --> 09:49.840
of evangelism, I made that out of a, well, I guess it's that or Windows and I don't want

09:49.840 --> 09:52.960
to do Windows, and so do Arch.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.040
I didn't do it because, yeah, let's do another machine with Arch, I mean Arch is great, but

09:57.040 --> 10:02.040
it doesn't feel like the, a rolling distribution doesn't feel like the solution for a machine

10:02.040 --> 10:05.720
that's supposed to do audio and video calls all day long.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.500
Like that doesn't feel like the right solution for that.

10:08.500 --> 10:14.380
But you know what, I went with an LTS and it blew up so bad, I not only had to delay

10:14.380 --> 10:19.080
one show by an hour and a half on Sunday, I had to completely forego doing another show.

10:19.080 --> 10:25.960
So I have damaged two shows, directly impacted my work and my business because of Ubuntu

10:25.960 --> 10:27.400
LTS's flakiness.

10:27.400 --> 10:33.880
So I had to bail on that, and my other option is Windows, and I think why isn't Fedora the

10:33.880 --> 10:37.540
answer here, something modern, something that gives me the latest packages so I have the

10:37.540 --> 10:42.120
latest audio visual stack, I can get the latest mumble client, something with CentOS, can't

10:42.120 --> 10:46.240
deliver on that, why isn't Fedora already in this position?

10:46.240 --> 10:51.200
And it seems baffling to me because if they could completely dominate this, then it seems

10:51.200 --> 10:53.120
like people would naturally slide into the cloud stuff.

10:53.120 --> 10:58.520
I've made my point, I'm rant done, it's just, I'm desperate for them to do it.

10:58.520 --> 11:05.640
I know, it's like, saying this, and it's like, I know you listed a lot of things, you didn't

11:05.640 --> 11:10.760
touch Debian, you didn't touch, there was another one I had listed, I'm just trying

11:10.760 --> 11:14.400
to think of the main distros, just ones you might want to think of in the future, give

11:14.400 --> 11:20.480
a shot, because I know people are just like, ugh, Debian, it's like, ugh, you know, people

11:20.480 --> 11:23.760
have this predisposition of, oh, it's slow and it's, oh.

11:23.760 --> 11:28.960
No, Debian's a great distribution, right, what's the company behind Debian that can

11:28.960 --> 11:32.440
make people in the market do what they say?

11:32.440 --> 11:33.440
And also-

11:33.440 --> 11:36.840
What's the company that could write a million dollar check to Nvidia one day?

11:36.840 --> 11:41.480
I don't know of one, right, there's, you need to have an organization that has some pull

11:41.480 --> 11:45.740
in the industry, you need to have an organization that can write a check from time to time,

11:45.740 --> 11:48.960
you just need to have an organization that maybe could fly a few people in every now

11:48.960 --> 11:54.080
then to talk about stuff, like, these distros are great, but they can't even do that, it

11:54.080 --> 11:59.240
has to be a distro that from time to time could afford to fly a developer in, that,

11:59.240 --> 12:00.840
we need to be able to start at that level-

12:00.840 --> 12:09.880
They do have that, they do have that, there are, just because something is kind of a volunteer

12:09.880 --> 12:13.960
organization does not mean they don't have money for that, you know, Xorg and all these

12:13.960 --> 12:16.480
other people put out tons of money every year to do this-

12:16.480 --> 12:20.840
You're right, and that's why, that's right, that's why, that's why there's so many Debian

12:20.840 --> 12:24.720
based OEMs out there, that's why there's so many hardware partners that-

12:24.720 --> 12:25.720
There are!

12:25.720 --> 12:29.640
No, no, no, no, there are, there are people, there are companies out there that use Debian,

12:29.640 --> 12:33.960
and because those companies use Debian, they create a contract with a manufacturer to write

12:33.960 --> 12:38.280
some code, but there's a complete difference, then, then, then, there's a total difference

12:38.280 --> 12:42.940
in a company like Valve contacting a group like Canonical and working with their developers

12:42.940 --> 12:48.000
and working through their organizational structure, and then a foundation that has some volunteers

12:48.000 --> 12:51.720
that get some money that has about two thousand dollars to spend from time to time to fly

12:51.720 --> 12:52.720
people around.

12:52.720 --> 12:56.620
I mean, I'm not saying that's not great, it is super great and I'm very, very, very, very

12:56.620 --> 13:00.400
glad we have it, but it is a totally different level than what you need to be if you're going

13:00.400 --> 13:05.120
to actually be a premiere platform provider, and it's, it's for the desktop in this marketplace

13:05.120 --> 13:08.400
today with the market conditions, and I'm not saying Debian, that, that demotes what

13:08.400 --> 13:11.720
Debian is, because Debian is an amazing distribution that so many things are built off, and it

13:11.720 --> 13:15.400
was what I really discovered Linux around when I put it on servers, I mean, it's a very

13:15.400 --> 13:20.040
great distribution, but it can't be, what is the, it can't be Ubuntu, it can't be Ubuntu

13:20.040 --> 13:24.280
on the desktop, it's not, it's not, it's not backed by an organization like Red Hat, and

13:24.280 --> 13:27.280
that makes a huge difference.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.760
I feel like Red Hat kind of screwed us, I feel like Red Hat screwed us, basically.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.400
I feel like they bailed on us and screwed us.

13:33.400 --> 13:38.320
Yeah, Red Hat has the resources of what you're talking about, they have a lot of resources,

13:38.320 --> 13:44.040
they're not a poor organization, and so it is frustrating when you see them, they have

13:44.040 --> 13:49.680
this blue-headed stepchild that they've had forever, and, and granted, they're putting

13:49.680 --> 13:54.800
more into it now, and it, and they're making it better, but it's, it's still got a ways

13:54.800 --> 14:01.200
to go, and it is frustrating coming from what is, many would consider to be a flagship Linux

14:01.200 --> 14:05.040
company.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.040
So I'm there with you.

14:06.040 --> 14:14.240
I think SteamOS might have been a bad idea to use as an example for that.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.600
Go ahead.

14:16.600 --> 14:21.360
I mean, because it is Debian-based, just because, you know, Debian isn't working specifically

14:21.360 --> 14:25.960
with any vendor, doesn't mean that there aren't, you know, vendors going in and taking their

14:25.960 --> 14:30.960
software and using it, that's kind of the spirit of open source.

14:30.960 --> 14:36.000
Debian's the place you want to go if you want to find the core developers, the people inside

14:36.000 --> 14:41.400
Linux, but if you want to get out and pull people in, it's not the place to go.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.640
I feel so let down.

14:42.640 --> 14:47.440
I just, I guess why I'm upset is I just feel, I feel really let down.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.080
Did you try PC Linux?

14:50.080 --> 14:53.840
Yeah, you know, how many more things should I try?

14:53.840 --> 14:56.560
It's just, it's, it's such a bummer.

14:56.560 --> 15:01.520
It's such a bummer because I've, I've just, I don't know, I try to get people to switch

15:01.520 --> 15:04.280
to Linux all the time, and I advocate the platform all the time, and then I try to use

15:04.280 --> 15:08.600
it and it just fails for me, and it's just so frustrating.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.900
I mean, those of you who didn't watch the Tech Talk, it was just such a joke, like,

15:11.900 --> 15:15.120
so just a real quick, like, total, like, abbreviated, like, I don't even know.

15:15.120 --> 15:19.560
So I restarted, I restarted the machine this morning, and when it came back up, all of

15:19.560 --> 15:25.320
the two USB sound cards that I have were only listed as input or as output devices, not

15:25.320 --> 15:26.560
available as input devices.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.640
Of course, one needs to be input and one needs to be output.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.320
One's the mic in, one's the mic out.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.320
Pretty obvious.

15:31.320 --> 15:36.920
So, for some reason, not only did the sound devices change the labeling, so the label

15:36.920 --> 15:40.420
of the sound devices changed, so they're actually mislabeled, it reverses them, but, you know,

15:40.420 --> 15:43.440
it's only two of them, so I can figure that out within about five seconds, and I've gotten

15:43.440 --> 15:46.720
used to that, it doesn't even bother me more, but it's odd that it happens after every single

15:46.720 --> 15:47.720
freaking reboot.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.080
So I get used to which sound devices have swapped the names, and then now this time

15:51.080 --> 15:55.120
I discovered that they're only listed as output devices, not listed as input devices.

15:55.120 --> 15:59.000
Okay, well, you know what, the Mumble Room, they're pretty flexible, they just need to

15:59.000 --> 16:02.480
be able to hear me, and I have a show I need to do, it is now after nine o'clock, so I'm

16:02.480 --> 16:07.160
already late, so I finally figure out, nothing I'm going to be able to do about this, I try

16:07.160 --> 16:11.800
plugging, unplugging, powering off, powering on, nothing happens, and, you know, I'm not

16:11.800 --> 16:15.480
really totally invested in it, because I'm also trying to prepare a show, and I'm on

16:15.480 --> 16:21.000
the live stream, but, you know, whatever, I see that the monitor webcam mic in is showing

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
up.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.760
I have the mic in on the sound card, which is ironic, because the NUC actually has audio

16:25.760 --> 16:30.960
out, but it shows audio in from the sound card, and the USB webcam audio on the built-in

16:30.960 --> 16:33.080
webcam on the monitor.

16:33.080 --> 16:37.960
So I figure, well, the Mumble Room could probably stand and just listen to me on the webcam

16:37.960 --> 16:41.000
microphone, even though it's about four feet away from me, they'll be able to hear me,

16:41.000 --> 16:46.520
and because I can still control audio out, I'll still be able to hear them and record

16:46.520 --> 16:47.520
it.

16:47.520 --> 16:52.200
Now, think about this, think about where I'm at right now.

16:52.200 --> 16:57.480
Or I'm trying to do a daily show, and this is what I'm reduced to, because this has just

16:57.480 --> 16:59.280
randomly fallen apart from a reboot.

16:59.280 --> 17:04.660
Oh, but okay, I'll choose the webcam audio, not a big deal, I can roll with the punches

17:04.660 --> 17:05.660
and troubleshoot afterwards.

17:05.660 --> 17:08.960
Yeah, I have another show to work on, but you know what, I'd like to spend an hour of

17:08.960 --> 17:12.800
my day troubleshooting this again, even though I just spent two hours of Sunday troubleshooting

17:12.800 --> 17:13.800
this.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.800
Oh, fine.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.120
So I choose webcam audio, and this is, mind you, because I've had so many issues, I'm

17:19.120 --> 17:24.400
doing cold boots now, so I've done another cold restart, figured out which USB device

17:24.400 --> 17:28.780
is labeled as what, made sure I have the correct input and output, and the only thing I've

17:28.780 --> 17:32.320
opened at this point is the sound settings control panel, or system settings, whatever,

17:32.320 --> 17:35.400
and I can see audio input when I talk from the webcam.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.520
Great.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.860
So I close that, I open up Mumble.

17:38.860 --> 17:39.860
No audio.

17:39.860 --> 17:40.860
Hmm.

17:40.860 --> 17:41.860
Well, I go check the audio settings.

17:41.860 --> 17:42.860
It'll set to pulse default.

17:42.860 --> 17:48.560
Well, pulse audio in is my webcam, pulse out is the correct audio out sound card, because

17:48.560 --> 17:50.920
again, audio out is the only thing I can control in that setting.

17:50.920 --> 17:51.920
Huh.

17:51.920 --> 17:52.920
Well, it doesn't work.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.160
So I close Mumble.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.160
I open up the sound settings.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.480
Well, I see levels when I talk.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.960
Why doesn't Mumble hear anything?

17:57.960 --> 17:59.000
So I close the sound settings.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I open up Skype.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
I do a Skype call test.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.760
Oh, Skype hears me just fine.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.760
Skype can hear the audio.

18:03.760 --> 18:04.760
Huh.

18:04.760 --> 18:05.760
So I close that.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
I open up sound recorder.

18:06.760 --> 18:07.760
I record me talking.

18:07.760 --> 18:08.880
Sound recorder records me just fine.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.440
I reopen up Mumble.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.240
No audio.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
No audio.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.240
Why?

18:14.240 --> 18:15.240
Don't know.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.580
I have now run into a completely new bug in Mumble.

18:17.580 --> 18:20.980
Completely unrelated, apparently, to the other bugs that I've been having.

18:20.980 --> 18:26.440
So I have to now close Mumble, turn the computer off, boot the computer back up, now figure

18:26.440 --> 18:33.100
out which USB device has been labeled as which, set them as my audio input and output devices,

18:33.100 --> 18:39.540
and now open up Mumble, changing absolutely nothing else, and the audio works just fine.

18:39.540 --> 18:44.880
So somehow I get through the show, and at the end of the show, we decide, got to take

18:44.880 --> 18:45.880
Ubuntu off here.

18:45.880 --> 18:46.880
This is just not working anymore.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.960
This is just not usable.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.320
I don't know why it's working like that.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.920
It is an Intel NUC.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.360
It is Ubuntu 14.04.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.840
I've tried it with updates installed and not updates.

18:59.840 --> 19:03.940
I have done updates because I thought it can't get any worse, and then that's when the mislabeling

19:03.940 --> 19:05.000
thing started to happen.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.160
It got worse.

19:06.160 --> 19:10.080
So I just don't know what to do at this point.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.200
I have had people look at it.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.200
I have troubleshooted.

19:12.200 --> 19:16.340
I don't know what else can be done other than to replace the operating system, and I am

19:16.340 --> 19:20.600
baffled as to why it happens, but it is unusable.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.800
I have an idea as to why it's happening.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.800
It's unacceptable.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
I agree.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.860
It sounds exactly like a UDEV pinning problem, and it's been outlined, and it's something

19:29.860 --> 19:35.640
that Ubuntu is apparently looking at changing, because the UDEV has two options.

19:35.640 --> 19:41.880
It can go and assign just basically whatever device comes up first when the kernel goes

19:41.880 --> 19:45.640
and finds it, and that's when it assigns the first device.

19:45.640 --> 19:49.440
That's why it assigns eth0 and eth1 and all these other things, and that's why these can

19:49.440 --> 19:51.800
flip randomly, it seems like.

19:51.800 --> 19:56.240
Now you can do a kind of a pinning process of, okay, when this one comes up, I want this

19:56.240 --> 20:03.720
one to always be eth0, or I want this sound card to always be audio 0, or what have you,

20:03.720 --> 20:10.960
and Ubuntu doesn't have that little switch flicked, and it's become more of a problem

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
now.

20:11.960 --> 20:17.680
I believe Fedora does actually flip as I've done this, and it is a real problem.

20:17.680 --> 20:25.040
I personally had this problem with Nix, where I've done it as to per eth0, these are the

20:25.040 --> 20:33.480
settings for eth0, and then I reboot, and everything's fine.

20:33.480 --> 20:38.880
I understand your pain, and I understand where you're coming from with the Red Hat thing.

20:38.880 --> 20:44.840
There's not someone I can call, or I can talk to, or that I know has covered this situation,

20:44.840 --> 20:50.800
and Debian, I guess, isn't that perfect one, because they're going to their own philosophical

20:50.800 --> 20:54.760
ideas of how things should work, and maybe that should be up to them.

20:54.760 --> 21:00.080
Red Hat will be more about thinking, I'm selling this thing, I need it to be just like this.

21:00.080 --> 21:08.720
I kind of understand that feeling.

21:08.720 --> 21:13.840
Some things about being in media production exacerbate it a little bit, because something

21:13.840 --> 21:20.160
that some people don't have is I have a USB 3 HDMI video capture device, and if I open

21:20.160 --> 21:25.920
up Jitsi, and then close Jitsi and want to open up Skype, video for Linux will not release

21:25.920 --> 21:30.280
the video capture device from Jitsi, so I have to reboot the machine in order to release

21:30.280 --> 21:34.080
the video capture device, so that way I can then open up Skype and have video.

21:34.080 --> 21:39.120
Well, that then, if you have any kind of problem with the audio issue, that then exasperates

21:39.120 --> 21:40.120
that issue, right?

21:40.120 --> 21:43.520
Whereas in a normal Linux system, you probably wouldn't be rebooting as frequently as I am,

21:43.520 --> 21:46.760
so you don't run into it every single episode like I do.

21:46.760 --> 21:51.480
So there's things that just compound on top of it that make it worse than what normal

21:51.480 --> 21:52.480
people run into.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.640
Like, a lot of people aren't having to change their audio interfaces very often, that's

21:55.640 --> 21:57.920
just not something they ever touch, right?

21:57.920 --> 22:01.080
But here it's something we change from time to time, and rebooting is something we do

22:01.080 --> 22:09.160
occasionally, and I try to minimize, I try to make it work so bad, and I feel so defeated

22:09.160 --> 22:17.320
when I've lost three days of work to this problem.

22:17.320 --> 22:21.400
I still recommend giving OpenSUSE a try.

22:21.400 --> 22:26.600
I don't really, I've never really been much of a fan of Fedora, other than, you know,

22:26.600 --> 22:32.120
testing a few things here and there, but I always say, you know, OpenSUSE still has

22:32.120 --> 22:37.200
the release model, it has stable upgrades, it's got server, you can sue it, it's got

22:37.200 --> 22:41.640
a company back with millions of dollars behind it that you can, you know, have some developers

22:41.640 --> 22:42.640
around.

22:42.640 --> 22:43.920
Which company is it this year?

22:43.920 --> 22:46.200
They change companies so often, I can't keep it straight.

22:46.200 --> 22:50.840
I'll just say it is, but, you know, just give it a try.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.880
No, I used to be an OpenSUSE user, I used to.

22:53.880 --> 22:54.880
Me too.

22:54.880 --> 22:59.680
You know why the OpenSUSE movement died?

22:59.680 --> 23:00.680
Ubuntu.

23:00.680 --> 23:01.680
Their PR is magical.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.680
They roll over anything.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.680
No.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.800
No, they just take, no, no, it's nothing to do with PR, Ubuntu's a better product, that's

23:07.800 --> 23:08.800
why.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.640
No, Ubuntu's a better product, that's why Ubuntu took over.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.640
Oh no.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.320
If it was a better product, I would have been using it.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.280
No, it's a better product for more people.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.280
Oh, really?

23:17.280 --> 23:18.280
I think it's a better product for more people.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
Right, you're the single arbiter of what is really bad in the Linux community.

23:19.280 --> 23:20.280
Yeah.

23:20.280 --> 23:25.200
Yeah, you're the single arbiter of what is really bad in the Linux community.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.200
Oh boy.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.200
Oh yeah.

23:27.200 --> 23:32.200
Ubuntu's freaking lost my freaking, you know, very long time ago.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
Give it a try, man.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.040
No, you tell me like I've never tried it before.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.880
I just ran like whatever 13.2 or whatever it was, I mean, you know.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.880
Other than on a VM.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.480
No, I had it on a, I had it on a Bonobo.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.480
So Chris.

23:44.480 --> 23:45.480
Yeah.

23:45.480 --> 23:52.120
I mean, in my opinion, you could switch to another distro and maybe that sound problem

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
will go away.

23:53.120 --> 23:57.320
Maybe it'll go away like today, maybe it'll go away for the next six months.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.320
And then come back.

23:58.320 --> 24:02.640
But something else will come and bite you, whether it's, oh no, I can't, I can't update

24:02.640 --> 24:07.960
my Java install, which is required by something else, or, oh no, I can't update my browser

24:07.960 --> 24:12.560
or there's some problem when I plug in USB devices that causes it to reboot, you know.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.560
That would be an issue.

24:13.560 --> 24:18.000
I mean, aside from that USB one, none of them would stop me from doing a show though, right?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
That's what gets me.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.240
No, but every distro, no distro is perfect.

24:22.240 --> 24:23.240
And I'm not saying we are.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.240
Right.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.240
No, I agree.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.620
They all have their own individual issues.

24:26.620 --> 24:32.360
And I, you know, I get this a lot at Linux user groups where people will install a distro

24:32.360 --> 24:35.560
and it doesn't really matter which one it is, they'll install a distro and something

24:35.560 --> 24:36.560
won't work.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.220
It doesn't matter what it is, whether it's the video card or their wacky mouse or whatever.

24:40.220 --> 24:44.560
And so the solution to that is not work out what the problem is, but it's, you know, wipe

24:44.560 --> 24:46.040
it and put a different distro on it.

24:46.040 --> 24:50.240
When eventually they'll find one that they're happy with, you know, for whatever measure

24:50.240 --> 24:51.880
of happy that is.

24:51.880 --> 24:55.640
And then, you know, you could check the mailing list and six months later they'll have flipped

24:55.640 --> 25:00.560
to something else because something else pissed them off or, you know, they might last a year,

25:00.560 --> 25:05.520
they might last 18 months or they might be happy on an LTS release of some distro or

25:05.520 --> 25:09.360
they might be on Debian stable and nothing changes and there's cobwebs everywhere, but

25:09.360 --> 25:11.600
it's all holding together and everything's fine.

25:11.600 --> 25:16.480
But someday something will fuck up and they'll get just as pissed off again.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.480
Yeah.

25:17.480 --> 25:22.000
I suppose what, you know what, you know, it's ironic is in a way if I could have booted

25:22.000 --> 25:27.520
up and realized, oh no, this update has made my audio way worse.

25:27.520 --> 25:32.960
If I could have rebooted again back into the old system state, that would have been very

25:32.960 --> 25:40.240
nice, like some sort of like transactional update where I could just roll back because

25:40.240 --> 25:45.780
I could have, if I could have rolled back, it could have been manageable had it not been

25:45.780 --> 25:48.280
like all of the other issues compounded by the latest updates.

25:48.280 --> 25:51.040
And I was hoping the latest updates would make things a little better because I figured

25:51.040 --> 25:53.640
it's already busted, can't get much worse, got way worse.

25:53.640 --> 25:57.960
And don't get me wrong, I feel your pain, you know, when something goes wrong and I

25:57.960 --> 26:01.940
just want to throw a laptop out of a window, you know, that frustration, especially when

26:01.940 --> 26:06.480
you have a deadline and you've got something to do, that it is the worst feeling in the

26:06.480 --> 26:10.720
world when you're fighting against and you feel that it feels like the computer is fighting

26:10.720 --> 26:12.440
against you.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.440
It's a horrible feeling.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.440
It is indeed.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.440
It is indeed.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.440
Heller, go ahead.

26:16.440 --> 26:20.680
You wanted to make, I think, what is going to be a fantastic point.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.680
That was your line.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.680
That was your cue, man.

26:22.680 --> 26:28.960
You were supposed to own that.

26:28.960 --> 26:35.520
Like I said, the most stable distro I've ever used on my Lenovo laptop has been Arch proper.

26:35.520 --> 26:41.920
I've gone through Mint, Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian and all of them.

26:41.920 --> 26:46.480
They've all come with something that just, but most of it's been graphics.

26:46.480 --> 26:49.840
It does have an optimist and video card in it.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.040
So I've had that issue.

26:51.040 --> 26:57.560
But the biggest, the biggest strong point I can make for Arch is the fact that gaming

26:57.560 --> 27:06.440
on Arch and Steam and everything on this Lenovo that I have has been phenomenal compared to

27:06.440 --> 27:08.320
the other distros.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.560
I'm not busting them down.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.560
I don't know.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.560
I use them for other things.

27:11.560 --> 27:16.120
One of the things that really bugged me about the Ubuntu Snappy personal, I can't remember

27:16.120 --> 27:19.920
what it's called when it was announced that Ubuntu Next is going to be based on Ubuntu

27:19.920 --> 27:20.920
Snappy.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.640
One of the headlines that went around a lot, there's a lot of different versions of it,

27:23.640 --> 27:27.380
but one of the ones that went around a lot is Ubuntu is setting out to make Linux more

27:27.380 --> 27:28.380
stable.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.320
And I thought, what the hell does that mean?

27:30.320 --> 27:33.960
You know, because when you tell users things are more stable, they think, does the program

27:33.960 --> 27:34.960
crash on you?

27:34.960 --> 27:37.040
Does the operating system lock up?

27:37.040 --> 27:47.020
But actually, if I could have rolled this system back and had a more functional system,

27:47.020 --> 27:51.240
that would have been my definition of stable for a production machine.

27:51.240 --> 28:00.480
And in a way, initially, the reaction to the Ubuntu Snappy release is, oh, isn't that quaint?

28:00.480 --> 28:03.260
They're taking a tar.gz file.

28:03.260 --> 28:05.280
They're decompressing it to a partition.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.400
They're updating the bootloader, and they're booting off that new partition.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.400
And if it doesn't work, you boot back to the old partition.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.200
That's very adorable.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.880
And then we just sort of dismiss it as, oh, yeah, that's transactional.

28:14.880 --> 28:21.580
But really, that's all it would have taken to fix my entire problem today, to solve two

28:21.580 --> 28:23.400
shows' problems.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.400
And I would have considered that more stable.

28:25.400 --> 28:30.040
And so what Canonical and Ubuntu are saying really is, hey, you know, this entire way

28:30.040 --> 28:34.200
we've been updating our computers this entire time, that's just inherently not all that

28:34.200 --> 28:35.200
stable.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.000
And there's just not really a way we're going to make that better.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.580
It turns out the way software is built, the way Linux is built, where one group is working

28:41.580 --> 28:45.000
on PulseAudio, and one group is working on video for Linux, and one group is working

28:45.000 --> 28:49.240
on this, and the other group is working on that, turns out not really a great way to

28:49.240 --> 28:51.620
just ship that in individual updates like that.

28:51.620 --> 28:55.080
So we're going to do these in these big snapshot updates, and you just roll back if it doesn't

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
work.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.520
And sorry, everybody else, you can keep doing it the way you're doing it, but we don't think

28:58.520 --> 29:00.480
that's a good way to go anymore.

29:00.480 --> 29:08.440
I think they might be on to something, because there has been a huge problem not just in

29:08.440 --> 29:13.720
a situation like I had, where I ran into, but if you look at how successful vulnerabilities

29:13.720 --> 29:18.600
like Heartbleed were, it was because people hadn't been updating their systems, their

29:18.600 --> 29:21.300
OpenSSL installation, or the PlayStation Network.

29:21.300 --> 29:26.600
Remember when Sony got hacked years ago, back at the start of TechSnow?

29:26.600 --> 29:30.580
They got hacked because they didn't update their Apache servers, right?

29:30.580 --> 29:31.920
You've all been in enterprises.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.960
You guys all have seen, I mean, most of you probably, if you've worked in any company

29:34.960 --> 29:39.760
at all, have seen some super old installations of software, because there is a certain roll

29:39.760 --> 29:43.600
of the dice when you update that software.

29:43.600 --> 29:49.480
And a lot of businesses are more willing to bank on the risk than they are willing to

29:49.480 --> 29:52.040
bank on the almost certain problems of updates.

29:52.040 --> 29:56.760
And so there were documents from the more recent Sony hack, the Sony Entertainment Pictures

29:56.760 --> 30:01.080
hack, the more current one with the whole interview movie, there's documents from that,

30:01.080 --> 30:05.520
where their CTO clearly says, their Chief Technology Officer clearly says, it is cheaper

30:05.520 --> 30:10.420
for us to run the risk than it is for us to mitigate and fix it.

30:10.420 --> 30:16.880
And part of that is, is because Linux is a huge part of these infrastructures.

30:16.880 --> 30:21.720
And it's not the Linux kernel's fault, but Linux distributions are not super great at

30:21.720 --> 30:23.920
updates, even ones like Red Hat Enterprise.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.680
They're not super great at it.

30:25.680 --> 30:26.680
Stuff breaks.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.840
And Windows isn't super great at it either, and neither is Mac OS X, and you know, etc,

30:29.840 --> 30:30.840
etc.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.040
They're not super great at it.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.520
But we did get better at it with the mobiles, didn't we?

30:34.520 --> 30:40.720
So I don't know, in 92, we were a little like, oh, yeah, it's a good idea, but it's a little

30:40.720 --> 30:41.720
quaint.

30:41.720 --> 30:46.200
And now, after having lived this last couple of days on an Ubuntu system, I'm thinking,

30:46.200 --> 30:49.160
if this was a year down the road or whatever it's going to be, and this was a transactionally

30:49.160 --> 30:53.540
updated system, I wouldn't have had this problem.

30:53.540 --> 31:00.680
So what I can take from this is, it might very well be like, you know, Ubuntu's contribution

31:00.680 --> 31:06.440
to Linux, you know, Red Hat's contribution system, etc, etc, and maybe that will be a

31:06.440 --> 31:07.440
good solution.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.560
You know, it will bring its own problems, but I guess the nice thing about this whole

31:11.560 --> 31:17.720
thing is, we might have a solution coming at Ubuntu, and what's even better is, it's

31:17.720 --> 31:20.000
not going to be the only way to do it.

31:20.000 --> 31:26.320
So you'll be able to get your perfect system where you just up the good chunks, and the

31:26.320 --> 31:31.640
Arch people will be able to update everything transactionally in their own, using Pacman.

31:31.640 --> 31:37.960
And I kind of think that, you know, all these problems aren't going to go away.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.680
I think it's just going to become a, there's a solution to it.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.440
This is your solution over here.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.440
Yeah.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.440
Yeah.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.800
I mean, there's only so much you can do when humans are continuing to make the software,

31:46.800 --> 31:47.800
until the computers take over.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.800
Yeah.

31:48.800 --> 31:49.800
I think that's what we're going to have to do.

31:49.800 --> 31:50.800
Yeah, exactly.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.800
There you go.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.800
Yeah.

31:52.800 --> 32:00.400
So the end, the RN solution was Antigros, and because I just wasn't sure if Arch was

32:00.400 --> 32:05.120
a great idea for this machine, even though every time I put Arch in production, I've

32:05.120 --> 32:10.880
been happy with it, I still, I think because I spent so many years in the enterprise IT

32:10.880 --> 32:19.160
area, deploying Red Hat and SUSE Enterprise, like to me, I just, I cannot get over that

32:19.160 --> 32:20.160
bias.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.320
Like, I just, it seems I cannot get over it.

32:22.320 --> 32:26.440
So, like putting Arch in here seems like such a big risk to me, that we're running this

32:26.440 --> 32:31.840
on the System76 Meerkat, and the original NUC is still sitting right next to it, with

32:31.840 --> 32:37.160
the Ubuntu Mate 14.04 install, ready to go, so that at any moment, if I have a problem

32:37.160 --> 32:40.760
with Arch, I just unplug everything and plug into the, into that machine, it's just, it

32:40.760 --> 32:42.560
would be probably just as broken.

32:42.560 --> 32:46.040
But it is, it's, we'll see.

32:46.040 --> 32:52.040
I'll run it like this for a little bit, and find out what happens, I guess.

32:52.040 --> 32:56.920
I should, I should do like Putin, did you guys see that, did you guys see that Russia

32:56.920 --> 32:58.560
is going to fork Sailfish OS?

32:58.560 --> 33:02.280
Oh, I didn't, that would be great.

33:02.280 --> 33:07.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that Russia's going to, so Russia's Minister of Communication, Nikolai,

33:07.920 --> 33:13.000
Nikolov or whatever, has taken to forums and consortiums and whatnot to announce Russia's

33:13.000 --> 33:19.660
plan to take a forked version of Yalla Sailfish OS to lessen its dependency on Western technology.

33:19.660 --> 33:26.320
It's a work meeting he held last week with folks from Sailfish Holdings and Yalla, along

33:26.320 --> 33:31.320
with other companies and participants in the open source software domain.

33:31.320 --> 33:35.000
Russia's officials recently swapped out their iPads for Samsung tablets, switching over

33:35.000 --> 33:40.720
to Android recently, and declared that they want to invest more in open source software.

33:40.720 --> 33:45.280
And so they're, they're going to look at how they can use open source more in private sectors,

33:45.280 --> 33:51.760
technical sectors, economic sectors, political offices, and other areas to lessen dependence

33:51.760 --> 33:53.200
on Western technology.

33:53.200 --> 33:57.120
So we could have a Sailfish OS fork soon.

33:57.120 --> 34:04.960
And speaking of Yalla and Russia, watch out, Popi, the Ubuntu phone has some serious competition.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.440
The Yoda phone too is up on Indiegogo this week.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.880
I mentioned this last week in Tech Talk today, I would have talked about it in Tech Talk

34:10.880 --> 34:16.520
today except for the, well, the Linux problems prevented me from doing the entire episode.

34:16.520 --> 34:20.640
But they are at 60 days right now on their Indiegogo campaign.

34:20.640 --> 34:24.560
They are 177% funded already.

34:24.560 --> 34:27.920
And I think they just launched it eight hours ago.

34:27.920 --> 34:35.920
So you might wonder, why is this thing funded 177% in eight hours?

34:35.920 --> 34:36.920
I know why.

34:36.920 --> 34:37.920
You guys know why?

34:37.920 --> 34:41.080
Never even heard of it before.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.080
Okay.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.560
Well, this is why you got to watch Tech Talk.

34:43.560 --> 34:45.120
Dual freaking display.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.120
Yep.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.120
Exactly.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.120
E Ink on the back of this thing.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.120
E Ink.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.120
Here, I'll play a little bit.

34:50.120 --> 34:51.120
This thing is so cool.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.240
What if we see the world around us the wrong way?

34:53.240 --> 34:54.240
What?

34:54.240 --> 35:04.440
What if we are just used to a one-sided world, feelings, dreams, hearing, seeing, love, used

35:04.440 --> 35:09.720
to one-sided freedom, one-sided communication?

35:09.720 --> 35:15.760
But what if, what if one side is not enough?

35:15.760 --> 35:20.480
Yodaphone, the phone with two fronts.

35:20.480 --> 35:25.240
We are so used to our smartphones that we accept the fact that we have to charge them

35:25.240 --> 35:27.040
multiple times per day.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.860
We can't see, we can't read in sunlight.

35:29.860 --> 35:34.280
It's require a lot of efforts and clicks to get access to information we need.

35:34.280 --> 35:38.720
And we thought, what if we look at the smartphone from another side?

35:38.720 --> 35:43.000
And that's how Yodaphone was born and solve all these problems.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.640
It doesn't waste battery power and legible under sunlight.

35:47.640 --> 35:52.040
All information you need is available to you just at a glance.

35:52.040 --> 35:55.840
And this screen can even act as a nice photo frame.

35:55.840 --> 36:01.120
Plus electronic paper display doesn't hurt your eyes and it's perfect for reading.

36:01.120 --> 36:05.560
Over the last two years, we've developed two generations of Yodaphone and now we are

36:05.560 --> 36:08.720
selling Yodaphone in more than 20 countries.

36:08.720 --> 36:14.300
This phone has won more than 20 prestigious industry awards and has been called many times

36:14.300 --> 36:18.120
as the most innovative and disruptive smartphone of the year.

36:18.120 --> 36:23.280
But we need your help to bring this innovative, disruptive smartphone to North America.

36:23.280 --> 36:30.120
So please support our Indiegogo campaign and be part of dual screen revolution with Yodaphone.

36:30.120 --> 36:33.000
So it's interesting, I like the idea of e-ink on the back.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.320
You can see how that would be really useful for reading a book too.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.680
So like the Kindle app or something like that.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.560
But Corky, you say don't trust it?

36:40.560 --> 36:41.720
I say do trust it.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.720
Oh, do trust it.

36:43.720 --> 36:48.720
Well if you look at the specs, it's what you'd expect in a normal phone.

36:48.720 --> 36:53.440
It's a Snapdragon 801, 2 GB RAM, 1080p screen.

36:53.440 --> 36:59.760
The only difference is what you can do with the back of the phone with this e-ink display.

36:59.760 --> 37:04.840
It's not as if they're tackling 15 different new goals at once.

37:04.840 --> 37:12.680
It's simply this is their USP and if they get this right, it will be an amazing phone.

37:12.680 --> 37:18.160
So they say up to 45 hours with Yoda energy mode.

37:18.160 --> 37:23.080
Always on information on the back of the phone like clock, temperature, notifications.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.660
You can have breaking news.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.760
You can also have your Google Fit information up on there like your steps and maps.

37:28.760 --> 37:32.560
This is a pretty neat idea you guys and this is a great example of something open source

37:32.560 --> 37:33.560
phones could totally do too.

37:33.560 --> 37:35.400
It doesn't need Android to do this.

37:35.400 --> 37:43.000
I mean they're going to ship it with Lollipop but yeah, you can see why it has already gotten

37:43.000 --> 37:44.260
a lot of funding.

37:44.260 --> 37:46.720
It's a pretty neat idea.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.560
It's fun to see where these devices are going to.

37:48.560 --> 37:55.680
So that's the Yoda phone and I don't know, you look at your Sailfish and Yalla, there's

37:55.680 --> 37:56.920
a lot of neat phones out there right now.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.400
Of course the Ubuntu phone too.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.640
A lot of, they just have the new Mayez phone or whatever that just went available for Chinese

38:02.640 --> 38:03.640
developers.

38:03.640 --> 38:04.640
Meizu.

38:04.640 --> 38:05.640
Meizu, thank you.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.640
Yeah, I was wondering about that if you were going to mention the Meizu.

38:07.640 --> 38:10.120
Yeah, the Meizu MX4.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.960
Which yeah, and then also the Rotten Corpse.

38:12.960 --> 38:17.320
Did you want to mention the Zenfone 2 that is like an x86 based phone, right?

38:17.320 --> 38:27.080
Yeah, it's a 64 bit quad atom and it has 4 gigs of RAM, it's got 1080p screen, it's a

38:27.080 --> 38:33.560
dual SIM phone, it's got like, it's got a ridiculous amount of hardware specs and it

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
costs $300 US.

38:34.560 --> 38:39.240
Yeah, and I bet with the x86 base, there's probably a pretty good chance you'll be able

38:39.240 --> 38:41.640
to get all kinds of fun things on there.

38:41.640 --> 38:47.280
Well, technically, it's theoretically possible but right now the bootloader is locked.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.280
That doesn't surprise me.

38:48.280 --> 38:51.280
The XDA and other people are working on fixing that.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.840
No, actually it's Intel's fault, not Asus' fault.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.160
Asus say they are going to unlock it.

38:56.160 --> 39:02.040
Yeah, well they're saying that Intel locked it and they're trying to basically get a deal

39:02.040 --> 39:03.080
with Intel to let it go.

39:03.080 --> 39:06.560
Come on Intel, you're not in a position of power in the mobile market, you should know

39:06.560 --> 39:08.080
better than that.

39:08.080 --> 39:13.000
Also the cheaper version is $200, 16 gigs internal storage, 2 gigs of RAM.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.480
Yeah, that one by itself is a powerful phone when it's got a price of like one of the mid-range

39:18.480 --> 39:19.480
phones.

39:19.480 --> 39:21.800
Willy, you have bad news on benchmarks though?

39:21.800 --> 39:26.920
I was surprised that hearing, even though it's x86 based, the benchmarks were putting

39:26.920 --> 39:32.920
it at below, in some cases, a Snapdragon 801, which was really surprising given just how

39:32.920 --> 39:34.400
powerful it was supposed to be.

39:34.400 --> 39:39.600
Well, I mean, they've been working on these ARM chips in mobile specifically now for years.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.680
I got a good head start.

39:42.680 --> 39:48.140
Well, it also depends on, with the 4 gigs of RAM, you can make it do a ton of things

39:48.140 --> 39:54.320
that just the RAM is handling and the CPU can do less effort into it.

39:54.320 --> 39:59.880
And it also has the power VR GPU stuff so it can manage it better.

39:59.880 --> 40:04.480
So if they're just focusing just on the CPU, then that's not really the whole package of

40:04.480 --> 40:05.480
a phone anyway.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.480
Yeah.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.880
You know what, if we're going to talk about mobile, this is the perfect opportunity for

40:09.880 --> 40:13.440
me to take a moment here and thank our sponsor Ting.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.440
Go to linux.ting.com and guess what?

40:16.440 --> 40:18.960
We have a great deal until the end of June.

40:18.960 --> 40:26.000
You can get $50 off your first Ting device or a $50 service credit when you go to linux.ting.com.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.760
Now, what is Ting?

40:27.760 --> 40:29.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.880
What's going on here with Ting?

40:30.880 --> 40:31.880
Actually, hold on.

40:31.880 --> 40:32.880
You know who says it better than I do.

40:32.880 --> 40:36.780
I could tell you what's going on with Ting, but with an introduction like that, I'll tell

40:36.780 --> 40:37.780
you.

40:37.780 --> 40:38.780
He says,

40:38.780 --> 40:39.780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:39.780 --> 40:40.780
I'll tell you what's going on with Ting.

40:40.780 --> 40:42.040
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.720
Ting's my mobile service provider.

40:43.720 --> 40:46.940
I like Ting a lot because you only pay for what you use.

40:46.940 --> 40:50.300
That's way better than the duopoly that's out there right now.

40:50.300 --> 40:54.960
When I think about changing the mobile industry and what effect I can take as a customer,

40:54.960 --> 40:55.960
there's not a lot.

40:55.960 --> 40:56.960
I don't have a lot of power.

40:56.960 --> 41:02.540
I have the need to have a phone and I have to use the existing infrastructure and it

41:02.540 --> 41:06.340
needs to snap in with the existing infrastructure as much as possible, as much as I've tried

41:06.340 --> 41:11.240
to work outside that system, maybe using only Wi-Fi or something like that.

41:11.240 --> 41:14.240
No, especially not once a family tries to get ahold of you.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.160
It just doesn't work that well.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.740
This is where Ting worked well for me.

41:17.740 --> 41:21.280
It gives me the control, but it also helps me feel like maybe I'm pushing the market

41:21.280 --> 41:24.840
into a certain direction with my monthly payment because you only pay for what you use.

41:24.840 --> 41:27.360
They just take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes and they add them up at

41:27.360 --> 41:28.720
the end of the month.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.560
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.820
It's just $6 for the line.

41:33.820 --> 41:34.820
That's crazy.

41:34.820 --> 41:35.820
Think about that.

41:35.820 --> 41:40.360
In fact, I think one time, from one of the big two, I think the lowest I heard, I know

41:40.360 --> 41:45.720
I've heard $35 a line before, but I laughed when I heard that.

41:45.720 --> 41:51.360
I think I've even heard as low as $15 a line, and of course, they'll tell you $10 a line,

41:51.360 --> 41:55.140
but then of course, they put the tax on there and they have a couple of administrative fees

41:55.140 --> 41:58.920
and then it really turns out to be like, what, $17 a line?

41:58.920 --> 41:59.920
Ting's $6 a line.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.880
There's going to be taxes on there, but there's no hidden fees.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.280
There's nothing sneaky in there.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.280
If you want to, for example, turn on hotspot until then, you just pay for the data usage.

42:06.280 --> 42:11.720
They have voicemail and caller ID, picture messaging, all the regular stuff you'd expect,

42:11.720 --> 42:14.880
and they have a really fantastic system if you need support.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.480
First of all, they've got no whole customer service.

42:16.480 --> 42:21.920
You call them at 1-855-TING-FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m., and a real human being answers

42:21.920 --> 42:22.920
the phone on a weekday.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.920
That's pretty nice.

42:23.920 --> 42:28.600
They also have one of the best self-help sites out there, not only because they have a community

42:28.600 --> 42:34.020
of rabid enthusiasts that are constantly helping you out and trying new things and pushing

42:34.020 --> 42:39.760
the envelope and pushing Ting, and Ting loves that, but they also have subreddits, and they're

42:39.760 --> 42:41.280
on Twitter, so you can hit them up there.

42:41.280 --> 42:44.560
They have YouTube videos they're pumping out all the time using the Ting experience.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.040
They make the Ting experience even better.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.560
They're giving you great apps constantly.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.960
Kyra just picked up this Turpin or whatever it's called, Turpin Profiler.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.880
I went, okay, I'll check this out.

42:53.880 --> 42:54.880
It's an unbelievable app.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.600
This is an unbelievable app she picks.

42:57.600 --> 43:00.700
These people are truly tuned in, like the people they hire to do their help desk for

43:00.700 --> 43:04.200
when you call in at 1-855-TING-FTW.

43:04.200 --> 43:07.360
They were like, well, how do we make sure that if people call in, the first person they

43:07.360 --> 43:10.800
talk to can solve the problem?

43:10.800 --> 43:12.160
You hire the geek.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.400
So things are going, well, that's what we'll do.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.520
We'll hire the geeks, and that's what they've done, and it's just awesome.

43:16.520 --> 43:21.360
So they have this really great mentality to how they roll out features in their dashboard.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.760
I don't know how much they talk about this.

43:22.760 --> 43:26.240
I don't know how much I'm even allowed to say, but their dashboard's really awesome,

43:26.240 --> 43:30.640
and they treat it like a full forward application development environment.

43:30.640 --> 43:35.300
They have rollouts and phases they go through, internal testing they do, they have betas

43:35.300 --> 43:40.140
they put out, they have feature sets that... recently Ting rolled out GSM service,

43:40.140 --> 43:43.560
so they have CDMA and GSM.

43:43.560 --> 43:46.560
That's something you have to work on over time to integrate that correctly into your

43:46.560 --> 43:49.820
management dashboard, because they've got a really great management dashboard, and it

43:49.820 --> 43:53.360
works across all range of devices, so they're really particular about it.

43:53.360 --> 43:58.600
So their development cycle approach to how they roll out these kinds of features is like,

43:58.600 --> 44:01.880
you'd almost think that was the entire focus of the business, but they just really get

44:01.880 --> 44:05.000
how to deliver this stuff because they're backed by Two Cows, and Two Cows has been

44:05.000 --> 44:07.080
around since the 90s.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.080
They've been through the ups and downs of the internet.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.400
They've done some of the best stuff on the web.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
They also run Hover.

44:11.400 --> 44:15.640
I mean, you guys know Two Cows, and so they've figured out what works and what doesn't work

44:15.640 --> 44:19.920
and how to structure these companies, and that's where Ting came from, and it's just

44:19.920 --> 44:20.920
so perfect.

44:20.920 --> 44:21.920
It's perfect for our audience.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.920
It's perfect for me, and when you go to linux.ting.com, they've got this $50 promo right now, which

44:25.920 --> 44:29.880
is a really great device, which is a really great price, so you can get a great device,

44:29.880 --> 44:35.760
like the Moto G. $91 from Ting Unlocked, and if you get our discount, it's going to be

44:35.760 --> 44:38.560
even cheaper, or here's another great device.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.840
If you have your own device, get a SIM card, or I really, really, really, really like the

44:42.840 --> 44:43.840
Moto X2.

44:43.840 --> 44:48.440
I don't have the Moto X2, but I would seriously recommend the Moto X2.

44:48.440 --> 44:53.200
Also another great device, if you're going to go to linux.ting.com, get the MiFi 5580.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.160
Get your $50 service credit when you get this thing.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.040
You're going to get a $50 service credit.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.600
That's going to pay for that hotspot.

44:59.600 --> 45:03.120
I'll go get the Moto X2 unlocked.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.120
That's just, that's a great device.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.120
That's a great service, too.

45:06.120 --> 45:11.200
Linux.ting.com, and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.840
You guys are rocking it.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.640
Congrats to the rollout to the GSM network.

45:15.640 --> 45:16.640
It's pretty cool.

45:16.640 --> 45:17.640
I'm really happy.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.480
Just a little, a couple of updates from the headlines that didn't make it into the Linux

45:20.480 --> 45:22.120
Action Show this Sunday.

45:22.120 --> 45:28.800
Chrome Stable is, Chrome 43 is bringing better high DPI support to Linux, which is really

45:28.800 --> 45:33.400
nice because I've got my XPS 13 with a high DPI display, and it drives me crazy.

45:33.400 --> 45:39.440
I have every web page zoomed in at 200%, and the UI doubled, and it's still too small.

45:39.440 --> 45:42.800
So high DPI support will be landing via your updates very soon.

45:42.800 --> 45:43.980
Thanks Google.

45:43.980 --> 45:46.520
We appreciate the update.

45:46.520 --> 45:49.600
And then I wanted to talk about some of our favorite terminal applications.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.760
We have just, and then, let's see, do we have any more?

45:51.760 --> 45:52.760
Oh yes.

45:52.760 --> 45:56.120
A couple more things, and then we're going to get to the Meerkat review.

45:56.120 --> 46:01.160
And I wanted to start with a couple of our favorite terminal applications, because Stormson85

46:01.160 --> 46:02.160
wrote in.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.720
He said, so I feel cool using the terminal, and honestly it feels more efficient half

46:05.720 --> 46:07.200
the time to boot.

46:07.200 --> 46:11.400
What are some of your most must have, or maybe most frequently used terminal applications?

46:11.400 --> 46:14.900
I've been trolling through the Arch Wiki's list of terminal apps, and I found that's

46:14.900 --> 46:15.900
a good start.

46:15.900 --> 46:16.900
Hmm, wow.

46:16.900 --> 46:20.000
I have never actually looked, the Arch Wiki has everything.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.760
I've never looked at the Arch Wiki's list of apps for the command line, but they do

46:25.760 --> 46:30.020
have a lot of, a lot of stuff here.

46:30.020 --> 46:33.140
Anybody in the Mamba room have a favorite command line app that you use all the time

46:33.140 --> 46:34.600
that's not Vim?

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
Absolutely.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.600
Okay.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.200
I love HTOP and BMON.

46:39.200 --> 46:40.200
Oh yeah?

46:40.200 --> 46:45.040
They're, install them on every single system, including servers, like anything you can name.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.040
Yeah.

46:46.040 --> 46:48.560
Like HTOP is Process Viewer the way it should be.

46:48.560 --> 46:51.120
And BMON is a bandwidth monitor, right?

46:51.120 --> 46:52.480
Yeah, exactly.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.360
And it has so many beautiful statistics.

46:54.360 --> 46:55.360
Yeah, BMON's great.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.280
I'll just have the tips of your fingers.

46:57.280 --> 47:01.680
They're like, you know, they're there for when something goes wrong and you're thinking,

47:01.680 --> 47:02.680
what's going on?

47:02.680 --> 47:03.680
Something's not right.

47:03.680 --> 47:04.680
You know?

47:04.680 --> 47:05.680
Yeah.

47:05.680 --> 47:11.520
One of my favorites is YouTube Download, YouTube-DL, and you'd think it's just for downloading

47:11.520 --> 47:17.440
YouTube videos based on the name, but it downloads all kinds of videos.

47:17.440 --> 47:21.040
I'm not going to tell you the dirty videos it can download, but it can also download

47:21.040 --> 47:22.040
those.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.840
And it can download like Fox News video clips.

47:23.840 --> 47:28.620
It can download, it has, what it does, it doesn't do everything, but it does a really

47:28.620 --> 47:33.200
good job of you give it a URL, it downloads that webpage, parses the HTML, and tries to

47:33.200 --> 47:36.520
figure out the video embed, and then tries to pull the source video for that.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.140
It's not just YouTube.

47:38.140 --> 47:39.140
It's sweet.

47:39.140 --> 47:41.360
So YouTube-DL, I've made it a pic before.

47:41.360 --> 47:44.220
Oh, and look, you can, there we go.

47:44.220 --> 47:47.920
There is a list of YouTube-DL supported sites, and it's a pretty good list, and a lot of

47:47.920 --> 47:49.440
them are porn.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.200
Anybody else have a, well, it is.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.200
Anybody else have a favorite app?

47:53.200 --> 48:00.720
Well, I'm a full-time tiling window manager user, so I currently have 15 terminals open,

48:00.720 --> 48:04.760
but I'd say my favorite would be CMOS.

48:04.760 --> 48:12.520
Lots of people use NCMP, CPP as their music player, but I really like CMOS as just anything.

48:12.520 --> 48:16.520
Put it there, read a music folder, start playing.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.000
What was the Pandora, was it Pythos?

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Is that the Pandora?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
No, what's the command?

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Pythos, yeah.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah, is that the command line Pandora client?

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
That's a really good one.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.780
Okay, I've got a couple other my favorites, obviously.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.720
Should I even give SSH a mention, or is that too obvious?

48:29.720 --> 48:30.720
I guess I'll do it.

48:30.720 --> 48:34.120
And I'll just do an honorable mention of Vim, Nano, and Emacs.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
I think we all agree.

48:35.120 --> 48:38.800
Piano Bar, that's what it is, Pino Bar, P-I-A-N-O Bar.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.800
That's what it was.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.280
No, no, Pythos is the graphical one.

48:41.280 --> 48:42.280
Yeah.

48:42.280 --> 48:47.120
I can give you an example of one that's not very commonly used, but it is very useful

48:47.120 --> 48:49.120
for when you do need to check.

48:49.120 --> 48:54.720
LSHW gives you a list of all your hardware, and that is so useful when I want to check

48:54.720 --> 48:58.880
to see what CPU and what RAM I have, or when I'm on a new computer and I need to check

48:58.880 --> 48:59.880
that.

48:59.880 --> 49:00.880
Yeah, that's a great one.

49:00.880 --> 49:05.740
I use it quite a bit, especially with different hardware testing, and especially when you

49:05.740 --> 49:08.400
can output it to HTML and just load it up in a browser.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.400
So nice.

49:09.400 --> 49:16.040
Well, thanks to Jupiter Broadcasting, I can't remember when, I now use Inksy a lot as my

49:16.040 --> 49:17.040
status monitor.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.040
Yeah.

49:18.040 --> 49:19.320
It gives you so much info.

49:19.320 --> 49:20.320
Yeah.

49:20.320 --> 49:26.020
I'll give a nod of the hat to Wimpy because, I mean, I knew about DDRescue, in fact, I'd

49:26.020 --> 49:29.440
made it a pick on last, even, but I didn't, I just, for some reason, always just went

49:29.440 --> 49:36.120
to using DD when I would write an ISO image to a thumb drive, but DDRescue is my way more

49:36.120 --> 49:41.680
preferred because you get your transfer rate, and you can tell it's working, it gives you

49:41.680 --> 49:44.600
more information, and I feel like it's faster too.

49:44.600 --> 49:49.800
So DDRescue is, DD, please.

49:49.800 --> 49:54.000
I used DD a long time ago, now I use DDRescue.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Fortune's a good one.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.760
I have another one that's really useful, but you've got to get used to how it works, Diff.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.520
Oh, yeah, sure.

50:03.520 --> 50:07.640
What's different about files is I use it all the time.

50:07.640 --> 50:08.640
Yeah.

50:08.640 --> 50:09.640
What did I say?

50:09.640 --> 50:17.200
Other than HTOP, as I used to use HTOP, but now I use Nmon, short for Nigel's monitor.

50:17.200 --> 50:22.960
It doesn't just monitor your real-time statistics, it has a longer term so you can see more of

50:22.960 --> 50:25.520
like a GUI CPU monitor.

50:25.520 --> 50:31.920
It just tracks it over time so you can see how your CPU usages are kernel or network

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
IO.

50:32.920 --> 50:33.920
That's right.

50:33.920 --> 50:34.920
I'm installing it right now.

50:34.920 --> 50:35.920
It's really nice.

50:35.920 --> 50:40.040
I just installed it right now as you said it, because that's one I've heard of before.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.400
That's what I love about doing this segment with you guys, is you guys will often mention

50:42.400 --> 50:48.360
ones that I know of, but, oh, MPV, yeah, Iamacon is right, MPV is not only like my favorite

50:48.360 --> 50:53.480
way to watch videos, but it is, I think, the absolute best way to watch a live video stream

50:53.480 --> 50:55.400
if possible.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.840
So for example, you take like the Jupiter Broadcasting JBLive stream, you go to jblive.tv

50:59.840 --> 51:05.280
and you right-click on the RTSP stream under the flash player, and once you have MPV installed,

51:05.280 --> 51:10.520
you go into your command line, you type MPV space, you paste in the RTSP stream, and you

51:10.520 --> 51:15.520
will see MPV figures out what the codec is, it sees if there's a delay between the audio

51:15.520 --> 51:19.720
and the video, and if there is a delay, it will sync that and correct that for you, and

51:19.720 --> 51:24.160
it's also aware if your network is being a little sticky and it's dropping packets and

51:24.160 --> 51:28.020
it will start buffering ahead to accommodate for a little bit of network issues.

51:28.020 --> 51:33.520
It is such a great way to watch live video over the internet because it is such an intelligent

51:33.520 --> 51:37.400
player, MPV, so I definitely got to give that a plug if you like to watch our shows and

51:37.400 --> 51:40.400
you don't want to use flash, super great for that.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.960
Second plug, I've mentioned it before, these are if you were a long time listener, you

51:42.960 --> 51:45.640
know these ones, live streamer.

51:45.640 --> 51:51.240
Live streamer is great because, again, I don't like watching live shows in my browser.

51:51.240 --> 51:53.040
I love watching live shows.

51:53.040 --> 51:56.840
I don't like watching it in my browser because my browser is for doing other stuff, I come

51:56.840 --> 52:01.800
from a day when browsers crashed a lot, and so live streamer, what you do is, for example,

52:01.800 --> 52:05.520
you go live streamer and then you put in the URL of the live stream, like a Ustream page

52:05.520 --> 52:11.200
or a Twitch page, and the quality of that stream you want, and what live streamer will

52:11.200 --> 52:18.580
do is it will go grab that flash encapsulated video, bundle it back up, do a local RTSP

52:18.580 --> 52:24.780
stream for you, send it to your media player like VLC, and do a local stream of that flash

52:24.780 --> 52:31.560
player over, in your computer, into your VLC player, bypassing the need for you to have

52:31.560 --> 52:37.120
flash at all, and then sending what was forced and locked into your web browser now into

52:37.120 --> 52:40.840
your VLC player, so that way you can move VLC onto your second monitor and have that

52:40.840 --> 52:42.800
to your web browser like an animal.

52:42.800 --> 52:44.860
So live streamer is awesome.

52:44.860 --> 52:48.000
And Phish is a great shell for doing auto completion.

52:48.000 --> 52:53.240
You can also do MPV, you could throw things like, you could type MPV jblive.fm and it

52:53.240 --> 52:56.040
would just start streaming our audio feed for you.

52:56.040 --> 52:58.000
So yeah, those are great ones.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.380
Those are really good ones.

52:59.380 --> 53:05.360
It's actually got a built in, a lot of people know it has YouTube DL support for MPV, but

53:05.360 --> 53:10.160
they've actually made it a more of a standard feature, so you don't have to put the dash

53:10.160 --> 53:16.800
YT DL, you can just do with a regular MPV command and it'll work.

53:16.800 --> 53:18.980
That's pretty nice.

53:18.980 --> 53:23.880
Does anyone feel like we've forgotten grep?

53:23.880 --> 53:28.400
Yeah I mean there are some go-tos, like do we list all of them like ls and grep and top,

53:28.400 --> 53:30.880
I mean those are good ones too.

53:30.880 --> 53:33.480
Yeah but grep is a good tool to learn.

53:33.480 --> 53:38.240
What about all the great systemd commands?

53:38.240 --> 53:46.080
You know, not to be that guy, but we could go on all freaking day, and I swear to god

53:46.080 --> 53:51.280
I didn't plan it like this, but this would be a great spot to mention Linux Academy because

53:51.280 --> 53:54.960
if you are kind of interested in learning these tools, so this is a little personal

53:54.960 --> 54:00.440
story and this is why I think Linux Academy, even if you're like a long time Linux user,

54:00.440 --> 54:07.240
I had a little humble pie like a few years ago and so go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug

54:07.240 --> 54:10.600
to get our discount and this was the humble pie I experienced.

54:10.600 --> 54:14.440
Now you could have this in your privacy of your own home, I had to have this at a classroom

54:14.440 --> 54:18.600
at a community college, so I go to a community college because you know what work wanted

54:18.600 --> 54:25.720
me to you know keep training up, keep going on and I had no interest in learning anything

54:25.720 --> 54:29.600
about the Windows stuff, so anything Linux I could take I was going to take that over

54:29.600 --> 54:33.160
the Windows stuff and the Microsoft stuff anytime, and they said well okay we'll take

54:33.160 --> 54:41.800
a Linux Plus course, and I rolled my eyes, I said I am your server, I converted this

54:41.800 --> 54:48.040
entire infrastructure from Novell Netware to Windows NT to Linux, I did all of that

54:48.040 --> 54:52.160
myself and you want me to go take a Linux Plus course, please right, I'm starting to

54:52.160 --> 54:58.080
get a little diva, but I went because first of all it was ran by this guy named Grant,

54:58.080 --> 55:01.960
he goes to Linux Fest, I bumped into him every year since I took his class which has been

55:01.960 --> 55:11.160
kind of cool and he's a great guy and I learned that even though I had deployed Linux hundreds

55:11.160 --> 55:16.120
of times, I had converted an entire company over to Linux, I had done massive deployments,

55:16.120 --> 55:22.720
I mean you know hundreds of servers, I still needed some of the basics to be refreshed

55:22.720 --> 55:28.040
because there was ways to do what I was doing better every single day, and it's not that

55:28.040 --> 55:31.920
I was arrogant, it's just that I thought if there was a better way to do it I had to figure

55:31.920 --> 55:37.320
it out by now or I just hadn't thought of it in a certain way, and so when I went and

55:37.320 --> 55:42.000
took that very remedial Linux course, I had a little humble pie to realize you know what,

55:42.000 --> 55:46.560
there is a space for me to always continue my education, and so when Linux Academy came

55:46.560 --> 55:52.200
around I was all about that because I do not want to become stagnant, I also like to re-challenge

55:52.200 --> 55:57.880
myself from time to time, and if you are employed, if you have reviews, if you have clients,

55:57.880 --> 56:02.920
things like that, these kinds of progress are really nice, and so one of the things

56:02.920 --> 56:07.440
I've really appreciated about Linux Academy since I've signed up is it's created by people

56:07.440 --> 56:11.820
that truly love Linux, they're truly passionate about Linux, and they get the challenges you're

56:11.820 --> 56:14.960
going to face when you have to go administer Linux, and so that's for example one of the

56:14.960 --> 56:18.880
reasons I've rolled out this new feature called Nuggets, they're just like single how-tos

56:18.880 --> 56:22.460
which are a perfect example of what I'm talking about, like you want to know how to just fully

56:22.460 --> 56:26.260
exploit rsync, you really want to know how to just get the most out of top, I mean like

56:26.260 --> 56:29.440
just these commands that if you knew a little bit better you might get more insights out

56:29.440 --> 56:33.920
of your computer or maybe you have better file transfers or better data integrity, so

56:33.920 --> 56:36.960
they created these nuggets, they're like anywhere between 2 and 60 minutes long and they just

56:36.960 --> 56:40.880
deep dive into one specific thing and make you better at using that thing, or of course

56:40.880 --> 56:44.840
they have entire scenario-based trainings where you're going to go deploy a server from

56:44.840 --> 56:49.320
beginning to end where it's got the entire LAM stack and maybe you're caching files up

56:49.320 --> 56:53.320
on Amazon and all of it, right, and they'll give you SSH access to it and they'll spin

56:53.320 --> 56:57.000
up the lab and you'll have 7 plus distributions you get to choose from, and whatever distro

56:57.000 --> 57:02.200
you choose, the courseware adjusts to that and the virtual machines adjust to that. This

57:02.200 --> 57:04.720
is such a neat system because they're not focused on trying to teach you how to use

57:04.720 --> 57:10.740
Adobe After Effects or how to manage Autodesk workstations or anything like that, or fix

57:10.740 --> 57:14.860
the sync, no it's all of this stuff in Linux and open source and they're following it so

57:14.860 --> 57:17.680
closely because they're passionate about it, so they're making sure their stuff is always

57:17.680 --> 57:21.560
current, they're rolling out new things all the time and that's why they're also investing

57:21.560 --> 57:25.840
in open source projects, they have a $5,000 grant program that you can find out more about.

57:25.840 --> 57:31.920
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our 33% discount, 33% and it's a really

57:31.920 --> 57:40.040
great resource, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and I give them a hearty recommendation from

57:40.040 --> 57:44.480
a hard learned lesson, you don't have to learn it the way I did. Yeah, you can do one more

57:44.480 --> 57:52.400
CLI app if you'd like, KDG, go ahead. Have at it. I don't, but are you muted? No, I don't

57:52.400 --> 57:56.440
hear you. Well, you can always leave in the comments too. Oh, go ahead. No, I hear you.

57:56.440 --> 57:57.440
Go ahead.

57:57.440 --> 57:58.440
SSH.

57:58.440 --> 58:04.720
We did SSH, but yes, SSH and not just SSH, but I think what deserves an honorable mention

58:04.720 --> 58:13.840
is like SFTP and X1140 using SSH, like SSH itself is like an umbrella for a lot of cool

58:13.840 --> 58:19.960
stuff, so yeah. Do they do an audio course? That's a good question, Dan. That's a really

58:19.960 --> 58:28.160
good question. Screen and Tmux, another, screen is vital. For example, right now, I'm using

58:28.160 --> 58:31.840
screen because I have a Minecraft server running up on a digital ocean droplet and I just,

58:31.840 --> 58:36.880
I have screen running all the time. RSync over SSH. MOSH, MOSH if you are connecting

58:36.880 --> 58:40.400
to a machine remotely and it's a little sticky, the connection isn't very fast, maybe your

58:40.400 --> 58:44.840
keys aren't repeating fast enough, MOSH rides on top of SSH but gives you things like local

58:44.840 --> 58:49.380
echo so that way when you type you see it immediately, it handles disconnects better

58:49.380 --> 58:54.880
so if you're on spotty Wi-Fi or you're using like a Mi-Fi hotspot and the connection is

58:54.880 --> 58:58.400
coming in and out because you're on the road, MOSH is going to handle those or here's another

58:58.400 --> 59:02.960
example. If you just have a laptop that you bring to work and you SSH into a machine and

59:02.960 --> 59:06.000
you put it to sleep and you go somewhere else and you want to be able to open up your machine

59:06.000 --> 59:11.360
and you can still get to that same host, MOSH will reconnect. So MOSH is really great. Apt

59:11.360 --> 59:18.400
Git. All right, Rotten Corpse, you'll have our last word and then we'll move on.

59:18.400 --> 59:25.400
Well in referencing to the emulation episode of last, this past Sunday, one of the great

59:25.400 --> 59:33.080
command line program that gives you a lot of good Nintendo 64 gaming, Mupen 64 Plus.

59:33.080 --> 59:40.460
Yeah, that was Colonel Linux's favorite. Mupen 64 Plus is awesome, so is SNX. All right,

59:40.460 --> 59:44.320
so coming up really soon and I'm surprised we haven't talked about it more is Southeast

59:44.320 --> 59:50.080
Linux Fest. And ironically, it's just in time for the new 2015 Southeast Linux Fest that

59:50.080 --> 59:56.240
the crew actually got 2014's videos posted. And our very own producer, Mr. Q5 Sys, his

59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.200
talk is up about Puppy Linux and deconstruction. I'm just going to play, I'll just play a little

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.340
bit for those of you who are not familiar with Puppy. This is kind of a good introduction

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.240
to it right here.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.800
Puppy was designed to be very friendly. You have an old system or someone has an old system

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.360
and they just want to get online, you plug it in, you get online, you can browse the

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:17.480
web, you can send emails. It's meant to be very, very simple to use. Now if you want

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:22.000
to get in and dig into it, you're going to need some skill levels above just a random

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.800
user because of how everything is actually done. But for just standard user computer

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.200
actions, we want it to be as easy as possible. Like I said, it will run extraordinarily fast.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.120
The primary reason for this is because it runs from RAM. We'll touch on that in just

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.120
a moment.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.120
Nice.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.420
It will have all the applications needed for daily use. These are the typical things like

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:47.680
a document writer, a spreadsheet, so you can send emails, you can play music, you can watch

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.460
movies. The versions of the programs that we use and the actual versions of programs

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:57.840
that we use are sometimes not the ones you're familiar with. The reason we've chosen those

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:02.440
is because we're looking to keep the size as minimal as possible. Right now, the latest

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:07.720
official release of Puppy, the entire OS, GUI, and all applications is about 140 megabytes.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:12.800
Wow. So the whole video is up. It's about 54 minutes long and it just went up and we'll

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.280
have a link in the show notes. And if you'd like to meet Mr. Q5SIS or Colonel Linux or

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:21.280
Rotten, are you going to go to self?

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.640
I'm planning on it, but I haven't. It's not confirmed yet.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.800
So I'll get to that in a second. But so Southeast Linux Fest, I'm told by the crew, one of the

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:35.120
great Linux Fest put on every single year is going on June 12th to the 14th, 2015 at

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:45.680
the Sheraton at the Charlotte Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. Okay, you got that? It's June

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.200
12th to the 14th at the Sheraton Charlotte Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. It makes

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.680
it really easy. And actually, to make it even easier for you guys, I set up a meetup at

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:01.880
meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting with all of the address and the bits of information

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.240
you need to know, including they have limited hotel rooms still available as part of the

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:11.400
self block. And if you get that, that means you're going to get a free shuttle to and

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.080
from the international airport and you're going to get the special $99 room rate and

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:20.080
you'll also get free internet in the room. So you need to book if you haven't booked

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:24.480
yet for Southeast Linux Fest because they've reopened just a few more rooms on the block.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.120
They'd sold out and they got a few more. We set up the meetup. You can go to meetup.com

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.120
slash Jupiter Broadcasting. You'll find it there. I also have it linked directly in the

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.760
show notes. If you'd like to meetup with the crew, they're going to be down there. Unfortunately,

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:43.960
I had intended to go, but we sort of overextended ourselves to make Linux Fest Northwest possible.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.640
And so I just, I can't afford to send myself to Linux Fest, I mean to Southeast Linux

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.080
Fest. I'm major bummed because it's one that I've been wanting to go to for a couple of

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:58.800
years. But we'll have the guys there and they'll be doing live coverage and I'll be in studio,

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:06.080
I suppose. And so I will still have great coverage. I am a little bummed because I really

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.040
wanted to go, but it doesn't affect our coverage of the event. And you can still meetup with

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:15.960
perhaps producer Rotten Corps. Kernel Linux and Q5Sys are going for sure. And it should

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.480
be, I'm told, one of the best events of the year. And it's really pretty convenient if

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.840
you get on that block because you fly in there, they shuttle you right to the fest. It's pretty

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:29.720
straightforward and you can sleep. And the fest is at the hotel, so you don't have to

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.400
travel. And then the guys just go out and get food and stuff. And there's some great

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.360
places to eat nearby. So gosh, it should be a heck of a time. It makes me, man, I, oh.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.880
So I think next year we sort of, we sort of assessed how we'll do Linux Fest so that we

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.680
can afford to do some of these other things. We have other events coming up too. That's

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:51.280
the other reason is because OSCON is just around the corner and I'm going to that very

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.360
soon. So there's a couple other events that, it's just all, they all back up really close

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.440
to each other. I would love to go to CELF, so hopefully we'll be able to pace ourselves

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:03.160
for Linux Fest Northwest next year. And then, and then I can go to CELF. Kind of a hard

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:10.040
lesson to learn, but now we know. BSDCAN was also, I was hoping to go to BSDCAN, but my

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.320
passport still hasn't come through at this point and it's getting too close. So yeah.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.940
But you guys can still go and then tell me all about it. Make me super jelly. And go

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:24.320
to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to get more on that. And Rotten Corps, I hope

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:30.680
you can make it. That'd be really cool. Cause I, I'm told it's a crazy party.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:36.240
The thing that annoyed me is that the, before I even knew it existed, they had went to Atlanta

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.640
and then the year after that they started going to Charlotte just consistently. So the

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.360
one that was actually close to me was the one that didn't know what happened.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:50.480
That'd have been nice, huh? Go figure. Well, that's how it goes. I, I, I, I've always been

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.440
tempted to go, but it wasn't until the guys had gone for a couple of years and were like,

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:59.560
yeah, we've, so it's one thing like you hear, you hear a good party, but then you go to

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.840
all of them and then you really get an idea of which ones are the good parties. And the

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:08.200
guys that go to all of them say, this is one of the best parties out there. So that's pretty

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200
cool.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.320
All right. We're going to get into the Meerkat review. System76 is not a sponsor of Linux

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:19.400
Unplugged and I, I wouldn't, I could, I would still do the review in the Linux action show,

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:24.560
but we actually have two weeks booked solid on Linux action show of really great guests.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:28.040
And so it doesn't really quite fit into our schedule. And I've been using the Meerkat

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:34.720
on and off in production. So I, my, my experiences are fresh right now. System76 has released

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:40.100
this ultra compact, it's a I five or I three based rig. You can put up to 2.5 terabytes

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.440
of disc in it cause it can actually fit two discs in this tiny little thing. It's smaller

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.800
than a Mac mini. It's based, I think on the NUC platform is, is, is essentially what the

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.000
original platform is based on. And then System76 has done design work and firmware work and

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.920
drivers work to sort of differentiate it from the rest of the market. I'll get to that here

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:01.560
in a moment, but to give you a general sense in production, we've used this up at Linux

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:06.720
Fest Northwest to drive a couple of displays and do our 24 seven playback that we had while

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:12.000
we had the booth assembled. And then now today it's actually in studio driving all of our

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.160
remote audio. And I'm going to get into more of that in a moment, give you my experiences

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:23.920
with the NUC platform and specifically with the System76 Meerkat. And I, in fact, something

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:27.660
I don't normally talk about in these reviews, but I want to in this review is the complete

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:32.640
out of box experience because System76 has done something unique with the Meerkat that

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.080
I've never seen them do with their previous products. So I think it deserves, it deserves

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.280
a mention. So before we get to that, I'll give our last sponsor this week a mention

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.460
because these guys are making my life so much easier and they can make your lives a lot

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.200
better too in a lot of different ways. It's DigitalOcean and DigitalOcean is a simple

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:53.000
cloud hosting provider that's dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.560
you to spin up your own cloud server. And that sounds like some mumbo jumbo. I'll grant

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.680
you that. In fact, it took me about three years to even be able to cope with the word

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:08.840
cloud and not shudder. I'm there now. Thankfully, it took some counseling. But the reason why

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:15.920
I get through that line is it's so accurate. It's exactly what you get. You get a badass,

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:22.660
super fast Linux computer up on a server that has been built by experts to be as fast as

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:28.440
possible and easy to manage and easy to deploy applications on as you could possibly conceive.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:34.540
And I guess I could say that every time, but that's a little more clunky than they are

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.100
a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:41.720
to spin up a cloud server. Legitimately, that's DigitalOcean. And if that for you means your

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:46.200
entire backend infrastructure, they can do that. If that for you means you need to rent

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.320
a server for two hours while you test something, they can do that. You can deploy everything

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.720
on their rigs with their SSD-based technology. It doesn't matter which package you pick,

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:00.640
it's all SSDs top to bottom, every single machine. That means you're going to get super

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.220
great IO. You're not going to need a big old disk array that's like fiber-attached or SCSI-attached

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:11.600
or whatever, iSCSI, so much nicer with SSDs today. And this is where DigitalOcean sort

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:19.500
of stacked the deck. I would say when they started out, betting on KVM was kind of risky,

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:24.000
but pretty obvious it was trending that way if you really followed the market. And DigitalOcean

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.920
does. I mean, the people that work for D.O. are like the top of the field. That probably

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:33.920
to them wasn't a big revelation. KVM is going to be a fantastic virtualizer. I mean, granted,

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:38.360
this is a while ago, right? So yeah, okay, they made that bet. Linux, again, kind of

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:43.740
the same thing. Bit of a bet back then for infrastructure on a cloud device, but kind

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:46.880
of seemed like where the market was going pretty clear by that point. It was going to

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.680
be Linux. KVM, not so clear. Maybe Zen, right? Could have been Zen, could have been QMU,

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.280
could have been something else. But Linux, that seemed pretty obvious. I think where

01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:02.460
they actually went out on a limb pretty big was SSDs. Because SSDs, the jury has still

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:07.260
only recently gotten in on that. That was a huge cost outlay for them. That was a huge

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:12.400
cost outlay for them to also then try to make the service so freaking valuable in cost.

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:16.380
And because they decided we need Linux, we need tier one bandwidth, we need the best

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:22.400
disk IO possible. When they stacked the deck that way, then all they had to do was seal

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.520
the deal. So that's what they did. You can get started in less than 55 seconds. And pricing

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.560
plans started only $5 a month. That seals the deal right there. For $5 a month, you're

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:37.600
going to get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.720
It's dedicated to you. You get a terabyte of transfer. I love that. I love that because

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:47.100
I pay for transfer. So when I'm setting up a digital ocean droplet, and I have one that

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.600
has Minecraft on there, and I think I get like four terabytes of transfer or something

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.420
like that, I'm like, okay, fine. Yeah, have at it. Let me just throw the transmission

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:59.520
web UI on there too. And they got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.080
Amsterdam, London, and a brand new Spankin data center in Germany that's connected right

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.520
on the internet exchange over there. So all Germany's neighbors get unparalleled access.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.040
I mean, you're going to look like a boss when you spin up a droplet over there. But that

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.840
interface is so slick. I mean, it's very intuitive. So you're going to be able to do a lot of

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.920
things that normally you would have thought to manage on a virtual server would have required

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.560
a degree. And it's so, so nice because you can also replicate all that functionality

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:25.700
with their straightforward API. And you can integrate that in with your applications,

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:29.620
your management infrastructure, you can take advantage of all of the great applications.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:34.040
When you go to digital ocean, check out some of their community apps. There's a lot of

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.760
good stuff. And remember, you can try all this out two months for free when you use

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.360
our promo code Do Unplugged. Do Unplugged will get you a $10 credit. Try out the $5

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.280
rig for free. And digital ocean is hiring too. They need writers. They're looking for

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:51.280
people to submit articles for their tutorial section. They're opening that back up again.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.720
Go over to digital ocean and check out their career section. They're specifically looking

01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:02.260
for Linux sysadmins. They're a growing company. They need tutorials. They need copyright editors.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:06.720
They need Linux sysadmins. They specifically told me to tell you guys that because they

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.600
know you guys are the super savvy audience that they want to hire. And they get this

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.480
stuff. They've asked me to tell you that because they want to hire you guys specifically, and

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:20.000
gals, because they know that Jupiter Broadcasting has one of the best audiences out there. So

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.720
go over there. Try out digital ocean for a little while. If you need a gig, look them

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:28.240
up. They got positions open. They specifically wanted me to mention the content editing position

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.480
and the Linux staff positions. When they opened up those positions before, they were filled

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.340
by JB community members. I think they can be done again. So go over to digital ocean.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:41.640
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED. That supports this show, but also gives you that $10 credit.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.740
You can try out the $5 rig two months for free. And if you're looking for a job and

01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:49.320
you're in the area, check out their careers page too. And if you can write some tutorials,

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:54.100
you might be able to make some money. They are really serious about having the best tutorials

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.000
on the web. And so if you're a really good writer, you might want to contact them and

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.040
work with them. There's a lot of great opportunity over there. They have great tutorials too.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.920
And they put those content editors on there. DigitalOcean.com, DOUNPLUGGED. Check them

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.000
out. They're a really great service.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.540
Okay. So back to the Meerkat. So you guys are talking to me right now on the Meerkat.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:17.720
And that's not too shocking, I suppose. But the question I really had is could a system

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:24.380
this small, could it do something very intensive? And I'll tell you what I've ran into from

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:29.140
a performance standpoint is it's going to depend if you get the i3 or i5. But we've

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:37.200
been able to do 720p live video streamed on it without any issues. It has the Intel Iris

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:43.680
graphics in there. And so you get essentially, we're pushing a 1080p resolution mirrored,

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:49.760
a mirrored 1080p resolution. And we're able to get full 30 frames to 60 frames per second

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.700
on our HD video calls. The system doesn't get hot. It doesn't kick up a fan noise. It

01:12:54.700 --> 01:13:04.620
does have a fan, but it's pretty quiet. It's not audible by our microphones in the studio.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:11.760
So what really sort of struck me about the Meerkat machine itself is while it's both

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:19.640
extremely capable, it's also very, very limited. So I feel like I can say right off the top

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:26.560
of this review, I can recommend this machine. If gaming isn't a huge component of what you

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:30.960
do, like you can do some gaming, like race the sun and things like that, but you're not

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:37.740
going to get much beyond that. That said, that's a lot of you because what you do get

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:44.040
is you get an i5 processor. You can put up to 16 gigabytes of RAM, which is pretty competitive.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:52.500
But what really does it for me is that you can have two disks in this tiny freaking computer.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:59.560
You can have the standard M SATA, and then it can also fit a 2.5 inch on the bottom drive.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.600
I think it's a 2.5. I actually didn't double check it. And you can mount it right on the

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:11.960
back of your monitor. It's got gigabit ethernet. It's got four USB 3.0 ports. It's display

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:19.940
port out and HDMI. And it has a combo audio jack. And it's got the Intel 5500 by the way.

01:14:19.940 --> 01:14:26.080
So that's not, that's no slouch. Two disks in this tiny little nearly silent Linux workstation

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.140
that can drive two monitors. If you have display port and mini HDMI, if you have monitors that

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:37.520
can take that and you can get cables that both of those go to display port, this tiny

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:43.080
little machine can drive two displays and it is wicked fast because all of the storage

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:51.020
is SSD based. So it's, it's, it's a pretty compelling, the price is a little more than

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:56.200
if you were to build it yourself. But if you bought like crucial RAM and you bought Samsung

01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:02.280
SSDs, like you got all good parts and then you also provided a warranty to yourself.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:07.640
I don't think, I think it's kind of a wash on the, on the, on the price, but as far as

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:14.120
performance goes, it, it's, it's, I, it's really hard to describe how impressively fast

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:20.520
this thing is. It is deceivingly fast. If, if you make a few tweaks to the gnome environment

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:26.320
to work better with the Intel graphics, it's breathtaking how, how, how, and it's just

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.080
like, I like it boots in about four seconds and I'm not exaggerating at all. Applications

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:38.680
open instantly. There's no waiting. Now I, more of my performance review is based on

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:43.640
my experience under Arch than it is under Ubuntu. And I did have a couple of problems

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:48.320
where it, one time when I powered it up, it said it couldn't find a boot device, but I,

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.920
I'm not actually sure what all was involved there because Ricoh was able to fix that in

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:58.320
about 30 seconds. And one of the things that he kind of clued me into is if you have a

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:02.880
Linux rig that you're setting up that has UEFI, he recommends, and I've been reading

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:08.480
about a software package you guys are probably familiar with in the mumble room called Gummyboot,

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:15.040
which is really just a simple UEFI boot manager that you use instead of grub. And so we're

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:24.040
using, we're using this Meerkat with Gummyboot and Antigros. And we, it shipped with Ubuntu

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:30.240
and that worked fine. But truth be told, that installation needed to be rebuilt because

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.840
we let a BSD user manage it. I'm not going to go into more details than that. But anyways,

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:41.720
so I needed to reload it and, and it's been great. I read reviews online. People say they

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:45.800
can use Windows 10 with it as well. I have not tried Windows 10. And if you're watching

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:49.960
the video version right now, I'm showing you a picture of what the insides look like. It's

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:56.920
surprisingly serviceable. The lid comes off and you've got three slots for RAM. You've

01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:01.640
got the slot for the, for the storage. And then the machine flips over and there's a

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.960
bunch of stuff on the bottom you can change out. Like the drive, like the second drive

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.480
and things like that. It's a pretty neat little rig. Does anybody in my world, do you guys

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:18.000
have any questions about the system 76 Meerkat? Other than the price. Yeah. So the price,

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:23.120
like I was just like, let's take a look at it here. So let's design and buy a system

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:29.400
76 Meerkat. And I would go with a 2.7 gigahertz processor. I would go a 16 gigabytes of RAM.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:34.120
I would go with a 250 gigabyte solid state drive. And then I like the option. See, one

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.520
of the things that I'll let you do here is you can go for your second drive. You just

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:44.080
want storage. You could go with a spinning drive, but I kind of, I don't know. I guess

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.720
if we're trying to work on price, maybe I won't pick, I won't pick a second drive, but

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:51.400
I like the option. I mean, to me that's makes this thing really nice, really compelling.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:55.000
I won't do a monitor or speakers. And I already have a keyboard and mouse and I can stick

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.320
with the year warranty. Now they're going to give you a lifetime support of the Ubuntu

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:05.320
installation. So that's not bad. And that's $878. And if you were to, and I did this kind

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:11.120
of earlier, if I did that same rig on Amazon, I think it comes out to be $140 cheaper or

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:22.120
$180 cheaper depending on which RAM and a CPU I get. It really is $180. Really? That's

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:28.160
not worth it to me because if I order this and again, this is not a sponsored segment.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.320
They do not, they're not paying me to say this at all. In fact, if anything they probably

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.900
would, they would probably prefer I say this and last because it has a larger audience.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:42.160
But truth be told, I think the value here is you spend a what, $150, $180, even if it

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:50.520
was $200 really, they preassemble it, they warranty it and they ship it to you. That's

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:56.720
just those things right there. And we have, now we've built two NUCs in studio and one

01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:04.200
NUC that first installation didn't go so well. That first NUC, if you just get any of the,

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.640
like you get the wrong RAM voltage or wrong timing and like it just, it doesn't work.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.280
And so it's kind of a bummer because we got the first NUC. I think the RAM, the voltage

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.640
of the RAM was off by just a tiny amount. I can't even remember what it was. It was

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.320
a package too. It was a package I bought off Amazon and they shipped it with the wrong

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.800
RAM and I got burned and we built the whole system. We got all set up, ready to go, hit

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:26.640
the button, nothing happens. And it's a major letdown because now you wait another three

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:32.080
days while you go realize, oh, I bought the wrong RAM. I get the right RAM shipped and

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:36.520
I send back the old RAM. And then, you know, and when you're sitting here in a business

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.840
and you want to get a machine in place because you need to replace something, that three

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:46.720
day delay was a major pain in the butt. For some of us, it'd be worth 180 bucks to have

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:54.840
somebody assemble it, test it, support it and ship it. Especially for a business. Rekai

01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:00.680
says, by the way, it was 1.5 volt voltage RAM instead of 1.65 or the other way around.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:07.320
And I find it to be, I find it to be, on paper, an interesting device. I find it, once I actually

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.600
have it in hand, to be a compelling device. I think the size is a big part of that. Corky,

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.600
what do you think?

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:21.080
Well, I think the size is a massive part. There are so many use cases that don't need

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:28.440
a massive graphics capability. And if you start deploying these in bulk, it could make

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:36.200
a massive difference, well, for Linux. Because when you take these kind of devices and you

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:42.880
deploy them as thin clients or dev machines or something, and they run Linux perfectly

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:50.920
because of open source graphics drivers, solid build qualities, they're a real showcase for

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.920
Linux's power.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:56.160
Yeah, and they're very, it's sort of, it's been one of those things where I showed some

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:59.800
people at the Linux Fest, and they're like, that's the whole computer. That was their

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.880
reaction. Like, that's the computer? That's not the power supply? No, that's the whole

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:12.520
computer. And I, so, and I've been told they run Windows really well. I can confirm they

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:21.120
do run Mac OS very well. And that's the beautiful thing about this, is it's all Intel parts.

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:27.960
And so if your operating system supports Intel wireless or Intel NUC, or I mean, Intel NICs,

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:34.320
Intel processors, Intel chipsets, if you know, if your operating system supports that, it's

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:44.160
going to work. And so that's Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. And in the case of Linux, it means

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.640
everything is supported by the kernel, out of the box. HDMI mirroring, audio out of the

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:56.320
HDMI port, all of it. Every distribution, every single distribution that ships with

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:05.200
like a Linux kernel 3.3 or newer works out of the box. And so that to me makes this machine

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.320
the perfect Linux workstation for a distro hopper.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:17.840
Well, that's just it. It's what it does. It has very few compromises, very few things

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:24.960
that you could switch out or make better, which will probably be improved in time. It

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:35.840
may end up with the same user base as ThinkPads, people who want things that do it perfectly.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:36.840
That's interesting, yeah.

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:43.000
But for a limited set of users. And for Linux, that's meant that ThinkPads are amazing for

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:49.200
Linux support because they've got that crowd of people who think they're perfect machines.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:55.200
And you know, you look at the trajectory and the slow but steady improvement of the Intel

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:06.360
graphics. I could see maybe a year or two from now where the NUC type hardware is very

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:13.280
capable for gaming. Of course, standalone graphics isn't going to stand still either.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.040
But yeah, I agree. It's not only very capable if you have, I think it's capable if you have

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:24.240
moderate graphics usage. And that's with like heavy workloads too. Like I'm telling you,

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:28.680
like we've thrown some serious CPU work at it. It's not an i7. You know, so you have

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.920
to come in, you have to come at, I came at it, maybe I came at it with an abundance of

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:39.080
caution thinking maybe I set my expectations too low thinking you couldn't, you just can't

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:46.080
have a powerful workstation in a computer this small. But after a couple of hours of

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:53.580
tweaking the Intel driver and after a couple of hours of just setting up the software,

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.760
I could already tell it was a great system. And so we've been using it now for two, three

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:01.560
weeks and I mean, it's just like, okay, let's stick it over here and do this for a little

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:06.160
bit. Stick it over here and do this for a little bit. And then this morning when I had

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:13.360
to replace the machine running mumble because the Ubuntu updates had just destroyed that,

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.500
we just put it in, we just put this machine right in its place and it's just taken right

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:20.560
over the role and it's working really well. And it's, it makes it very, very nice to say,

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:24.760
you know, this is a really easy installation. And if somebody were to come to me today and

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.800
say, Hey, I'd like to buy a Linux rig. I feel like this is one I could recommend to them

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.520
and know that even if they ended up having to reload it themselves, they're not going

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:38.640
to run into problems. And then like the nice thing about the Meerkat is where there are

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.360
rough edges, System76 kind of rubbed those down nice to a little smooth round edge and

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.200
they're not that sharp. And I mean, I think you get most the way there if you built the

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:53.240
NUC yourself and then they've come in with the Meerkat and sort of finished it off. And

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.600
so for me, I'd say, I'm just going to, like, if I need a device like this, I'm just going

01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.720
to buy a Meerkat now. Maybe you can make your own decision. And if, but, and for people

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.880
that I recommend, people that I think want a new computer, this is the machine I'm going

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:09.280
to tell them to buy. If I say, do you play games? And they say, no, this is the machine

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:14.860
I'm going to tell them to buy. It's because it starts at $499, first of all, and not everybody

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.440
needs an i5 with 16 gigs of RAM. Some people are going to be fine with an i3 and eight

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.400
gigs of RAM or whatever. And, and so for them, you know, they can get at a lower price point.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.160
I'm just because of me, I, I, well, I'm going to use it in production so that I can have

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:32.920
an i5, I got to have 16 gigs, you know, blah, blah, blah. But $499 is actually the starting

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.280
price for this thing. That's not so bad. I think, I think they've, I, the only criticism

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:47.560
I would give System76 for this is they should have done it sooner. And, and also there are

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:51.980
packages out there by folks like Gigabyte that have an i7, but I've read those have

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.240
heating issues. So I think it's nice that I stick them closer to the main line. And

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.960
I know why they didn't do it sooner. I know that it wasn't, they didn't feel like it was

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:03.880
ready to ship sooner. I just, I wish I didn't have to buy, I bought two other Intel NUCs

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:07.500
and I would rather buy the System76 Meerkats because it's a more complete package. It feels

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.520
like a product, whereas the NUC kind of feels like a spec car that I'm putting together

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:16.380
that works out pretty good, but it definitely feels like a spec car and it feels like it

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:20.680
has rough edges that I just, that a shipped product doesn't have. And then the other nice

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:26.120
thing about the Meerkat is it ships in some super badass packaging. System76 has a really

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.880
great box that they put it in with some great designs in it and they ship it with a better

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:36.520
power adapter than the, than the regular kit. So that's nice too. So they've taken, they've,

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:41.220
they've improved that area as well. So it's a great rig if you need like a development

01:26:41.220 --> 01:26:45.960
machine or if you need something to do web browsing or mail or you need an office system.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:51.040
And what I really like about it for the office environment is it, you, it comes with the

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.600
visa plates. You can just mount it to the back of a monitor. It comes with the plate,

01:26:54.600 --> 01:27:01.240
at least my demo model did. I think they all do. So that's really cool too. That's, I really

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:07.520
like that. Anyways, any other questions about the, the NUC or the Meerkat in general or

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:12.400
the performance or any of that stuff? It's been interesting to compare the Meerkat to

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:18.600
the straight line NUC side by side. And, and I, cause I was pretty skeptical. What's the

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.080
difference really? And I'd say there's enough of a difference and just the convenience and

01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:26.960
the support that I think they have something here. And then especially when they're selling

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.400
directly to consumers.

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:31.400
How well does that perform with KDE?

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.600
Oh, that's a good question. I don't have a lot of experience, but I have similar experience

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.760
under like a similar CPU and video card. And it, you know, it's fantastic. It's the, the,

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:50.400
the Iris 5,500. You can play Borderlands 2, the pre-sequel using that graphics card. Like

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.760
it is a fully capable. Now I don't, I'm not saying it's going to be high settings. It's

01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:00.880
going to be like 30 frames a second. Well, there are 40 frames a second, but you can

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.960
fricking play borderlands, the pre-sequel on the Iris graphics. The only time I have

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:14.840
a massive, I have a massive laptop that has like quad core I five and like eight gigs

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.240
of Ram. It can't play borderlands 2.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:21.360
And you know, the only thing is, is the Iris graphics is not up to the task of high DPI.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.040
That's where it falls down. So of course that's what the XPS has in it. But if you hook this

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.040
up to a 1080p display or even like a 2k display, it's going to be fine. It's going to do just

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:32.920
fine and it's going to look really good. That's a good question. And I'll do some more gaming

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:37.560
tests on it now that we have it hooked up here in the studio. Cause I have not thrown

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.760
like a, one of the ones I get, one of the ones I never get from the, you know, I get

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:46.960
different, when I do hardware and distro reviews, I get one set of questions from the live audience,

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:49.640
totally different set of questions from the download audience. And the download audience

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.840
often wants to know about Dota 2. They often want to know how Dota 2 runs. And I don't

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:59.200
think any of you guys have ever once asked me how Dota 2 runs, but they, so that's something

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.560
I'll try. I'll try Dota 2. I'll try some games. I'll do that and then I'll report back, but

01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:08.120
we just, we just reloaded it. So I got to get steam installed and get the multi-lib

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:14.480
and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, the Meerkat from system 76, I give it a thumbs up and

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:19.400
I wonder if they'll let me hang on to it for a little while. And if you're going to do,

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.720
if you're going to do your own like arch load or you're going to, I mean, it comes with

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:29.600
Ubuntu and it really, you know, that's a nice package. Their Ubuntu installation is pre-set

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.880
up with their system 76 software packages. So you can go get latest updates from the

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:39.400
system 76 repo and it's ready to go out of the box. If you want to put another distro

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:44.620
on there, it looks like gummy boot is a good way to go. If you want to keep UEFI or maybe

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:49.160
if you have your own UEFI rig at home, gummy boot is worth checking out. It made the installation

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.320
process a little bit smoother and it's also the way arch is pushing for those of you that

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:58.140
are arch users. And I'll also have linked in the show notes a write-up that beta news

01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:04.520
did where they reviewed the Meerkat and they liked it as well. And he did a tear down a

01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:09.380
little bit of the internals, which is pretty cool. I thought that was a good one. All right,

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:12.580
one last plug before we run, don't forget about that meetup, meetup.com slash Jupiter

01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:19.800
Broadcasting. If you're going to be at self, we'd like to see that. And don't use the hashtag

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:26.000
self. That's something else completely, which you will find out the hard way if you use

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.360
that. And then last but not least, send in your runs Linux picks. Go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:33.920
slash contact and choose Linux action show from the dropdown and send in your runs Linux

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:38.460
like pictures of your setup or a video of a cool thing or whatever. We love doing the

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:45.560
runs Linux picks from the audience. And last but also not least, jblive.tv to tune into

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:49.720

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.880
hang out in the Mamba room, you get to interact with us live and give us a hard time. If we

01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:01.640
do something stupid right here, you can call us out on it. But also we have pre and post

show where we like to hang out and chat with you guys. And then you can also always engage.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:10.000
Oh, hi there. Hi. That just came in right in there at linuxactionshow.reddit.com. Send

the subreddit and then that helps make a better show. And we'll follow up with that. And I'll

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.600
also try to follow up on the Meerkat gaming stuff like, and if you have any questions

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.160
about that linuxactionshow.reddit.com in the Linux Unplugged feedback thread, put your

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:31.040
Meerkat questions in there and I'll try to collect some of those and do a follow ups

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.160
in that next week's episode of Linux Unplugged. All right, everybody. Well, thank you so much
