00:00.000 --> 00:02.360
It is our last episode for a bit from the studio,

00:02.360 --> 00:04.040
for a long bit, actually.

00:04.040 --> 00:05.120
I wonder how that's going to be.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.280
And it's kind of perfect because Brent's here.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.040
Hello, Brent.

00:08.040 --> 00:08.920
Well, hi.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.480
And he made us brunch.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.520
He sure did.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.280
Oops.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.240
It was great.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.480
We had, what is it, like an egg?

00:14.480 --> 00:15.280
Is it a frittata?

00:15.280 --> 00:16.040
Is that what it's called?

00:16.040 --> 00:18.200
You know, I typically like to make a frittata here,

00:18.200 --> 00:19.920
but I was on the hurries.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.640
So it's a modified frittata.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.480
And now maybe it's like a Nelly frittata.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.840
Well, see, you keep that nice cast iron pan and the cover

00:28.840 --> 00:30.000
that goes with it here for me.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.680
So I just kind of created a micro oven in the cast iron,

00:33.680 --> 00:35.080
and it did all right.

00:35.080 --> 00:35.880
Nice.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.720
And then he also utilized the new air fryer

00:37.720 --> 00:39.720
to make some fried potato sides for us.

00:39.720 --> 00:41.000
Already a convert.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.080
That's the first time I use that thing,

00:43.080 --> 00:44.680
and I must say I'm impressed.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.760
I realize this is why there's kind of like in JB,

00:47.760 --> 00:51.680
inside JB, there's kind of like resource contention over Brent.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.200
Like when Brent's coming to the studio, Alex telegrams me,

00:54.200 --> 00:56.440
like, oh, you got Brent time?

00:56.440 --> 00:57.160
That's no fair.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.360
I want Brent time.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.480
This is why.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.960
Because he's in there cooking breakfast and stuff

01:01.960 --> 01:02.600
for everybody.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.720
He brings snacks.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.560
He does.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.600
He brings snacks.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.880
Guys, guys, you can check.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.840
You can check.

01:07.840 --> 01:19.160
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.000
My name is Chris.

01:20.000 --> 01:20.720
My name is Wes.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.920
Hello, Wes.

01:21.920 --> 01:22.520
Hello.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.680
Are you full and satisfied?

01:23.680 --> 01:25.720
Not quite, but I've got the beer at the ready.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.200
He did also bring beer, too, which we did not mention.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.840
I know how to win hearts.

01:29.840 --> 01:30.600
You do.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
in learning for Cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.960
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs,

01:37.960 --> 01:42.720
get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.320
Well, today on the show, we're going

01:45.320 --> 01:47.760
to tell you how to run every single Linux distribution,

01:47.760 --> 01:49.400
well, nearly, at once.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.120
And I'm not talking about VMs.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.720
I'm not talking about containers.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.400
I'm talking native on one box simultaneously.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.800
You pick the host distro, and then you hijack it.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.320
And we'll chat with the developer of this mind-boggling

02:01.320 --> 02:02.400
tool.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.400
Plus, we got the community news.

02:04.400 --> 02:05.880
We got some feedback.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.040
But first, we have to say time-appropriate greetings

02:08.040 --> 02:08.920
to our virtual lug.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.040
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:10.040 --> 02:10.540
Hello.

02:10.540 --> 02:11.040
Greetings.

02:11.040 --> 02:11.540
Hello, Wes.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.040
Hello, Wes.

02:12.040 --> 02:12.540
Namaskaram.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.640
Hello, Brent.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.020
We are at full power today.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.760
We have 27 of them in there.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.020
We have some in the on-air and some in the quiet listening,

02:21.020 --> 02:22.280
and it's awesome.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.620
And the Mumble Room is going to be the trickiest piece

02:25.620 --> 02:26.520
while we're on the road.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.720
So I'm glad everybody made it for this one, at least.

02:29.720 --> 02:30.780
Oh, but yeah.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.000
So Brent got in last night.

02:32.000 --> 02:32.760
Sure did.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.720
After a day of travel for you, and what

02:34.720 --> 02:38.080
felt like a day of commuting for me to get down to the airport.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.920
And so Brent is joining us here in Seattle.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.040
And then he's going to board Lady Joops tonight,

02:43.040 --> 02:45.400
probably think, or tomorrow morning, but probably tonight.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.400
And then we head out tomorrow morning.

02:48.400 --> 02:54.720
Me, Brent, Hadia, my three kids, and the dog,

02:54.720 --> 02:56.040
all in Lady Joops.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.120
It's like a little land cruise you've got going here.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.240
Yeah, it's a land yacht, but it's going to.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.880
Are you crazy, Brent?

03:01.880 --> 03:02.880
Are you just crazy?

03:02.880 --> 03:05.700
I think I am, but I'm strangely OK with it.

03:05.700 --> 03:06.440
OK.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.440
Yeah, we are going to have a chase vehicle, as they call it.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.320
So Brent will often probably be in the chase vehicle.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.400
And then I imagine what will end up happening

03:14.400 --> 03:16.720
is Brent and I will essentially become co-drivers.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.620
So there'll be times where he'll have eyes on something

03:18.620 --> 03:21.080
I don't have eyes on, and we're going to have two-way radios.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.440
Oh, that's just adorable.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.200
Hey there, Brent, you know?

03:24.200 --> 03:25.040
Good, Chris.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.360
I think you're going to need some cute radio nicknames too,

03:27.360 --> 03:27.680
right?

03:27.680 --> 03:28.240
Call signs?

03:28.240 --> 03:29.680
Yeah, OK.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.200
Maybe he could be Brunch.

03:32.200 --> 03:32.960
Seems appropriate.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.000
Yeah.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.080
And so something that Hadia and I do

03:37.080 --> 03:38.680
is sometimes if I need to get over,

03:38.680 --> 03:41.000
she can move over earlier and kind of create

03:41.000 --> 03:42.040
a hole in traffic for me.

03:42.040 --> 03:42.880
Name and presence.

03:42.880 --> 03:43.720
Yeah, exactly.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.260
Or sometimes scoot ahead and check out

03:45.260 --> 03:48.040
a gas station or a rest stop and that kind of thing.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.160
And it also gives you a chance to have your own space,

03:50.160 --> 03:53.040
listen to something or make phone calls or whatever.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.600
Do business while you're going down the road, as one does.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.880
You've got your own podcast playlist, I'm sure.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.280
But on top of that, Brent's going

03:59.280 --> 04:02.480
to be working with me to record content during the trip,

04:02.480 --> 04:05.320
including chats with team members and information

04:05.320 --> 04:07.680
and just anecdotes from the trip and all that stuff.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.280
So we could see some fresh brunches for everybody.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.080
Oh, now that is exciting.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.360
So pretty excited about that.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.640
And totally feel unprepared.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.760
I don't have any of the production gear packed yet.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.520
Because I didn't want to break anything down

04:21.520 --> 04:22.360
until we're done with the show.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.280
We need it here, yeah.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.320
I've taken a couple of things out of the studio early,

04:25.320 --> 04:27.480
like my mute pedal and a couple of cables and stuff.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.320
But it's funny, too.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.200
I mean, it's not like you haven't been preparing.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.240
You've been thinking about this.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.640
You've been churning through it for, I mean,

04:32.640 --> 04:33.680
months now at this point.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.360
Yeah.

04:34.360 --> 04:37.600
And you remember last week, we had a server lockup.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.440
And it locked up twice in one morning.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.520
It was looking real bad.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.200
It was just after a Pacific Northwest heat wave.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.440
And I was literally going into panic mode.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.640
Because this server is a critical component

04:47.640 --> 04:49.040
of production.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.640
Because I need to get in and administer the mixer.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.520
And I do that via a WireGuard tunnel that

04:53.520 --> 04:54.800
comes in through that server.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.600
So if I didn't get access to the next cloud instance on there,

04:57.600 --> 04:59.480
if I couldn't get access to the media that's stored on there,

04:59.480 --> 05:01.960
if I couldn't get access to the archive, if one thing,

05:01.960 --> 05:04.440
I need WireGuard, I need to get access to the mixer

05:04.440 --> 05:05.600
so I can control the studio.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.560
And that's a critical role that server fulfills.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.800
And it's designed around that, right?

05:08.800 --> 05:11.680
It's our big ZFS-powered redundant server.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.520
No, it turns out.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.600
It was locking up.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.840
It was locking up.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.920
And so Wes and I were racking our brains.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.120
Like, nothing has changed.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.880
So we were thinking maybe it's hardware failure.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.040
Because in the absence of software change,

05:22.040 --> 05:24.160
you start to suspect something changed in hardware.

05:24.160 --> 05:27.400
And it's an older used machine as we put it through its paces.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.960
It's literally sitting in an oven.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.800
I mean, sometimes it gets so hot out there

05:30.800 --> 05:32.160
you could slow cook pork ribs.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.120
It's bad.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.040
So we thought that must be what it is.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.160
Then it dawned on us, like, I don't know,

05:37.160 --> 05:38.120
maybe after the show.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.600
I can't remember when we thought about it.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.640
But we thought, you know, there is one change.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.360
And I don't know if this is what it is.

05:43.360 --> 05:47.200
But the one change we made is I reinstalled NetData,

05:47.200 --> 05:49.480
a really handy tool that we recommended before.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.680
And I installed the LM Sensors package.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.080
And those are the only two changes I made.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.940
But maybe something is there.

05:56.940 --> 06:01.920
So I did a systemctl disable NetData, turned it off,

06:01.920 --> 06:04.000
and stopped it.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.720
And ever since I did that, it's been solid.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.200
The system hasn't locked up once.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.120
And it's still gotten hot a few times.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.840
The other thing I've done, I've started setting up fans

06:13.840 --> 06:16.220
to vent the garage into the house.

06:16.220 --> 06:17.720
It heats up the rest of the house.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.480
But then I have a series of fans that kind of push it out

06:20.480 --> 06:21.140
the back door.

06:21.140 --> 06:22.840
And so it means the downstairs gets warmer.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.120
But the garage area drops like 10, 15 degrees.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.760
It's a significant improvement.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.120
I like this sort of readjusting the entire climate

06:30.120 --> 06:32.360
control of the studio for that poor little server.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.640
And then what we've done is we've

06:33.640 --> 06:35.560
sealed off the actual studio, the production

06:35.560 --> 06:37.080
part of the studio where we record.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.400
And we've installed an air conditioner there

06:39.400 --> 06:41.120
to climate control the specific studio.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.560
Now, if you're interested, we are selling very sketchy colo.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.240
So don't worry.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.320
Discount rates.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.920
Great prices.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.320
Average uptime.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.280
Great prices, OK uptime.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.440
Jupiter garage hosting.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.120
I love it.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.200
So hopefully, everything's going to be OK.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.660
And it'll last through the road trip.

07:01.660 --> 07:03.160
I haven't touched it since because I

07:03.160 --> 07:05.120
don't want to introduce any state change at all.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.540
I mean, we'd like to eventually be

07:06.540 --> 07:08.680
able to try re-enabling net data, for instance.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.760
We want to validate this.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.800
Not right now.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.400
So my thought is when we get back,

07:12.400 --> 07:15.560
I'll probably flip net data back on and see if we get lockups.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.880
I'm hopeful that everything will be fine.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.040
And that's just one less thing to worry about right now.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.600
And if it doesn't, I should be able to tuck and roll fairly

07:25.600 --> 07:29.920
easily into spinning everything up that's essential,

07:29.920 --> 07:31.660
with the exception of the mixer.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.120
It's still tricky because it's on the physical land here

07:34.120 --> 07:34.720
at the studio.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.200
And I need a way to remotely connect

07:36.200 --> 07:37.640
while I'm on the road.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.260
And the solution I have now is so perfect.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.240
And so I don't know.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.160
Maybe in a pinch, we could set up another system in here

07:45.160 --> 07:47.360
and act as a wire guard system or something.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.680
Yeah, we'll get some back doors going.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.920
The one thing we have going for us is Wes flies out later.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.960
So you'll be here a little bit after I'm gone.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.640
There will be a critical window still.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.360
But if it fails before then, we've got some time.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.100
Yeah, so that's hopefully it.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.280
The meetups are coming soon.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.080
The first meetup will be in Salt Lake City on August 7th.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.480
And the second meetup will be in Denver on August 20th.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.920
The Denver one, we'll have our friends from Lidnode there.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.600
Linux gamer Garnet will be there.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.560
We'll be giving away some raspberry pies.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.200
They're going to be giving away some big, like,

08:18.200 --> 08:20.640
big dollar amount Linode credits.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.760
They're going to have all kinds of stuff they're doing there.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.200
And we're also going to have drinks and snacks.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.700
And so it's going to be a big meetup.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.200
And we're also going to bring on board for the Salt Lake City

08:28.200 --> 08:28.520
meetup.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.580
We're going to have swag on board

08:29.580 --> 08:31.880
to give out to folks that make it to the Salt Lake City

08:31.880 --> 08:33.960
meetup as well.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.720
So hopefully that all goes smoothly.

08:35.720 --> 08:36.560
But what do you say?

08:36.560 --> 08:38.300
Maybe we should do a little community news.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.600
Yeah, we better get through it.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.480
We've covered some of the possible downsides

08:41.480 --> 08:44.160
to the Linux ecosystem with the Steam Deck,

08:44.160 --> 08:47.080
specifically around focusing more on Proton development

08:47.080 --> 08:49.520
to less on Linux native games.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.440
But there's clear positives as well.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.840
And I thought maybe we'd focus on those today.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.960
So along with some of the optimizations

08:55.960 --> 08:58.120
that you're going to see just throughout the Linux stack

08:58.120 --> 09:00.400
with the Steam Deck, the one we wanted to talk about

09:00.400 --> 09:02.200
is AMD's work.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.520
They've been working with Valve on CPU frequency and power

09:05.520 --> 09:08.480
scaling improvements to enhance the Steam Play gaming

09:08.480 --> 09:11.600
experience on the modern AMD platforms that

09:11.600 --> 09:13.800
are in our laptops, desktops, and also the Steam Deck.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.400
Yeah.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.680
Now, historically, AMD hasn't really

09:16.680 --> 09:19.420
worked on the Linux CPU frequency scaling stuff,

09:19.420 --> 09:22.320
especially in the kernel as much as Intel has.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.480
And actually, that kind of goes for other areas of power

09:24.480 --> 09:26.080
management as well.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.800
But going by a recent job posting and now some patches,

09:30.800 --> 09:32.860
it seems AMD is ramping up efforts

09:32.860 --> 09:35.480
in those areas, including some specific stuff

09:35.480 --> 09:36.360
around the scheduler.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.960
And we know how important that is.

09:37.960 --> 09:38.640
Yeah.

09:38.640 --> 09:39.840
I was looking.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.220
I couldn't find the job postings anymore.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.880
But Michael Larble over at Feronix

09:43.880 --> 09:46.480
kind of implied that it might be like multiple job postings

09:46.480 --> 09:49.080
that AMD had to work on this stuff.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.000
Now, AMD and Valve are working together

09:51.000 --> 09:53.860
to improve the performance and power efficiency

09:53.860 --> 09:57.080
for modern AMD platforms running on Proton.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.960
They've also spearheaded the ACPI CPU frequency driver.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.680
The focus on Proton still remains.

10:01.680 --> 10:06.320
That's interesting, but I kind of, I mean, we'll see.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.080
We're going to hear more about this at XDC.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.920
It seems AMD will be presenting some information.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.680
And it's quite possible that some of this

10:11.680 --> 10:13.680
is based around some effort that we've already

10:13.680 --> 10:16.760
seen for a previously proposed driver.

10:16.760 --> 10:20.040
We'll see, something that AMD actually suggested back in 2019.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.440
Michael Larble is on it like a bonnet over at Feronix,

10:22.440 --> 10:26.120
though, so keep checking over there for more information.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.800
And also related to just like Steam Deck, perhaps the hype

10:28.800 --> 10:31.680
bubble, it seems like it's driving a few more people

10:31.680 --> 10:33.880
into Linux gaming than we've seen recently.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.880
Liam over at Gaming on Linux reports

10:35.880 --> 10:38.320
that Linux has seen a bit of a surge right now.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.440
And it's flirting with that 1% user share on Steam.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.880
Say it ain't so.

10:43.880 --> 10:44.640
Yeah.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.720
If we do the math here, take the number of monthly active users

10:47.720 --> 10:51.600
Steam says, 120 million, that would give us

10:51.600 --> 10:57.080
like 1,204,000 monthly active Linux users on Steam.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.960
1.2 mil monthly?

10:58.960 --> 11:00.480
That's a real demographic.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.040
It is.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.640
I mean, 1% seems really small.

11:02.640 --> 11:04.560
But then you consider like everyone

11:04.560 --> 11:07.280
uses Steam who plays games at all, so wow.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.560
And why is it surging right now?

11:09.560 --> 11:10.400
What's changed?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.560
It's the Deck, right?

11:11.560 --> 11:13.040
It's got to be the news of the Deck.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.320
And maybe people are like, well, Valve's

11:15.320 --> 11:16.420
taking it this seriously.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.200
Maybe I should look at it again.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.160
I mean, I admit it got me to reopen up Steam again

11:20.160 --> 11:21.680
and poke around a little bit.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.000
I will say just casually, it does

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
seem that there's some general acceptance among the Linux

11:26.000 --> 11:27.760
curious folks that maybe just they're not

11:27.760 --> 11:29.360
running Linux on the desktop, but they use it for work

11:29.360 --> 11:30.360
or whatever.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.320
I've noticed more of them hearing about Proton

11:32.320 --> 11:33.960
and hearing good experience reports.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.000
So I wonder, too, if there's just a sort of slow build of,

11:36.000 --> 11:37.760
Proton's just been good for a while now.

11:37.760 --> 11:38.400
And getting better.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.560
And it's getting better.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.640
One question I have is, do you think

11:41.640 --> 11:43.840
this is any different than when they first

11:43.840 --> 11:45.700
sort of jumped all in on Linux?

11:45.700 --> 11:47.240
It sounds familiar to me.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.400
Maybe a few years ago, they kind of did the same thing.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.020
With the Deck, you mean how is it different?

11:51.020 --> 11:51.540
Yeah.

11:51.540 --> 11:54.400
I think this time, the Deck is an accumulation

11:54.400 --> 11:56.700
of all of their mistakes that they wish they would have done

11:56.700 --> 11:59.800
a little bit differently and kind of all in on this one.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.760
In fact, the Steam Controller itself,

12:01.760 --> 12:03.760
the original Steam Controller, initially

12:03.760 --> 12:06.000
started with a screen in it.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.920
And then Valve transitioned everything

12:07.920 --> 12:09.200
to touchpads over time.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.520
Don't call it a Dreamcast.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.360
Yeah.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.320
And they've kind of been working through this.

12:13.320 --> 12:16.120
Like the sound system in the Deck

12:16.120 --> 12:18.360
is basically an upgraded version of what's

12:18.360 --> 12:20.560
in the Index that they've already been making.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.680
And so that kind of stuff, I think,

12:22.680 --> 12:26.560
at each kind of phase, since they announced Steam Machines,

12:26.560 --> 12:27.880
they've learned lessons there.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.280
And for better or for worse, I think

12:29.280 --> 12:31.960
that's also what's driving them to push Proton so much,

12:31.960 --> 12:33.400
part of that whole thing.

12:33.400 --> 12:37.320
And I just saw a Hacker News conversation thread today

12:37.320 --> 12:38.920
that was, I think it's great.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.700
And this guy had all of these reasons

12:40.700 --> 12:44.120
for why he thinks it's great that Valve is pushing Proton,

12:44.120 --> 12:46.680
and that should be the go-forward strategy forever

12:46.680 --> 12:47.720
and all this kind of stuff.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.000
And I don't know about that.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.120
But I sit here, and I look at this, and I see it as,

12:52.120 --> 12:54.400
it's a real multispectral issue.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.020
And part of it, to your question, Brent,

12:56.020 --> 12:59.080
is even if this sort of is not much different

12:59.080 --> 13:02.520
than their original announcement and kind of peters out,

13:02.520 --> 13:05.080
the interim enhancements that we're getting, like with AMD

13:05.080 --> 13:07.160
contributing to the CPU scaling code

13:07.160 --> 13:10.560
and the intermediate stacks for the video drivers

13:10.560 --> 13:13.320
and the audio stuff is getting so much work and improvement

13:13.320 --> 13:16.480
to prepare for this that we've kind of already benefited.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.000
Yeah.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.120
It seems like they've learned a lot since the whole Steam

13:19.120 --> 13:19.660
Machine thing.

13:19.660 --> 13:21.660
Not only is it more focused in the hardware sense,

13:21.660 --> 13:24.160
we are seeing some specific improvements coming in, right?

13:24.160 --> 13:26.300
But also, they've just had this experience

13:26.300 --> 13:28.640
of working with various contractors

13:28.640 --> 13:30.980
on wine and Proton improvements and getting more stuff targeted

13:30.980 --> 13:31.960
towards the kernel.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.060
So it seems like they're just leaving

13:33.060 --> 13:35.600
a lot of good stuff in their wake, whatever they're doing.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.360
Mm-hmm.

13:36.360 --> 13:40.780
And for me, Linux has never been a really big gaming platform,

13:40.780 --> 13:43.640
because I've kind of decided that Linux is,

13:43.640 --> 13:45.200
when I want to play on my computer,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.760
I play with Linux or a desktop environment,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.680
but something in that stack.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.120
And when I want to play a video game, I play on my Switch.

13:53.120 --> 13:57.160
And I hope that the Deck might replace the Switch for that,

13:57.160 --> 13:59.600
where then I'm still on Linux, and I'm still

13:59.600 --> 14:01.160
playing the games I've already bought,

14:01.160 --> 14:02.960
and I could move to the PC.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.400
And the other thing that's so exciting about that is,

14:05.400 --> 14:07.960
I could be on the Deck, and the kids could be on a PC,

14:07.960 --> 14:09.720
or they could be on the Deck, and I can be on a PC,

14:09.720 --> 14:11.000
and we can all play together.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.460
I think that's going to be something

14:12.460 --> 14:14.420
that the other consoles don't offer right now,

14:14.420 --> 14:16.800
and that is going to be a huge selling point to me.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.880
We'll see where it goes.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.840
As a dad, I like it a lot.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.960
As a gamer myself, I think, I don't know.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.400
Because for me, the Switch offers the Nintendo franchise

14:24.400 --> 14:29.000
games, like Mario, like Zelda, like Metroid.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.640
And that's always going to be a draw to me.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.200
Does that just show your age, Chris?

14:32.200 --> 14:33.480
Yeah, maybe.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.920
Maybe.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.600
Let's talk about ingenuity.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.920
What an amazing accomplishment.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.640
You guys remember the Linux Copter on Mars?

14:40.640 --> 14:41.840
How could we forget?

14:41.840 --> 14:44.600
Oh, man, has it been something to watch this thing go.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.060
And in a brand new video, which we'll

14:46.060 --> 14:47.760
have linked in the show notes, you

14:47.760 --> 14:51.680
can see ingenuity make its highest and most complex flight

14:51.680 --> 14:53.000
to date.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.720
And they're now taken into an area that sounds treacherous.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.520
It's called Raised Ridges.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.680
Watch out, little copter.

14:59.680 --> 15:03.400
Now, during this trip, which is its 10th flight on Mars,

15:03.400 --> 15:07.120
ingenuity covered a distance of 310 feet, or 95 meters,

15:07.120 --> 15:08.440
for you metric folk.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.720
So we're doing a record altitude for it of 40 feet, or 12 meters

15:11.720 --> 15:12.220
high.

15:12.220 --> 15:16.100
Remember, that's in the crazy thin atmosphere over there.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.440
Combined with the distance it's traveled throughout all

15:18.440 --> 15:20.280
of its prior flights, ingenuity has now

15:20.280 --> 15:23.680
flown for more than a mile, arbitrary milestone maybe.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.040
But I mean, that's some serious performance.

15:26.040 --> 15:26.720
It's amazing.

15:26.720 --> 15:30.480
It was originally designed to only perform four flights.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.560
So we're talking 10 flights now?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.440
This has been since April, too.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.560
Not only is that just an incredible accomplishment

15:36.560 --> 15:38.280
on its own, but it has essentially

15:38.280 --> 15:40.380
submitted this type of Linux-powered device

15:40.380 --> 15:43.440
as a go-to, must-have secondary piece of equipment

15:43.440 --> 15:45.520
when exploring another planet.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.440
What?

15:46.440 --> 15:48.360
Can we just soak that in for a second?

15:48.360 --> 15:50.200
From, like, we've never done this before.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.700
We're not sure if it's going to work

15:51.700 --> 15:53.960
or if it's up to the task to, no, we need these.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.200
We need to bring these along.

15:55.200 --> 15:55.700
Right.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.920
And it's when we're exploring other planets.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.640
It's the stability of Linux that really makes it appropriate.

16:00.640 --> 16:01.600
It's crazy, man.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.880
It is so, so crazy.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.560
I am so excited to watch the development of this thing.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.440
And it's going to continue on, too.

16:08.440 --> 16:08.880
Yeah, right?

16:08.880 --> 16:09.880
I mean, it's not done yet.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.560
As we've seen, I think JPL and NASA

16:12.560 --> 16:14.360
have a pretty good record of getting

16:14.360 --> 16:16.520
all they can out of our little adventure buddies

16:16.520 --> 16:17.560
over on the Red Planet.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.440
Ha, ha, ha.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.360
Linode.com slash unplugged.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.400
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account

16:26.400 --> 16:28.160
and you support the show.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.120
Linode is our hosting provider for everything

16:30.120 --> 16:31.780
we've built in the last couple of years.

16:31.780 --> 16:35.080
Since we went independent, we've built everything on Linode.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.140
The infrastructure is solid, it's flexible,

16:37.140 --> 16:38.320
and of course, it performs.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.360
And you can focus on your project,

16:40.360 --> 16:42.080
not on your infrastructure issues.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.080
And you get 11 data centers to choose from all

16:44.080 --> 16:45.800
around the world, and every service level

16:45.800 --> 16:49.780
is backed by the best customer support in the business.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.960
And they've been around since 2003,

16:51.960 --> 16:54.480
which means they've been doing this now for 18 years.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.560
And every step of the way, they've

16:55.560 --> 16:57.480
had to kind of innovate and stay competitive

16:57.480 --> 16:59.960
and watch out for different players to come in the market

16:59.960 --> 17:02.400
and offer different packages and different dashboards.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.440
Linode's got all of that.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.720
And they've really honed in something special.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.040
You know, a few months ago, I set up a $5 Linode.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.880
And I just use it for simple passing data

17:09.880 --> 17:12.200
between home and the studio.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.800
It's like an intermediary that adds just additional bandwidth.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.960
And then once I had it going, I was like, well, gosh,

17:16.960 --> 17:19.400
you know, I could set up an SSH jump post on that.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.640
Oh, you know, I could put some quick documentation up there

17:21.640 --> 17:23.720
that I could SSH into and read real quick.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.040
Oh, hey, you know what would be nice

17:25.040 --> 17:26.680
is if I put a status page up there that

17:26.680 --> 17:29.200
could check on the connections remotely that I could go,

17:29.200 --> 17:30.640
oh, you know what else I could do?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.680
And from on and on and on.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.080
And it's all just on a $5 Linode.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.360
It's so impressive.

17:36.360 --> 17:39.120
You really can just kind of push it beyond what you'd expect.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.040
And the value is there because they're always

17:41.040 --> 17:42.280
investing in the hardware.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.320
And they're 30% to 50% cheaper than some of the big hyperscalers

17:45.320 --> 17:46.040
out there.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.980
And I could sit here and tell you about this all day long.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.820
But you really got to go see it for yourself.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.400
And this $100, it's really going to let you test it.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.920
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.840
Get $100 for your new account.

17:56.840 --> 17:57.560
Try this stuff out.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.240
Build something.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.360
Learn something.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.720
And support the show.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.400
You know, we are just almost to one year

18:02.400 --> 18:04.040
since we've gone independent.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.720
Just a few of us sitting here working our hearts out

18:07.720 --> 18:09.000
to make content.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.920
And the reason we can do this and the reason why

18:11.920 --> 18:13.520
we can take this as seriously as we do

18:13.520 --> 18:15.440
and invest the energy and effort we do

18:15.440 --> 18:18.040
is because people out there take advantage of our sponsor offers

18:18.040 --> 18:20.000
and let them know that it's worth their money.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.160
It's worth our sponsors' time.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.800
They get value out of our shows.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.220
And it's such a nice system because they're

18:24.220 --> 18:25.440
offering you something great.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.480
I mean, I enthusiastically endorse Linode.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.560
I have zero reservations about that.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.640
And $100 is real value.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.160
Like, they're meeting you there with $100.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.800
So go try it out and support the show.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.560
Linode.com slash unplugged.

18:38.560 --> 18:44.160
So we teased this earlier, but it is true.

18:44.160 --> 18:49.240
You can actually run every Linux distro at once.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.680
Now, this is something that we've been taking a pass at.

18:51.680 --> 18:52.320
No kidding.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.720
I mean, it's a little bit of a dream, right?

18:53.720 --> 18:54.520
You love Arch.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.060
You want all the stuff in the AUR,

18:56.060 --> 18:58.880
but sometimes it just doesn't make sense for that system.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.200
Yeah, and honestly, we thought maybe we

19:01.200 --> 19:04.720
could solve this with Toolbox, that great, handy Fedora tool.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.320
And it got me part of the way there.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.280
I will admit, it got me part of the way there.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.360
But it wasn't all that I wanted.

19:10.360 --> 19:14.320
I wanted something that was truly like multiple distro

19:14.320 --> 19:15.440
package managers.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.880
I didn't really want something that

19:16.880 --> 19:19.640
was in a VM that wasn't on my local system.

19:19.640 --> 19:20.480
That's just it, right?

19:20.480 --> 19:21.840
Sometimes you really do want that.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.440
It's just you're using this application

19:23.440 --> 19:26.080
for a specific use case or only at certain times or something.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.360
Or it's just you don't want it as part of your system.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.120
You want to play with it and try it out.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.920
Toolbox really does work with containers of all kinds.

19:32.920 --> 19:33.680
But you're right.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.160
If you're setting up a battle station,

19:35.160 --> 19:37.000
you're going to be using this, maybe a video editor,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
or you need something in the background, a tool

19:39.000 --> 19:40.600
that your distro doesn't have.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.440
You're going to be always fighting that you've

19:42.440 --> 19:44.680
containerized it when you want it to be integrated.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.760
And then once you've figured all of this out,

19:47.760 --> 19:49.960
you don't want to create some shit storm problem

19:49.960 --> 19:52.680
that you have to manage all the time that is just spewing

19:52.680 --> 19:55.000
crap all over your box and making things break left

19:55.000 --> 19:55.560
and right.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.600
You don't want that either.

19:56.600 --> 19:56.960
Oh, right.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.960
I had to compile it this way with a custom patch

19:58.960 --> 19:59.660
to get it to work.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.320
And how did I do that again?

20:01.320 --> 20:03.400
Yeah, it's just you could see how you could really

20:03.400 --> 20:05.160
crap up a box quick, right?

20:05.160 --> 20:10.380
And it really is the case that there is a type of solution

20:10.380 --> 20:13.040
here that is quintessentially free software.

20:13.040 --> 20:18.560
And we, seven years ago, chatted with Paradigm, the developer

20:18.560 --> 20:21.960
of Bedrock Linux, which is a meta Linux distribution which

20:21.960 --> 20:24.640
allows users to mix and match components

20:24.640 --> 20:27.160
from other distributions, typically incompatible

20:27.160 --> 20:28.080
distributions.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.960
Bedrock integrates all of these components

20:29.960 --> 20:33.240
into one largely cohesive system.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.680
So you could have a Debian stable host distribution

20:36.680 --> 20:41.280
with an Arch kernel or other packages from the Arch repo.

20:41.280 --> 20:45.000
In my case, I set up a Fedora 34 workstation,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.080
and then I hijacked that into a Bedrock install.

20:47.080 --> 20:47.840
Nice.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.240
So because I thought that'd make for a pretty decent base.

20:51.240 --> 20:53.520
But this is why I say it's quintessentially free software

20:53.520 --> 20:56.880
is Paradigm has been working on this now for about just

20:56.880 --> 20:57.720
over 10 years.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.880
Seven years we talked to Paradigm.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.320
And I thought, is Bedrock gone?

21:01.320 --> 21:01.840
Is it dead?

21:01.840 --> 21:02.960
Is it still alive?

21:02.960 --> 21:05.040
It's just such an unfortunate but common story, right?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.200
Someone has a great idea, but it just never takes off,

21:07.200 --> 21:08.540
or they move on with their life.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.960
It was a passion project, and things change.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.320
But that decade is a long time.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.760
Yeah, especially for something that is ambitious as this,

21:16.760 --> 21:19.280
when the Linux ecosystem moves as fast as it does,

21:19.280 --> 21:21.120
when there's the number of distributions out there

21:21.120 --> 21:21.720
that there are.

21:21.720 --> 21:22.040
Right.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.260
I mean, not to diminish any projects,

21:23.260 --> 21:25.080
but this isn't just a respin of a distro

21:25.080 --> 21:27.160
with some customizations or a different DE, right?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.720
This is a meta distribution.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.480
Yeah, you pick the distro you start with,

21:30.480 --> 21:32.040
and then you convert it into this.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.480
And it's incredible.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.960
So what we wanted to do was call up Paradigm

21:35.960 --> 21:39.360
and check in on how he's doing and how the project is going.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.800
Paradigm, welcome back to the show.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.160
It's been seven years since we chatted last.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.360
I'm happy to be back.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.840
So long, in fact, that I didn't recall our conversation

21:47.840 --> 21:50.280
until you embarrassingly reminded me,

21:50.280 --> 21:52.880
and then it all came flooding back.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.640
So thank you for making it.

21:55.640 --> 21:59.000
And I think this marks like nine years or so

21:59.000 --> 22:01.920
that you've officially been making, creating,

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
running Bedrock.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.800
The first public release was nine years ago,

22:04.800 --> 22:06.720
but there was definitely some preliminary work,

22:06.720 --> 22:08.680
maybe two or three years before that.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.040
So yeah, it's been a while.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.520
Yeah, and along with all of that,

22:12.520 --> 22:16.680
I see you in the IRC room answering questions often.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.000
We talked a lot back in the day about this concept

22:20.000 --> 22:23.920
and about taking up disk space and how

22:23.920 --> 22:26.280
there was multiple libraries sometimes and all of that.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.880
And I look back at this conversation now,

22:27.880 --> 22:29.680
and I go, it's so funny because it

22:29.680 --> 22:32.520
feels like Flatpak and Snap sort of just settled

22:32.520 --> 22:33.480
that conversation.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.600
And I wonder, where do you see Bedrock fitting in now,

22:36.600 --> 22:39.080
all these years later, when there are things like Flatpak

22:39.080 --> 22:39.960
and Snaps out there?

22:39.960 --> 22:43.200
Do you feel like there's a shift for Bedrock,

22:43.200 --> 22:45.240
or does Bedrock's core mission continue?

22:45.240 --> 22:47.600
I'd say Bedrock's core mission still continues.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.360
Things like Flatpak and Snap do solve a problem

22:50.360 --> 22:53.920
that Bedrock could have helped with before they came around.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.160
But they don't completely overlap with Bedrock,

22:56.160 --> 22:58.080
since they're kind of a lot of independent things

22:58.080 --> 23:00.920
that you still need Bedrock for if you're interested in them.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.840
So they end up being largely orthogonal.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.840
Right, I had a fun experience hijacking a Fedora 34

23:05.840 --> 23:07.920
install and creating a Bedrock install out of it.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.720
And then on top of that, I layered

23:09.720 --> 23:12.120
on Alpine and Void Linux.

23:12.120 --> 23:15.400
And pretty soon, it just became its own hybrid monster

23:15.400 --> 23:16.760
in the greatest way possible.

23:16.760 --> 23:20.000
I could pick and choose which packages from which distro

23:20.000 --> 23:22.080
I want, and I had all of the package managers

23:22.080 --> 23:22.800
all of a sudden.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.040
So I'm curious now, like nine years or so,

23:26.040 --> 23:28.000
at least since we chatted seven years,

23:28.000 --> 23:29.760
what problems are you solving now

23:29.760 --> 23:32.400
that you weren't solving back when we first chatted?

23:32.400 --> 23:34.880
I think when we first chatted, one

23:34.880 --> 23:36.520
of the limitations you brought up,

23:36.520 --> 23:38.360
which was very correct at the time,

23:38.360 --> 23:40.880
was Bedrock was pretty rough to install.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.600
It was comparable to something like OneX from Scratch.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.000
Did even Bedrock get features from other distros?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.280
Not just packages, but anything in the abstract.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.120
This includes things like the installation process.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.200
And so at the time, the installer

23:53.200 --> 23:54.680
was kind of a placeholder until I

23:54.680 --> 23:57.080
figured out how to get an installer from another distro.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.320
And as you mentioned, it's pretty easy now.

23:59.320 --> 24:02.000
You got Fedoras without thinking about it too much.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.320
So that's definitely one thing that I did not

24:04.320 --> 24:06.720
have solved seven years ago that I do today.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.080
I also recall during our chat that we were really

24:09.080 --> 24:11.560
consternating over what you were going to do about systemd

24:11.560 --> 24:13.240
and just init systems in general.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.360
Oh, yes.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.160
At the time, for the same reason,

24:16.160 --> 24:17.880
Bedrock had a placeholder in it until I

24:17.880 --> 24:20.120
figured out how to get inits from other distros.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.600
And today, you can get almost every major init.

24:23.600 --> 24:27.080
I think, in fact, we're probably going to get S6, maybe

24:27.080 --> 24:29.440
the latest one I'm working on getting to work.

24:29.440 --> 24:33.040
And it'll probably work here in the next point update.

24:33.040 --> 24:38.480
But yeah, systemd, OpenRC, runits, even upstart,

24:38.480 --> 24:40.840
I'd still test against old ISOs.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.280
And that works as well.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.200
Wow, that's impressive.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.760
I mean, what's the process like of onboarding a new init

24:45.760 --> 24:46.560
system?

24:46.560 --> 24:47.840
I kind of solved most of the work

24:47.840 --> 24:49.800
in a very generalized fashion.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.800
Bedrock has a menu when you put the system kind

24:52.800 --> 24:54.840
of like after the bootloader menu where you pick your OS

24:54.840 --> 24:55.680
and kernel.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.720
Bedrock adds an init selection menu to select your init

24:58.720 --> 25:01.360
and does some generalized bootstrap work there.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.680
And then for each specific init, there's

25:03.680 --> 25:06.280
often quirks I have to go work on.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.000
So for example, for systemd, I had

25:08.000 --> 25:11.720
to make some unit files to go change things after it started.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.600
But that's generally how it goes.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.440
Well, obviously, the goal here with Bedrock

25:15.440 --> 25:17.880
is getting a lot of nice abilities, features,

25:17.880 --> 25:20.760
superpowers, you might say, from all the various Linux

25:20.760 --> 25:23.440
distributions that you have support for.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.840
But when you do that, are there some downsides

25:25.840 --> 25:27.720
of hijacking your system?

25:27.720 --> 25:30.200
The predominant one is complexity.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.760
A Bedrock system is fundamentally more complex

25:32.760 --> 25:35.160
than a traditional distro, largely because it

25:35.160 --> 25:37.040
has all the complexity of traditional distros

25:37.040 --> 25:40.200
with Bedrock on top and possibly multiple distros,

25:40.200 --> 25:41.480
or normally multiple.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.560
And so as long as things are working, it's fine.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.640
But as soon as something goes wrong,

25:44.640 --> 25:46.240
it's a lot more effort to debug.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.560
You thought just having to figure out

25:47.560 --> 25:49.880
the problems with one package manager was a problem.

25:49.880 --> 25:50.960
Well, add a few more.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.480
Yes.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.440
Well, I do remember when we were chatting last time,

25:55.440 --> 26:00.640
you had a goal of a meta package manager that would, in theory,

26:00.640 --> 26:03.640
run updates and whatnot across all of the various package

26:03.640 --> 26:05.920
managers you might have installed on a Bedrock system.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.120
How does that work on?

26:07.120 --> 26:08.560
Happily, that's available.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.720
It works great today.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.880
We call it the Package Manager Manager.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.840
I think that was just like a shorthand for it, just

26:14.840 --> 26:17.680
a placeholder name when I first came up with it,

26:17.680 --> 26:19.560
and that ended up sticking.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.040
You can use it for the obvious use

26:21.040 --> 26:23.080
case of upgrading the whole system.

26:23.080 --> 26:26.640
But there's also, I found, some workflows on Bedrock

26:26.640 --> 26:29.520
that need to take multiple package managers into consideration

26:29.520 --> 26:32.200
that you might not think about if you're not on Bedrock.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.680
For example, if I want a specific package,

26:34.680 --> 26:37.040
I might want to check if one distro has it.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.840
If it doesn't, then check if another does.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.720
If that doesn't, check if a third does.

26:40.720 --> 26:43.080
And just install whatever the first one has.

26:43.080 --> 26:46.200
And so PMM can do that pretty trivially.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.320
So for a concrete example, actually, I

26:48.320 --> 26:51.360
use S-Cron as my preferred cron program.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.840
And Void Linux is the only distro

26:52.840 --> 26:55.480
I knew of that actually provides it.

26:55.480 --> 26:59.080
And I figured that out by typing PMM install S-Cron,

26:59.080 --> 27:01.760
and I did that.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.440
Void was mostly low on my priority list.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.640
I had to skim quite a few.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.920
Wow, interesting.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.640
Is it recommended to use PMM, or is it still

27:08.640 --> 27:10.160
fine to just use the individual ones

27:10.160 --> 27:11.800
and you won't really miss out on much?

27:11.800 --> 27:14.120
You're welcome to use individual commands if you want.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.000
But after using Bedrock for a while

27:17.000 --> 27:19.520
and you find enough kind of cross-package manager

27:19.520 --> 27:20.840
operations that you want to do, it

27:20.840 --> 27:22.520
starts becoming more pleasant.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.120
An additional feature of PMM I should mention while we're on

27:25.120 --> 27:26.440
that I'm somewhat proud of.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.360
Since the idea behind Bedrock is to get features

27:28.360 --> 27:30.440
from other distros, I wanted to see

27:30.440 --> 27:33.000
if I can get the package manager user interface

27:33.000 --> 27:34.440
from other distros as well.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.520
Because I know people have a lot of muscle memory

27:36.520 --> 27:38.280
for how to use one package manager.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.400
I found some people who need a Bedrock will type things

27:40.400 --> 27:45.480
like pacman install or apt-s just from confusing their muscle

27:45.480 --> 27:46.320
memory there.

27:46.320 --> 27:49.160
And so you can configure PMM to mimic the user interface

27:49.160 --> 27:50.120
of different distros.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.400
Whatever muscle memory you have, it can continue with.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.320
And you can use that across all the distros on your system.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.920
Well, it's that kind of polish that

27:57.920 --> 27:59.320
makes me think we should also make

27:59.320 --> 28:01.640
sure we hit more on that interactive tutorial.

28:01.640 --> 28:04.400
I know Chris and I both tried it, and just, wow.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.640
I mean, it was really useful.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.240
It was fun.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.320
It was easy.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.440
And it just felt like it was quite polished.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.120
And I'm curious, what's the story there?

28:11.120 --> 28:13.880
How did that come about, and how does it all work?

28:13.880 --> 28:17.440
The story there, it starts with difficulty expressing

28:17.440 --> 28:18.840
what Bedrock is to other people.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.720
People don't like to read dry documentation.

28:21.720 --> 28:25.920
And it's difficult to summarize within people's own attention

28:25.920 --> 28:28.080
span everything needed for Bedrock.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.620
So someone else came up with the idea,

28:29.620 --> 28:32.520
so I can't take it full credit, of an interactive tutorial,

28:32.520 --> 28:34.160
hoping that the interactive nature will

28:34.160 --> 28:36.960
help keep it more engaging and help things sink in more.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.920
First try was just, essentially, documentation

28:38.920 --> 28:40.960
in a terminal, which didn't work too well.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.640
I started adding some scripting to it,

28:43.640 --> 28:45.600
so it'll detect your environment and see

28:45.600 --> 28:47.800
what you're doing interactively to kind of actually force

28:47.800 --> 28:48.760
you to run the commands.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.480
And I found that made a big difference.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.120
Yeah, that really stood out to me.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.760
It felt like it wasn't just a static thing,

28:54.760 --> 28:57.720
but the tutorial actually asks you to cat some files,

28:57.720 --> 28:59.400
to use T to pipe stuff around.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.800
And not only does it actually show you the output in a way

29:01.800 --> 29:03.880
that you get to feel like, oh, I see that.

29:03.880 --> 29:04.960
That's actually on my system.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.520
I don't just have to trust the man page,

29:06.520 --> 29:07.960
but it also just meant that it felt a little bit

29:07.960 --> 29:08.720
like a video game.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.960
Yeah, it requires you to complete the task

29:10.960 --> 29:12.680
before you can move forward in some cases.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.800
Yeah.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.800
So I have a couple of questions about the future.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.120
On the top of mind of listeners last time

29:19.120 --> 29:21.040
was, what about graphical apps?

29:21.040 --> 29:23.080
And I'm curious how the transition to Wayland

29:23.080 --> 29:25.800
affects Bedrock and the state of graphical applications

29:25.800 --> 29:26.960
using, say, Bedrock.

29:26.960 --> 29:31.440
Like, in my case, I have a Fedora 34 hijack system.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.780
And perhaps I wanted to load Arch on there or something

29:33.780 --> 29:36.480
and pull something in from one of those repositories.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.240
Could I successfully get a Wayland application

29:38.240 --> 29:38.960
working that way?

29:38.960 --> 29:41.640
In fact, I did zero effort for Wayland.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.040
It just worked with the kind of infrastructure we had.

29:44.040 --> 29:44.560
Wow.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.840
That's why that became a thing.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.280
So yeah, that should be fine.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.520
That's great.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.360
And then I had another looking forward kind of question

29:52.360 --> 29:56.240
is, with everything we see with container technology,

29:56.240 --> 29:58.560
cgroups and namespaces and just stuff that's

29:58.560 --> 30:01.320
just built into Linux now, do you ever look at that

30:01.320 --> 30:03.480
and think, maybe there's a future there for Bedrock

30:03.480 --> 30:05.520
to take advantage of some of that tech?

30:05.520 --> 30:06.720
People ask that a lot.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.680
But I strongly disagree.

30:09.680 --> 30:11.280
The issue there is all of those are

30:11.280 --> 30:13.600
designed around segregating things and keeping them

30:13.600 --> 30:15.560
separate, whereas the whole point of Bedrock

30:15.560 --> 30:17.920
is the opposite, is to make everything work together.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.800
So I've tried to do my due diligence

30:19.800 --> 30:22.240
to understand those technologies and to experiment with it

30:22.240 --> 30:22.860
and to see something.

30:22.860 --> 30:24.520
But I really couldn't actually find anything

30:24.520 --> 30:25.640
with anything on those lines that

30:25.640 --> 30:27.040
would be useful for Bedrock.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.120
I like that answer.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.800
I think I completely agree.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.440
It's like, this is what Bedrock's mission is,

30:32.440 --> 30:36.480
is to really kind of create one meta Linux distribution.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.440
And by separating it off into containers,

30:38.440 --> 30:40.320
it sort of would defeat the purpose of what

30:40.320 --> 30:41.400
you're trying to accomplish with.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.360
But I did see the question come in quite a bit,

30:43.360 --> 30:44.920
so I did want to get it out there.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.360
And then the last question, I know

30:46.360 --> 30:47.960
it's one that you get a lot, Paradigm,

30:47.960 --> 30:51.520
is where do you get off calling this thing a meta distribution?

30:51.520 --> 30:54.360
So if you define a Linux distribution

30:54.360 --> 30:57.680
as a project that distributes a Linux-based operating system,

30:57.680 --> 30:59.800
called a distro for short, there are

30:59.800 --> 31:03.280
a number of things that kind of fit in the broader distro space

31:03.280 --> 31:04.680
that aren't really distros.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.400
They don't fit that definition.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.960
What they tend to do is distribute some means

31:08.960 --> 31:11.200
that you can use to get a Linux-based operating system,

31:11.200 --> 31:14.120
even if they don't distribute the operating system itself.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.760
Gentoo is a good example here, where

31:15.760 --> 31:17.360
it distributes kind of like a framework

31:17.360 --> 31:19.040
to build your own distro.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.480
In fact, I didn't coin the term meta distribution.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.960
I found that on Gentoo's website.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.080
Another good example is Linux from Scratch,

31:26.080 --> 31:27.800
where they just distribute documentation.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.000
They don't even distribute any tooling

31:30.000 --> 31:32.680
to help you build your own Linux-based operating system.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.440
And so Bedrock kind of fits that pattern, where we're not

31:35.440 --> 31:37.240
actually distributing the operating system.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.960
We're distributing tooling to kind of build one yourself.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.520
Just unlike those other projects,

31:41.520 --> 31:44.120
we're letting you use the packages and parts

31:44.120 --> 31:45.680
of other distros to do that.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.040
Very good.

31:46.040 --> 31:47.200
We'll keep up the good work.

31:47.200 --> 31:51.280
You have remained dedicated to this project for years.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.880
And even today, before we got on the horn here,

31:53.880 --> 31:56.960
you were in your IRC room answering questions.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.000
And people aren't even all that polite always,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
which they should be.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.080
But sometimes, they're a little frustrated,

32:02.080 --> 32:04.160
and you're still in there.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.200
That's really impressive.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.360
So keep up the great work.

32:06.360 --> 32:10.520
And I think now, with how simple it is to get going and hijack

32:10.520 --> 32:12.360
an existing install, this is probably

32:12.360 --> 32:13.920
going to be one of my go-to tools.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.040
So thanks for all the great work, Paradigm.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.320
You're very welcome, and I'm happy to hear it.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.800
And what might be the most impressive thing about Bedrock

32:20.800 --> 32:23.400
is it doesn't feel like a hacky solution.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.720
No, it really doesn't.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.040
I mean, I do all kinds of weird stuff

32:27.040 --> 32:29.840
I shouldn't with containers, and VMs, and mounting stuff

32:29.840 --> 32:30.680
places.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.960
It did not feel like that.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.840
I mean, a lot of it's wrapped up in the burl on our Bedrock

32:34.840 --> 32:35.360
Linux.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.240
I don't know what you would call it.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.000
BRL is like the little command line tool

32:38.000 --> 32:39.520
to actually manage everything.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.560
And that's where you can see the delicate balance Bedrock has

32:42.560 --> 32:45.320
to strike between keeping things kind of isolated off

32:45.320 --> 32:47.680
on their own so that you can have an Arch system over here

32:47.680 --> 32:49.440
in the corner, but also making sure

32:49.440 --> 32:51.560
that Arch's package manager doesn't step

32:51.560 --> 32:53.040
on Debian's package manager.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.760
But if you're using a Debian tool,

32:54.760 --> 32:56.840
well, you might want to know about the themes, or the fonts,

32:56.840 --> 32:59.120
or be able to access the newest version of JQ

32:59.120 --> 33:01.080
that you installed over in Arch world.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.440
And that takes a lot to get right

33:03.440 --> 33:05.520
and to make it feel actually useful.

33:05.520 --> 33:08.360
Do you think we'll see this propagated a little bit more

33:08.360 --> 33:11.080
generally into some other distributions in the future?

33:11.080 --> 33:12.960
I know maybe it seems early now, but.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.920
I mean, it's been around for a while, though.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.880
And it hasn't really, you've seen solutions

33:16.880 --> 33:19.560
that kind of solve the problem Bedrock solves

33:19.560 --> 33:22.320
in their own sort of focused way.

33:22.320 --> 33:26.400
And I don't think it's really appealing to some distro makers.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.680
I don't think they want to own the whole thing, I think.

33:28.680 --> 33:31.800
It really does feel like there's definitely

33:31.800 --> 33:35.840
some shared spirit with things like Nix, I think.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.280
But Bedrock strikes me as something

33:37.280 --> 33:40.520
that has a somewhat limited audience, not in a bad way,

33:40.520 --> 33:42.880
but it's like a power user feature, right?

33:42.880 --> 33:45.680
It's made for us folks who love having a Linux system, who

33:45.680 --> 33:47.880
want to play with it, or who just, you know,

33:47.880 --> 33:49.040
I'm not someone who installs Ubuntu,

33:49.040 --> 33:50.440
doesn't configure it, and just runs.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.760
That's great that we can do that.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.440
If you want something custom and really

33:53.440 --> 33:56.480
to be able to make your Linux desktop super useful,

33:56.480 --> 33:57.920
Bedrock seems like a tool for you.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.760
And it does seem like it's attempting

33:59.760 --> 34:01.960
to solve a fundamental compromise you often

34:01.960 --> 34:02.600
have to make.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.440
Maybe you prefer distro X, but it

34:04.440 --> 34:06.480
doesn't have everything in its package repository

34:06.480 --> 34:08.200
that another distribution has.

34:08.200 --> 34:11.480
And you're kind of being offered a way to mix and match that.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.400
And I think the trickiest thing about adopting Bedrock

34:14.400 --> 34:17.560
is it has its own vernacular.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.240
You know, you have these stratas,

34:19.240 --> 34:23.640
which are kind of really like a collection of files

34:23.640 --> 34:24.440
and processes.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.520
And you have like these different languages,

34:26.520 --> 34:28.640
different terms for things that you have to learn.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.960
And so that is probably the biggest learning curve,

34:30.960 --> 34:33.640
is not managing it, not even setting it up,

34:33.640 --> 34:35.600
because it has a really fantastic tutorial.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.200
So the biggest learning curve is just

34:37.200 --> 34:38.560
learning what the different terms mean.

34:38.560 --> 34:39.900
And there's four or five key terms

34:39.900 --> 34:41.020
you really have to figure out.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.480
And you know, I think that's fair,

34:42.480 --> 34:45.360
because Bedrock's doing stuff that no one else is doing,

34:45.360 --> 34:45.860
right?

34:45.860 --> 34:48.480
I mean, it's one of the first meta distributions

34:48.480 --> 34:50.360
out there in this sense, at least.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.520
And so you've got to come up with some new names.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.040
Yep, yep, absolutely.

34:54.040 --> 34:58.400
And Paradigm, right now, I just checked during the chat.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.800
He's in his chat room over there right now,

35:00.800 --> 35:02.680
answering questions and chatting with people.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.320
So he's on Librarian Chat.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.880
And it's just pound bedrock or hashtag.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.160
I will say, I think Bedrock's going to stick around

35:09.160 --> 35:11.120
on at least some of my systems.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.640
The hijacking went pretty smoothly.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.840
I didn't feel a big, I wasn't worried about that.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.680
And at least maybe start with a couple of workstations

35:16.680 --> 35:18.080
that aren't in the critical path.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.300
But if I can just get all the AUR stuff,

35:20.300 --> 35:21.760
but still have it easy to install,

35:21.760 --> 35:24.040
you know, random devs I might need for work.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.500
Yeah, this could be the final piece

35:25.500 --> 35:27.800
that makes something like Fedora 34 stick for me,

35:27.800 --> 35:31.000
or CentOS Stream 9 in the future.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.240
Think about just, even if we just did CentOS Stream 9

35:33.240 --> 35:36.640
in the studio, and just a handful, a couple of packages

35:36.640 --> 35:39.440
that weren't available to us in CentOS's repo,

35:39.440 --> 35:41.840
or in Flatpak, or something, we could use Bedrock.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.560
And we could close that gap and use it in audio production.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.960
I mean, it has serious potential.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.380
And if you don't go crazy with it,

35:48.380 --> 35:50.800
I don't see why it wouldn't be sustainable.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.600
So yeah, it's a tool that we're definitely

35:52.600 --> 35:54.440
going to be using for a long time.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.160
Sorry, Paradigm.

35:55.160 --> 35:59.620
You might just see us in your IRC room more often pretty soon.

35:59.620 --> 36:01.440
I wanted to mention we have stickers

36:01.440 --> 36:03.420
for all of the active shows now.

36:03.420 --> 36:04.880
And how cool is this?

36:04.880 --> 36:06.280
Based on popular demand.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.800
I get to say that, because it's true.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.320
People love the stickers.

36:09.320 --> 36:11.680
You know, it was me being a dummy, really.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.080
I drug my feet at first, because it

36:14.080 --> 36:15.520
felt like it was a low effort thing

36:15.520 --> 36:18.600
to do to take the vector art for the MP3 albums

36:18.600 --> 36:19.840
and turn that into a sticker.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.360
I'm like, I can do better than that.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.160
It's not a custom new design or anything.

36:23.160 --> 36:23.960
Right.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.480
I didn't commission somebody to create.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.200
It's like, I can't do that.

36:27.200 --> 36:32.000
And then when Self-Hosted 50 landed, I realized, wait a minute.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.840
That's 50 releases of this album art.

36:33.840 --> 36:36.160
It's actually kind of awesome to have that as a sticker.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.740
And then because I have it as a vector,

36:37.740 --> 36:40.520
we can do cool high resolution, different sizes.

36:40.520 --> 36:45.120
So I busted out sticker artwork for all the active shows now.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.680
I realized that was the way to go.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.840
And they're awesome.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.240
I think it's actually perfect.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.800
And so they're all up at jupytergarage.com,

36:52.800 --> 36:54.280
as well as some new exclusive merch

36:54.280 --> 36:56.240
to celebrate Self-Hosted 50.

36:56.240 --> 36:59.280
And as always, our core contributors get a discount.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.520
So check the limited ad feed or live show

37:01.520 --> 37:03.800
feed for a note from me on your promo code.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.880
Or you can just go to the members download area

37:05.880 --> 37:06.640
and get the note.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.440
So you can use the promo code and take some money off

37:08.440 --> 37:10.260
when you go over to jupytergarage.com

37:10.260 --> 37:11.600
and get them stickers.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.320
I think they turned out great.

37:13.320 --> 37:17.200
And one of the stickers, there's a special plea

37:17.200 --> 37:18.520
from Wes Payne in there.

37:18.520 --> 37:19.640
But I won't say which one.

37:19.640 --> 37:21.480
You'll just have to go check the stickers and find out.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.120
I have been kidnapped.

37:24.120 --> 37:24.960
All right.

37:24.960 --> 37:28.880
All right, and with that, let's do a little bit of feedback.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.080
You want to take this one?

37:30.080 --> 37:33.480
Roxodus from Linux server IO writes in,

37:33.480 --> 37:35.360
just listen to LUP 4.16.

37:35.360 --> 37:39.160
And I'd like to clarify some things regarding web top.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.080
First, I just want to say that you brought up

37:41.080 --> 37:42.700
an interesting use case.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.160
And that's awesome.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.440
So hey, look at us continuing to abuse software.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.200
That's right.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.240
That's our thing.

37:48.240 --> 37:52.000
Regarding flavors, we also have fedora variants, nice,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.160
with mostly the same VMs.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.680
Arch may also be in the works.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.360
Oh.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.160
That would be killer.

37:58.160 --> 37:58.780
That would.

37:58.780 --> 38:00.000
Either one would be great.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.440
You remember web top is that project from Linux server

38:02.440 --> 38:04.900
that lets you run a Linux desktop in a container.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.560
You connect to it remotely with your web browser.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.360
Yeah, exactly.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.040
And we had a lot of fun playing with it.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.440
But did definitely have some questions

38:10.440 --> 38:12.760
because it's a lot of components that are all integrated

38:12.760 --> 38:13.240
together.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.640
And one thing we were wondering was, well, Chris,

38:15.640 --> 38:17.920
you noticed that default user was named ABC.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.120
And I don't think you love that.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.920
You just want it to be called Chris, I assume.

38:20.920 --> 38:21.680
Yeah.

38:21.680 --> 38:24.640
Well, as for ABC, unfortunately, at the moment,

38:24.640 --> 38:27.640
it's fairly relied on as it's kind of the only constant they

38:27.640 --> 38:29.440
have when trying to manage permissions in there.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.980
And I will say, they're doing good work here,

38:30.980 --> 38:33.140
as Linux server always does, to try to make things secure,

38:33.140 --> 38:34.680
not just leave it a big old security hole.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.360
So I get that you probably want to set some user permissions.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.560
What they're doing is really tricky.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.120
And that is the compromise you have to make.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.840
And so that's why I think my thought was put it

38:42.840 --> 38:44.920
behind WireGuard or put it behind a VPN.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.560
Don't just put it right out on the net.

38:46.560 --> 38:47.920
Yeah, definitely a consideration you

38:47.920 --> 38:49.800
want to make when running software like this.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.760
And just a moment to say thank you to our friends

38:51.760 --> 38:52.760
at a Cloud Guru.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.920
They have a SystemD management course for Linux.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.960
This course is designed to give you a deep dive

38:57.960 --> 39:01.800
into the topic of SystemD, the most widely used service

39:01.800 --> 39:04.120
management scheme in Linux out there.

39:04.120 --> 39:07.280
The course is really just going to help you demystify SystemD

39:07.280 --> 39:09.080
and go beyond just kind of muddling through it

39:09.080 --> 39:11.120
and getting things done to actually understanding

39:11.120 --> 39:13.000
how all the different components work together,

39:13.000 --> 39:15.640
how to configure, manage, and monitor and troubleshoot

39:15.640 --> 39:16.440
SystemD.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.840
We'll have a link in the show notes for this course,

39:18.840 --> 39:20.360
or you can go to cloudguru.com.

39:20.360 --> 39:25.640
Well, let's do a little bit of housekeeping around here.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.720
It has gotten awfully filthy, probably Brent's fault.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.160
Hey, now.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.160
I want to mention you can join the conversation

39:32.160 --> 39:35.640
and check in with the team over on our Telegram channel.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.280
That's at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

39:37.280 --> 39:40.280
telegram, and we are always looking for your feedback,

39:40.280 --> 39:43.040
your ideas, suggestions, anything you

39:43.040 --> 39:46.000
want to send us for the show linuxunplugged.com slash

39:46.000 --> 39:46.920
contact.

39:46.920 --> 39:49.480
Our meetups, which include the Denver and Salt Lake City

39:49.480 --> 39:52.240
meetups, are at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

39:52.240 --> 39:53.280
meetup.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.320
And we do have the LoveLog I want to mention.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.480
And Minimac, it sounds like there's

39:56.480 --> 39:57.800
a lot going on these days.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.000
Yeah, thank you, Chris.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.440
So all I can tell you that the LoveLog community is doing fine

40:02.440 --> 40:05.200
every Sunday on Mumble, and it's really great to see

40:05.200 --> 40:07.280
a lot of people from all over the world.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.800
I can tell you, we have new listeners or new participants

40:10.800 --> 40:13.040
joining us from the Philippines and Australia.

40:13.040 --> 40:16.920
And you have to imagine, for them, it's early in the morning.

40:16.920 --> 40:20.160
So it's also nice, by the way, to see Wes, Poppy, or you

40:20.160 --> 40:20.920
from time to time.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.120
So thank you all.

40:23.120 --> 40:26.200
The cool thing is in LoveLog, everything can happen.

40:26.200 --> 40:29.680
Like last Sunday, we had an online tutorial

40:29.680 --> 40:32.560
for user kernel on his PinePhone.

40:32.560 --> 40:35.360
And that ended up in a git commit for the J package

40:35.360 --> 40:36.720
on Manjaro.

40:36.720 --> 40:40.160
But as Colonel is here, he can talk about this story, Colonel.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.480
Yeah, so I've been playing with the PinePhone

40:42.480 --> 40:47.880
with the Manjaro base image with Plasma Mobile on top.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.480
And I wanted to install something

40:49.480 --> 40:53.240
that wasn't in the Manjaro ARM repos, which then, of course,

40:53.240 --> 40:54.760
means AUR.

40:54.760 --> 40:59.560
Yay is the default arch helper installed for Manjaro ARM.

40:59.560 --> 41:02.560
However, when you install it, it didn't

41:02.560 --> 41:04.960
install the development packages,

41:04.960 --> 41:07.280
which is required for AUR.

41:07.280 --> 41:11.760
Well, one of the maintainers for the Manjaro ARM repo

41:11.760 --> 41:15.200
was there in LoveLog, and he made that a dependency.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.640
And now, when you install Yay, it automatically

41:17.640 --> 41:18.600
installs that.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.080
Well, that sounds fascinating.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.320
Sounds like if you tune in at LoveLog on Sundays,

41:23.320 --> 41:25.280
there always could be some geeky stuff going down.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.080
We have the time at jupitabroadcasting.com

41:27.080 --> 41:30.800
slash calendar, and the mumble info at linuxunplug.com

41:30.800 --> 41:31.560
slash mumble.

41:31.560 --> 41:37.600
So as I hit the road, I will be tracking my trip

41:37.600 --> 41:40.920
at colonytracker.live, and I invite you to follow me there.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.840
And if you are on the road in my area,

41:42.840 --> 41:44.600
if you're in that neck of the woods,

41:44.600 --> 41:46.600
we're going to have a link that you can click on

41:46.600 --> 41:49.560
at colonytracker.live to start a meetup with me,

41:49.560 --> 41:51.400
a little micro meetup, even if it's just you.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.240
You want to hang out?

41:52.240 --> 41:53.840
Maybe we'll talk about Linux.

41:53.840 --> 41:54.360
I don't know.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.440
Micro meetup?

41:55.440 --> 41:58.200
Do you have any preferred micro meetup location types?

41:58.200 --> 42:00.840
Easy to accommodate a large vehicle.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.480
So I created this form for people

42:02.480 --> 42:04.040
to fill out so I can kind of like try

42:04.040 --> 42:05.360
to suss that information out.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.120
So that way we have like a landing spot for dupes.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.440
Chris also doesn't mind proximity to chicken wings.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.200
No, that's true.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.240
And then what I'll do is I'll send Brent in to suss him out,

42:13.240 --> 42:14.680
you know, like he'll head in first.

42:14.680 --> 42:17.560
I'm really looking for lakeside or even rivers will do.

42:17.560 --> 42:19.080
Sure, yeah.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.960
Anywhere that's got drinks would be nice too.

42:20.960 --> 42:21.920
Why not?

42:21.920 --> 42:25.640
Mr. Payne, we have a last minute pic coming into the show.

42:25.640 --> 42:27.600
I'm being told by the control room

42:27.600 --> 42:29.560
that this could be really useful for people that

42:29.560 --> 42:31.200
maybe have duplicate images.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.080
Yes, indeed.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.080
I thought we might have something visual inspired

42:34.080 --> 42:37.880
since we've got photographer Brent in the house over here.

42:37.880 --> 42:38.880
OK, so it's pretty easy.

42:38.880 --> 42:41.760
There's lots of great Linux command line tools out there,

42:41.760 --> 42:44.080
or not command line even, to go filter duplicates

42:44.080 --> 42:45.920
if it's just the same hash of the file.

42:45.920 --> 42:46.720
That makes sense.

42:46.720 --> 42:49.000
It's pretty easy to go find an actual duplicate.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.300
But what if you are someone doing a lot of visual things?

42:51.300 --> 42:53.120
Maybe, honestly, this comes up for me

42:53.120 --> 42:55.680
because I'm using Photopea and downloading a bunch of copies

42:55.680 --> 42:56.800
where I've made modifications.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.480
Or just recently, I was making a GIF to embarrass a friend.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.240
And so I had a whole bunch of similar files.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.480
I didn't need all of them, right?

43:02.480 --> 43:03.880
But they weren't exactly the same.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.440
They were saved different times, exported

43:05.440 --> 43:07.600
different JPEG resolutions or something.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.480
That is where image dupes come in,

43:09.480 --> 43:12.560
because it can find near duplicate images

43:12.560 --> 43:14.800
based on a perceptual hash.

43:14.800 --> 43:18.000
So it uses Python and some machine learning type

43:18.000 --> 43:20.760
algorithms to try to give a score perceptually

43:20.760 --> 43:22.800
based on what the image looks like,

43:22.800 --> 43:24.400
not just the bits in the file.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.800
Boy, it gives a whole new meaning to perceptual hash,

43:26.800 --> 43:28.920
doesn't it?

43:28.920 --> 43:30.200
Wow, that's awesome.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.440
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

43:31.440 --> 43:32.320
I could see that.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.520
Could be really useful just to run over my library.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.320
I wonder if we would find slight crop variations and stuff.

43:37.320 --> 43:38.120
That's a good question.

43:38.120 --> 43:38.880
We'll just have to try.

43:38.880 --> 43:39.740
We'll have to try and find out.

43:39.740 --> 43:42.280
Yeah, it was a late last minute addition to the show.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.820
And we thought that'd be a good one

43:43.820 --> 43:45.640
to mention, because like Wes said,

43:45.640 --> 43:47.120
that photographer guy is here.

43:47.120 --> 43:47.840
Hey, you know what, though?

43:47.840 --> 43:49.400
Even though we're on the road, the show

43:49.400 --> 43:50.560
is still going to be live.

43:50.560 --> 43:53.160
Somehow, I suspect, you can always

43:53.160 --> 43:55.440
follow at Linux Unplugged or at Jupyter Signal

43:55.440 --> 43:58.360
to get live information, or go to the calendar page

43:58.360 --> 44:00.400
at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.800
In fact, the entire slate of shows is going to continue on.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.720
We're going to attempt to produce all of them

44:04.720 --> 44:07.720
from the road, I say, with some trepidation.

44:07.720 --> 44:09.800
And you, dear audience, get to find out how

44:09.800 --> 44:11.320
that goes right along with us.

44:11.320 --> 44:11.820
Yeah.

44:11.820 --> 44:14.280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

44:14.280 --> 44:17.040
Linux Action News episode 200 just landed this week.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.400
It sure did, didn't it?

44:18.400 --> 44:21.320
And this was a fun one, because through a series of rabbit

44:21.320 --> 44:22.760
holes that Wes and I found ourselves

44:22.760 --> 44:24.920
going into researching news items,

44:24.920 --> 44:28.840
we came into this story about how big hyperscaler companies

44:28.840 --> 44:32.560
are building and loading and buying out

44:32.560 --> 44:34.160
international cable links.

44:34.160 --> 44:36.880
And the scale of it is unbelievable.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.680
Just hundreds of terabits of information

44:38.680 --> 44:39.480
flowing per second.

44:39.480 --> 44:39.980
Yeah.

44:39.980 --> 44:43.560
And so we report on what we found in Linux Action News 200.

44:43.560 --> 44:45.280
So if you haven't heard that one yet,

44:45.280 --> 44:48.120
it's a great time to jump in on LAN or send it to a friend.

44:48.120 --> 44:51.600
That's linuxactionnews.com slash 200.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.500
Brent, thank you for joining us for a special episode.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.320
Are you ready to get crammed into Lady Joops?

44:56.320 --> 44:58.920
Well, I like small spaces, so I think we'll be OK.

44:58.920 --> 44:59.960
But who knows?

44:59.960 --> 45:01.580
We're going to have to see how it goes.

45:01.580 --> 45:03.040
You're already helping me organize, though.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.240
Brent has me like every piece of production equipment

45:05.240 --> 45:05.880
that's got to go.

45:05.880 --> 45:08.200
It goes right now on the coffee table in the studio.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.400
Everything that's got to go goes on the table.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.200
At least once an hour since I've landed here,

45:13.200 --> 45:15.520
we've noticed like, oh, we've got to remember to bring this.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.120
Oh, we've got to remember to bring this.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.160
Let's put this on the table.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.280
If it's not plugged in right now and making this show happen,

45:20.280 --> 45:21.240
then it's on the table.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.960
That's pretty much it.

45:22.960 --> 45:26.360
Then we will be live on Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern,

45:26.360 --> 45:28.080
over at jblive.tv.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.360
See you next week.

45:29.360 --> 45:31.760
Same bad time, same bad station.

45:31.760 --> 45:33.720
And links to everything we talked about today,

45:33.720 --> 45:37.360
that's over at linuxunplugged.com slash 417.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.760
Dah!

45:38.760 --> 45:40.360
That's my.com.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.560
That's how I say.com now.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.600
It's kind of pirate-like.

45:42.600 --> 45:43.640
It's very efficient.

45:43.640 --> 45:46.160
Yeah, I think as I get older, I want

45:46.160 --> 45:49.080
to go more towards the pirate direction, just in general.

45:49.080 --> 45:50.800
Less prospector, more pirate now?

45:50.800 --> 45:51.680
Yeah, yeah.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.080
I've done the prospector thing.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.120
I think pirate's where it's at.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.280
Next step, peg leg.

45:55.280 --> 45:58.000
Yarr!

45:58.000 --> 46:00.080
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

46:00.080 --> 46:01.600
of the Unplugged program.

46:01.600 --> 46:03.680
We'd love to hear from you, linuxunplugged.com slash

46:03.680 --> 46:04.200
contact.

46:04.200 --> 46:07.000
But either that or not, even if you don't go there,

46:07.000 --> 46:08.280
if you just listen, you know what?

46:08.280 --> 46:09.520
We appreciate it.

46:09.520 --> 46:10.360
We appreciate it.

46:10.360 --> 46:11.520
We'll see you next Tuesday!

46:11.520 --> 46:16.520
Thanks so much for tuning in.

46:42.480 --> 46:46.600
Yes, it is hammer time.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.240
Feels actually like dance time.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.960
I see all of us grooving in the studio here.

46:49.960 --> 46:50.440
We are.

46:50.440 --> 46:51.600
Doesn't matter how many times we hear it,

46:51.600 --> 46:53.040
we still groove to it.

46:53.040 --> 46:55.480
So how have I have how the mighty have fallen?

46:55.480 --> 46:58.160
I have gone from the guy that could record four or five

46:58.160 --> 47:01.480
beers tasties in a row, to I have one Canadian six

47:01.480 --> 47:04.600
and a half ABV, and I can barely get through the outro.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.400
It's that Canadian water they brew with it.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.400
Is that what it is?

47:07.400 --> 47:07.920
Jeez.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.280
Fresh from the Canadian Rockies.

47:09.280 --> 47:10.800
Tell you what, it is actually.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.360
Oh, man, we're going to be going over the Rockies.

47:12.360 --> 47:12.920
I know.

47:12.920 --> 47:14.160
It seemed appropriate.

47:14.160 --> 47:15.480
And the damn Cascades.

47:15.480 --> 47:16.560
No, Chris, you know what?

47:16.560 --> 47:19.480
It's because you're not used to hanging out with people

47:19.480 --> 47:21.600
anymore, and it tired you out.

47:21.600 --> 47:22.840
And it's hot.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.840
During the interview, we had the air conditioner

47:24.840 --> 47:27.920
going, but it's like you get like five minutes of reprieve,

47:27.920 --> 47:29.400
and then it's hot again.

47:29.400 --> 47:30.760
Hot studio, cold beer.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.640
And it's only going to get worse because I'm

47:32.640 --> 47:33.760
driving into the heat.

47:33.760 --> 47:44.520
So it's only going to get worse.
