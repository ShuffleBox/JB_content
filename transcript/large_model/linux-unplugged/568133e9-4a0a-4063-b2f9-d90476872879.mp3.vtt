00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Okay, Mr. Colonel Linux. This is a quiz for you, sir. Can you place this tune?

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Okay, that's all you get so far. Then I'll give you more of a hint.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
It's a clip from a sound board in the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
Okay, all right. Well, technically correct, but not the actual accurate answer. Don't look at my screen. I will continue on.

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
Now, Wes, you recognize what this is, right?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
I do.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Yeah, I thought so.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Must be Star Trek, then.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.000
Uh-uh. Nope, nope.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
Come on, nobody in the chat room knows what this is? Really?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Nope.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Really? Hmm. All right, I'm going to give you one more hint, one more hint, one more hint.

00:53.000 --> 01:14.000
All right, Wes. What is it, Wes? What is it? What is it? Let us know, Wes. Give us the big reveal. What are we listening to?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Are you ready? Are you ready?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I don't know.

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
It is, ladies and gentlemen, the original Star Fox intro.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Ah.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Oh, North Ranger got it.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, I got it.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Star Fox. Okay, so I love Star Fox.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I love Star Fox, too.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
I actually saw a Star Fox thing at Linux Fest Northwest, surprisingly enough, but anyways, that's not what we're here to talk about.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
I love this. You know, this is a different kind of open source. This is an intellectual kind of open source.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
A fan-made Star Fox cartoon recalls the best of 70s sci-fi animation, and you should watch it really before it gets taken down.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
It is a Star Fox cartoon, a fox in space, and if you liked the old Star Fox show, they have a big disclaimer that we're not doing this for profit.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
We swear we're not doing this for profit. We swear.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
You guys should just turn around and leave because you do not want to piss off my uncle.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, just who I needed to see. Star Wolf.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Star Wolf.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
This gives me happening.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
All your friends are out of the game, Wolf. Don't make me shoot you down.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
This is so great.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
It really is great.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
If you ever watched or played Star Wars, I should say, or Star Fox, this is for you.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
This is really cool. I have a link in the show notes, and one of those things that's probably going to get pulled down really soon.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Right away.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, so if you want to enjoy it, you got to kind of be a fast mover.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Just YouTube DL that right now.

02:31.000 --> 02:48.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 142 for April 26, 2016.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's had such mush.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
It's been swapping drives while the computers are still powered. That's legit.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
My name is Chris.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
My name is Wes.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Wes, welcome to the post-Linux Fest Northwest hangover.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Ooh, it's a doozy.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Oh, man. I don't know how, but somehow we're going to have a great show for you today.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Somehow. We will persevere. We're going to talk about it.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, don't leave. Stay here.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Stay here. Don't worry.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
It's worth it.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah, we got some interesting Firefox updates coming towards you.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Some good reports of the new Ubuntu tablet.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Of course, the clips you never got to see in Linux Action Show from Linux Fest Northwest.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
The good stuff.

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
As well as a few stories, a few build projects gone awry. Perhaps some beer will be spilt.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
And, as always, we'll update you on some of our favorite open source projects.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
A lot of really fun things to cover, so you know what we've got to do, Wes.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
We've got to focus. We've got to harness the power of the internet and bring in our virtual lug.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Hello, everyone.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Hey, guys.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Hello, guys.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
So, Wes and I might be a little punchy. My mouth may not work very well today.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
None of those things should be held against us.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
We need your help.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah, because we're going to be leaning on you guys because I've got to tell you,

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
things have gotten so bad around the JV1 studios because of total exhaustion from Linux Fest Northwest

04:09.000 --> 04:17.000
that just mere moments ago, we decided we've had too many things frustrate us.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
And both Noah and I were just totally done with Ubuntu 16.04.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
And I have it on this Apollo that I've been keeping. I was going to keep it in Linux Action Show.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
I said I'm going to stick with this.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
That was a pretty big step for you.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah. And we're going to give you our full take towards the end of the show.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
So those of you who don't really care, don't worry. We won't bore with you at the top here.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
But to give you an indication of how mush our heads are, but yet we're still trying to push through,

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm about to play something for you that is not the first time this happened this weekend.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Not the second time this happened this weekend.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
But perhaps the third time this weekend that we had to rebuild a machine, swap drives out,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
and load a new OS, and all three times.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
This is agonizing.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
We had to do it more than three times.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
But all the three times I'm thinking of, we were in such a rush,

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
we actually forgot to turn the computers off first.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
So I'm going to play a little bit of this clip that Mr. Kernel Linux grabbed this morning.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
You think you can log in?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
No.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
We'll see.

05:18.000 --> 05:25.000
So right here you are seeing this is my Apollo after I've closed the lid like 20 minutes ago,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
walked out, came back into the studio, and didn't realize that I hadn't turned it off.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
This is a common problem we had.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
So it's just sitting there suspended.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
I flipped the laptop over, started taking the screws out of the bottom, pulled the plate off,

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
pulled out both hard drives, swapped out the Ubuntu drives with two blank drives, powered it back on,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
and it actually woke up, Wes.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And here is the login manager working.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
It's kind of impressive.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Oh, you just got the wrong password.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
Maybe you should drop down to a terminal.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
There we go.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Now let's see if we can log in.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Oh, we're starting to get errors.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
We're starting to get I.O. errors.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Uh-oh.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Extended four error.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I know there's coming in across the board, sir.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I block zero, can't find I block zero.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I know there, sir.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
So much for being able to run completely out of RAM.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Unable to read.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I block zero.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Why are you running your OS on a RAM disk, Chris?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Oh, man.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Massive turbulence.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Initiating emergency reboot sequence.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Uh-oh.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Connection refused.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Unable to activate service.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Oh, no.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
We're going down.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
So that was me this morning.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
Now I just want to give you a taste of what my nights are like.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
See, I usually go to bed a little bit later than I like to.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Naturally.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Because they're hard days.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
And every single day since NOAA got in town, every single day there has been major decisions

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
to make that have serious long-term ramifications about production and the network, and it's

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
just been like...

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
There are no off days.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
It is exhausting.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
It is exhausting.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.200
But it's been even worse for NOAA and, say, Rekai, because they're the ones staying up

07:12.200 --> 07:16.800
to all hours of the night actually implementing some of these changes.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.640
And so this was about a 2 a.m. call that I got.

07:20.640 --> 07:25.000
And I should point out, too, that this was stuff that we did not intend to be on the

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
air, per se.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Oh, yeah.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Right.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
But we're going to let it on the air anyway.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
This is the unplugged show.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.360
There will be some F-bombs about a minute into this.

07:33.360 --> 07:34.360
Don't worry.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.360
They're not too bad.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.360
But hold on.

07:36.360 --> 07:40.280
It's a late-night call that I got that NOAA sent me that I thought I'd share with you

07:40.280 --> 07:43.000
guys because, yeah, this was never supposed to be aired, but this gives you a little idea

07:43.000 --> 07:48.640
of the state of mind that everybody was in after working until about 4 a.m., 5 a.m. for

07:48.640 --> 07:50.160
about six, seven days straight.

07:50.160 --> 07:51.160
Oh, wait.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.160
Not this one.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.160
That's the last one.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.160
Hold on a second.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.160
Hold on.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.920
And wait for it.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.160
I don't even see it in here.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.920
Oh, I don't even see it in here.

07:59.920 --> 08:00.920
Maybe I'm totally...

08:00.920 --> 08:03.280
My head is too tired.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.280
But I bet I'll come up to it.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.480
I bet I'll find it in a little bit.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.740
I bet I'll find it in a little bit.

08:06.740 --> 08:07.740
Here we go.

08:07.740 --> 08:08.740
I just found it.

08:08.740 --> 08:10.160
Oh, wait a minute.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
That's what I did.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.160
See, I am tired.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.920
I mislabeled the eclipse.

08:13.920 --> 08:14.920
Oh, well.

08:14.920 --> 08:15.920
Woe is me.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.920
I think I had...

08:16.920 --> 08:17.920
You know what, Mr. NOAA?

08:17.920 --> 08:18.920
I think I'm getting a little bit of feedback.

08:18.920 --> 08:24.600
I think I'm hearing a little bit of goodness come through on your speakers there or something.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.600
So, yeah.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.600
There we go.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.600
Hey, I found it.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.600
Here.

08:28.600 --> 08:29.600
I'm going to play it for you.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
Are you ready?

08:30.600 --> 08:31.600
Okay.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
This is...

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
Now, just be warned.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.600
But, yeah.

08:34.600 --> 08:38.720
1.57 a.m. precise is when this came into me here.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.880
And now I'm going to play it for you.

08:40.880 --> 08:41.880
Yeah.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.840
Hop on the other side.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.840
Hi Topher.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.840
Chris Topher.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.840
Hi.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
Hi.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.840
So, it's really late.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.840
Like, super.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.840
That's beard.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
Hi, beard.

08:51.840 --> 08:56.120
I like how laying on your shoulder just makes me go forget.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.200
So we're all exceedingly tired.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.200
Crazy tired.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
Crazy tired.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.080
I had to go get some water because I drank the Coke.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.080
That rhymes with tired.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.680
But we fixed.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.360
We fixed your fucking RDMP stream.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.360
So now...

09:12.360 --> 09:13.360
Kinda.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.360
What do you mean, kind of?

09:14.360 --> 09:15.360
I thought you said it was...

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
YouTube doesn't completely work.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.360
Because I'll start as a bitch.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.360
Right.

09:18.360 --> 09:19.960
You have to restart it manually.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.480
But you're a smart guy.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.480
So you can do that.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.800
But we'll fix it so you don't have to do that.

09:24.800 --> 09:25.800
Beard will fix it.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.800
I will not fix it.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.800
Because I don't...

09:27.800 --> 09:30.800
I'll fix it by not using Ubuntu.

09:30.800 --> 09:37.200
Beard, that does not seem smart.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.200
So anyway...

09:38.200 --> 09:39.600
And I transcoded all your files.

09:39.600 --> 09:40.600
Yeah.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.600
He did good.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
That boy...

09:42.600 --> 09:43.600
In other words, he's useless.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
No.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
Useless out of the...

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
No, but...

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
So listen to me now.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.880
SatCom 1 is a go.

09:48.880 --> 09:49.880
And it is working.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.680
SatCom 2 is kind of half a go.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.680
It's half a go.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
Your personal rig?

09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
Fucked.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Totally.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
Oh yeah.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
Oh yeah.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
So this...

09:58.680 --> 10:00.360
This thing.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.360
You get to play with that.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.360
When you...

10:02.360 --> 10:03.360
Fucked out of 10.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.360
Fucked out of 10.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.720
I'm actually fucked out of like 150.

10:06.720 --> 10:07.720
We try.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.720
I don't know.

10:08.720 --> 10:12.640
It's that hardware works, but I can't install your stupid AnderGhost.

10:12.640 --> 10:13.640
So...

10:13.640 --> 10:14.640
Turns out...

10:14.640 --> 10:15.640
MVME drives.

10:15.640 --> 10:16.640
MVME drives out of 10.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.640
They fucking suck.

10:17.640 --> 10:22.360
If we put it on the SSD, it'll work just fine.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.160
But I don't know what the fuck is going on.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.720
Might have to buy a plane ticket or something.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.720
Maybe that's what we'll do.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.720
Okay.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.360
So I just wanted to tell you how hard we worked and how fucking tired we are.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.840
Which I'm here to know at 2 o'clock.

10:34.840 --> 10:35.840
Yes, but I...

10:35.840 --> 10:37.320
How much sleep did you get last night?

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
Not much.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.680
And I got like two out of three hours.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.680
How...

10:41.680 --> 10:42.680
You're...

10:42.680 --> 10:43.680
You're in a fucking good sleep schedule.

10:43.680 --> 10:44.680
Yeah.

10:44.680 --> 10:45.680
Yeah.

10:45.680 --> 10:46.680
But...

10:46.680 --> 10:47.680
He's very cold, though.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.840
I've hit my limit of how late I can stay up.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.040
So I'm going to bed.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.640
And just to let you know, we stayed up.

10:53.640 --> 10:54.640
And fixed your shirt.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.640
Hopefully it works.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.640
Turn the heat off so you don't keep them up all night.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.640
Oh yeah.

10:58.640 --> 10:59.640
Turn the heat up or off.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.640
We're going to freeze.

11:00.640 --> 11:01.640
And then, after he gets this working, he decides to kiss the phone.

11:01.640 --> 11:02.640
Good night.

11:02.640 --> 11:03.640
Oh, that's adorable.

11:03.640 --> 11:04.640
Oh, it didn't shut off.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.640
That was really awkward.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.640
Okay, you try it.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.640
Okay.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.640
Nighty night.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.640
Here, hold on.

11:09.640 --> 11:10.640
All right, Brown Bear.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.640
How much had you drank before you went to bed?

11:11.640 --> 11:30.000
Zero.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.080
I have had no drugs.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.280
I have had no alcohol.

11:32.280 --> 11:37.180
It is literally just five consecutive nights, six consecutive nights of no, like, one to

11:37.180 --> 11:38.180
two hours of sleep.

11:38.180 --> 11:39.180
And you just, you hit a limit.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.320
And then, all of a sudden, like, you get so tired.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.720
And it's just, like, simple things.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.640
Like, somebody would say something to me, and I would just completely forget about it,

11:45.640 --> 11:46.640
like, 30 seconds later.

11:46.640 --> 11:47.640
I had no recollection of it.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.920
I just switched the whole hard drive and the computer, and I have zero recollection of

11:49.920 --> 11:50.920
doing it.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.880
It's amazing that everything still works.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.880
Yeah, really.

11:53.880 --> 11:57.400
Yeah, literally, he swapped out a hard drive and a machine, totally forgot about it.

11:57.400 --> 12:01.420
So you kind of teased it there real quick.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.920
Why don't you tell the people what the heck SatCom 1 and SatCom 2 is, how the heck they

12:04.920 --> 12:07.440
run Linux, and why it's so damn awesome now?

12:07.440 --> 12:14.200
So basically, we are trying to expedite the flow of streams and also create a way that

12:14.200 --> 12:20.360
not one system is so heavily reliant with problematic internet.

12:20.360 --> 12:25.280
And so basically, we are sending a single stream up to DigitalOcean to JBSatCom 1.

12:25.280 --> 12:29.480
And SatCom 1 then distributes those streams to all of the various places like Ustream

12:29.480 --> 12:31.780
and ScaleEngine and whatnot.

12:31.780 --> 12:36.560
And then, the other thing we've done is we, SatCom 1 also sends a stream to SatCom 2.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.140
And SatCom 2 then connects in with YouTube.

12:39.140 --> 12:41.640
So we have a YouTube live page now.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.460
And you will have the ability, I'm doing it right now, but you'll eventually have the

12:44.460 --> 12:48.920
ability to, from the chat room, start and stop SatCom 2 to bring that live stream up

12:48.920 --> 12:49.920
and down.

12:49.920 --> 12:53.880
Yeah, using JBot, which is very cool.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.160
So one of the things about this trip is, and I think we should probably talk about this

12:58.160 --> 13:04.120
almost in its own dedicated thing, but these are all Linux rigs being powered by Linux

13:04.120 --> 13:07.160
machines running OBS here in the studio.

13:07.160 --> 13:11.920
We're now able to, this is probably doesn't seem like a big deal to most people, but it's

13:11.920 --> 13:15.660
a big personal thing for me because it was always a polished thing.

13:15.660 --> 13:20.160
We're now able to switch from reruns on the live stream to live shows without any interruption

13:20.160 --> 13:21.160
in the stream.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.160
That is really nice.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.040
We can take equipment offline behind the scenes and all that kind of stuff.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.400
And we'll also soon be able to have stream recordings and whatnot.

13:26.400 --> 13:30.440
It's really like a true 24-7 live stream, which would be a big goodness.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.440
Yeah.

13:31.440 --> 13:36.400
So what we did to work around some Comcast issues, and really, if you think about it,

13:36.400 --> 13:41.000
this is so perfect, is we set up a droplet on DigitalOcean, which is, of course, a sponsor

13:41.000 --> 13:42.440
here on Linux Unplugged.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.440
Two droplets.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.440
Oh.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.440
One that's like a big rig.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.320
Like if you go over to digitalocean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you'll get

13:48.320 --> 13:50.480
a $10 credit and you can try out some of these rigs for free.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.040
They even have hourly pricing, so you get like the $5 you can try it out.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
I love that hourly pricing.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.040
Yeah.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
Yeah, I do.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.880
I decided, I went for one of my biggest droplets yet.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.880
Ooh, how big?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.280
Yeah, I got a $40 a month droplet.

14:00.280 --> 14:05.000
I get four gigabytes of RAM, a two-core processor, 60-gigabyte SSD, and four terabytes of transfer.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Nice.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.560
Now, this thing's going out to Ustream.tv, Scale Engine, YouTube Live, right?

14:09.560 --> 14:12.680
You got all these, and the audio stream, and we want to add more.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.400
So I wanted something with a lot of processor power.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.400
Ooh.

14:15.400 --> 14:19.440
What was really cool, though, is we started at the $5 droplet as we just tested the theory.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.440
Right.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.920
And then we just incremented it up as we needed it.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.480
It is so nice.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.720
And we're going to take advantage, so Noah mentioned that we'd be starting and stopping

14:26.720 --> 14:30.520
the live stream by using a bot in our IRC chat room.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.600
It's a really sweet API they have to do this.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.080
So we'd be using an IRC bot.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.640
We turn droplets on and off.

14:36.640 --> 14:37.640
Oh, that's slick.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.640
Right?

14:38.640 --> 14:40.320
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code D01PLUG.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
They start at $5 a month.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.920
You get 512 megabytes of RAM, one blazing fast CPU, 20 gigabytes of SSD, and a terabyte

14:45.920 --> 14:51.060
of transfer, because they all SSDs, y'all, and they have super fast rigs, all the different

14:51.060 --> 14:56.200
Linux size you'd want, Core OS, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, of course.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.520
They also have free BSD.

14:57.520 --> 15:01.520
They have data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, and

15:01.520 --> 15:02.520
Germany.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
Just pick whatever makes the most sense.

15:03.520 --> 15:09.080
They have a brilliant interface, really good stuff, really great dashboard.

15:09.080 --> 15:15.760
It's made like, for example, so Noah could just manage these as droplets with no effort.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.760
As I'm setting all these things up, I can just check his SSH keys, and they get added

15:19.760 --> 15:22.160
as the droplet gets created, and he has login.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.160
He's good to go.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.160
So easy.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.160
I love DigitalOcean.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.160
You will love it, too.

15:26.160 --> 15:30.680
Use the promo code DEOUNPLUGGED, one word lowercase, and support this show, and get

15:30.680 --> 15:32.720
yourself a $10 credit, and go try them out.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.800
They have the great interface.

15:33.800 --> 15:39.140
They have great guides and tutorials, super, super, super good documentation, and now they're

15:39.140 --> 15:41.040
just running even more of our infrastructure.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.280
When we want a Linux server on demand, this is where we go.

15:43.280 --> 15:49.720
With great bandwidth, great connectivity, DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DEOUNPLUGGED.

15:49.720 --> 15:54.600
Before we get into the Firefox news, I should mention that Wes did bring us some bruskies,

15:54.600 --> 15:57.520
as has been tradition for quite a while now, and one that I love.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.040
I'm not going to complain.

15:59.040 --> 16:02.520
And did you know that this is Alasian's flagship beer?

16:02.520 --> 16:03.520
Alasian.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
Alasian.

16:04.520 --> 16:05.520
This is Alasian, or whatever you call them.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.520
Aslan?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.520
I don't know.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.520
Aslan, I believe.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.520
Not Aslan, huh?

16:09.520 --> 16:12.040
This is their flagship beers, one of them, the Batch 15 IPA.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.400
So let's go ahead and... A medium body, citrusy, and unfiltered.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.400
What are you thinking?

16:17.400 --> 16:18.900
Have you been drinking this?

16:18.900 --> 16:19.900
Another Northwest brew.

16:19.900 --> 16:24.480
This is actually, speaking of Linux Fest Northwest from Bellingham, this beer is from

16:24.480 --> 16:25.480
Bellingham.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.480
It sure is.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.480
Brewed in Bellingham, Washington.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.480
With 7% ABV.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.480
That's not bad.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.480
Yeah.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.480
It's pretty good.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.480
Are you enjoying it?

16:32.480 --> 16:33.480
Yeah.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.320
It's hoppy, but it's not too hoppy.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.680
As it finishes there, you want more, but it's not...

16:37.680 --> 16:38.960
That's exactly how I would put it.

16:38.960 --> 16:40.520
It's not cloying in your mouth at all.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.620
You nailed that.

16:41.620 --> 16:45.240
Just as it was finishing, I was like... As I was swallowing it, I'm like, this is... As

16:45.240 --> 16:48.320
I'm swallowing it, and you're saying, it's not that hoppy, I'm like, dude, what?

16:48.320 --> 16:49.320
This is super hoppy.

16:49.320 --> 16:52.040
And this, just as it finished, I'm like, I could have more, and you're like, but then

16:52.040 --> 16:53.040
you could have more.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.280
You nailed it, that's exactly what it tastes like.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.440
And you know, it's right from our own backyard.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.440
Kind of appropriate.

16:59.440 --> 17:01.800
So, that's what we will be enjoying during the show today.

17:01.800 --> 17:06.360
All right, let's talk about Firefox 46, finally released, and it's really, truly, genuinely,

17:06.360 --> 17:08.960
actually, honest to goodness here.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.960
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Firefox with, you guessed it, GTK 3 integration.

17:13.960 --> 17:14.960
No way.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.800
Yeah, it's true.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.680
And I know Mr. Colonel Linux is a Firefox fan.

17:21.680 --> 17:25.400
I'm going to get to him in a moment, but I wanted to open up to the mumble room first.

17:25.400 --> 17:29.720
Anybody out there actually cray-cray enough to try out Firefox 46 and play with the GTK

17:29.720 --> 17:32.560
3 integration on the Linux desktop builds?

17:32.560 --> 17:35.880
Yes, I plan on doing it.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.880
Okay.

17:36.880 --> 17:41.640
I've been using GTK 3 Firefox on Arch for like three releases now.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.640
Yeah, right.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.640
It's been doable.

17:43.640 --> 17:48.880
And anything stand out to you?

17:48.880 --> 17:54.240
I did run into one bug with the dark theme where you get white text on white background

17:54.240 --> 17:56.400
sometimes, which is kind of annoying.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.200
But otherwise, it's actually been very, very smooth.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.200
Okay.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.200
Okay.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.600
That bug exists forever.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.760
Yeah.

18:03.760 --> 18:08.840
We also have improved H.264 and AAC media support, better web RTC performance support,

18:08.840 --> 18:09.840
which-

18:09.840 --> 18:10.840
Those seem like good wins.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.840
Those do seem like really good wins.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.480
I think no one's going to be all about that using like Firefox Hello and whatnot.

18:14.480 --> 18:18.200
Now here is the, and great for the Firefox team, no snap yet.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.200
Right.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.200
I thought that was interesting.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.200
They even bothered pointing that out.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.200
But you caught that too, huh?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.200
There was a snap.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.200
I would install it right now.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.200
Yeah, I would too, actually.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.200
I wonder if that's going to start happening.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.200
I hope so.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.120
You can actually just go ahead and use it anyway, because you don't have to install

18:30.120 --> 18:31.120
it.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.120
You can download the tarball.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
Oh, yeah, sure.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.120
Yeah, totally.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
Let's talk about Firefox and Thunderbird.

18:36.120 --> 18:40.800
Mark Sermon, he wrote up a post at his site about Firefox and Thunderbird, a fork in the

18:40.800 --> 18:41.800
road.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.080
Firefox and Thunderbird have reached a fork in the road, he writes.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.720
It's now time, it's now the right time for them to part ways on both a technical and

18:48.720 --> 18:49.800
organizational level.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.320
So Thunderbird and Firefox, time to part ways, he says.

18:52.320 --> 18:57.280
A little bit of background, much of Mozilla, including the leadership team, believes that

18:57.280 --> 19:02.280
focusing on the web through Firefox offers a vastly better choice, or I'm sorry, chance

19:02.280 --> 19:07.120
of moving the internet industry to a more open place than investing in further Thunderbird

19:07.120 --> 19:12.680
development or in continuing to attend to both products.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.680
Many of us remain committed to Thunderbird users and want to see Thunderbird remain a

19:16.680 --> 19:18.880
healthy community and product.

19:18.880 --> 19:23.120
But both Firefox and Thunderbird face different challenges, have different goals and different

19:23.120 --> 19:25.240
measures of success.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.840
Our actions regarding Thunderbird should be viewed in this light.

19:28.840 --> 19:32.680
Success for Firefox means continued relevance in the mass consumer market as a way for people

19:32.680 --> 19:35.140
to access, share, and feel safe across many devices.

19:35.140 --> 19:38.620
With hundreds of millions of users on both desktop and mobile, we have the raw material

19:38.620 --> 19:40.120
for this success.

19:40.120 --> 19:46.480
If we want Firefox to continue and have an impact on how developers and consumers interact

19:46.480 --> 19:51.280
with the internet, we need to move to much more quickly and we need to innovate on mobile

19:51.280 --> 19:52.280
and in the cloud.

19:52.280 --> 19:58.080
Mozilla is putting the majority of its human and financial resources into Firefox product

19:58.080 --> 20:00.720
innovation.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.560
Now here comes the swinging blow, Noah, for Thunderbird.

20:03.560 --> 20:10.160
In contrast, success for Thunderbird means remaining a reliable and stable open source

20:10.160 --> 20:12.560
desktop email client.

20:12.560 --> 20:17.520
While many people still value the security and independence that come with desktop mail,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.400
the overall number of such people in the world is shrinking.

20:20.400 --> 20:24.400
Given these different paths, it should be no surprise that tensions have arisen as we

20:24.400 --> 20:28.160
have tried to maintain Firefox and Thunderbird on top of a common underlying code base and

20:28.160 --> 20:31.120
a common release engineering team.

20:31.120 --> 20:35.440
Here's what they're going to do, on the organizational front, they've hired an open source leader

20:35.440 --> 20:36.440
like Simon Phelps.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.400
He's going to look at different long term options for a home for Thunderbird, including

20:40.400 --> 20:45.860
perhaps the Document Foundation, perhaps Gnome, or the Mozilla Foundation and the Software

20:45.860 --> 20:48.200
Freedom Conservancy are also on the list.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.880
With the right technical and organizational path set forward, both Firefox and Thunderbird

20:51.880 --> 20:57.160
will have a better chance of success and dramatic reading.

20:57.160 --> 21:04.640
In other words, while Mozilla, over the last years, has had time to try everything from

21:04.640 --> 21:13.480
phones to sticks and everything in between, even a browser, what we don't have time for

21:13.480 --> 21:15.200
is an email client.

21:15.200 --> 21:21.600
An open web is important, but an open email ecosystem, have you guys heard of Gmail?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.160
What do you think, Noah?

21:23.160 --> 21:28.200
I think that Thunderbird is single-handedly the most popular client I see used on Linux

21:28.200 --> 21:33.560
desktops and it's kind of a huge disappointment that the Mozilla Corporation is either unaware

21:33.560 --> 21:40.520
or chooses to willfully ignore that user base and it seems like, I've tried Kmail, I've

21:40.520 --> 21:45.600
tried a lot of different ones, but like you, I have a large inbox and I don't like going

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
to the web for my mail.

21:46.600 --> 21:50.400
I like having a mail client running, especially on my workstation at home, so that I'm quickly

21:50.400 --> 21:55.720
alerted to incoming emails and stuff like that and if they pass it off to somebody else

21:55.720 --> 22:00.360
or if they decide to abandon the project completely, I really hope that whoever picks it up steps

22:00.360 --> 22:01.360
it up a little bit.

22:01.360 --> 22:04.980
It doesn't need to be updated a whole lot, it just needs to work and continue to function

22:04.980 --> 22:05.980
the way it is.

22:05.980 --> 22:06.980
It's good enough.

22:06.980 --> 22:12.160
You know, ironically, that's their main complaint, is they don't want – see, this is what actually

22:12.160 --> 22:18.360
strikes me, is they talk about success for Firefox means continued relevance in a mass

22:18.360 --> 22:23.720
consumer market, chasing mobile, focusing on the cloud and they say, in contrast, Thunderbird

22:23.720 --> 22:29.240
means remaining a reliable and stable open source desktop email client.

22:29.240 --> 22:33.760
Almost like saying, in opposite of our goals of Firefox, Thunderbird needs to be stable.

22:33.760 --> 22:34.760
What?

22:34.760 --> 22:35.760
What?

22:35.760 --> 22:37.880
What kind of logic is that?

22:37.880 --> 22:44.720
In contrast, they are literally saying, in opposite, that's another – in contrast,

22:44.720 --> 22:49.640
Thunderbird, for it to be successful, needs to be stable and an open source desktop client.

22:49.640 --> 22:53.440
They're saying, what does that mean for the goals of Firefox?

22:53.440 --> 22:54.600
Go cray-cray?

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
Go crazy with mobile?

22:55.600 --> 22:58.520
Go crazy with the cloud and stability goes out the window?

22:58.520 --> 23:03.400
It seems like it is absolutely a core focus of Firefox to have stability and that in no

23:03.400 --> 23:05.400
way, in no way detracts from Thunderbird.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.320
I don't make – this logic makes no sense to me.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.880
Yeah, it's pretty iffy.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.880
Now, should they be doing it if they don't want to do it?

23:10.880 --> 23:11.880
Of course not.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.880
Right.

23:12.880 --> 23:13.880
Of course not.

23:13.880 --> 23:14.880
I don't know.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.880
I don't know.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.880
Anybody in the mumbling room have an idea of where maybe it should go?

23:19.880 --> 23:24.880
The conservancy has already said that they would take in the hosting and they would also

23:24.880 --> 23:28.440
be open to like a Thunderbird Foundation split.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.720
The other ones haven't really said anything like that.

23:30.720 --> 23:34.400
In fact, I think – I think maybe Simon's report might actually be out as we record

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
this.

23:35.400 --> 23:39.320
Yeah, it's been out for about an hour now.

23:39.320 --> 23:40.320
Yeah, okay.

23:40.320 --> 23:47.240
The interesting thing is that the change between Mozilla and Thunderbird has already happened

23:47.240 --> 23:49.740
and it happened in like 2012.

23:49.740 --> 23:54.280
So this change is actually a good thing because Mozilla has already washed their hands of

23:54.280 --> 23:55.280
Thunderbird.

23:55.280 --> 24:02.360
They are just kind of a little bit still putting their feet in the water but Thunderbird doesn't

24:02.360 --> 24:07.920
want to be associated to Mozilla anyway because it limits them in what they can do for their

24:07.920 --> 24:12.260
base for like the runtime engine and everything.

24:12.260 --> 24:14.920
So they can actually improve Thunderbird overall.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.600
So this is actually a good thing even though it sounds weird.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.160
No, I actually am in complete agreement with you.

24:20.160 --> 24:23.360
I guess I wish that the priorities lined up differently.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.400
Mini MC, what do you think?

24:25.400 --> 24:31.360
Yeah, I think it's the release often philosophy for Firefox.

24:31.360 --> 24:36.720
If you have new technologies, implement them and do changes afterwards.

24:36.720 --> 24:41.520
Unless with Thunderbird, you need still a stable client.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
All right.

24:42.520 --> 24:46.920
So here is the – the register has the report that Simon put out a bit ago.

24:46.920 --> 24:51.160
He says software conservancy and document foundation seen as ideal new homes, they need

24:51.160 --> 24:54.620
technical hosting, they need finance and staffing and government dispute management leadership

24:54.620 --> 24:56.800
and trademark management.

24:56.800 --> 25:01.320
Now the software conservancy has already agreed to take over Thunderbird if asked, FIPS says,

25:01.320 --> 25:02.320
which is pretty great.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.320
Wow.

25:03.320 --> 25:06.360
Yeah, remember that's also where Inkscape lives, Git and QMU.

25:06.360 --> 25:11.160
On the other hand, the document foundation over in Germany is close to the largest national

25:11.160 --> 25:12.600
community of Thunderbird users.

25:12.600 --> 25:16.640
So I guess there's another – we'll see where this – we'll follow this.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.200
I guess Gnome Foundation wasn't super probably up on the top of this because they already

25:20.200 --> 25:21.520
kind of tapped out these days but –

25:21.520 --> 25:25.400
Yeah, they already – they said that they wouldn't be able to handle such a change

25:25.400 --> 25:26.400
at this moment.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.400
Yeah.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.400
Well, it's good to see Google stepping up.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.400
It's an important project.

25:29.400 --> 25:35.120
I like the fact that Mozilla is opening to let them use the trademark even though they're

25:35.120 --> 25:38.200
probably going to keep the trademark but they're going to let the Thunderbird project keep

25:38.200 --> 25:39.200
it.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.200
Yeah, good point.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
Good point.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.960
Mr. WW, do you have any final thoughts on the Thunderbird situation?

25:43.960 --> 25:47.880
I think Thunderbird is an insanely reliable client.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.320
It's been rock solid for me.

25:49.320 --> 25:57.560
I have literally thousands of emails in it and it doesn't take over 300 megs of RAM.

25:57.560 --> 26:02.960
On one end, this is going to put a lot more pressure on Firefox.

26:02.960 --> 26:07.080
People are going to be looking closer at them and saying, OK, you're done with Thunderbird.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.280
You moved on.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.960
What are you going to do for us now?

26:10.960 --> 26:17.200
What are you going to do to compete with Chrome, with Microsoft Edge, with Devalti?

26:17.200 --> 26:20.280
Are you going to be able to fix issues that you've had?

26:20.280 --> 26:23.240
People I'm sure are going to be looking at them more closely now.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.520
Yes, I think I will be.

26:25.520 --> 26:26.520
Yeah, definitely.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.520
Yeah.

26:27.520 --> 26:28.520
All right.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.900
One last update before we get into some of the meatier topics.

26:30.900 --> 26:35.640
Last week, I think it was, we mentioned that one of the first reviews of the Ubuntu BQ

26:35.640 --> 26:40.760
tablet was pretty sour on it and not very positive.

26:40.760 --> 26:47.720
Now Jack Wallen has his review out at TechRepublic.com and he's got a little bit of a different take

26:47.720 --> 26:48.720
on it.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.760
I think I like this one better because this feels more like a more longer term, bigger

26:52.760 --> 26:55.400
picture Linux user who's trying this.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.200
Someone who's open to it as well.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.200
Yeah.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.160
Someone who might be coming at it more from my perspective of I'm okay with rough edges

27:01.160 --> 27:04.520
if I can accomplish X and then just stick with it as it develops.

27:04.520 --> 27:07.280
Here's what he said that grabbed my attention.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.480
Now he's also got screenshots of what LibreOffice looks like on the thing and whatnot, but he

27:10.480 --> 27:15.240
says this, the only real issue with running full-blown version of LibreOffice on the Ubuntu

27:15.240 --> 27:20.440
tablet is the toolbars and menus, et cetera, are really on the small side because the resolution

27:20.440 --> 27:25.400
is super high, so you better have good vision.

27:25.400 --> 27:29.560
But he said, for example, he ran the GIMP, it's ready to go on the Ubuntu tablet, and

27:29.560 --> 27:31.340
here's what I really loved.

27:31.340 --> 27:35.080
The second the Ubuntu tablet connects to the wireless mouse, it switches over to desktop

27:35.080 --> 27:36.080
mode.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.640
That's when the real magic happens.

27:37.640 --> 27:41.760
All of a sudden, I'm working on a tablet that is in full multitasking mode.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.240
Windows act like Windows in the traditional sense.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.320
They can be resized, minimized, everything you've grown up to with on the desktop.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.720
Oh, that does sound really nice.

27:49.720 --> 27:50.720
Yeah, it does.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.720
Yeah, it does.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.440
He says, the only issue with the Ubuntu tablet is when you switch to desktop mode, you do

27:55.440 --> 27:57.120
lose some horsepower.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.880
There's some significant lag in the cursor movement, and apps don't seem to open nearly

27:59.880 --> 28:00.880
as quickly.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.760
That might be one of those things you've got to wait until the next tablet, but it could

28:04.760 --> 28:05.760
be.

28:05.760 --> 28:06.760
He ends in a conclusion.

28:06.760 --> 28:10.240
I don't want to spoil it for you guys, so he has a great write-up, but I haven't leaked

28:10.240 --> 28:17.760
it in the show notes, too, but he says, canonical, I am seriously impressed.

28:17.760 --> 28:22.960
He says, in desktop mode, I can actually get my work done in a similar efficient manner

28:22.960 --> 28:27.320
as I would if I were standing right at my desk.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.280
That is powerful.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.800
That's sounding a lot better than the last review we read.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.720
Do you think so, too, Mr. Kernalynx?

28:34.720 --> 28:35.720
I do.

28:35.720 --> 28:40.640
I've actually, for a number of years, been looking for a solution, a small portable solution

28:40.640 --> 28:41.920
that I can take with me everywhere.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.880
And when you say a number of years, you mean like 10.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.880
Yeah, yeah.

28:44.880 --> 28:48.880
It's basically kind of been what I've always wanted, but it seems like there's no place,

28:48.880 --> 28:52.840
it seems like either my laptop is inconvenient to take places or bad things happen to it

28:52.840 --> 28:53.840
sometimes.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.520
Which we'll get into.

28:55.520 --> 28:58.680
But if I could have a tablet, but the problem with the tablet is, every time I try to use

28:58.680 --> 29:03.940
a tablet operating system, I get stuck and bogged down in, it's good at tablet-y things,

29:03.940 --> 29:07.240
but I can't actually do desktop things, so the ability to switch back and forth is absolutely

29:07.240 --> 29:08.240
essential.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.520
Joe, you had a chance to play with it on Sunday.

29:10.520 --> 29:14.640
Yes, thanks to Wimpy at the Egham Raspberry Jam.

29:14.640 --> 29:20.080
And the thing is, okay, if you look at it from our point of view, it's a great tablet

29:20.080 --> 29:24.780
in that you can get Exmere running, you can get LibreOffice, but then if you actually

29:24.780 --> 29:29.280
step back out of our little bubble, our kind of free software bubble, and think of it as

29:29.280 --> 29:32.640
a consumer product, the thing is absolutely terrible.

29:32.640 --> 29:37.080
I mean, you know that gesture where you swipe in from the right and you get all of the recent

29:37.080 --> 29:38.080
applications?

29:38.080 --> 29:39.080
Uh-huh.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.760
That was all juddery and whatnot.

29:41.760 --> 29:46.080
And just the whole experience was not slick at all.

29:46.080 --> 29:54.000
Compared to my Nexus 9 running stock Android, it's just a joke, really, as a consumer product.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.160
And I don't know, maybe we're here to discuss the benefits of it.

29:59.160 --> 30:02.160
You can run proper terminal applications on it.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.700
You can do everything you can with a Linux box, basically.

30:05.700 --> 30:10.160
But for the general public, and that's how this was sold to me, at least.

30:10.160 --> 30:14.640
If you look at the websites where you can buy this thing, it looks like a consumer product.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.640
I'll grant you that, yeah.

30:15.640 --> 30:18.240
And the fact is, it is not a consumer product.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.880
It's not ready for market yet.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.880
Mr. Pobie, I'm sure you must have some response to this.

30:22.880 --> 30:23.880
Hello.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.080
Sorry if my audio is terrible.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.080
I'm in a hotel room in Prague.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.080
Yeah, thank you for joining us, even in the hotel room.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.080
That's awesome.

30:30.080 --> 30:35.680
So interestingly, I got to play with a BQ M10 for the first time today, other than the

30:35.680 --> 30:40.000
one I looked at Joe playing with over his shoulder at the weekend.

30:40.000 --> 30:50.240
And I understand that the performance is pretty bad with the OTA.

30:50.240 --> 30:55.000
So the device is shipped with, I think, OTA 9, and then the first update you get is OTA

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
10.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.680
And as I understand it, there's a bug in OTA 10, which makes the mirror performance pretty

30:59.680 --> 31:04.240
terrible, which is now fixed, which should land in OTA 11.

31:04.240 --> 31:08.320
So the performance should be improved quite dramatically.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.880
I haven't tried all of the gestures that Joe was.

31:11.880 --> 31:16.800
But I will certainly have a play with it tomorrow and see if it's as bad as Joe makes it out

31:16.800 --> 31:17.800
to be.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.080
But as I understand it, it should be better in OTA 11.

31:21.080 --> 31:26.000
You know, Pobie, one of the things that I kind of got on Librem's, or Purism's case

31:26.000 --> 31:31.840
for, was it felt like they were marketing towards super, super, super freedom aware

31:31.840 --> 31:37.040
users that would require things like core boot and no binary blobs, yet were shipping

31:37.040 --> 31:44.000
a device that had a proprietary blob and is not totally free, doesn't use core boot.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.400
And it's like, well, why didn't they just market to a different crowd?

31:47.400 --> 31:49.960
Why not market this to the tech enthusiast crowd?

31:49.960 --> 31:51.840
Is it just not simply a big enough market?

31:51.840 --> 31:54.520
Because it seems like that's all who's really going to end up buying it in the first few

31:54.520 --> 31:55.560
generations anyway.

31:55.560 --> 31:58.920
So it could end up saving a little face by just saying, well, this is really sort of

31:58.920 --> 32:00.440
for the technical people.

32:00.440 --> 32:03.520
I know you don't have an answer in terms of what the company's take is.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.320
But personally, do you think it's maybe would be better to target more geeky people to set

32:07.320 --> 32:08.320
expectations?

32:08.320 --> 32:11.000
Well, it kind of is.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.920
We like repeatedly have said, well, you know, it may be we're giving out a mixed message,

32:16.920 --> 32:24.200
maybe, you know, the marketing looks like it's consumer grade, and it's aimed at normals.

32:24.200 --> 32:30.480
Despite what we internally feel about, you know, we're not expecting this to be everyone

32:30.480 --> 32:33.720
who's got an iPad is going to go and buy one of these and replace their iPad with one of

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
these.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.440
Like, we're not stupid enough to think that.

32:38.440 --> 32:45.480
And similarly, you know, I know Joe has a Nexus 9, which he covets greatly.

32:45.480 --> 32:49.720
And I don't expect him to replace his Nexus 9 with an M10 either.

32:49.720 --> 32:53.760
I think bear in mind, this is our very first tablet.

32:53.760 --> 32:59.760
Yeah, we've had two major phones so far.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.960
The BQs and the MX4.

33:01.960 --> 33:06.320
And now this one, I think we're still iterating on things.

33:06.320 --> 33:10.440
And yeah, it's not it's not ready for my mom yet, certainly.

33:10.440 --> 33:14.120
And we've had this conversation before on Unplugged.

33:14.120 --> 33:20.960
Unlike unlike any other Ubuntu experience, though, this is so closely tied to how good

33:20.960 --> 33:22.320
the hardware is.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.720
Because you know, you get it all as one package.

33:24.720 --> 33:29.720
And so it's going to take a couple of iterations of BQs hardware to to get better and better.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.720
For the higher end stuff to reach the right price point.

33:32.720 --> 33:39.840
And the OS experience, like switching apps stuttering, is going to suffer for a while,

33:39.840 --> 33:40.840
right?

33:40.840 --> 33:47.160
And the flip side is, like, for the first time last night in a bar, I held a Meizu Pro

33:47.160 --> 33:49.560
5 that I've not seen before.

33:49.560 --> 33:54.320
And oh my god, that is years ahead of every other device that we've had before.

33:54.320 --> 34:00.560
It's super fast, super smooth, the UI is much slicker than than all of the devices we've

34:00.560 --> 34:01.560
had before.

34:01.560 --> 34:07.320
And I picked up my EQ 4.5 this morning was like, oh my god.

34:07.320 --> 34:10.920
So Wimpy, you disagree with me on the hardware front, you think the BQ tablets in pretty

34:10.920 --> 34:14.240
good shape right now as far as horsepower goes?

34:14.240 --> 34:15.240
I do.

34:15.240 --> 34:20.280
And just generally, the build quality of the hardware is very, very good.

34:20.280 --> 34:26.400
I've got a Nexus 9 and most of my family have Nexus 10.

34:26.400 --> 34:33.800
So comparing it to the Nexus 10, it's a lot more trim and lighter and so the hardware

34:33.800 --> 34:36.000
I've got no complaints at all.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.200
I think hardware wise, nobody's going to be disappointed.

34:39.200 --> 34:44.160
I've got the full HD model as well and that the screen is very, very good.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.800
So no, no complaints there.

34:45.800 --> 34:53.280
You can definitely feel the performance I've used up until for devices on some of the Nexus

34:53.280 --> 34:57.920
devices, Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and the BQ5.

34:57.920 --> 35:02.880
And this is, you know, significantly better in terms of performance despite, you know,

35:02.880 --> 35:07.800
some of the bugs that exist in some of the transitions when you've got the desktop mode

35:07.800 --> 35:09.960
enabled.

35:09.960 --> 35:14.200
That's what I really where I really want the horsepower to is if I'm in desktop mode, I'm

35:14.200 --> 35:15.200
working.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.240
If I'm in tablet mode, I'm probably consuming content.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.240
That seems likely.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.240
Browsing the web, whatever.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.240
Yeah.

35:21.240 --> 35:22.240
Oh, boy.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.240
Wes.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.240
So what do you think?

35:24.240 --> 35:25.240
What's your gut tell you on it?

35:25.240 --> 35:26.240
I'm excited to play with it.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.240
Yeah.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.240
You know, I don't know.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.840
Maybe it's not ready for a mass number of people, but we're on the track, right?

35:30.840 --> 35:35.000
Like it's out there and it's real and when does it get to the point where next time Wes

35:35.000 --> 35:38.340
is shopping for a tablet, this is a serious contender?

35:38.340 --> 35:40.000
Are we there yet?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.680
First I have to actually shop for a tablet.

35:41.680 --> 35:42.680
Yeah.

35:42.680 --> 35:46.280
This is kind of like making me consider tablets again as a piece of technology I might want

35:46.280 --> 35:47.280
to buy.

35:47.280 --> 35:49.560
So kind of like me, you've sort of lost interest in them.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.800
You have one that lasts forever because all you do is look at Reddit on it.

35:52.800 --> 35:53.800
Or watch Netflix.

35:53.800 --> 35:54.800
Or watch Netflix.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.800
Or maybe, right?

35:55.800 --> 35:56.800
Yeah.

35:56.800 --> 35:57.800
Yeah.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.320
So if there's something suddenly I can just throw in my backpack and then if at work and

36:00.320 --> 36:03.720
then there's a spare monitor, I plug it in and there's my desktop, I could use that

36:03.720 --> 36:04.720
even if there's some rough edges.

36:04.720 --> 36:08.980
I could tell you for sure, not to put words in Noah's mouth, but I could see on a trip

36:08.980 --> 36:13.000
like this, a tablet that could also double as a desktop would have been super handy.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Right?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
Right?

36:15.000 --> 36:18.640
Well, I can tell you this, the tablet wouldn't have gotten relegated to throwing it on the

36:18.640 --> 36:21.800
kitchen counter and saying, here, see if you can find a use for this to control some other

36:21.800 --> 36:25.040
hardware because I don't really use it, so it's just been sitting in my backpack the

36:25.040 --> 36:26.040
whole time.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.040
Yeah.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.200
He donated a Nexus tablet too for us to use for some production stuff.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.840
Joe, I would be curious to hear your thoughts on the Maru.

36:33.840 --> 36:41.160
Yeah, so Maru is a ROM for the Nexus 5, which is basically AOSP.

36:41.160 --> 36:45.920
It just is really boring Android until you plug it into a screen and your Bluetooth keyboard

36:45.920 --> 36:46.920
and mouse and then suddenly-

36:46.920 --> 36:47.920
Right.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.920
And this is based on Debian, right?

36:48.920 --> 36:49.920
Yeah.

36:49.920 --> 36:53.960
Then you've got a full Debian desktop and I put it on a Nexus 5 and I took a little

36:53.960 --> 36:56.680
selfie video, then another video of it working.

36:56.680 --> 37:00.120
I downloaded and installed GIMP and OpenShot.

37:00.120 --> 37:06.880
I made the title cards in GIMP, edited it in OpenShot, exported it, uploaded it to YouTube,

37:06.880 --> 37:09.080
all on the Nexus 5.

37:09.080 --> 37:13.440
The thing about that is that it's taken two existing things that are solid, Android we

37:13.440 --> 37:18.280
know is a great platform, Debian, that's a no-brainer.

37:18.280 --> 37:22.440
Instead of trying to reinvent things and they're not invented here syndrome, you've got a situation

37:22.440 --> 37:28.360
where the developer of Maru has taken these two solid platforms, put them together, and

37:28.360 --> 37:33.280
that's exactly what we've been talking about, this idea of I can carry around a phone and

37:33.280 --> 37:37.240
do or there's no reason you couldn't do it on a tablet as well and then get to work,

37:37.240 --> 37:39.620
plug it in and have a full desktop.

37:39.620 --> 37:43.880
Instead of trying to reinvent things, sometimes it's better to just stand on the shoulders

37:43.880 --> 37:46.920
of giants and combine things that are good already.

37:46.920 --> 37:52.920
I think that's a pretty sound and pretty often heard argument and I would say that this is

37:52.920 --> 37:57.800
sort of it playing out on a major grand scale that we're all going to sit back and watch.

37:57.800 --> 37:59.960
It's not just this particular stuff too, right?

37:59.960 --> 38:00.960
It's also other things.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.600
I mean Windows has been big on the whole there version of convergence.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.600
Yeah.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.600
Yeah.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.200
So we're well and I think particularly with Canonical and some of the decisions we're

38:09.200 --> 38:12.800
just going to see where this goes and I don't know yet.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.080
I think it's too early to call.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.960
I think we'll have to see where they and we'll have to see how the other part of the picture

38:17.960 --> 38:21.880
is how the updates are delivered to the device, how regularly and how much of a difference

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
that makes.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.880
I think all that kind of plays a big piece too.

38:24.880 --> 38:31.560
You know, Noah, it strikes me that we should totally load Maru on that Nexus 5 that I bricked

38:31.560 --> 38:32.560
earlier this week.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.560
Sure.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.560
Yeah.

38:34.560 --> 38:35.560
We should totally do that.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.560
I can install it on mine.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.560
Oh, you crazy.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.560
You should do it.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.560
I'll have it for next week if you want.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.560
Yeah, let's do it.

38:40.560 --> 38:41.560
Let's do it.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
We'll do a little take on it.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.560
We could do it together.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.560
Oh my gosh.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.480
You know, I should mention that throughout this episode I've been installing Etagros

38:47.480 --> 38:48.480
on the Apollo.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
That sounds great.

38:49.480 --> 38:55.200
And I decided to step away from Ubuntu 16.04 for a bit.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.120
And safe havens of arch.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.120
But I didn't format.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.640
I drive swapped, hence the story about drive swapping.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.840
So I can go right back to 16.04 because we had some spare parts.

39:04.840 --> 39:07.220
I kind of downgraded in terms of total storage.

39:07.220 --> 39:11.780
So I'll probably eventually go back to the Ubuntu drives, but I didn't want to wreck

39:11.780 --> 39:14.840
that install because it was actually a pretty solid install of 16.04.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.040
So I'm going to tell you guys more about that.

39:16.040 --> 39:21.080
But before we get into all that stuff, I also want to cover some Linux Fest Northwest clips.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.080
There was some good stuff, including one time where Wes stopped by the booth.

39:24.080 --> 39:25.080
Oh, that's right.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.080
Yeah, so people are watching the video version.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.440
They're going to get to see what Wes looks like here in just a little bit.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.400
Hey, a little surprise there.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.280
But first I'm going to mention our friends at Ting.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.280
This is luck of the draw.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.880
You know, it's different everywhere you go.

39:35.880 --> 39:39.340
But sometimes you just really score with your mobile service provider.

39:39.340 --> 39:40.700
That for me was Ting.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.440
You go to linux.ting.com to save.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.560
They have a CDMA and GSM network.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.560
That's going to be key here.

39:45.560 --> 39:46.560
I'll tell you in just a moment.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.560
Yeah.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
Oh, man.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.560
But here's what's great.

39:49.560 --> 39:52.720
No contracts, no determination fee, and it's only $6 for the line.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.360
And then you just pay for your usage on top of that.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.360
That's all you pay.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.800
You don't have to like pre-buy minutes and messages and megabytes and all that stuff

39:57.800 --> 39:58.800
that you might use.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.500
Like I might use 800 minutes and I might use 10 gigabytes.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.160
That's just not a game you play.

40:03.160 --> 40:06.160
It's super simple to activate your devices, especially like the Nexus devices.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.520
You just put the SIM card in and activate the SIM card and you're good to go.

40:09.520 --> 40:14.220
They have radically good customer service, radically better than the rest of the industry.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.680
Their dashboard also is just fantastic.

40:16.680 --> 40:20.960
But you know, we just are super lucky.

40:20.960 --> 40:26.480
Bellingham just has crazy good Ting coverage.

40:26.480 --> 40:33.700
In the expo hall, sitting at the booth, Noah and I have LTE coverage, which to be at a

40:33.700 --> 40:37.280
conference and have LTE coverage is so nice.

40:37.280 --> 40:43.020
And because a lot, just about almost all the JB crew there was on Ting, we all had connectivity.

40:43.020 --> 40:48.240
So we could message each other and it was crucial to making it a smooth Linux fest.

40:48.240 --> 40:52.240
And a huge part of that is being able to choose your network, CDMA or GSM means that you can

40:52.240 --> 40:56.240
pick whichever is stronger in your area and be able to do that just if you know what those

40:56.240 --> 40:59.440
things are, if you know there's something called GSM and CDMA and you vaguely know what

40:59.440 --> 41:03.400
they are and you can vaguely look up coverage maps, you're good to go.

41:03.400 --> 41:08.040
And Ting is super easy when you understand that difference and they make control all

41:08.040 --> 41:09.820
yours with their excellent control panel.

41:09.820 --> 41:10.820
We're doing all this stuff.

41:10.820 --> 41:12.800
We never have to talk to customer service, nothing like that.

41:12.800 --> 41:16.000
It's a really good service and they have really great staff.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.840
In fact, they just recently did a blog post kind of about how they make their margins

41:19.840 --> 41:23.640
between different towns and how they're making money on fiber internet rollout.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.880
They're just really open about that kind of stuff and transparent.

41:25.880 --> 41:26.880
So you can check out their blog.

41:26.880 --> 41:30.080
But first, go to linux.ting.com so we get the credit.

41:30.080 --> 41:33.900
Noah showed up with a $9 SIM card, which was awesome, I ended up using that.

41:33.900 --> 41:38.560
They have the Motorola E second gen, which I don't think I would want for myself when

41:38.560 --> 41:42.680
I could get the LG Volt, but the Motorola E second gen, $74 unlocked, you own it.

41:42.680 --> 41:47.400
I would go for the LG Volt 2, though, because Marshmallow's coming out for that, 66 bucks,

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
no contract.

41:48.400 --> 41:50.760
It can do most everything you really need in a phone.

41:50.760 --> 41:52.020
That's ridiculous, right?

41:52.020 --> 41:54.200
And it ships tomorrow.

41:54.200 --> 41:58.120
It's got a decent camera on the thing, it's got tri-band LTE connectivity, it's got that

41:58.120 --> 42:00.360
faux metal back with the little thingy there.

42:00.360 --> 42:01.360
Oh, the thingy.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.360
The thingy.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.960
What's that little, it's got that little shutter button right there.

42:03.960 --> 42:10.000
This is seriously, and a quad core Snapdragon processor for 66 bucks, and it's going to

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
get Marshmallow.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.280
Yeah, I don't know if it has it yet, because they just released the press release a little

42:14.280 --> 42:15.280
bit ago.

42:15.280 --> 42:19.680
They also have internet phones, they have the blue dash, which is cool, for 103 bucks,

42:19.680 --> 42:21.840
unlocked, all of these are no contract.

42:21.840 --> 42:22.840
Netgear Zing is my MiFi that I use.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.480
Oh, I've been thinking about getting one of those.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.960
Yeah, that's what I use, I love it.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.520
You can check them out, they have the OnePlus on there, or you can just go get the Nexus,

42:29.520 --> 42:33.000
I don't know if they're still on sale at Google Play, but they were recently, and then you

42:33.000 --> 42:34.520
just grab it and put it on the Ting network.

42:34.520 --> 42:37.540
Just start by going to linux.ting.com, that supports the show, lets them know you heard

42:37.540 --> 42:41.240
about it here, that keeps us on the air, and it gives you that discount.

42:41.240 --> 42:47.000
Or, if you already have a device you can bring, it'll give you a service credit, linux.ting.com.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.720
Linux Fest Northwest, you guys couldn't all be there, turns out, so we wanted to give

42:52.720 --> 42:53.920
you a little flavor.

42:53.920 --> 42:57.160
In the unplugged program, I cut things a little loose.

42:57.160 --> 43:01.200
So I didn't cut it, like in last, you know, we'll put some transitions in there, I cut

43:01.200 --> 43:04.840
it right to when we do the introduction, like it really stands out, like in the clip where

43:04.840 --> 43:10.920
I introduce you, like, you'll actually see me reset and then introduce you, but I just

43:10.920 --> 43:14.680
left it all in there, because this is the unplugged program, so I'm gonna show you guys

43:14.680 --> 43:16.180
everything.

43:16.180 --> 43:21.520
So let's start with, well let's actually start with something that happened before we got

43:21.520 --> 43:22.520
to Linux Fest Northwest.

43:22.520 --> 43:28.000
Now you might have noticed in last week's episode, 141, the energy was really high.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.620
We were having a good, rambunctious time in last week's episode, and this is how it goes.

43:32.620 --> 43:36.620
We got all these projects, you know, we're finally reunited in person, we get to work

43:36.620 --> 43:42.660
on all these things, we get to do all this stuff, and so last week, we all kind of huddled

43:42.660 --> 43:47.960
in the studio, because it was a full house, and Noah and I were sharing a microphone.

43:47.960 --> 43:53.320
Well, that was a really dumb idea, you might notice we're not doing that this week.

43:53.320 --> 43:59.620
And Noah had to pay a very high cost, and the question came up, if you listen to last

43:59.620 --> 44:04.000
week's episode, you might hear something that kind of sounds, kind of like something falling

44:04.000 --> 44:07.120
over, you know, something like, something that maybe tipped over, and you might hear

44:07.120 --> 44:11.800
your host get really stressed out for a few moments, well I'm not gonna say exactly what

44:11.800 --> 44:16.760
happened because, well, we covered it on the livestream, somebody noticed and asked us

44:16.760 --> 44:17.760
about it.

44:17.760 --> 44:23.320
And by the way, I am not drunk in this clip.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.320
I am not drunk.

44:24.320 --> 44:25.320
Was I drunk at Linux Fest?

44:25.320 --> 44:26.320
Did I have anything to drink?

44:26.320 --> 44:27.320
No.

44:27.320 --> 44:28.320
You didn't have time to get anything to drink.

44:28.320 --> 44:34.120
No, no, yeah, I was dehydrated, if anything, but just exhausted, because we'd worked so

44:34.120 --> 44:39.880
hard up to this point, it was a bumpy day tech-wise, and I was so happy when Wes showed

44:39.880 --> 44:40.880
up.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.320
It was good to see a friendly face.

44:43.320 --> 44:51.240
Of course, Wes, you know how sometimes you're doing a show, and things happen, and you just

44:51.240 --> 44:55.360
gotta keep doing the show, like, maybe you gotta go get a beer, so one of us gets up

44:55.360 --> 44:58.360
and grabs a beer, and the other guy keeps doing the show, right?

44:58.360 --> 44:59.360
Yeah.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.760
Well, also, same thing happens when you spill a beer.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.760
That does happen.

45:02.760 --> 45:08.720
So we were doing, Noah and I were sharing a mic in Linux Unplugged, as you recall, what,

45:08.720 --> 45:09.720
what, you want this?

45:09.720 --> 45:10.720
Yeah.

45:10.720 --> 45:18.520
And Wes was sitting there with us, doing a show, very fun, and I was going to switch

45:18.520 --> 45:24.200
a camera shot, and I knock over my beer, right on top of Noah's ThinkPad.

45:24.200 --> 45:29.280
And it was great, because it wasn't like beer splashed, it was like a, glug glug glug glug

45:29.280 --> 45:30.280
glug glug glug.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.280
Yeah, that sound happened.

45:31.280 --> 45:35.680
And I think all of us in the studio were like, oh crap, we can't say anything, what do we

45:35.680 --> 45:36.680
do?

45:36.680 --> 45:37.680
Let's be very quiet.

45:37.680 --> 45:41.860
So all three of us just start silently communicating, like, while we're still doing the show.

45:41.860 --> 45:42.860
That was amazing.

45:42.860 --> 45:43.860
It was an intense moment.

45:43.860 --> 45:44.860
Yeah, it was an intense moment.

45:44.860 --> 45:46.920
What's funny was, I went back and listened.

45:46.920 --> 45:48.560
There's, I mean, if you know what you're listening.

45:48.560 --> 45:49.940
You can hear the beer fall.

45:49.940 --> 45:54.800
You can tell, but if you didn't know what was happening, I don't know that anyone would

45:54.800 --> 45:55.800
know anything was up.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.800
You have no idea.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.880
It's great, we just gave that away.

45:57.880 --> 46:01.200
You can hear a beer fall over in the episode, but you can't hear it pouring on the laptop.

46:01.200 --> 46:03.680
No, you don't hear the glug, glug, glug, glug.

46:03.680 --> 46:04.680
But you hear the funk, glug, glug.

46:04.680 --> 46:07.560
Well, yeah, and you also can hear the stress in the voice.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.560
Oh, really?

46:08.560 --> 46:09.560
Oh, yeah.

46:09.560 --> 46:10.560
Oh, you can?

46:10.560 --> 46:11.560
A little bit.

46:11.560 --> 46:12.560
That's funny.

46:12.560 --> 46:13.560
So what was the outcome of that?

46:13.560 --> 46:19.080
Well, it became a project to take it apart and try to drain it.

46:19.080 --> 46:22.600
Now it's in this UPS box on its way back to Lenovo to get fixed.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.120
Actually, it's not Lenovo.

46:24.120 --> 46:28.600
It's actually a guy that runs a YouTube channel that teaches people how to fix their computers

46:28.600 --> 46:31.520
at the component level, like the soldering and stuff like that.

46:31.520 --> 46:39.280
So if you have a MacBook or ThinkPad or anything, and the controller goes out in it, Apple will

46:39.280 --> 46:43.940
tell you that you need to buy a new computer, that it's not repairable.

46:43.940 --> 46:49.440
And he will show you how to buy a $0.39 component and solder it back into your computer.

46:49.440 --> 46:53.880
Now you know he has a good YouTube channel because he led me to believe that I was so

46:53.880 --> 46:57.040
confident in what I could do that I could fix my own computer, which did not work out

46:57.040 --> 46:58.100
well at all.

46:58.100 --> 46:59.100
So now I'm going to send it to him and he can fix it.

46:59.100 --> 47:01.000
But someone more confident than you probably could have.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Yes, that is true.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
That is true.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.720
Yeah, we were sad because it looked like it might just be a simple keyboard issue.

47:09.720 --> 47:14.800
And then, of course, in the disassembly and to try to resolve the keyboard issue, it doesn't

47:14.800 --> 47:16.080
really go back together.

47:16.080 --> 47:22.640
By the way, whoever came up with the ribbon cables, screw all y'all, screw all y'all.

47:22.640 --> 47:26.080
I want a little white connector with individual pins that I can plug in and unplug.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.080
Dude, I got it.

47:27.080 --> 47:28.080
Yeah.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.080
Lasers.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.080
Lasers.

47:30.080 --> 47:36.520
So as Popey would probably point out, the ThinkPad should have been fine, right, Popey?

47:36.520 --> 47:38.320
The ThinkPad, it has the drain holes.

47:38.320 --> 47:39.840
It should have been okay.

47:39.840 --> 47:40.840
Yeah.

47:40.840 --> 47:41.840
It's his enterprise hardware.

47:41.840 --> 47:42.840
Yeah.

47:42.840 --> 47:44.200
I mean, Popey is, he's like a fanatic.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.200
So he's, he's efficient.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.200
He knows about these things.

47:46.200 --> 47:48.460
And of course, well, you would think so.

47:48.460 --> 47:53.080
But first, before we get to that, this, just because you couldn't see what happened, Noah

47:53.080 --> 47:57.720
wanted to recreate how things likely went down in the studio if we could have said something

47:57.720 --> 47:59.040
to each other.

47:59.040 --> 48:00.360
This is, this is that moment.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.360
Oh, my God.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.360
I am so sorry.

48:02.360 --> 48:04.080
I did not mean to do that.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.440
It was totally accidental.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.440
But here's the thing.

48:06.440 --> 48:07.780
I'm on air doing Linux unplugged.

48:07.780 --> 48:11.280
So if we stop right now to address this, we have to start the entire episode over because

48:11.280 --> 48:14.040
we recorded all in one cut.

48:14.040 --> 48:18.000
And my feet are really nasty because this is sticky and there's stuff all over.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.240
So paper towels could get in here.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.240
That'd be great.

48:20.240 --> 48:22.240
That was pretty much it.

48:22.240 --> 48:23.240
Yeah.

48:23.240 --> 48:26.900
I like that you put on my shirt to do that, Noah.

48:26.900 --> 48:28.400
Although you know, you didn't get the collar quite right.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.400
I'm just saying.

48:29.400 --> 48:30.400
That's right.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.400
Yeah, it's okay.

48:31.400 --> 48:32.400
I aim for the hair to be right, too.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.400
But I think I failed on that, too.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.400
Yeah.

48:34.400 --> 48:35.400
Yeah.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.400
Yeah.

48:36.400 --> 48:37.400
The ribbon cables.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.840
So he disassembles it and makes sure there was no beer in there.

48:39.840 --> 48:41.400
And the keyboard did get kind of wrecked.

48:41.400 --> 48:43.720
Even though it has the drain holes, it got kind of wrecked.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.760
So he disassembles it to see if anything else gets wrecked.

48:45.760 --> 48:46.760
Good news.

48:46.760 --> 48:47.760
It's just the keyboard.

48:47.760 --> 48:48.760
Nice.

48:48.760 --> 48:49.760
So he orders himself a keyboard.

48:49.760 --> 48:50.760
Keyboard arrives.

48:50.760 --> 48:54.400
Turns out the thing doesn't go quite back together quite right.

48:54.400 --> 49:00.000
I was following a YouTube guide and the guy literally is like, well, this cable here,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.160
I never quite figured out how to disconnect it properly.

49:02.160 --> 49:05.720
So if you just yank on it really hard, it comes disconnected.

49:05.720 --> 49:10.400
And that was about the point where I realized my ThinkPad was screwed and I should probably

49:10.400 --> 49:12.160
send it into Lewis to get him to fix it.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.160
Oh, Noah.

49:13.160 --> 49:14.160
Wow.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.160
Oh, yeah.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.160
Yeah.

49:16.160 --> 49:19.000
So this, you guys got to remember, this was Saturday.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Things were a little crazy.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Oh, Saturday.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.260
And there was a competition, Nye.

49:24.260 --> 49:26.040
The Switch competition was that evening.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.960
And so that's really where a lot of our thoughts were.

49:28.960 --> 49:34.540
And Noah, just the thing about Noah is you could try to set things up so that he'll go

49:34.540 --> 49:35.540
to bed early.

49:35.540 --> 49:39.560
And no matter what you do, he's still going to be up till 2 a.m. in the morning in the

49:39.560 --> 49:42.640
lobby of the hotel talking about, you guessed it.

49:42.640 --> 49:46.200
He goes down there to talk about Linux and ends up with a bunch of people sitting around

49:46.200 --> 49:49.160
him and they're all talking about Linux instead of sleeping.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.560
We get a little bit of peek of that and then watch as Noah pivots from that and starts

49:52.560 --> 49:55.200
recruiting him to try to help with the Switch competition.

49:55.200 --> 50:01.520
The man is unstoppable.

50:01.520 --> 50:03.760
So here's by the way, I just included a little bit of this.

50:03.760 --> 50:07.560
This here is the shot of our booth, if you guys didn't get to see so much of the live

50:07.560 --> 50:08.560
coverage.

50:08.560 --> 50:09.560
Sweet booth.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.560
Yeah, it was really great.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.320
It's Chase in the bottom corner and I'm over there in the other corner.

50:12.320 --> 50:16.440
There's Albert Westra and there's Jed's butt over there, so you guys can catch that, which

50:16.440 --> 50:17.440
is nice.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.720
So it was a really cool, it was actually a great booth.

50:19.720 --> 50:23.880
And so we were sitting there just kind of getting things fixed up and Noah's buddy stops

50:23.880 --> 50:24.880
by.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.880
Did you watch that episode?

50:25.880 --> 50:26.880
I didn't, no chance.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.480
Okay, no, that's fine.

50:29.480 --> 50:33.040
So I host the show with Chris, if that isn't evident to you yet.

50:33.040 --> 50:35.040
We should recap the story a little bit.

50:35.040 --> 50:38.480
I was walking, you were walking in the hotel and you look over my shoulder and you're like,

50:38.480 --> 50:39.480
hey, is that Linux?

50:39.480 --> 50:40.480
Hey, is that Linux?

50:40.480 --> 50:41.480
Yeah, I've heard the story.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.600
And then you mistakenly thought you were just going to walk off and go back upstairs and

50:44.600 --> 50:45.600
what, go to bed or something?

50:45.600 --> 50:47.400
Like, no, that's not going to happen.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.120
So I was like, no, come on over here.

50:49.120 --> 50:52.440
So then you decided you had to go, you were going to go get your significant other and

50:52.440 --> 50:53.440
your brother was with you, right?

50:53.440 --> 50:54.440
Yeah.

50:54.440 --> 50:55.440
Oh, there's your brother.

50:55.440 --> 50:56.440
There he is.

50:56.440 --> 50:57.440
Hello, Hussein.

50:57.440 --> 50:58.440
That's Hussein and that's Devon.

50:58.440 --> 50:59.440
Hussein.

50:59.440 --> 51:00.440
Hussein.

51:00.440 --> 51:01.440
And that's Devon.

51:01.440 --> 51:02.440
And you're new.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.440
Oh, okay.

51:03.440 --> 51:04.440
Check out his tattoo.

51:04.440 --> 51:05.440
Yeah, I like that.

51:05.440 --> 51:06.440
Nice.

51:06.440 --> 51:07.440
Nice.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.000
So I'm guessing you use Linux then if you bothered to ink it on your body.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
He's a Linux user.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
You're a Linux user?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Yeah.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
Yeah.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
You can stay.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Draft it on your skin.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
You better be.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Yeah, right.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
So we sat down.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
What do you think it was?

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Like an hour conversation?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Oh my God.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Hour and a half at least.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Yeah.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Oh my gosh, dude.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
What time?

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
What time of night is this?

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Two in the morning.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Yeah.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
I didn't get to bed before two.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
Dude, do you ever sleep?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
You got to sleep tonight.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
There was Linux to talk about.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Yeah.

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
He tells me he has to be here at 830.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
I'm like, oh my God.

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
You know what?

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
I just sleep in.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
It's not a big deal.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
I'm in the dark.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
I know.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
And he's got to be live all day.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.400
But there was Linux to be had.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.400
Yeah.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.400
Okay.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.400
So we sat.

51:45.400 --> 51:46.400
We talked about Linux.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.400
We talked about Arch.

51:47.400 --> 51:48.400
We talked about Ubuntu.

51:48.400 --> 51:49.400
Anyway, super, super cool people.

51:49.400 --> 51:50.400
Aw, thank you.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.400
And you guys are...

51:51.400 --> 51:54.440
So you actually travel here every year for the last six years?

51:54.440 --> 51:58.480
Yeah, something like five years, four years, four to six years.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.480
Something like that.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.480
So tell me about that.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.840
How did you get from Vancouver to come to Linux Fest?

52:02.840 --> 52:04.640
There's nothing like this.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.640
Linux Fest is unique.

52:05.640 --> 52:06.640
Every conference is unique.

52:06.640 --> 52:13.640
But Linux Fest being free and open to everybody is very like the community in and of itself.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.600
And it's just so much difference than a paid conference.

52:16.600 --> 52:17.600
The talks are more inclusive.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.600
People are more friendly.

52:18.600 --> 52:21.600
We had a crazy conversation at 2 a.m.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.440
Now you've attended Linux Con.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.000
So you've gone to both sides...

52:25.000 --> 52:26.320
I call it both sides of the...

52:26.320 --> 52:27.320
Corporate Linux.

52:27.320 --> 52:28.320
Yeah.

52:28.320 --> 52:30.320
Can you compare and contrast the two events for me?

52:30.320 --> 52:34.680
Corporate Linux, the talks are very more in-depth.

52:34.680 --> 52:38.280
Like the speakers clearly work in the field.

52:38.280 --> 52:42.320
And like there's no question that they know what they're talking about.

52:42.320 --> 52:47.560
But at the same time, it's kind of intimidating because like these are these are hardcore

52:47.560 --> 52:48.560
heavy professionals.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.600
And it's not that you don't get that here.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.920
There's definitely those kinds of talks here.

52:52.920 --> 52:57.640
But it's more like reading a forum where people just kind of talk and you get more of a community

52:57.640 --> 52:58.640
feel with even the talks.

52:58.640 --> 52:59.640
Yeah.

52:59.640 --> 53:06.120
And so have you ever been to Linux Con or Roscon or any of the like the big like corporate

53:06.120 --> 53:07.120
events?

53:07.120 --> 53:12.960
Have you ever been to that and had any sort of like spontaneous, completely unplanned,

53:12.960 --> 53:16.960
totally unwarranted community events like we had?

53:16.960 --> 53:17.960
Because it wasn't just him.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.800
It was him and it was Devin and it was and it was just right.

53:20.800 --> 53:25.320
And then your buddy Sean was there, you know, so it's like we had like this little group

53:25.320 --> 53:27.680
that just assembled at the hotel.

53:27.680 --> 53:29.760
I mean, like right now we have this group that is forming here.

53:29.760 --> 53:36.560
So how can you have you ever had something like that happen at one of those larger events?

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
It's different.

53:37.560 --> 53:40.880
I chatted with John Mad Dog Hall on the bus to the after party.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.680
So I mean, you know, that's a perk.

53:42.680 --> 53:43.680
Yeah, exactly.

53:43.680 --> 53:45.680
But it's not the same where people just talk.

53:45.680 --> 53:50.080
And I think because you see Mad Dog Hall, it's hard to just interject in the conversation.

53:50.080 --> 53:53.840
And I was talking with that guy at the Software Freedom Law Center.

53:53.840 --> 53:54.840
Forget his name.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.160
He does some really awesome stuff.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.160
Even?

53:57.160 --> 53:58.160
No, no.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.160
Shit.

53:59.160 --> 54:00.160
Maybe it was.

54:00.160 --> 54:01.160
Yes.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.160
It was even more one.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.160
Yes.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.160
And again, awesome conversation.

54:04.160 --> 54:05.160
We're talking on the floor.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.160
Crowd forms around us.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.160
But nobody wants to talk.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.160
Yeah.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
Because it's even freaking mobile.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.160
Talk to the guy.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.160
Yeah.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.160
I'm weird.

54:13.160 --> 54:14.160
I just like to talk to people.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.160
Yeah.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.920
So I want to I do want to talk.

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
I do want to talk to your brother.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.000
I do want to talk to your girlfriend.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.240
But can you tell me if you were?

54:23.240 --> 54:27.000
Can you tell me what you would say to somebody that has that maybe is thinking about coming

54:27.000 --> 54:30.800
to Linux Fest, but hasn't really been here, isn't really sure they're kind of on the fence?

54:30.800 --> 54:36.400
What would you say if somebody asked you what you what they should do or you having so much

54:36.400 --> 54:41.480
experience coming to Linux Fest, what you would say to them?

54:41.480 --> 54:43.200
I wouldn't waste their time.

54:43.200 --> 54:45.000
I just say come and check it out.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.360
You can't know until you're here.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.360
All right.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.360
Last thing.

54:48.360 --> 54:49.360
Last thing.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.360
One last thing.

54:50.360 --> 54:51.360
This is kind of like icing on the cake.

54:51.360 --> 54:52.360
You have like the cake and then you have the icing.

54:52.360 --> 54:53.360
Sure.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.400
Tell me about text messages and being concise.

54:55.400 --> 54:56.400
Oh, man.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.400
Oh, man.

54:57.400 --> 54:58.400
You.

54:58.400 --> 54:59.400
Yeah.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
Yeah.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.400
Yeah.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
Everyone needs here.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.400
This is a PSA.

55:03.400 --> 55:04.400
Kind of like how I.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.400
I just got three text messages while you asked that.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.400
Oh, my God.

55:06.400 --> 55:07.400
One thread.

55:07.400 --> 55:08.400
Yeah.

55:08.400 --> 55:09.400
Yeah.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.960
Kind of like I did just there where I took 10 seconds to organize my thoughts and the

55:11.960 --> 55:12.960
host didn't mind.

55:12.960 --> 55:17.440
They, you know, interjected and said something while I organized my thoughts.

55:17.440 --> 55:18.440
I didn't do that here.

55:18.440 --> 55:23.280
I'm kind of spamming it out, but you organize your thoughts and you get it out in one message.

55:23.280 --> 55:24.280
One message.

55:24.280 --> 55:28.840
Otherwise, and you know, I have this watch and this watch vibrates every time I get a

55:28.840 --> 55:29.840
message.

55:29.840 --> 55:30.840
Oh, my God.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.400
How does it help you to answer if you get like three spams rather than.

55:33.400 --> 55:34.400
One concise message.

55:34.400 --> 55:35.400
It doesn't.

55:35.400 --> 55:36.400
It drives me.

55:36.400 --> 55:37.400
I start to think, oh, there must be an emergency.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.400
I better check right.

55:38.400 --> 55:39.400
Oh, no.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.400
It just spread out.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.400
It spread out over four messages.

55:41.400 --> 55:42.800
And when it comes to an actual emergency, you'll just be ignored.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.840
So you're lost, but.

55:44.840 --> 55:45.840
One message.

55:45.840 --> 55:46.840
Keep it concise.

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
All right.

55:47.840 --> 55:48.840
Can we talk to your girlfriend or your brother?

55:48.840 --> 55:49.840
Who was ever up?

55:49.840 --> 55:50.840
Or both?

55:50.840 --> 55:51.840
Anybody?

55:51.840 --> 55:52.840
Next up.

55:52.840 --> 55:57.480
That was, that was particularly for me because he knows that that was kind of funny about

55:57.480 --> 55:58.480
this guy, too.

55:58.480 --> 55:59.880
So he sits down, right?

55:59.880 --> 56:03.700
And he sees a Jupiter broadcasting sticker on our laptop and he goes, oh, do you guys

56:03.700 --> 56:05.840
listen to Jupiter broadcasting?

56:05.840 --> 56:08.560
And so I, you know, I stopped for a second to see if he's trolling me, if he's serious

56:08.560 --> 56:09.560
and he's serious.

56:09.560 --> 56:10.560
I'm like, yeah, no, we do.

56:10.560 --> 56:12.560
And he's like, are they any good?

56:12.560 --> 56:13.560
The shows any good?

56:13.560 --> 56:15.000
I'm like, yeah, hosts are all right.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.200
There's one guy in the Linux action show kind of darker skin.

56:17.200 --> 56:20.400
He's kind of a kind of a jerk, but everything else is fine.

56:20.400 --> 56:23.520
So then we start talking about the, you know, the, the episodes and stuff.

56:23.520 --> 56:26.520
And that's when I told him, I said, you know, go watch the Ubuntu versus arch episode.

56:26.520 --> 56:29.880
I think that would clarify some of the things that, you know, we were talking about or whatever,

56:29.880 --> 56:32.880
but I thought it would be funny if he had seen it before he actually came over to the

56:32.880 --> 56:33.880
booth.

56:33.880 --> 56:36.520
And then he shows up at the booth and turns out, oh, that's the guy.

56:36.520 --> 56:41.600
So there, so what happens a few moments after that, and this is super funny is his girlfriend

56:41.600 --> 56:43.360
says, no, I don't really feel like sitting down.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.760
And I just decided not to, I just, that was long enough clip.

56:45.760 --> 56:46.760
I wanted to cut it.

56:46.760 --> 56:50.360
The next thing that Noah does when the, when the, when his girlfriend declines to sit down

56:50.360 --> 56:53.400
and he says, okay, okay, will you guys do me a favor?

56:53.400 --> 56:56.960
Will you go out and find anybody running windows and tell them to come see me?

56:56.960 --> 56:59.920
And then, and maybe this is actually probably a good thing I cut it out is then he gives

56:59.920 --> 57:00.920
out his telegram handle.

57:00.920 --> 57:03.320
He's like, or just have them telegram me.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.320
Let's organize this thing.

57:04.320 --> 57:05.880
Cause he's getting super competitive.

57:05.880 --> 57:09.800
And just as we start getting competitive, guess who stops by for a chat?

57:09.800 --> 57:10.800
Guess who stops by?

57:10.800 --> 57:11.800
Why?

57:11.800 --> 57:12.800
Yes, it's Emma.

57:12.800 --> 57:16.320
And I was stepping, I had stepped away from the booth for a couple of seconds.

57:16.320 --> 57:20.000
And so Noah and Angela were sitting on the live stream cause I was out taking a walk

57:20.000 --> 57:21.000
around the floor.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.060
I wanted to get a feel for it.

57:22.060 --> 57:25.700
And Emma stops by to talk, well, talk about actually switching people to Linux, which

57:25.700 --> 57:27.680
is really interesting if you're trying to switch people to Linux.

57:27.680 --> 57:29.800
And she also talks a little bit about the switch competition.

57:29.800 --> 57:30.800
Yeah, yeah.

57:30.800 --> 57:31.800
Come over here.

57:31.800 --> 57:34.800
Did you hear that we did a hashtag team Noah?

57:34.800 --> 57:35.800
I did.

57:35.800 --> 57:36.800
Okay.

57:36.800 --> 57:37.800
Isn't there a hashtag team Emma?

57:37.800 --> 57:38.800
There needs to be.

57:38.800 --> 57:39.800
There is.

57:39.800 --> 57:40.800
There is now.

57:40.800 --> 57:44.400
Hashtag, hashtag team.

57:44.400 --> 57:45.400
You pointed that way.

57:45.400 --> 57:47.080
Oh, I was pointing to the sign.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.080
No, you were fine.

57:48.080 --> 57:49.080
It's right in the center.

57:49.080 --> 57:50.080
Learn how to frame man.

57:50.080 --> 57:51.080
I was just pointing.

57:51.080 --> 57:52.080
I can't see it.

57:52.080 --> 57:53.080
The camera got moved.

57:53.080 --> 57:54.080
So we're not centered anymore.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.080
I can't see it.

57:55.080 --> 57:58.400
And when somebody does this, I think that means, I'm sorry, that's good.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.400
Team Emma.

57:59.400 --> 58:00.400
Hashtag team Emma.

58:00.400 --> 58:02.800
Which is the, this is, so what we're doing here, this is the team that you don't want

58:02.800 --> 58:03.800
to go for.

58:03.800 --> 58:04.800
Oh.

58:04.800 --> 58:05.800
No, I'm just kidding.

58:05.800 --> 58:06.800
I'm kidding.

58:06.800 --> 58:08.440
If you want a awesome, I'm going to get in trouble now.

58:08.440 --> 58:09.440
You're going to get me in trouble.

58:09.440 --> 58:11.960
Now my boss is going to see me hanging a sign on our camera that says team Emma.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.520
What are you guys doing to me?

58:13.520 --> 58:16.320
This was a setup.

58:16.320 --> 58:17.320
Who did this?

58:17.320 --> 58:21.120
So if you're looking for an awesome experience on hardware, if you didn't, let's say you

58:21.120 --> 58:23.420
didn't want to be switched to Linux on your computer.

58:23.420 --> 58:27.040
Let's say you just wanted Linux to work on your computer.

58:27.040 --> 58:30.440
Then you might consider system 76, right?

58:30.440 --> 58:34.280
So tell me how long have you been at system 76, Emma?

58:34.280 --> 58:35.560
Almost four and a half years.

58:35.560 --> 58:36.880
And what do you do for them?

58:36.880 --> 58:39.320
I am the consumer sales manager.

58:39.320 --> 58:40.680
And what does that mean exactly?

58:40.680 --> 58:48.000
I manage individual sales, so if it's not a business or a university, I'll handle all

58:48.000 --> 58:55.000
aspects of the sale, including sales questions over the phone or on our social networks.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.160
And that's about it.

58:57.160 --> 59:01.560
So do you get a lot of Windows users that call in and want to, that are looking to switch

59:01.560 --> 59:02.560
to Linux?

59:02.560 --> 59:03.560
Yes.

59:03.560 --> 59:09.400
Everyone starts the conversation with, you know, I'm just so sick of Windows and I Googled

59:09.400 --> 59:10.960
and I found you guys.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.960
Oh, it's not.

59:11.960 --> 59:13.520
I listen to Jupiter Broadcasting.

59:13.520 --> 59:19.240
That is actually very common, too, but you guys don't have, you guys have more Linux

59:19.240 --> 59:20.920
users listening to your show.

59:20.920 --> 59:21.920
Sure.

59:21.920 --> 59:22.920
Thank you.

59:22.920 --> 59:27.800
Because I think you guys switch them by having the show.

59:27.800 --> 59:30.560
When people call in, do you guys sell Windows hardware?

59:30.560 --> 59:33.760
Like if I wanted to buy a computer with Windows, do you guys ship that?

59:33.760 --> 59:39.240
So when somebody calls in and they say, I'm interested in a computer, is there a conversation

59:39.240 --> 59:43.280
that takes place where you have to convince them that they're going to buy this computer

59:43.280 --> 59:46.040
and have Linux installed and use it?

59:46.040 --> 59:49.920
Or have they already made that decision when they call in?

59:49.920 --> 59:54.280
A lot of times they've made the decision that they're fed up with it, but then they have

59:54.280 --> 59:56.720
some questions about why they're hesitant.

59:56.720 --> 01:00:02.600
So I'll answer maybe five or six questions and then they'll get happier as the conversation

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.600
goes.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.200
I can hear them smile every time I give them an answer and they're like, oh, this is sounding

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.200
great already.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.720
This is so much better than Windows.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.720
I'm so excited.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.480
So I get them excited.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.920
And when you're talking to these people, you're having these conversations, what kind of questions

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.920
are they asking?

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.960
Do I need virus protection?

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.720
What kind of apps are installed?

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.200
What kind of software will work with it?

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.720
Can I open Windows documents?

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.920
What are some alternatives for certain types of software?

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:39.120
So those are pretty much the most common questions.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.600
And what kind of support is there available?

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.000
And we offer lifetime software support, so that's a winner too.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.840
So you have a one year warranty on the hardware?

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.840
So after that one year, they can continue to call in and ask questions, even if it's

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.040
not the version of Ubuntu that shipped on their laptop and you will continue to help

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.040
them?

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.200
For hardware, yes.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.320
So we don't ever turn away anyone for support.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.960
So we do offer a one year, two year, or three year warranty.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:10.700
So that would cover the cost of the parts and repair.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:15.520
But if you do need a part and you're out of warranty, we'll still get you the part.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.200
How many people have called in and said, I am a perfectly happy Windows user and I don't

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.020
really have any interest?

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:28.140
They haven't started the conversation with switching to Linux and have you dealt with

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.140
that?

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.720
You know why he's asking, right?

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.240
I know why he's asking.

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.880
He's asking because he's trying to determine how big of a challenge he faces.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.320
What he's trying to set here is the narrative that they're already on the way to switching

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.320
when they call.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320
And that's what he said.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.800
He's sitting over there laughing and shaking his head because he knows that's true.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.840
And so this is how competitive Noah is.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.480
Even in the interview questions, he's setting it up that way.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.480
It's so great.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:58.240
You have talked them from, I think I'm maybe not a perfectly happy Windows user, but it's

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.920
tolerable and it works for me, into you need to start running Linux.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.800
They're always just so close to the edge.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.080
So I'm just that hand to hold.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080
Okay.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:13.500
Now I have to ask, if somebody wanted to get in contact with you here at the Fest, is there

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.000
a way for them to do that?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Yes.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.960
They can either tweet to System76 or contact us through our Facebook page or come by our

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960
booth.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.560
And your booth is...

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.000
How do you identify booths?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.840
I don't know.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:29.840
Second to the last...

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.840
We have a blue curtain.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.840
I don't...

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.680
Second to the last row from the door.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680
If you come in the main door...

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.680
I would just call it the middle.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:37.680
They are B2.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.680
B2.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.680
Oh, there.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.680
Oh, look at you pulling out a mask.

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:41.680
Oh, look at you being smart.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.680
So here's us.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.680
There we are.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680
See, and that's...

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680
So...

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.680
Hey.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:47.680
How you doing?

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.680
Good.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680
They're the next row, right behind you.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680
Thanks.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680
Thanks.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680
Pretty clever.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.680
That's System76.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:54.680
Two presentations.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680
Well, thank you very much for stopping by the booth.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680
Yeah.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680
That's not trolling.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680
Well, yeah.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680
That's not trolling.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680
Are you, in fact, Team Emma?

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.680
Huh?

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.680
Are you, in fact, Team Emma?

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.680
I am.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.680
Then it's not trolling.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.680
I am Team Emma.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.680
The only thing trolling is making me hold that up when my boss is walking in.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680
Well, if you were interviewing someone, I was gonna come by and be like...

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680
Oh.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.680
That would be trolling.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.680
Yeah.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.680
That would be my original plan.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.680
That would be trolling out of ten, as we're saying.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680
Oh, geez, Noah.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.680
Oh, geez.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.680
Trolling out of ten.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:17.680
So, yeah.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.000
So that was what's funny is I was, like, watching this back on the replay, I'm like, Noah is

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.560
totally pumping, and he's thinking to himself, okay, so when they come to Emma, they're already

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.440
sort of greased to be switching.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440
Switching.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440
Switching.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440
Oh, whoa.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.440
So that was pretty funny to see his...

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.440
That was great.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.440
Wheels turning there.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440
Okay.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.840
So, after Emma stopped by, we started realizing we may have ourselves a situation.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.840
We had...

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.840
We started...

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.560
A couple of things had gone down on the live stream, and we decided to get up and go for

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.560
a walk.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:53.440
And we went, and when we started walking around, we started picking up a little scuttlebutt.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.100
And by the time we made it back to the live stream, we could definitely feel the tension

01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:02.360
building for the night's Switch competition, and, well, I'll let the clip speak for itself

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.360
here.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360
Do it live.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360
We'll do it live.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360
Oh, and Wes stops by, too.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.360
Hey, there he is.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.360
Howdy, howdy, sir.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.360
Sit down in the hot seat.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360
Have a seat with us.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360
How you doing, Wes?

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360
Doing wonderfully.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360
Yeah.

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.800
Hey, it's Wes.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.520
Wes, grab the mic.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.520
You gotta eat it a little bit.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.520
You gotta eat that.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.520
Oh, hello.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.520
You gotta do a foul when you're ready there, Mr. Chase.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520
All right.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.000
Ladies and gentlemen, joining us here in the hot seat is, of course, one Mr. Wes Payne

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
from Linux Unplugged.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.040
Wes, good to see you in the flesh, sir.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.360
Oh, it's wonderful to be here.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.980
How did the drive up teach you?

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:37.980
Not too bad.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:38.980
I thought it was gonna rain.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.980
It looks like it's gonna rain.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:40.980
Yeah.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:41.980
It's an angry day out there.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:42.980
It is.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:43.980
Yeah.

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.560
That is some of the best weather commentary I have ever heard.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560
It's an angry day out there.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:47.560
And then I just play off.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.560
It's treacherous out there.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.560
Nothing.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560
It's treacherous in the present.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560
Yeah.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560
A wonderful day for Linux.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.560
I've actually gotten a chance to go out and do a little watering thing.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.560
You can tell we're doing an amazing job.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.560
It's like we're going to be in the rain.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.560
Yeah.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560
It's gonna be great.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.560
We're not.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.560
We're not going to.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560
We're not going to.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.560
It is.

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.560
It is.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560
It's a perfect day for Linux.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:12.600
Yeah, a wonderful day for Linux. I've actually gotten a chance to go out and do it like a little

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:21.200
Him it is and tonight should be a pretty fun night. We have the big switch competition. Oh

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.320
Yeah, and and we're going out. How's our main man here feeling? I

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.680
You know, here's ready. No, I'll tell you what. Here's when you were born ready. We know that yeah, I was I eat you pay

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.800
Attention. That's what I like about you. No, so I think that I think that I

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.120
Really? I got it. I got to watch my back because yeah

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.600
Here's what I've here's what I know

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:48.520
I know that there is there is no one more dangerous than somebody who is truly motivated and I was over at the at the

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.800
System 76 yeah, and hashtag team Emma

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:57.520
Yeah, they are they're taking it seriously and the thing is she has a lot of stuff going for her that I don't have going

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.360
For me. So for example, she can off if you switch with em, like if you switch with me

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:05.320
Yeah, first of all, just supportive. Well, there's that yeah doesn't hurt you to work

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.840
But that's not gonna help you run Linux and you you're like some weird Indian I am

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.600
They haven't deported me yet, but no not normally around many people, you know

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.660
But now think about this if you switch with me the support ends when when I leave right because let's face it

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.120
I'm going back to Grand Forks and good luck with your in his rights install

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.840
But now the system 76 they've got a phone number

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.440
They have a whole team full of people on standby to switch and when you go to upgrade

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.720
By a different computer or you decide that you need a little bit more horsepower

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:38.800
She can easily just it's literally just a dovetail into a brand new machine loaded with the same operating system

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.360
You've already so there so she does have some major major. I'll tell you what. Here's why I'm worried and

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.700
You know we

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:50.280
The the fact that we are in our own backyard. Yep

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:56.080
Could actually be just a disadvantage to us. Yeah a little complacent. Yes. We're a little complacent and

01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:01.320
Because we're here people, you know people watch the show. They're letting her know that they're back in Noah, right?

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.040
I like so that's kind of put her back on her heels a little bit

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.200
And I thinking when you get somebody back on their heels a little bit

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:12.480
They're more aggressive they are and the thing is is there will be a counter pressure to that there will be a counter wave

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.880
It'll swing the other direction

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:19.200
I think by the by the approach of the evening support for team Emma will be building and you actually we can see this in

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.360
The email they're saying there's people are sending it in that is high-resolution screen. I tell you what 4k display. Yeah

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:31.200
a raving raving raving fan writes in and says I'm for hashtag team Emma because she's so happy to help new Windows users get

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.120
Set up with running a bunch

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.660
That's what I'm saying is patient a light never makes you feel like you're stupid for not knowing how to add a printer or something

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:44.120
Like that plus she's pink bedazzled workspaces and you can't go wrong with that go hashtag team Emma. That's a

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:50.920
This is what I'm thinking is I think there will be a groundswell in for Emma because she's nice

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.440
She's got the backing of system 76. She's got she's got a pink thing in her hair that matches her shirt that catches the eye

01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.520
Yeah, you know it didn't bring his glass

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.560
So that was like BSD whore that's a huge conversation starter for a huge conversation starter

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.560
So I'm just a little concerned that

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:12.480
So what and here's the other thing we're not doing this switch here at Linux right because these are mostly Linux

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:16.640
Yeah, we have to go out into the crowd where we lose our familiar advantage, right?

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:21.880
So I'm just yeah, and and and I think we may even Jupiter broadcasting. What's that Chris?

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:26.480
I know and to make matters worse. I think we may actually have a defector in our midst. Oh, yeah

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:32.400
I think we have somebody who may be who may have leaked at one of our planned locations to team Emma

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.440
Yeah, so there is no way isn't it?

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.800
There is a lot going on on top of the fact that we're here doing a show, right?

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.280
Like I said, I forget about the show at some point because there is just so much

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.280
Dynamics to this to keep track of and and you know

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.280
You got people in the JB crew betting behind the scenes on this thing

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:55.200
You got you got people now defecting to team Emma. I have a groundswell in the community. It is

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.120
down to the wire West so so like

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.100
Like every Linux fest Northwest as much as you can handle and more. Yes, exactly

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.040
Yeah, it's an extreme Linux best. Yeah

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.240
the so then it was just a couple of hours after that to the switch competition kicked off and

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:16.420
It was nuts and we will have the final results in Sunday's Linux action show

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040
and it was

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:25.240
Really a kind of intense for us as the host because we kept it all a secret from each other and all of that

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:30.000
So I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah, it has been crazy and I have a couple of photos

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.300
I wanted to share with you guys too. This is a great picture here of Noah

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.840
This is what he spent a lot of his time here doing is rebuilding computers swapping parts around you can see

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:44.300
There's just screws and pieces everywhere paper plates pizza rolls

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.080
It's basic fuel tablets

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.920
motherboard boxes, this is this is a picture from the

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.800
After party where I could only get so many people in one shot

01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:00.040
It was just there's people everywhere hanging out around the studio. This is a shot here of some of the pizza here

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.920
Let me take off the lower third there so you can see all of the pizza

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:09.720
Hey, yeah, we fed a lot of people it was healthy eating while we were all here and then of course, there's Emma

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.480
She stopped by yeah that Emma. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. She got she got in the studio and we had some fun

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.600
Yeah, so it was all good time. In fact, I got a little clip

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.160
If you're watching the video version here just a little clip of us. We went up to dinner after the switch competition

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:26.340
Well, that's way louder than I wanted to I apologize for that here

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:29.040
Let me pull it down a little bit here. Oh, so just you can see the venue a little bit

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:35.000
For those of you that are watching Oh, I'm on Goose

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.440
You know what video is hard for Goose. It's you know what Goose. I understand. It's been hard for us this week, too

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.440
There we go

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:51.520
That's the table we we took up and and the crew that helped us out there's Ian from system 76 playing on his

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.320
His game boy. It was it was a lot of fun at the day. We went to a really nice place

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.280
What was it called the Boundary Bay? Yeah, they may bay. Oh, man, and no if you said it was one of your favorite places

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.280
We'd been yet

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.440
All Hall song. Sorry. No, I don't I don't hear you. Sorry. No, hold on Noah get it get your audience

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:14.440
Get your audience. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

unplugged so I as the show has been going have been loading and hair girls on my Apollo switching it from always a

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:28.580
pleasant experience

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.560
Mm-hmm. It really was switching it from Ubuntu

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:38.600
1604 unity to enter gross and I you know, you could watch episode

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.140
413 of the Linux action show where we reviewed Ubuntu 1604

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:50.020
To hear my thoughts on how Ubuntu is difficult to install software. You will also hear Noah's thoughts on why it is not difficult

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.180
however

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.420
Noah himself has admitted and

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:58.600
This is I actually think this is kind of a big deal that Ubuntu 1604

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:03.220
Has kind of disenfranchised him from Ubuntu for a bit. No, I do you want to explain what's going on

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:08.500
Literally gotten to a point where a 1604 is no longer even usable for me

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.500
I mean I have it unloaded on this laptop

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:15.540
After everything I was preaching on Sunday was based off the idea that it with the LTS

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:20.500
I know that I'm getting limited software, but the software that is on there will work just fine. Well as it turns out

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:24.540
1604 has screwed even that up because I can't install the software

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:29.500
like I go goes in the software center and I launched into an inadvertent game of ping-pong and

01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:34.060
Then I installed you to buy to install it and the software might install but then half of these apps don't

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:38.940
Actually load properly and if they do load properly the menus don't work properly and if those work properly

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.860
I realize I'm not on the internet half the time because my network manager crashes and if that works properly I

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:49.140
Just it seems like every time I turn around there's another problem and how this qualifies as an LTS. I

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:55.020
I can't I can I can't as a Linux enthusiast and you know, you see me all the time, right?

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.660
I'm somewhat of an optimist

01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:02.260
I tend the Rekha always calls me the lowest denominator Linux like I'm like well boots and I can see something I call it good

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:07.460
But this is beyond unusable. It's beyond unusable and I'm sure they'll get it fixed

01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.660
But they have stained the mark of the LTS at this point because they have released

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:13.500
quote

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:18.020
Reliable solid long-term support software and it's totally useless out of the box

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:22.900
Yeah, and when we were at Linux fest, everybody was kind of nodding their heads when we were complaining about stuff Joe

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.900
What's your experience been?

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:28.340
Well, I downloaded it today 1604 I'd been busy

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:30.100
So I've only just got a chance to check it out

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:34.340
And one of the first things I wanted to do is install Chrome because that's what a lot of people do

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.340
So I downloaded the the deb

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.620
Opened it opens up the software center or software install

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.660
It's called now and you press install and just nothing happens and then

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:51.300
Nothing happened. Yep, and then so I thought okay, right? Well d package dash I

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:59.300
And then the path to it and then it gave me the the issue about the char one problem because they've tightened up the security

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:05.260
Right now for me, I know how to get around that but for your average user who Ubuntu is aimed at

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:07.420
That's not a very good situation. Is it?

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:11.060
Just installed Chrome as during the show on Ubuntu

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:15.700
And I mean I paste I did it with via PPA pasting from in from a website into the terminal

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:19.900
But it was the same kind of experience where I was like I could do it, but that's not great

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:26.260
So the things that I've I've personally ran into are sort of are sort of disappointing for myself, too

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:31.620
I have had some serious issues with network manager and I've had some issues with Intel graphics when I'm hooked up to a second monitor

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:35.500
Ironically other people have had the issue when they're not hooked up to a second monitor

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.900
My issues have been when I am hooked up to a second monitor

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:42.900
And if you go back and watch the review, I said this was the most exciting Ubuntu release in a long time

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:49.260
And I still kind of feel that way in some sense. Like I'm not really hesitant to use it on the server

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:55.100
Yeah, right exactly. Yeah, I'm excited still there. Yeah, like I okay Alex the e2o is out, you know

01:16:55.620 --> 01:17:03.140
They've got a support. Yeah, exactly. They've got snap packages will eventually be shipped. I'm sure I'm I hope

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:07.740
But on the desktop, this has been bad. This has been a and you know

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:12.140
The unity version seems to be the worst because I primarily spent my time on Matei and on

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:18.660
Kubuntu and they didn't suffer from a lot of infrastructure on those that kind of mask these problems. Mm-hmm. I

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:26.260
So I am I am I watched it back our review today actually on the on last and I ended it by saying I was extremely

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:30.540
Excited I got to say I'm I'm pretty disappointed as far as a desktop experience goes

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:35.940
I just every single day every single day. There has been an application that I've needed that is not available

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.900
Literally every single day it is this whole weekend, you know is a little bit of a rare exception

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:47.060
We're doing a lot of things but has been a so today. I wanted to I wanted to cut those videos of

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.180
Linux fest from our live stream, right?

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:56.700
And this is the the video editor we never talk about on the show is the best video editor out there

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:03.420
It is dude. It's called avid mucks and it's yeah, you can you could mark an endpoint and I took videos that were wrapped in

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.420
the FLV flash container

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:10.700
drop, I know that one dropped it in avid mucks marked my in and outs and save them out as

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.820
And I and I didn't have to re-encode it just extracts

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.340
H264 in the audio and saves them out as MKVs

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.120
So not only did I cut my in and outs in the stream files

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.460
But I also converted it from a dot FLV to MKV without re-encoding the video

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:28.900
It's a really good tool. I use it for all my clips on them filter all the time. It's my number one editor

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:33.140
it's like a nice like gooey equivalent of ffmpegs power and yes flexibility and

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:39.020
Go ahead and try to install that on Ubuntu 1604 one of the best one of the best quick little apps

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:43.100
You could you'll find PPAs you can get those PPAs and then dependencies won't work

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:46.180
You can try to download devs from get Deb, but it won't work

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:52.060
You cannot actually go download a 1604 Deb directly no installation candidate. No, there's nothing

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:58.100
It's it's it's and it's every single week. I'm sorry every single day. It's an actual useful application

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.700
It's not an esoteric strange app that just got posted up on github

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:07.820
It's real desktop applications on Linux are a pain in the ass to install and that is an egregious one

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:14.540
And 1604 has been just really extremely spotty and I had intended as of last week's episode

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:19.260
To keep Ubuntu on this Apollo for as long as I possibly could and now

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:24.420
Using it here. I I had to take it off. It was just it was just with I

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:31.860
Can't even use it for my workflow. It is it has got to be the one of the worst LTS releases for the desktop ever

01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.380
and

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:37.140
Then I I don't think it's impossible to fix

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:42.780
I think 1604 dot one or two so in like six months you could be I would have you could be completely I would say

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:44.580
Maybe even three months. Yeah

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:48.260
But what the hell happened and they've been so good at releases in the past

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:52.640
Well, I just don't understand what happened. I don't I mean it's not like anyways, so

01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:55.260
We were a little disappointed to I mean

01:19:55.260 --> 01:20:01.580
I think probably know the most but all of us were sort of disappointed in it. And so and it was also like

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:08.740
So it just as another example if you want the latest version of OBS on Ubuntu you need to install Ubuntu 1404

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:11.940
Really even that is two point releases behind

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:16.160
Now guess what? We needed to use this weekend. Oh, yeah. Oh, yes

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.520
you know the only way to get the so

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.480
this week turns out

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:28.560
They revved OBS with Intel quicksync support and Nvidia. I forget what Nvidia is GPU accelerated the same thing

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:33.200
Yeah, they're GPU accelerated encoding which we have an Intel i7 processor and an Nvidia

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:38.820
GPU in our OBS rig and we would love to take advantage of accelerated encoding

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.280
The only way to do that cleanly in a package managed environment

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.560
It was for us. We load an arch

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:49.200
Well, we tried to do Ubuntu right now up on SATCOM one and SATCOM two

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.920
We're still using Ubuntu, but we need to yeah, we actually have to use Ubuntu 1404

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:59.160
So we just had to deploy to Ubuntu 1404 and that's not totally totally outrageous in enterprise production

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:01.160
But it is kind of outrageous for us, right?

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.400
so I

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.000
Even on the server. We actually have deployed a few 1604 servers over the last few days as well

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.360
But I probably will soon. Yeah, I've deployed a couple

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.880
But I don't think anything no nothing in the yes

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:21.920
You can see me a thumbs up or thumbs down but nothing in the video production chain now is using the 1604, right?

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.120
Everything's 1404 or arch. Yeah, huh?

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:31.080
Yeah, the stuff that needs to be more current and you know need to have the latest support is arch and then the stuff that's

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:36.800
On the back end more stable that handles like all of the back end communications SATCOM one and two are for our Ubuntu 1404, right?

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:42.880
And then that way and it's kind of an indictment in some sense on the release mobile room. Anybody have thoughts or an opposite opinion

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.560
Well, I was just going to say that at least the online search is off by default now

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.640
So they've kind of taken that privacy. Yeah stuff into consideration at last. Yeah, I do

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.440
I do like that a lot

01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.000
It's you know, like I think like I've been saying I think it's gonna be a release in a few months

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.960
You could recommend to average people to install but I don't know like the software not installing when you click install

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:11.520
What the swap issue they didn't get fixed until a couple of days before release it just it gives it like a slam-together feeling

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.200
which is not the impression you want to give for an LTS and it

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:19.200
See if you're if you're a cynic like me like if you're kind of a jerk you start thinking

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:20.560
Well, you know

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:26.640
maybe it's because they had that BQ tablet that ended up needing to ship right around the LTS release and they needed to work on

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.360
Getting that ready and maybe they got distracted and they also had that bash on Windows

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:38.400
And they also had that bash on Windows project like maybe they were spread a little thin during the build up to a question

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:42.560
Their allocation of resources it does and that's and I could be completely wrong

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:45.680
But that when you when you deliver something like this people start going. What are they?

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.520
Is this a safe bet questions are asked? Yeah. Yeah

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.040
So, uh

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.040
I don't I don't want this to be a total downer because I still save those drives and I plan to plug them back in

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:59.680
In a couple of months. I'm still gonna do an update some deploys here. Yeah, and I still plan to run it on servers

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.960
Uh, but I I just I I think i'm gonna hold the breaks

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.000
I'm gonna and you know, I watched watching that review back. I was all in I was actually and i've been saying on this show

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.760
For for months and this is the the release i'm the most excited about

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.960
True and I ran it for a month up to the review

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:20.800
But you know the big mistake I made there is because I just wasn't all that excited about unity is I ran plasma desktop and matte

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:26.000
And and and truly, you know wimpy has has really smoothed over some of these rough edges

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.160
And it's not nearly as bad of an experience on ubuntu mattei and to that end the machines

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.440
We have put in production running ubuntu are on ubuntu mattei

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.240
Right. Yeah, so

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:41.040
Yeah, it's just sort of the way it's shaking out wimpy. Are you still here? Do you have any thoughts on the 1604 release?

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.720
I wonder if he i'm not sure if he's still here or not

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:50.400
I can't see the screen. No, I don't think so. I think both him and poppy were from hotel connections and had to disconnect

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:54.880
Uh, i'm curious. Maybe we'll pick his brain. I don't want to over overdo the ubuntu coverage

01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:02.080
But uh, I you know, I will say installing that ubuntu mattei welcome package on any 1604 release really does go a long way

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:09.120
I totally agree. I really do. All right mumble any mumble any closing thoughts on the ubuntu, uh follow up before we uh, wrap it up

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.480
Going once going twice

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.900
I take that as sort of a tacit agreement unless you disagree otherwise

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.040
That's legit right streamer streamer says yeah

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.840
Okay stream says no disagreement

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.480
Uh, yeah. Yeah poppy had to disconnect. I know I really think that uh, it's a

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:33.760
Okay closing thoughts really quick just just to wrap it up because I did share these on the live stream on saturday

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.240
Part of me. Here's what I think happened. I think maybe they legitimately got distracted

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:39.120
They had too many things

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.920
They were working on before 1604 came out and they have this release date so much is built around

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:49.600
Ubuntu hitting this release date all the flavors, uh, you know, uh vps is the whole big rolling

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:54.000
It's an industry now based around these lts releases and so they have to hit that release date

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
There's a lot of pressure to hit that release date

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:02.320
Whereas a distribution like anagros or any a lot of other ones i'm just picking on anagros because that's what we've been messing around with

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560
between the two

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:10.240
They release when they feel like they have an iso that has enough new fixes or updates to release it

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:13.600
Otherwise, it's just kind of developed all the time. Yeah, just update it

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.800
They just release iteratively when they feel like it and arch just sort of updates iteratively when they feel like it

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:24.560
And sometimes I think you get in a sweet spot where that's a good combination and things are working pretty great

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.680
And sometimes that sync slips a little bit and the ltss are a better combination and right now I think

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.840
the arbitrary release dates and uh, just slamming out the features

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.320
Yeah

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:42.000
I mean really even even the even like a we made a big deal about the zfs support and it's it's there

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:46.080
But you gotta install all if you install the desktop version, you gotta install all of the userland packages

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.560
There's no there's no user exposed way to actually set it up. You're going down the terminal

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.200
You're going down the terminal and using zpool and zcreate and whatever else whatever else at that point

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.640
You know the dkms stuff before it wasn't that much extra. Yeah, exactly like the dkms wasn't that hard?

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.400
It's like the least amount of work exactly

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.480
That's my point and like you're going to have to go buy alan jude's book to be able to set up a zfs

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.800
On your pointer box. I linked that to so many people. Yeah zfsbook.com. Uh, he just released a new edition go check it out

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.560
like seriously

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:20.080
Uh, and and and again, I am not trying to compare to other distros, but other distros and when you're installing

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.040
Zfs is just in the drop down. I'm not using I don't i'm not using it to set up zfs

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:29.760
But it's just like how much extra work if you have all the userland utilities available?

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.680
You have the kernel module available

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.280
How much extra work is it to expose that as an option in your installer?

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:39.680
How much if all of the underlying linux software is there how much work can that be?

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.440
and if you're like taking this big step by offering it like you think you'd want to like

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:49.360
Package that up as a whole big cohesive thing. And of course, they have the excellent excuse of well, we don't uh, think it's uh,

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.440
targeted for uh, end users

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.080
so uh, it wasn't really a

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.600
Priority to make it available in the gooey

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:03.520
Which is a very solid argument except for the very reason that ubuntu has any relevance is because they made a great desktop

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:08.560
Distribution to begin with and people adopted on this is their thing. That's how ubuntu got traction

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:12.320
They didn't start out as the server as the vps cloud distribution

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.360
They started out as a as linux for human beings. Yep

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.600
Where's that gone?

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.280
Where is that?

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:21.280
on the phone

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.000
Hey, oh

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.480
All right. Hello everybody end of rant. I'm just um, I uh, I just uh

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:32.720
I just I don't know. I guess I probably I probably should get off my soapbox because in reality

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:35.520
I think it's wasted effort. It's not gonna get me anywhere

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.000
Uh, and that's okay because I think over time things will get comments. Yeah

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.200
Well, that's for that. I think noah's gonna get more comments about his lack of sleep

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.160
Then I will get comments about my ubuntu hate so I think we're doing okay
