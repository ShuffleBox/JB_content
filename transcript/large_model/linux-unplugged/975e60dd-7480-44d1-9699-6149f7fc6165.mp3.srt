1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,960
Wes found something that might change my life

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,320
for this week's episode.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
Game changer.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,760
The peak of the show, right here,

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,800
is a Raspberry Pi-powered grocery bot.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,420
You take it with you, it's like a Raspberry Pi companion.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,120
It's built into a case, it has a handle,

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,880
it has a mustache, it has a camera.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,040
What a mustache.

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,600
It is a great mustache, actually.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,240
Why don't more Raspberry Pi cases have mustaches?

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,760
And anyways, get this thing.

13
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,560
It's basically got like one of those little barcode scanners

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,680
and a buzzer, and it helps you keep track of the groceries

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,400
that you need and have picked up.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,920
And you just take it with you and scan the barcodes,

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,500
and you can add them to your grocery list,

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,620
and then you can get the report on your mobile device

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,960
when you're at the grocery store.

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,080
So you have this thing in your kitchen,

21
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,680
you pull, oh, I'm out of milk,

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,900
and you scan the barcode, it adds it to your list,

23
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,560
and then the next time you're at the grocery store,

24
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,920
you have all the items, the exact item, the specific item.

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,360
Buy a barcode, I mean, yeah, right?

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,200
How great is this?

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,160
It seems really nice.

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,680
Because take it to the next level.

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840
Imagine that Beard here, right?

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,060
Beard gets online deliveries all the time.

31
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,280
I've done it a little bit myself

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,720
with our local Safeway grocery store, it's great.

33
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,560
It's so the way to go, yeah?

34
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,400
Yeah.

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,960
And imagine now taking that to the next level

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,840
where you could have this thing next to the fridge,

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,960
and you scan the barcode, it adds it to a list,

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,640
and then when you're done, you just hit send,

39
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,820
it sends the whole list off to the grocery delivery service,

40
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:21,960
and in a couple of days,

41
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,360
a whole new batch of grocery shows up at your door.

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,040
You would totally use this, come on.

43
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,400
I would, the thing I would like to see more

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,160
is AI integration to suggest new groceries to me.

45
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,240
Oh, like based on your grocery profile.

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,080
Yeah.

47
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,680
Ha ha ha.

48
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 225

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,840
for November 28th, 2017.

50
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:57,120
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged,

51
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,840
your weekly Linux talk show that honestly,

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,400
a little meat drunk this week.

53
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,280
My name is Chris.

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
My name is Wes.

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,980
Hello, Wes, and Wes, as luck would have it,

56
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,820
the beard's here too.

57
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,760
Hello, beard.

58
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,280
Happy half birthday to me.

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Okay.

60
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
Indeed, dude.

61
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
That's random, that's random,

62
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,680
but it's gonna be, you know what?

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,720
A day of celebration here on the Unplugged program.

64
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,040
That's right.

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,520
He looks good for his half age too.

66
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,640
He does, doesn't he?

67
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,160
Nominally this week, we're gonna talk about DRM,

68
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,040
about sort of the historical impact

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,420
I think it's gonna have,

70
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,840
and how Linux users could take a small

71
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,840
but important step today to make a change.

72
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,400
We'll talk about that later on in the show,

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,600
but before then, we got some news.

74
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,560
We got some community news we're gonna get into,

75
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,640
and we've got a Gentoo challenge.

76
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
How's it going over there, by the way, Wes?

77
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,440
Are you getting the virtual machine fired up?

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
Yes, I am.

79
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,360
So as the show progresses, Wes will be installing Gentoo

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,640
from a stage three install.

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,480
That's right.

82
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,960
Getting a base system running,

83
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,440
and then throughout the future weeks

84
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,920
of the Unplugged program, each episode,

85
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,060
another piece of the Gentoo puzzle will be clicked

86
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,960
into place, and we'll see how many episodes it takes

87
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,920
to get Wes Payne to a fully functional Gentoo system.

88
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm excited.

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,940
So starting off right now with episode one.

90
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,040
So 2.25 marks episode one of the Gentoo challenge.

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
Right now, right here.

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,280
We're gonna need to get a jingle for this.

93
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,960
We're gonna need a Gentoo challenge jingle.

94
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,800
So if you have any ideas, send us one.

95
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,400
And we're gonna, in the background,

96
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,120
we'll be doing that as we go through the news,

97
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,720
and we'll check in with you towards the end of the show

98
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,960
and just see how far you got, okay?

99
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Are you good with that?

100
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,640
You feel kumskies?

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,460
You kumskies with that?

102
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,820
I'm totally kumskies.

103
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,360
All right, well then before we go any further,

104
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,500
then you know what we gotta do.

105
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,020
We gotta bring in that virtual lug.

106
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,760
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

107
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,600
Hello.

108
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,920
Hello, hey.

109
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,600
Oh, oh, hello.

110
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,660
Oh, hello, everybody.

111
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,640
It is good to see you.

112
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,880
Thank you for being here.

113
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,160
Now, we got so much to talk about this week.

114
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,480
There's a big story.

115
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,900
It's one of these licensing stories

116
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,760
that makes like a lot of headlines

117
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,440
and a lot of people glaze over when it comes out,

118
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,500
but I think it's definitely worth talking about.

119
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Today, breaking news, ladies and gentlemen.

120
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,860
This is CNN Breaking News.

121
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,560
Press release from Red Hat over at redhat.com.

122
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,880
Facebook and Google, IBM, and Red Hat

123
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,680
have committed to providing a clause

124
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
to their GPL2 software that they ship.

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,320
And this clause has some familiar elements to it.

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,220
You may have heard us recently discuss

127
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,880
the Software Conservancy's agreement they got

128
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,240
with about 200 Linux kernel copyright holders

129
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,560
to try to work out with companies.

130
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,400
Yeah, right.

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,240
Smooth things out before you sue them.

132
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,440
We'll try all other avenues before we sue.

133
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,600
It was essentially this agreement

134
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,040
that took some clauses from the GPL3

135
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,920
and applied them in a signing statement

136
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,000
to the GPL2 software.

137
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,480
Well, now Red Hat and Facebook and Googs

138
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,600
and IBM have taken it a step further.

139
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,420
Red Hat writes on their blog,

140
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,500
this is gonna provide greater predictability

141
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,040
to users of open-source software.

142
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,760
Red Hat, Facebook, Google, and IBM today

143
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,380
each committed to extending the GPL3 approach

144
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,380
for licensing compliance errors to the software code

145
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,580
that each license under the GPL version two

146
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,080
and GPL, LGPL version two and version 2.1.

147
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,980
They're calling it a common cure rights commitment.

148
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,860
Boy, that's thick.

149
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,880
But what it essentially says is,

150
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,600
we'll try everything else first.

151
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,900
We'll work with you.

152
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,900
And Karen Sandler, she runs the Software Conservancy,

153
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,120
she was quoted in an article from the Register

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,760
that says, yeah, she's really thrilled

155
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,880
that companies are doing this,

156
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,440
that they're willing to take on dialogue

157
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,800
and upping their commitment to enforcement

158
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,360
in a way that is gonna actually work long-term.

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
And in the article from the Register,

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
they quote Red Hat, saying, Red Hat explained

161
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,640
that legal proceedings generally produce poor results

162
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,520
in the free software and open-source community.

163
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,760
And that litigation should always be avoided.

164
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Why I like this story is because it's a victory

165
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,160
for the nerds, it's a victory for the engineers,

166
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,560
it's a victory for the people who create things

167
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
and make things and write software,

168
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,560
it's a victory for the kernel developers,

169
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,320
because this is their preference.

170
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,680
I'm not here to tell you which approach is right.

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm here to tell you that the kernel developers,

172
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
they seem to appear to prefer this approach,

173
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,320
and that's good enough for me, good enough for me.

174
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,440
They wanna work with these companies first

175
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,600
before you try to sue them, because when you sue them,

176
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,000
they react badly, they retract from their involvement

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,280
in open-source, and they make shit worse for everybody.

178
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,760
Yeah, right, getting the lawyers involved

179
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,280
doesn't make new things happen

180
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,200
or improve anyone's experience or the software at all,

181
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
it just makes it worse.

182
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,920
You're in the legal system.

183
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,280
I felt this way for years.

184
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,400
When we had Greg KH on the Linux Action Show,

185
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,080
and this is something that he and I personally talked about,

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
it wasn't necessarily in the interview,

187
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,840
but it was something that he and I talked about off air,

188
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,280
was that these discussions take years and years and years,

189
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,280
but generally result in a internal advocacy

190
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,840
for respecting open-source licenses,

191
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,160
and that sort of blossoms into a change of culture

192
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,360
for a company and how they interact with open-source.

193
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,840
They interact with open-source projects,

194
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,160
and when you sue them,

195
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
what happens is you smack them in the face,

196
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,040
they retract from their involvement in open-source

197
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,560
because all of a sudden it becomes a business risk,

198
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
and you shut them down.

199
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,960
You poison the water.

200
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,200
Say it again? You poison the water.

201
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
You poison the water.

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,720
And the thing is, I don't really have a dog in this hunt,

203
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,920
but I know that the people that are writing the software do,

204
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,600
and this is the preference they have,

205
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,960
so it's really, really great to see Google and Facebook

206
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,160
and IBM and Red Hat all kind of go this way.

207
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,960
And the elephant in the room is,

208
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,600
well, what about this whole software freedom law center

209
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,680
versus the software conservancy lawsuit that's going on,

210
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
which a lot of people thought was sort of brought on

211
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,120
after this big agreement?

212
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,720
I don't know. I don't know.

213
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,200
But I think this is a really great move.

214
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,840
Also, unrelated, fuck the register.

215
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,040
This is a ridiculous stock image

216
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,400
that they have used for this post.

217
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
It's some attractive girl staring at her clock,

218
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,080
making some stupid face that you'd make for Instagram,

219
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,440
and they've slapped it on a story about GPL license laws

220
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,640
where they're quoting Karen and they're quoting other...

221
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,080
When you look at the Twitter preview,

222
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
it looks like this is a stock image.

223
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
This is supposed to be an image of Karen Sandler,

224
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,920
which it's not, and this is a weird image.

225
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,080
It's just inappropriate.

226
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,920
The register recently has been really pissing me off

227
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,360
with inaccurate coverage, and then now this. I don't like it.

228
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,720
I don't like it. I know they're trying to get clicks,

229
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,720
but do a better job. Do a better job.

230
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,400
Anyways, I think this is, plenty enough,

231
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,160
actually looking at the Twitter feed for Karen Sandler,

232
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,960
somebody pointed out what a bizarre stock photo

233
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
that the register used.

234
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
Because when you look at the preview on Twitter,

235
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,560
it totally looks like that's supposed to be Karen Sandler

236
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,520
because it's coming from the Software Freedom Conservancy

237
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,960
Center, and they're talking about Karen

238
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,600
getting quoted in the article,

239
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,400
and then there's this picture of the stock girl

240
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,280
who is wearing glasses that don't even have lenses in them

241
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,880
and is staring at a watch that's too big for her wrist.

242
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,080
It's just a really obnoxious photo.

243
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,800
Anyways, it's good to see Red Hat

244
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,040
and all those companies work together,

245
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,160
and I bet the real story here is how that happened.

246
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,880
How did those companies wind up in a room together to do this?

247
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,280
And what was the thing that started the conversation?

248
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,560
What was the seed to get Facebook and IBM and Google?

249
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,200
See, that's the thing.

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
They're big people with their own agendas.

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,040
Like if it was, yeah, if it's Twitter and Facebook

252
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,000
or Microsoft and Facebook, but Google and Facebook,

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,440
yeah, there's something bigger going on here.

254
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,640
There's a bigger story here that we,

255
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,840
the peeps, don't get to know about.

256
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,360
And hopefully it speaks well to their desire

257
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,800
to continue good relationships with the open source community,

258
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,320
both using and contributing back.

259
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,520
Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,520
I kind of am sick of the licensing stuff,

261
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,480
to be honest with you. I couldn't...

262
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,160
It's important, but it's like, at the end of the day,

263
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,320
that's not what we get excited about, right?

264
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,800
We want to get excited about the software.

265
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,160
It's like exercise. Like I know I need to do it,

266
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,400
and so I have to push through it.

267
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,040
All right, fine, I'll go for a fucking walk.

268
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,400
But I got to tell you, I don't really have any interest

269
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,440
in doing it. Like this licensing stuff,

270
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,440
there needs to be a Groklaw of 2018 that is concise

271
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,560
and needs to tell us why this stuff matters.

272
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,800
So that way I can quote them,

273
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,440
so that way I don't have to read through all this shit

274
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,400
and then tell you guys about it.

275
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,960
Because it's just like slogging.

276
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,920
I know, first world problem, right?

277
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,400
Speaking of first world problem,

278
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,800
how do you finance your open source project?

279
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,360
How do you make money doing open source?

280
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,560
How can you do open source full time?

281
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
Well, we found a guide this week.

282
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
Did you find this or did I find this?

283
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm not sure.

284
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
I don't remember either.

285
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
I think they have both stumbled upon it.

286
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,880
Maybe, maybe.

287
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,160
This is a handy financial guide for open source projects

288
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,640
and it's up on GitHub.

289
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
And in the pre-show, I was talking with Dan

290
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,420
from Elementary OS, and I was telling Dan

291
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,720
that one of the things that I actually really respect

292
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,840
about Elementary OS is that they're brave enough

293
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,920
to ask for money for their hard work.

294
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
And I think initially people push back.

295
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,280
I was like, well, what is Elementary OS doing?

296
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,120
What are they doing?

297
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,480
They're just an Ubuntu re-spin.

298
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,640
Obviously misunderstanding all of the hard work

299
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
that goes into it, but the people that get it

300
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,800
wanna pay, they wanna support something like this.

301
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,120
But how do you ask for money?

302
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,720
How do you do that in a way that isn't offensive

303
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,700
and in a way that doesn't seem unreasonable

304
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,480
for something that is free by its very license?

305
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,000
And so this is a massive guide.

306
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,240
This is actually legitimately worth your time.

307
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,560
And it breaks us down into 16 different areas.

308
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,200
16 different areas.

309
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,280
Number one would be you can just take a donation button

310
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,420
and you're gonna get the pros and cons

311
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,460
about each one of these.

312
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,720
You can have bounties.

313
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
You can have crowdfunding one time.

314
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,280
You can have crowdfunding reoccurring.

315
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,120
You can have merch, books, advertising, sponsorships.

316
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
You can get hired by a company to work on a project.

317
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,400
You can start a project while you're currently employed.

318
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,760
You can have grants, consulting services,

319
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,240
software as a service, freemium licenses,

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,840
dual licenses, open core foundations, maybe VC.

321
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,680
There's a lot of options.

322
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, and it shows you examples of all of them too.

323
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,720
So Dan, I know you just had like five minutes

324
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,800
with the article, but did anything jump out at you?

325
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,680
Any warning signs or do you think this is maybe

326
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,880
a solid guide to point people at?

327
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,240
No, I've been poking through it while you guys

328
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
have been doing all the rest of the show

329
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,520
and it's really comprehensive.

330
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,960
She does a really good job going through

331
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,200
and saying hey, this is what's good about this,

332
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,880
but this is also what's bad about going this route

333
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
and gives a lot of alternatives.

334
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,200
You get a sense of a lot of research.

335
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
I mean a lot of research when it's like

336
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,960
she must have gone out there and surveyed

337
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,760
a lot of open source projects and seen how they're doing.

338
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,400
Yeah, absolutely.

339
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,400
But I think one of the things that is kind of glossed over,

340
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,840
I guess, but that I would definitely recommend

341
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
for anybody thinking about how to fund

342
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,360
their open source product is to try as many as they can,

343
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,040
as long as it doesn't go against your project goals.

344
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,960
Because she does talk about with advertising and stuff,

345
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,960
maybe that conflicts with your project stances

346
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,080
on how they feel about whatever.

347
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,720
But just try a lot of different things and see what sticks.

348
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,940
Dan, what do you think about this advice

349
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,880
for an open source project is think of your,

350
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,800
asking for contributions not from random strangers,

351
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,040
but from community members you've engaged with.

352
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
Which means you're gonna have to up

353
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,220
your community engagement,

354
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,720
you're gonna have to up your community game,

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,840
but you're not asking for the drive-by donators.

356
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,720
What you're asking for is people that have

357
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,960
engaged with the project, that become fans,

358
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,720
they're advocates of the project,

359
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,460
they use it themselves, they find importance with it.

360
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,620
Those are really the people you want donations from

361
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,120
because those are the ones that are gonna be motivated

362
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,520
to keep the project alive, right?

363
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,640
Yeah, I mean, I think that's the big,

364
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,820
you're gonna get your recurring stuff from them, right?

365
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,400
So your merchandising or if you're on Patreon

366
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,320
or anything like that, those are definitely the people

367
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,200
that you wanna look at for things like that.

368
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,800
I can tell you though that our number one

369
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,120
method of revenue right now is the pay what you want

370
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
on our website.

371
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,880
And it's a lot more than what we get from Patreon.

372
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,480
Really, more than Patreon?

373
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,600
Even though Patreon's reoccurring.

374
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Now, that must be cyclical though.

375
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,480
And that must be tied to release cycles because-

376
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
Yes, absolutely.

377
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,320
Yeah, which when you do that, now you have to predict,

378
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,840
you know, what does that money actually mean per month?

379
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,320
Doesn't that make staffing significantly harder?

380
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Like there's so many like hard things to predict

381
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,120
because you don't know if say the elementary OS released

382
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,560
based on 1804 is gonna be a huge hit or not.

383
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,380
Maybe all the attention will be on stock Ubuntu.

384
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,600
Yeah, so in that way, you kind of have to, you know,

385
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,480
look at, you know, what past releases did

386
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,000
and you can only guess, you know,

387
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,060
based on what information you already have.

388
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,640
So if you haven't been fundraising for a few years already,

389
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,440
you don't really have a base to go off of, you know,

390
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,480
it can be scary at first figuring out

391
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,280
how much money do you even really have?

392
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,080
You also have to sort of sum up your worth

393
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,040
and say, how valuable am I versus the other things

394
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,880
that are out there?

395
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,800
That can be, you have to be pretty humble

396
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,760
when you do that, don't you think?

397
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,980
Yeah, and I think that's a huge part of your marketing

398
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,960
as a project is actually pitching your value proposition.

399
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,920
What do users get by supporting you?

400
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,000
Why should they do it?

401
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
Why should they do it continually

402
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,040
if you're raising money on something like Patreon?

403
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,540
That's one of the cons that she points out

404
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,360
and this list is on something like Patreon,

405
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,240
it can be unclear.

406
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,120
Why do people wanna continually give you money?

407
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,560
What is it exactly that they're funding?

408
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,400
Yeah, and she points out that it usually taps out,

409
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
they're like, there seems to be like sort of a maximum

410
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,440
that you're gonna get there

411
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,840
and that's just about as much saturation as you get.

412
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,260
And I would say too, just been, you know,

413
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,880
doing this now for a while,

414
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,840
and something that I could do a lot, lot better at

415
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,220
and creators like Philip DeFranco are much better at it

416
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,640
than I am, is diversify constantly,

417
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,080
always be looking for new avenues to try merchandise or,

418
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,760
not, and again, and this is something

419
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
I think people fuck up a lot,

420
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,360
is don't do it from the standpoint of

421
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,260
how the hell do I milk these people for all they worth?

422
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,960
But think about it from the standpoint of

423
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,220
people who get what I'm doing are my target,

424
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,960
I wanna sell to people who I'm already engaging with

425
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,200
and what is it that would,

426
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,580
and this is a douchebaggy term,

427
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,200
but this is really how you gotta think about it,

428
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,080
what would delight them?

429
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,800
Right, what would get them like,

430
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,920
what would get them like fired up?

431
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,020
Like, yeah, that's a great idea.

432
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,320
Like, could you do something funny with a t-shirt?

433
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,040
Then that's merch that's worth selling.

434
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,000
You know, if you're just gonna put a basic bitch logo

435
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,080
on there and put it over the,

436
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,840
which I've done plenty of times,

437
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
you know, why are you bothering?

438
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,360
You know, they could go make that themselves these days

439
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,460
if they really wanted that.

440
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,560
You know, I'll offer something different there

441
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,240
if you're gonna diversify.

442
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,300
And it involves a lot of reflection,

443
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,160
it involves a lot of understanding

444
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
of what your target audience wants

445
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,440
and what they're generating value from.

446
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,840
And when you understand those things,

447
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,640
you can tend to sell well to those people.

448
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,280
And it's not because you're selling them,

449
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,640
it's because you're providing something they already want.

450
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,080
And you just have to kind of connect

451
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,320
with where they're at and do that.

452
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,200
And if that may be bugs, it could be a bug,

453
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,920
that could be a bug bounty program.

454
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,000
It doesn't have to necessarily be merchandise.

455
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
There's a lot of options there.

456
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,880
So definitely take a look at this guide

457
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,680
because myself, and I bet, of course, Dan feels this way,

458
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,400
but I know a lot of others do too.

459
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,380
I want to see more people making money

460
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,560
from open source than we've ever seen before.

461
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,080
Wouldn't that be a thing, like if by the end of 2018,

462
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,040
it's considered a viable business model

463
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,240
to make a living producing open source software

464
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,120
for independent.

465
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,640
I really, really, really, really think

466
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,980
the next few years are gonna be a great opportunity

467
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,320
for people that can go independent and work for themselves,

468
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,760
be a contractor or be their own business or whatever

469
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,640
that aren't reliant on a standard paycheck.

470
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,720
I think just at least here in the States,

471
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,380
this is obviously a very US centric view,

472
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,240
but I think here in the States,

473
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,760
people that are self employable,

474
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,220
people that can self produce

475
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,960
and generate their own sources of income

476
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,200
and diversify multiple sources of income

477
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
are gonna have the best chance going forward.

478
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,380
And there would be a huge benefit to open source

479
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,040
if one of the ways you could make independent living

480
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,060
as somebody who has some software development skills

481
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,880
is by developing open source software.

482
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,080
And this guide could help people figure it out

483
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,400
because it's a bunch of really hard learned lessons

484
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,320
over the last decade, all compiled

485
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
into 16 different categories.

486
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,160
And it's stuff that when I read through this

487
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,200
resonates with my personal experience

488
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,760
and resonates with stories I've heard

489
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,280
from developers in open source.

490
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
And so it's one of these things where

491
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,040
it's a rare opportunity to get about a decade's worth

492
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,560
of hard learned lessons in one solid read

493
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,760
if you're trying to do this yourself.

494
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,160
And my personal bias is really,

495
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,520
I just wanna see more people making money

496
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
developing open source.

497
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,640
Well, I actually would like to see

498
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,040
a little bit of a different approach also taken

499
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,800
because I feel that a lot of projects start

500
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,800
with this concept of just designing the software

501
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,440
that they are passionate about.

502
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,720
Of course, that is all that open source is about,

503
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,320
but I think there's a big difference

504
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,800
between making a business and making what you love.

505
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,920
You can sometimes merge the two.

506
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,760
And unfortunately-

507
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,440
Sometimes you shouldn't really, to be honest.

508
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,840
There's a reason why I don't have a Star Trek podcast.

509
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,840
The whole thing is when you decide to make it a business,

510
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,960
you actually have to come up with a business plan

511
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,840
that is viable.

512
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,080
And this is actually the problem number one

513
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
for most people, in my opinion,

514
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,000
when they come up with their open source projects,

515
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,320
they start with the ideas of how can I get donations

516
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,600
as soon as they start seeing the project

517
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,960
getting some traction,

518
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,520
and they're already succumbed into a place

519
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,480
that they can't really charge well for their product.

520
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,520
If you're a business, you need capital first

521
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,440
when you start developing.

522
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
You do an investment,

523
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
then you expect the return of that investment.

524
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,040
And people don't even contemplate

525
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,000
how much of that investment they're doing themselves

526
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,080
is worth it.

527
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
That's why they don't have a way of calculating the price

528
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,080
that they should be charging.

529
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,960
Yes, that's very true.

530
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,880
I've been there myself.

531
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,880
They actually don't look out for how to,

532
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,360
how to actually start seeing, for example,

533
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,920
if there's actually people interested,

534
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,360
the people that are willing to put their money

535
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,040
where their mouth is.

536
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,680
Oftentimes, they go around and ask,

537
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,880
would you like to see that happen?

538
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,080
People say, yeah, I would buy that.

539
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,800
Then it's done and people don't pay.

540
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,520
The developer goes like, oh, I got fooled on this.

541
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,080
Of course, people could get it for free.

542
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,280
They would get it for free.

543
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,960
Bashful Robot, you have some thoughts on sustainability

544
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,320
and some pushback on it.

545
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,880
And then I'll go back to you, dear Devlin.

546
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,640
Go ahead, Bashful.

547
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,960
All I was really gonna say is you look at some people,

548
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
like the sustainability loops back

549
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,800
to what you were saying before

550
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,600
with why they're asking for donations.

551
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
So that was kind of like one little point

552
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,280
was just that maybe that's the approach to take.

553
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,200
Then the other point was the pushback.

554
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,720
Like, for example, I don't know if you're familiar

555
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,640
with what happened with the Caddy project, but-

556
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,480
No, could you give me a background on that?

557
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,320
Yeah, a little bit.

558
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,440
So Caddy is an HTTP2 server written in Go.

559
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,480
Mark Bates is the author and it was open source.

560
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,440
And he basically started building out

561
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,280
or attempting to build out a business behind it.

562
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,600
And the only form of sponsorship was like an HTTP header

563
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,160
that they just injected in there.

564
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,480
So a lot of people got super PO

565
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,280
that they thought it was gonna be like a closed source thing.

566
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,200
They didn't like the header,

567
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,960
which in some ways I can sort of see,

568
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,880
but then he just basically got raked over the coals

569
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,920
trying to find a way to monetize

570
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,120
and continue on with the work.

571
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,560
And you think there's some entitlement there?

572
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,640
Yeah, I think so because if you look at,

573
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,040
like people get something for free

574
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,200
and you could even take that

575
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,480
and look at it from the point of view of like support.

576
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,720
And a lot of people are doing this in their spare time

577
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,880
and they almost expect you to answer like immediately,

578
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
or they expect you to fix the bug immediately

579
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,800
or add the feature set and along those lines.

580
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,160
And it's kind of like now, now, now,

581
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,600
whereas anyone may have like five different things

582
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,000
that they're trying to do.

583
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,840
And it's not necessarily just that one project.

584
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,320
Or if you look at some of the other people,

585
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,640
like even like Wimpy and them who work full-time

586
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,640
for Canonical, they've got certain obligations there.

587
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,040
Plus, he's got Monte and all the other stuff

588
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,520
that he's got his fingers in.

589
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,160
Like he's, I don't know how he does it, to be honest.

590
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,120
Wimpy, you are a machine, that is for sure.

591
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
Yeah.

592
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
Derek Delvin, I wanted to let you finish your thought though

593
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,880
because I know you were kind of wrapping that up.

594
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,120
So basically it's like actually one of his last point

595
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,600
that is actually also about setting expectations.

596
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,240
And the other thing, unfortunately, that I see happening

597
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,200
is that people often forget

598
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,920
how the GPL was intended to be monetized.

599
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,360
It is the developer gets paid to write code,

600
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,400
not developer gets paid for releases

601
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,240
or for versions or licensing.

602
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,480
And a lot of these models that people come up

603
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,320
with open source is like, oh, I'm about to download

604
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,240
and they, you know, everybody chooses what they want,

605
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,200
but I'm about to download so I give a donation.

606
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,880
It's equivalent of paying for the current version

607
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,320
or current license.

608
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,960
And that is kind of what leads to most of the problems.

609
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,760
So if you actually come with a value proposition

610
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,000
of code gets written upon payment

611
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,800
and this is what it costs to produce these code,

612
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,520
then you could either only invest in it

613
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,760
if you effectively got the money.

614
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,920
And in that way you could support sustainably

615
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,840
your development and it would be like any other contract.

616
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,480
Stallman has talked about these over and over.

617
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,160
The idea is to get developers to get paid to write code

618
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,520
so that then the ownership is true.

619
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,160
The person who paid for the code has ownership over it.

620
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,840
So Dan, do you think as a project,

621
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,880
there is messaging here to that if you just position

622
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,920
the project and make it clear

623
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,400
that these are our resources, this is our availability,

624
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,480
is that the solution to entitlement Dan

625
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
or is it deeper than that?

626
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,560
Yeah, I absolutely think messaging is super important.

627
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,120
I mean, you know firsthand that a few years ago

628
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,400
we had some terrible messaging and came on your show

629
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,720
to try to fix it because it was so bad

630
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,720
and had huge pushback and it still burned us to this day.

631
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,920
Yeah, yeah, just recently in a Reddit thread

632
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,600
you and I were talking about somebody brought it up

633
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,240
and it's like, come on.

634
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
Yeah. It's just ancient history.

635
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,280
But definitely figuring out how to navigate around

636
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,080
these are not the good ways to communicate

637
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,200
and these are the good ways to communicate

638
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,360
and being able to express to people

639
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,080
about how you want to meet their expectations

640
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,680
and you want to provide the features

641
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,680
and that it isn't that you don't care

642
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,200
because they want to know that you care about them

643
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,040
and that you're trying and to explain

644
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,200
that this is the best that we can do

645
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,240
with the resources we have and if we had these resources

646
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,360
then we would be able to do that thing

647
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,280
and try to make it a negotiation.

648
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,960
You're so right, Dan,

649
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,000
because you guys have been a case study of that.

650
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,180
So, I mean, that is 100% legitimate experience

651
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,360
that you have and I cannot disagree with that.

652
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,160
It's kind of funny if you think about it

653
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,420
because I can't really think of,

654
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,940
I'm gonna give a second before I say this out loud,

655
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,360
but I can't think of two other projects

656
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,800
that are better at explaining

657
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,840
why the hell you should pay for them

658
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,560
than elementary OS and Ubuntu MATE.

659
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,640
So Wimpy's posts, I'll tell you what I like

660
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,380
about Wimpy's posts for the Ubuntu MATE project on Patreon

661
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,880
that have inspired me now for a couple of years

662
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,960
and I still haven't gotten my shit together

663
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,000
on how to do this for Jupiter broadcasting,

664
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
but Wimpy will say, we spent $126 to this guy

665
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,960
or whatever to develop this feature

666
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,040
and we spent a hundred and whatever with this project

667
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,520
and we sent this much of your money to this project.

668
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,560
Wimpy, did you have an intentional rationale

669
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,400
behind those posts to specifically say

670
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,640
this is the value you're getting from your contribution?

671
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,720
Was there like some reflection you did to say,

672
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,940
I need to tell people what they're getting

673
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,140
with their contribution?

674
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,860
Is he there?

675
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,920
It was such a good question.

676
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,760
It really was.

677
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,920
It was a great question.

678
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,880
That's okay, it's okay.

679
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Go ahead, Eric.

680
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,040
I know you wanna jump in, so I'll jump to you.

681
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,560
Go ahead.

682
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,960
Yeah, well, I mean, I can speak to a lot of this.

683
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,320
I work full time for an online education company,

684
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,360
but on the side, I own an IT consulting business.

685
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Oh, okay.

686
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,780
And that consulting business recently,

687
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,780
actually day before yesterday, just lost our best client

688
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,240
because even though I took time off from my day job,

689
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,800
like took vacation time in the middle of the day

690
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,000
to go and help with what they considered was an emergency.

691
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,920
It ended up being something fairly simple,

692
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,760
but to them, it was an emergency.

693
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,160
And so I left my day job to go help them out.

694
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,920
And it ended up being Windows 10 Home Edition

695
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,000
was their problem.

696
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,640
They bought a computer that I didn't recommend

697
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,280
and they got Windows 10 Home instead of Windows 10 Pro.

698
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:47,280
And to be honest, I went into the situation

699
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,560
not having my ducks in a row

700
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,880
because I tried to pitch switching to Linux,

701
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,240
getting away from all the licensing with Microsoft

702
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,000
and that kind of thing and supporting open source.

703
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,760
And they basically fluffed it off as,

704
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,280
well, that Linux thing that's just for nerds.

705
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,120
I've been there.

706
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,160
Yep, I'm really sorry.

707
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
That sucks.

708
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Losing a client too is like the worst thing ever,

709
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,120
especially when they don't follow your recommendations.

710
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,160
That is the worst, yeah.

711
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,120
I'm sorry to hear that, Eric.

712
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
Wimpy, sounds like you have your situation sorted, sir.

713
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,320
Do you remember my question?

714
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,000
I do, yes.

715
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,960
It always helps to remember

716
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,800
which key you've bound to push to talk.

717
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,640
I love it.

718
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,760
I love it, push to talk.

719
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,740
Well, it's good to hear you and yeah, please run with it.

720
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,160
Yes, my intention with those messages that we send out

721
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,520
is to exactly explain to the patrons

722
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,400
how the money is being spent,

723
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,400
but more importantly, the value that that has to the project.

724
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,680
And oftentimes the way that the money is being used

725
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,760
is to fund development that the teams

726
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,120
that are involved right now

727
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,200
who volunteer their timeframe freely

728
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,480
wouldn't have time to do if they weren't incentivized

729
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,640
or compensated in some way

730
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,680
in order to work on those projects.

731
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Now, do you agree with my assessment

732
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,320
that the way to think about a patron

733
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
or some other sort of reoccurring contribution

734
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,480
to an open source project is if you reframe it

735
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,880
as they're your client

736
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,000
and you need to constantly remind your client

737
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
why their contribution or their patronage of you is useful.

738
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,000
Like you're communicating to them on an ongoing basis.

739
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,580
It's almost a sales position.

740
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,560
It's really sort of doing sales,

741
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
but in a more genuine way.

742
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,200
I don't mean to like douchebag it up a little bit,

743
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,100
but don't you feel like it's kind of like

744
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,000
a client relationship that you're reselling your value to?

745
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
It really is.

746
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,960
I mean, there are months when I don't get the time

747
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,520
to post a patron as detailed as I would like

748
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,280
or as regularly as I would like.

749
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,240
And when you get a couple of months off the back like that,

750
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,560
you do see people reining in their support.

751
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,040
So they'll reduce their contributions

752
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,600
or they will opt out entirely.

753
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,180
So it is very much a client management relationship

754
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,480
in that respect for some people at least.

755
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,320
Yeah.

756
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,480
And I don't know, those are just sort of my insights.

757
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
And I think Wimpy's and Dan's insights

758
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,960
that if you wanna try to monetize an open source project

759
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
or something like that, just things to consider.

760
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,080
And boy, I'd love to see more people be successful.

761
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,480
I try to back as many people as I can on Patreon.

762
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,560
It's getting to be that point.

763
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,520
Absolutely.

764
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
But I try to because I really wanna see more people

765
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,200
be successful and wanna see people do this long term.

766
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,460
Sounds like we have more thoughts on this.

767
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,680
So Eric and others, let's take it up in the post-show.

768
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,500
Save it, please.

769
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,680
Don't mind me because I will forget by the time we get there

770
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,600
because right now I gotta stop

771
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,560
and take a moment and thank Linux Academy.

772
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,440
And to be honest with you,

773
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,080
I'm so excited about freaking Linux Academy

774
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
that I'm not gonna remember what we wanted to talk about

775
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,680
because it's finally here.

776
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,800
Finally, a platform to learn more about Linux

777
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,720
that's been created by Linux enthusiasts,

778
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,280
has been developed by developers

779
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,560
that really, really know their ass.

780
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,520
Like they can build complicated systems

781
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,280
that match courseware and distros and virtual machines.

782
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,200
And they all bring it together in a platform

783
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,360
that teaches you everything around Linux

784
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,360
to make money and to be more successful in your career.

785
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,200
It's Linux Academy.

786
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,160
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin

787
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,320
or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

788
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,900
OpenStack and DevOps,

789
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,520
a sharp skillset is an absolute necessity to succeed.

790
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,960
Meet Linux Academy,

791
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,840
an online Linux and cloud training platform

792
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,520
that uses self-paced video courses and hands-on labs

793
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
to give you real-world experience

794
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
for a wide range of skills.

795
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,120
Train for your certification,

796
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,000
learn the latest DevOps tools

797
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,360
and grow your skillset to do better work.

798
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,200
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

799
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,040
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system

800
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,080
allow you to learn hands-on.

801
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,400
We also have full-time human instructors

802
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,640
who answer questions and help you earn that certification

803
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,180
or promotion at work.

804
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,900
We add new training every week

805
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,680
so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

806
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,160
Sysadmins of every experience level use Linux Academy

807
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,400
to stay on the bleeding edge of the Linux ecosystem.

808
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,840
You should too.

809
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,680
While you're laughing,

810
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,560
the hackers are dropping malware into your system.

811
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,920
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug

812
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,200
to get a free seven-day trial and support the show.

813
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,840
Try out their hands-on labs,

814
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,900
their testing for certs, their courseware,

815
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,040
their downloadable comprehensive study guides.

816
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,520
It's amazing, you guys.

817
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,280
Old young, or I should say young Chris

818
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,640
would envy old Chris, which is present Chris.

819
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
It's complicated for the Linux Academy.

820
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,520
I mean, it's one of the things

821
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,840
that I just couldn't even imagine

822
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,680
when I was getting started.

823
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,480
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

824
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,240
Oh, thank you Linux Academy

825
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,040
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

826
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,880
So the folks over at ours decided to review Ubuntu 17.10.

827
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,360
It's about time.

828
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Scott Gilbertson posted on November 27th,

829
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,840
just a couple of days ago, at 4.30 in the morning,

830
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,600
his review of Ubuntu 17.10.

831
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,080
Now, who do you suppose that's about?

832
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,800
4.30 in the morning, that's really something.

833
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,520
And I find it to be interesting

834
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,440
to just get like sort of an outside the bubble take

835
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,920
on the Ubuntu 17.10 release.

836
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,360
That's sort of what I thought was fascinating about this,

837
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,840
sort of outside the bubble.

838
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,680
And there's a couple of elements of this review

839
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,780
that jumped out at me.

840
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,340
What was his name?

841
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,820
His name was Scott.

842
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,500
So Scott writes, in light of the gnome switch,

843
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,780
this really seems more like a homecoming

844
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,700
than an entirely new voyage.

845
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,380
More like a homecoming.

846
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,520
Yeah, I kind of agree.

847
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,800
It does kind of feel like more like a return to gnome.

848
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,640
Yeah, it really does.

849
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,440
Yeah, and a return to community-inspired design

850
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,540
and building and packaging, right?

851
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,560
And feature sets.

852
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,400
One of the things that when Dustin Kirkland

853
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,880
was going around and doing the survey

854
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,400
and asking what people wanted on Ubuntu,

855
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,160
the thing that really stood out to me is,

856
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,600
ah, this feels like old Ubuntu.

857
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,320
This feels like old, early days Ubuntu.

858
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,400
The whole entire thing felt like that to me.

859
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,320
So I completely agreed with Scott's take here.

860
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,080
It's like more of a return, really.

861
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,880
He goes on to write a couple other interesting points.

862
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,000
A recent call for community input

863
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,360
on the new Ubuntu desktop theme seems to message a point

864
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,800
about the new Ubuntu desktop,

865
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,200
one that's more community-centric.

866
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,200
And then he writes,

867
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,000
Canonical got rid of most of its design team.

868
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,120
So in one sense, it has no choice

869
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,760
but to farm these things out to the community.

870
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,600
Ha ha!

871
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,480
Pobie, I don't know if you wanted to,

872
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,880
in your personal opinion,

873
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,440
did you want to respond to that particular line

874
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,260
in this review?

875
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,640
Because that's a bold statement right there.

876
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,140
Canonical got rid of the desktop team.

877
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,160
No more designers working on the desktop.

878
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,400
And their only option now is to cheap it out

879
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,320
and go to the community for a theme.

880
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,640
What do you think of that?

881
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,120
Yeah, it's not the first time I've heard people say that.

882
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,960
People have said in the past similar kind of things

883
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,260
about how we don't have a design team

884
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,080
or the design team don't care.

885
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,000
There's always some reason,

886
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,780
there's always some ulterior motive

887
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,720
for why we're asking the community for input.

888
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,060
It can't possibly be that we're just asking them

889
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,480
because we value their opinion as users

890
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,860
and experts in the field.

891
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,680
Like that can't possibly be the reason why we're asking.

892
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,840
Yeah, it does seem to be like there's an assumption,

893
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,440
just an assumption.

894
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Now, would you acknowledge that it does,

895
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,720
I think some of that comes from this recent restructuring

896
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,040
at Canonical where people just kind of,

897
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,000
it's people don't know from the outside.

898
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,820
They don't really know who's left

899
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,000
and who's working on what.

900
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
So they just make their assumptions from the outside

901
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,300
that, well, they got rid of the Unity 8 folks,

902
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,040
they got rid of the people working on artwork

903
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,280
and now they just have the core team of people

904
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,560
that we hear about and that's it.

905
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,520
And so they have to do this.

906
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,620
I mean, the perspective seems reasonable to me

907
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,440
just completely from the outside.

908
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,760
To some degree, we did downsize to some degree back in April

909
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,400
and that was a struggle.

910
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,800
And there are people who were lost

911
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,560
through all areas of the business.

912
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,020
So some, yep, certainly some people were lost from design

913
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,520
and some people lost from the desktop team

914
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,100
and some people lost from all other parts of the company.

915
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,900
It wasn't just, if you worked on Unity 8,

916
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,160
you're out the door and that's it.

917
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,560
There were people lost from all over the place

918
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,540
and that was difficult for us.

919
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:55,540
But the thing about Unity 7 and theming and stuff,

920
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,940
we haven't made a lot of effort in Unity 7 changes

921
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,880
for a number of years.

922
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,860
Like we haven't, it's been mostly maintenance mode

923
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,520
for some time because our focus was on other things

924
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,040
like the phone, for example.

925
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,480
And we spent a lot of time cultivating a community

926
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,800
around the phone and now we're no longer doing that.

927
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,680
We've refocused back on the desktop.

928
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,880
It's not like we stopped asking the community for input.

929
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,280
It's just that our focus was on something else

930
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,240
and yeah, we've refocused.

931
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,720
So his comments about returning home

932
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,480
and coming back to the Ubuntu of old,

933
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,840
that's not unsurprising given that we're no longer working

934
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,600
on things that some people thought we shouldn't

935
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,280
have been working on in the first place.

936
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,120
Right, right.

937
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,360
I think when you look at it in a wider context,

938
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,040
you look at people that are also on the new community site

939
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,720
that are discussing, what do you wanna see from Mir?

940
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,960
What do you think about a Unity 7 remix of 1804?

941
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,500
When you look at the discussions that are taking place

942
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,440
on the new community portal or hub,

943
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,880
what's the, what should I call it, Poppy?

944
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,720
What do I call it?

945
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,560
The new community hub.

946
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
When you look at all of the discussions

947
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,280
that are taking place, then the theme discussion fits in

948
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,160
as just one of many wide ranging discussions

949
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,440
that are now taking place.

950
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,280
But when you look at it in, it's in just,

951
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,640
if you look at just the theme discussion,

952
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,200
it looks like, oh, we're tossing it to the community.

953
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,080
And when in reality, you guys are seeking input

954
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
on like three or four different topics

955
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,280
that I can think of just off the top of my head right now.

956
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,680
And it's a change, you're right.

957
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,300
What it is, is it's a behavior change

958
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,480
from the last few years.

959
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,560
It's an adjustment to a behavior change.

960
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,120
Yeah, and part of the reason why we changed

961
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,360
and rebooted the community website

962
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,060
was because it didn't lend itself particularly well.

963
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,920
I mean, something I've said to other people recently

964
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,680
is that a lot of this engagement happened

965
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,120
over the last few years.

966
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,360
You just didn't see it.

967
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,180
It just wasn't particularly visible.

968
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,480
It was buried on IRC channels.

969
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,680
There were conversations happening

970
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,120
in an Ubuntu desktop IRC channel on FreeNode,

971
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,120
while the conversation was happening on a mailing list

972
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,640
somewhere, it's public, but nobody found it.

973
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,680
And it wasn't particularly easy to engage with.

974
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,080
Modern projects are using things like Slack,

975
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,280
like discourse to make it easier for members

976
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,560
of the community to get on board and voice their opinion

977
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,600
and say, yeah, I'd like to help.

978
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,280
If the way you get on board is, well, first of all,

979
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,100
you've got to sign up to this mailman mailing list,

980
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,240
then people are gonna be like, no, screw that.

981
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,200
I don't even use email anymore.

982
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,880
Right, and so part of this is planned.

983
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,560
You know, we wanted to make it easier,

984
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,280
the onboarding process, the whole reason

985
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,680
why the Community Hub exists is to make it easier

986
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,340
for that onboarding process so that we can start

987
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,240
having initiatives which are, you know, new design

988
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,880
or get involved in a new flavor,

989
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,160
or what should we do about this feature,

990
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,040
or what should we do about this particular

991
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,360
piece of software?

992
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,880
It's to make it easier for people to engage with us.

993
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,720
And people are engaging, as you've said.

994
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,800
Can I ask you something?

995
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,720
Oh, go ahead, go ahead.

996
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,440
I'd just like to add to that as well.

997
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,380
What makes contributing to the themes so sacred?

998
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,640
Why is it that all of the community members

999
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,960
that contribute translations or file bugs

1000
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,740
or submit patches or work on the upstream code

1001
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,260
that Ubuntu and many other distributions are made of,

1002
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,920
why is it that that kind of contribution is fine,

1003
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,640
but suddenly asking people to work on themes

1004
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,480
is suddenly taboo and you've sold out,

1005
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,400
you've thrown it all to the community,

1006
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,560
you don't care anymore?

1007
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,520
I guess because the fantasy is that Canonical

1008
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,760
has like these super high-end developers

1009
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,840
that are secretly using Macs with Adobe Photoshop

1010
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
to create themes that we don't have.

1011
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,680
I don't know.

1012
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,340
No, I don't think it's that.

1013
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,880
I think it's that for some reason people have it

1014
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,100
in their head that design is not a thing

1015
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,440
that people contribute for the love

1016
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,480
of wanting to contribute.

1017
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,720
You have to pay designers.

1018
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
That's the only way to get good design

1019
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,820
is you have to pay them.

1020
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,480
Yet software developers, people who provide patches,

1021
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,040
people who do translations, people who write documentation,

1022
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,080
they can all do it for free for the love of it

1023
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,000
in their spare time, but designers, no,

1024
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,040
you have to pay them.

1025
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,280
And I think it's a ludicrous assertion

1026
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,000
that these are entirely separate different people

1027
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,320
that have to be paid.

1028
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,400
I'm not saying never pay them,

1029
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
but the assertion that for some reason

1030
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,140
we shouldn't be able to ask the community

1031
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,760
to give us help in the areas of design

1032
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,700
in the same way that we ask people to help us translate,

1033
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,440
patch, test ISOs and write documentation,

1034
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,340
I think is bizarre.

1035
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,500
Okay, all right, that's a pretty good point.

1036
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,820
Yeah, it's just a sort of a reframing

1037
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,940
of how you think about it.

1038
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,160
So Dan, I think you and I would agree on one point,

1039
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,960
the biggest point of branding could be the theme.

1040
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,720
Like this is where Ubuntu could really kind of be,

1041
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,260
you see it and it's obviously Ubuntu.

1042
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,640
So it's not really even, it's not a theme,

1043
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,720
it's an experience, isn't it?

1044
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,220
It's like the Ubuntu experience.

1045
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,640
And it seems like owning that is pretty critical

1046
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,920
to have a desktop that's truly an Ubuntu feeling,

1047
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,220
like it's the heart of Ubuntu.

1048
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,360
Yeah, and honestly, I mean, my personal stance is

1049
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,480
themes are dead, it doesn't really,

1050
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,280
like style sheets are API these days,

1051
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,200
they're important for applications.

1052
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,560
And I think your style sheet and your icons

1053
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,940
are just as important as any other component

1054
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,740
of the desktop environment.

1055
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,440
You wouldn't say, I mean, when you,

1056
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,160
when Canonical decided to stop doing Unity 8,

1057
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,400
they didn't say, okay, community,

1058
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,300
come up with a new desktop environment, you know?

1059
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,140
Right.

1060
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,400
Like that's, it's important work

1061
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,220
that you just don't hold a contest for.

1062
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,080
You know, like there has to be a direction and a vision

1063
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,440
and they said, hey, we're gonna go with GNOME

1064
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,280
and then took feedback

1065
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,140
on how are we gonna present GNOME, right?

1066
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,440
And then they didn't leave that up to a vote

1067
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,360
or hold a contest or anything like that, right?

1068
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,260
It was, well, let's take the feedback into consideration

1069
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,680
and let's, you know, do surveys

1070
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,720
and there it was much more of a directed effort.

1071
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,800
And I think that's probably what people are objecting to

1072
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,200
is it kind of seems like, it's like,

1073
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,040
ah, you know, we don't care, it's just paint, you know?

1074
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,100
Yeah, but what if, and I know this is a long shot,

1075
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,000
but what if you can end up with something

1076
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,960
that's like 90% there and it's pretty damn good

1077
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,720
and you take your own internal team

1078
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,240
and you round off that last 10% and you make it great

1079
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,400
and then you over the next three LTS releases,

1080
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,000
I mean, I'm talking a really long-term scale here,

1081
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,360
you make it specifically the Ubuntu branded desktop theme.

1082
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,520
And it, but it starts with, the thing that I like

1083
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,960
about going to the community about this is,

1084
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,840
well, let's get the most modern takes

1085
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,920
on what makes the best theme.

1086
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,120
Like let's get the Arc people involved,

1087
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,800
let's get the Mocha people, let's get everybody,

1088
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,360
people that are loving the Pop OS stuff,

1089
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,600
let's get everybody involved that's loving all that stuff

1090
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,360
and get the best, most modern version

1091
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,040
of a Linux desktop theme that we can get

1092
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,240
because GTK 3 can be beautiful.

1093
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,440
And so let's just see the most latest version of that.

1094
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,540
Yeah, but the problem is like, in reality,

1095
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,180
what you get is everybody just upvotes

1096
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,280
like trendy crap that's broken, you know?

1097
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,100
It's like nothing that somebody actually put time into.

1098
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,400
I think, you know, the decision that was made

1099
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,400
to have Sam do the Suru icons is like a no-brainer,

1100
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,120
and like not doing that would be a huge mistake to me.

1101
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,280
So what I would, you know, if I were someone

1102
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,280
that had power in the Ubuntu canonical realm

1103
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,900
is that I would say, hey, you know,

1104
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,640
all this great design work that we did for Unity 8,

1105
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,520
let's rally a community around building a style sheet

1106
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,000
that lives up to that ideal.

1107
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,520
And let's build what we all, you know,

1108
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,920
invested in, you know, before GTK 3.

1109
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,640
That's really a thing, though.

1110
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,800
I mean, that's a thing that you gotta take on and maintain

1111
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,440
and then really own for years and years and years,

1112
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,840
especially when you ship it in an LTS, you know?

1113
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,000
And whereas if you start with Edwardia

1114
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,160
and then you make Edwardia good and usable by human beings,

1115
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
you're almost all the way there.

1116
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,320
I'll say this, I'm not really, on my machine at home

1117
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,680
that I use all day long and all night long

1118
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,680
on my non-workdays, it's an Ubuntu LTS 16.04 Unity 7

1119
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,720
with the ArcDark theme.

1120
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,560
And I forget the icon theme,

1121
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,060
but I'm not using the standard one.

1122
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,480
But the thing that really strikes me

1123
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,120
about the old theme that comes with Unity 7

1124
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,120
is it's extremely glance-able.

1125
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,120
Like, you can just look at the icons

1126
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,400
and you know immediately what they are.

1127
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,560
They're large, they're readable, it holds up.

1128
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,520
Unity 7's theme today holds up.

1129
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,760
It holds up in high DPI even, it holds up.

1130
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,240
It holds up better than some current themes hold up.

1131
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,520
Surprisingly, it feels dated but it holds up.

1132
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,760
And so in some ways, because they sort of,

1133
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,700
they did own that and they really kind of took that

1134
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,320
under their wing, you know, years later, it still works.

1135
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,720
It still holds up, it's just feeling old these days.

1136
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,880
So I do follow you, Dan, and I do completely agree

1137
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,320
that if you could, you wouldn't just sort of

1138
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,480
dump that investment in the Unity 8 design.

1139
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,780
You wouldn't just jettison it.

1140
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:16,740
You would somehow incorporate it in the future product.

1141
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,400
That is, to me, not as sustainable

1142
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,520
as having a light fork of Edwardia

1143
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,300
and then over the next, say, two or three releases,

1144
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,040
carefully iterating it.

1145
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,040
That, to me, seems to be a, I don't know,

1146
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,120
a more sustainable approach, you know what I'm saying?

1147
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,800
Like something that, it will take longer

1148
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,600
but it would work much longer.

1149
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,520
It's something that's usable much longer.

1150
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,160
Yeah, I think the argument is that

1151
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,960
it requires a significant investment

1152
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,600
and one of my favorite quotes from a design article

1153
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,300
was, you know, design's not something you sprinkle

1154
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,320
on the top like a little bit of je ne sais quoi

1155
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,200
as a junk grid pissing down an alleyway.

1156
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,280
You know, it's just like something you just throw on there

1157
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,400
like, ah, whatever.

1158
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,720
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah.

1159
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,280
It's, you've gotta invest in it and cultivate it

1160
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,080
just as much as you care about the actual meat

1161
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,840
of the code of the applications.

1162
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,680
And I think that's the thing, is people wanna see

1163
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,540
that it's invested and cared about

1164
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,680
and not like an afterthought.

1165
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,680
And I know that those guys actually do really care

1166
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,360
about that stuff, I think that it just needs

1167
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,720
to be communicated that way.

1168
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,320
I suppose, Eric, you have a good point.

1169
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,260
Eric in the Mumble Room says, well, look,

1170
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,240
this is like the definition of not,

1171
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,540
this is the definition of anti-not invented here.

1172
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,120
Right, Eric?

1173
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,860
Right, I mean, for years, Canonical was that company

1174
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,640
that if it's not built here, then we're not using it.

1175
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,800
You know, I mean, that's very reminiscent.

1176
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,360
Or at least that was, I think, the impression, yeah.

1177
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,960
Right, I mean, that's, right, yeah, exactly.

1178
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,160
That was the impression.

1179
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,040
But I mean, how is reaching out to the community

1180
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,380
anything but being like an apple

1181
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,000
who embodies that completely?

1182
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,440
I mean, here, why don't you be a part of this thing?

1183
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,400
Why don't you help us create icon themes

1184
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,400
and wallpapers or whatever the case may be

1185
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,840
and be a part of this product?

1186
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,360
Be a part of, you know, 1804.

1187
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,760
Hmm, so I guess we probably really just have

1188
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,680
to kind of leave it here, it seems to me,

1189
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,600
unless anybody else has any closing thoughts on it.

1190
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,780
It seems like we just leave it here

1191
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,220
and we just wait and see what happens,

1192
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,560
but good point, everybody.

1193
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,560
Just one extra point, I think it's because people

1194
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,960
often are going a little bit back

1195
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,480
on the notion between code or design,

1196
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,200
which team should actually get contributions,

1197
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,120
is that if you pick up a pen and a little bit of paper,

1198
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,040
try to draw something, you'll probably see

1199
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,440
that you failed miserably.

1200
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,880
And it's hard for you to actually have that notion

1201
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,840
when it's about code.

1202
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,760
So people often think that they're gonna get crappy design.

1203
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,200
And so they tend to value and think that the only way

1204
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,080
is by actually acquiring talents

1205
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,160
and having the company do so.

1206
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,700
And the other point on for recommendations,

1207
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,600
like when it's like getting actual feedback

1208
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,360
from the community, it has been the inconsistency

1209
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,040
that makes Canonical's voice a little bit kind of low.

1210
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,560
And in that way, community responds

1211
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,760
not with an open heart immediately.

1212
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,960
It takes a good amount of time until they actually,

1213
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,280
okay, feel more, okay, they are actually being honest here.

1214
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,020
It's not just another move.

1215
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,660
It's not gonna change in a couple of weeks type of thing.

1216
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,240
Yeah, and that could be something that changes over time,

1217
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,080
don't you think?

1218
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,120
Don't you think that's something

1219
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,920
that will ease over time potentially?

1220
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,960
I think yes.

1221
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,240
As long as the management is done in such a way

1222
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,640
that actually fixes problems that existed before.

1223
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,200
As a developer, I had once a really bad experience

1224
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,080
when I actually spent time investing

1225
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,180
in a piece of technology that Canonical did invest in,

1226
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,960
and then just bang, disappeared.

1227
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,840
And that experience, if you have that over and over,

1228
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,180
you don't come back, right?

1229
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,020
Yeah, yep.

1230
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,120
And it's one of those things, you have to be resilient

1231
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,840
and you have to kind of do smooth transitions.

1232
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,480
And I think they're doing that now.

1233
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,000
I hope they continue with that path.

1234
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,840
Well said.

1235
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,600
So I wanna move us on because I still wanna talk about DRM

1236
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,000
because I think that's sort of a super important topic.

1237
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,920
And there's been some major developments this week,

1238
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,880
but I do wanna do just a quick bit of followup

1239
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,240
and go back to last week's episode, if we could.

1240
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,920
And the CEO of, you guys remember we talked about Linus,

1241
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,500
the auditing tool last week?

1242
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,120
And it was Sysify, is that how we decided?

1243
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,520
C-I-S-O-F-Y, Sysify?

1244
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,400
Yeah, that sounds right.

1245
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,400
Michael is the CEO there, and he pinged me and said,

1246
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,080
hey, just a couple of extra bits of information

1247
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:57,080
about Linus, it just hit its 10 year birthday this month

1248
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,680
as we happened to just randomly cover it.

1249
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,520
That's awesome.

1250
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,640
That's super awesome, dude.

1251
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,720
And also, Linus can run as an unprivileged user.

1252
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,840
In the episode, I decided to run it with sudo.

1253
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,160
But he says, if you do that,

1254
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,120
if you run it as an unprivileged user,

1255
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,160
the report is just stored in slash temp.

1256
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,920
And I really appreciate it.

1257
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,440
He also said that some of the plugins are completely free,

1258
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,800
and there are indeed others that are commercial.

1259
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,480
They're built by companies.

1260
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,880
He says, also, we advise using a cron job

1261
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,800
with daily comparers for easy detection of new findings.

1262
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,240
And he linked to a linux-audit.com article for that.

1263
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,600
If you didn't catch last week's episode,

1264
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,480
I definitely recommend it.

1265
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,120
We talked about Linus, a tool where you could

1266
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,800
audit your own system and see what's changed,

1267
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,440
see what's going on with that.

1268
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,840
How's the Gentoo challenge going over there?

1269
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,100
I see, I have a whole bunch of things happening

1270
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,000
right now on the screen.

1271
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,040
I don't even know what these are.

1272
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,720
What are we seeing build right now?

1273
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,640
What is this?

1274
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,720
Right now, we are updating the world set.

1275
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,960
So Wes Payne over there, Mr. Wes Payne, son of a bitch.

1276
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,360
He's the one that, I don't know if you guys,

1277
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,360
if you've caught all of the episodes of Linux Unplugged,

1278
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,840
as we were wrapping up, just a couple episodes ago,

1279
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,040
it wasn't that long ago,

1280
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,240
Wes suggested that we do a Gentoo challenge.

1281
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,760
And so what we have done is we have created

1282
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,560
a virtual machine here in the studio

1283
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,680
that is building Gentoo right now as we record this episode.

1284
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,400
And that's what you're looking at

1285
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,040
if you're watching the video version right now

1286
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,560
of the Unplugged program.

1287
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,120
If you're listening to the audio,

1288
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,360
AKA if you're the majority of the audience,

1289
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,360
just envision a lot of GCC crap going across the screen

1290
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,360
and you've basically got it.

1291
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,920
So I just wanted to give a mention for two reasons.

1292
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,560
One is a completely selfish reason

1293
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,780
and the other is because I just love

1294
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,280
talking about these events.

1295
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,820
And I can't help but talk about them.

1296
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,680
Texas Linux Fest is coming up

1297
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,720
and they have their call for papers right now.

1298
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,680
So it's gonna be in June.

1299
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,760
So you got a little bit of time to plan for this.

1300
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,680
It's gonna be at the AT&T Conference Center

1301
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,480
in Austin, Texas.

1302
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,100
And they have a whole range of topics,

1303
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,560
but they have their call for papers right now.

1304
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,000
This is their eighth year.

1305
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,680
And they've never been.

1306
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,520
I thought it was-

1307
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,620
It seems like a lot of fun.

1308
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,460
Could somebody tell me how many people go to this thing?

1309
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,240
How many people go to Texas Linux Fest?

1310
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,960
And is it June?

1311
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,160
Is it worth being in Austin in June?

1312
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,080
Like really, be honest with me.

1313
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,780
Is it, tweet me, at Chris Elias,

1314
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,320
is it worth being in Austin in June?

1315
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,160
It just doesn't,

1316
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,000
it feels like it's gotta be a really good event

1317
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,980
to be in Austin at that time.

1318
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,040
And then just a little PSA

1319
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,200
before we wrap up the community news segment this week.

1320
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,720
You Fedora users, to pay attention just for a moment,

1321
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,840
Fedora 25 has entered the end of life status,

1322
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,440
aka no more updates for you,

1323
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,400
in just about a week from when you hear this episode.

1324
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,240
So now would be a really good time

1325
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,000
to upgrade to Fedora 26 or maybe Fedora 27.

1326
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,840
Yeah.

1327
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,040
Fedora 26 should be really solid right about now.

1328
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,600
And 27's getting there.

1329
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,520
And your upgrade should probably go pretty smooth

1330
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,440
if you have a pretty straightforward system.

1331
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,640
My upgrades have gone smooth for many releases now.

1332
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,080
Fedora 25 will be DOA in just about two weeks.

1333
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,560
So upgrade to Fedora 26 or 27 now if you're a Fedora user

1334
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,640
because your time is running out.

1335
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,360
We need to have like an end of life theme.

1336
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,320
Like if somebody wants to make us an end of life clip,

1337
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,320
I'll play it on the sound board

1338
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,920
for like distros that go end of life.

1339
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,080
Because I think we should just have like a segment

1340
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,340
like if you're running this version of Linux,

1341
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,560
you're no longer getting patches.

1342
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,400
If you're running this version of Linux,

1343
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,240
you're no longer getting patches.

1344
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,520
Yeah, right, you can just follow this show

1345
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,000
and know when you need to update.

1346
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,340
There's no master list, right?

1347
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,720
So we should just put it all out there.

1348
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,480
Just let everybody know.

1349
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,520
I don't know, then I hear from people, maniacs,

1350
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,920
like I think maybe Joe or somebody.

1351
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,160
Somebody I know.

1352
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,400
I'm not gonna say it's Joe Resington.

1353
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,240
I'm not gonna say it's Joe.

1354
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,080
But it probably is.

1355
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,520
But it's probably Joe.

1356
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,120
I run like Ubuntu 14.04 or something.

1357
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,120
I know, I know.

1358
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,120
Just absolute, absolute animals.

1359
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,600
Absolute animals, just animals.

1360
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,520
I can't even understand it.

1361
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,700
I can't even understand it.

1362
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,440
Bashful, you had a comment about the funeral march

1363
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,700
towards old distros, go ahead.

1364
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,880
I was just gonna say, you wanted a sound clip?

1365
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,780
Just run the funeral march.

1366
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,920
Oh, I get it.

1367
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,760
You know like the brr, brr, brr.

1368
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,600
Bingo.

1369
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,920
I feel like we need something unique to the show though.

1370
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,400
You know, like some podcasts have people

1371
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,800
submitting clips all the time.

1372
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,640
Sound board stuff.

1373
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,460
For sure.

1374
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,120
I got an empty sound board right now

1375
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,240
and the only thing on the Linux unplugged sound board

1376
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,720
is the intro and outro theme and the flashback.

1377
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,420
I got the flashback harp, which I feel like is good, right?

1378
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,260
That's good.

1379
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,200
But I don't have anything more.

1380
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,000
So if you wanna help populate the new sound board

1381
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,560
for 2018, you can start sending clips

1382
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,680
into the unplugged program.

1383
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,520
It's gonna be full of.

1384
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,680
Is the bell not a part of the sound board?

1385
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,520
Well, it depends.

1386
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,340
Is that a real bell?

1387
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,180
Depends on the show.

1388
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,020
It depends on the show.

1389
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,440
You know, people ask, should I reveal?

1390
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,640
Do you guys feel like I should reveal

1391
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,960
if the bell is real or not?

1392
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,240
No, keep it a mystery.

1393
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,480
I'm gonna keep it a mystery.

1394
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,520
Cause I know some people have looked at the audio waveforms

1395
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,100
to try to determine if the bell is real or not.

1396
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,860
And I don't wanna say.

1397
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,320
I don't wanna say.

1398
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,240
You'll have to guess yourself.

1399
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,920
You can load this up in Audacity.

1400
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,800
Load this episode up in Audacity.

1401
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,280
And you take a look at it yourself.

1402
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,040
Digitalocean.com.

1403
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,560
Go over there to support the show, Digitalocean.com

1404
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,680
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

1405
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,520
One word.

1406
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,720
That's it, one word.

1407
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,800
You get $10 credit over Digitalocean.com.

1408
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,160
Wes Payne is the perfect Digitalocean customer

1409
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,800
because every time I have a conversation with you, Wes,

1410
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,180
every single time you're like,

1411
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,880
you know, I could just do that on a droplet.

1412
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,240
Like I kinda had to actually.

1413
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,080
You know, that's true.

1414
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,080
I kinda had to argue with you

1415
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,400
to just load a virtual machine on your laptop

1416
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,160
to do the Gentoo challenge.

1417
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,000
Whoopsie.

1418
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,820
Cause you're like, you know,

1419
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,880
we could just do it on a droplet

1420
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,060
and then I could use the HTML5 console

1421
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,560
and then I could reload one of those rigs with Gentoo.

1422
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,400
Like, you had a whole plan.

1423
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,620
And I don't know, less than 55 seconds.

1424
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,160
Which, ironically, is probably how long

1425
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,720
it would take to spin up a droplet.

1426
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,560
You like that?

1427
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,380
I like that a lot.

1428
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,400
Digitalocean.com.

1429
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,600
You create your account, you use the promo code DOUNPLUGED,

1430
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,560
you get a $10 credit.

1431
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,180
Now, the rig that I love, my personal favorite,

1432
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,700
three cents an hour.

1433
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,160
Let me just let that marinate for a second.

1434
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,260
Three cents an hour.

1435
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,100
That's like nothing.

1436
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:16,940
That's nothing.

1437
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,320
It's like just walking around outside.

1438
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,080
I mean, you know, I'm not saying the burger comparison,

1439
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,560
I'm not saying the coffee comparison or the heroin or weed,

1440
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,400
whatever your habit is.

1441
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,240
I don't think people would get that.

1442
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,800
And I'm not saying if that's a soundboard bell

1443
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,720
or a physical bell.

1444
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,380
But what I am saying is you can get a great deal

1445
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,040
if you go to digitalocean.com

1446
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,440
and you use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

1447
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,160
They got 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors.

1448
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,400
Of course, the host machines run

1449
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,400
GNU slash Linux running KVM for the virtualizer.

1450
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,680
And they got Bloxorg.

1451
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,280
If you're basic and you just want something

1452
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,520
that shows up as a slash dev slash SD device,

1453
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,760
go with the Blox storage.

1454
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,680
That's what I do when I wanna have it as my home.

1455
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,920
So when I set up a DigitalOcean dropout

1456
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,280
that I'm gonna remote into and have like Ubuntu mate,

1457
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,000
I use Blox storage for my slash home.

1458
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,480
Now if I have a rig that I'm using for like web storage

1459
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,720
or additional files or sharing with co-hosts,

1460
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,880
that's where I use spaces or object storage

1461
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,800
with DigitalOcean.

1462
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,720
They have an API so when the machines during,

1463
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,180
for our production, I need to spin them up

1464
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,000
or shut them down, I do it all through the API.

1465
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I don't go to the website.

1466
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,360
Love it.

1467
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,320
And if you're in a project, if you're like a,

1468
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,400
maybe you're like, I don't know,

1469
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,720
just randomly gonna put this out there.

1470
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,680
Just a crazy idea.

1471
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,140
If you're in an open source project,

1472
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,360
you're working with some people,

1473
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,960
they got team accounts.

1474
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,900
Team accounts.

1475
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,060
They got team accounts.

1476
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,520
You can easily manage your cloud with your team

1477
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,500
by inviting others' team accounts.

1478
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:39,760
DigitalOcean.com.

1479
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,040
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED

1480
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,120
and take advantage of a $10 credit

1481
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,600
and enjoy spaces.

1482
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,240
I wonder, are they still offering that?

1483
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,680
Oh shoot, they're still offering, oh shoot.

1484
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,520
Oh!

1485
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,920
So here's what you can do.

1486
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,120
You go to DigitalOcean.com, you create your account,

1487
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,260
use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, you get the $10 credit,

1488
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,240
and then you go sign up for a two-month trial

1489
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
of spaces for free.

1490
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,080
It's good stuff.

1491
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,600
It really is good stuff.

1492
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,520
You know, the thing about DigitalOcean that strikes me,

1493
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,160
and maybe they should make this like their slogan

1494
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,000
or something, but.

1495
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,820
Go, S, go.

1496
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,160
It's easy enough for development.

1497
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,000
All right.

1498
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,420
You can spin it up like you said, API, super simple

1499
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,260
dashboard. Seconds.

1500
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,100
Right, seconds.

1501
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:16,920
You don't have to think about it.

1502
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,760
It's not difficult. Like serious CPU and memory.

1503
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,600
There's a big range of integrations.

1504
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:20,560
Bandwidth, seconds.

1505
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,400
Yeah. It's crazy.

1506
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,200
But it's stable enough for production.

1507
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,880
Like when you're ready to go full bore,

1508
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,680
putting it out there for the world, boom, no problem.

1509
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,560
Oh, boom, no problem.

1510
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:33,480
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

1511
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,520
and Godspeed.

1512
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,780
Go create some infrastructure.

1513
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,960
You know, I had a good comparison.

1514
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,360
That costs less per hour than long distance

1515
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,360
used to cost per minute.

1516
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,680
Wow.

1517
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,560
And also super solid old man reference.

1518
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,400
Yeah.

1519
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,240
Nice.

1520
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,160
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1521
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,360
So I used to be one of these guys who was

1522
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,500
not so concerned about the DRM.

1523
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,040
You just wanted your media.

1524
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,400
Then I went and watched a talk by this Cory Doctorow guy.

1525
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,240
This son of a bitch totally changed my entire position.

1526
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,200
He knows how to speak.

1527
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,600
It happened randomly too.

1528
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,160
And I have a vlog about it, not to be that guy,

1529
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,040
but I have a vlog about it where I went there

1530
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,400
and I saw the talk and I went, well shit,

1531
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,100
now I completely changed the way I feel about this.

1532
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:30,080
So I wanna frame our discussion here with what hit me

1533
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,060
and what I walked away with.

1534
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:39,400
And I think it helps us think about this DRM problem.

1535
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,520
There is a lot of inventions throughout humanity

1536
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,800
that are really there because they were able to stand

1537
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,320
on the shoulders of giants.

1538
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,160
We even have a saying for it.

1539
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,920
Standing on the shoulders of giants.

1540
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,400
And if you look at open source,

1541
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,960
I mean that's what all of our open source desktops

1542
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,080
are all standing on top of the frameworks

1543
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,360
and libraries and kernels and stacks

1544
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,320
that everybody else has built.

1545
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,920
Everything is standing on the shoulders of giants

1546
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:08,920
that we rely upon.

1547
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,680
If you look at the internet, it's the same fucking thing.

1548
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,100
It's standing on the shoulders of giants.

1549
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,120
And DRM locks it up.

1550
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,600
DRM locks up knowledge.

1551
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:30,180
It locks up intellectual property.

1552
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:38,760
It makes it ephemeral.

1553
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,920
And it makes it something that's only available in the present

1554
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,160
and something that is inaccessible

1555
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,540
to future generations of humanity.

1556
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,160
It locks up knowledge.

1557
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,600
It is the antithesis of the open internet,

1558
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:00,720
of open standards, of open source, of sharing knowledge.

1559
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,000
It's the antithesis of what the internet has brought us.

1560
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,560
This fundamental communications platform

1561
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:11,000
that humanity can use to educate themselves and grow.

1562
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,640
DRM is the opposite of all of that.

1563
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,560
And the EFF has been fighting against DRM

1564
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,400
and the laws behind it for a decade and a half.

1565
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,660
And things are not going well.

1566
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,560
So Cory Doctorow, who I think is the premier thinker

1567
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:34,740
on this topic, who holds talks that will change

1568
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,380
the way you think about this.

1569
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:41,280
And he writes posts on the EFF's deep links blog

1570
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,760
that will really make you think.

1571
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,040
And the headline is DRM's Dead Canary,

1572
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,760
How We Just Lost the Web, and What We Learned From It,

1573
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,640
and What We Have to Do Next, or What We Need to Do Next.

1574
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,360
And the thing about DRM is it's not

1575
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,560
about copyright protection.

1576
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,640
In fact, that's total 100% bullshit.

1577
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,640
That's used car salesman bullshit.

1578
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,640
Everybody, and this is Cory's words,

1579
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,840
everybody on the inside of the industry

1580
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,840
secretly knows that DRM technology

1581
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,400
is completely irrelevant.

1582
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,200
The technology is irrelevant.

1583
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,480
It's fundamentally flawed.

1584
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,280
And I'll get into why.

1585
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,920
But it is fundamentally flawed.

1586
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,000
It is impossible to keep DRM safe.

1587
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,640
But DRM law is everything.

1588
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,800
And this is not a US-specific thing.

1589
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,680
The reason companies want DRM has nothing

1590
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:49,600
to do with copyright, nothing to do with copyright at all.

1591
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,440
So let's look at Netflix, because it's just

1592
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,400
an easy example.

1593
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,760
But there's so many other things beyond Netflix.

1594
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,440
DRM has so many other implications

1595
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:01,120
besides online media.

1596
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,520
But it is the one that we think of.

1597
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,020
And it's the easiest one to relate to.

1598
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,640
So let's go with Netflix.

1599
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,440
They send you an online streaming movie

1600
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,280
that's been scrambled.

1601
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,200
And they want to be sure that you

1602
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,640
can watch it and that you can even maybe save it

1603
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,120
to your hard drive and play it back later.

1604
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,920
But they want to make sure it's protected.

1605
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,000
So they need to give you a way to view the movie at some point.

1606
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,920
That means they have to unscramble the movie for you.

1607
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,800
And there's only one way to unscramble

1608
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,500
a file that's been completely encrypted.

1609
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:31,560
You have to use a decryption key.

1610
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:36,880
So Netflix has to also give you the unscrambling key.

1611
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,520
But if you have a key, you can't just

1612
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,560
unscramble the Netflix movies and save them to your hard drive.

1613
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:48,160
So how can Netflix give you a key but control how you use it?

1614
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,920
Netflix has to hide the key somewhere on your computer,

1615
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,160
like in a browser extension, like an encrypted browser media

1616
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,120
extension.

1617
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,480
Hiding something really good, hiding something well,

1618
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,440
is hard.

1619
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,920
Hiding something well in a place of equipment

1620
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,640
that you give to your adversary to take away with them

1621
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:16,960
and do anything they want to it offline is impossible.

1622
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:23,320
Any tiny flaw in that fragile wrapping around these keys,

1623
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,840
any tiny flaw that you can exploit, and they're free.

1624
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,560
And once that flaw has been exposed,

1625
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,480
anyone can write an app or browser plug-in

1626
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,200
that has a Save button that can just exploit it immediately.

1627
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,280
And of course, they've seen this over and over

1628
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,520
again with all kinds of different schemes.

1629
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,960
And Cory is writing this in a way

1630
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,560
that maybe people aren't familiar with the situation.

1631
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,560
It does a really good job.

1632
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,520
But yeah, it's super good.

1633
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,800
Once the flaw is exposed, anybody can get access to it.

1634
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,080
And this is a fact.

1635
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:51,080
The companies know this.

1636
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,120
They can spend millions of dollars developing DRM.

1637
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,120
And it gets broken in days by teenagers or hobbyists

1638
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,320
with equipment.

1639
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,400
And it's not because DRM makers are stupid.

1640
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,820
They can have brilliant people making DRM.

1641
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,680
It's because the idea is stupid.

1642
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,320
Trying to store a decryption key on a system

1643
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,200
that your adversary controls is dumb as shit.

1644
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,680
It's the dumbest thing you could do in security.

1645
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,560
Think about that for a second.

1646
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,800
Trying to store the key to your system on a hacker's computer,

1647
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,960
that's the stupidest thing you could do.

1648
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,000
And that's what DRM is trying to do.

1649
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,360
So this is where the law comes in, Uncle Sam's law comes in.

1650
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:35,080
But the best thing is, it goes way beyond Uncle Sam.

1651
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,040
It all comes back to your old buddy, your favorite,

1652
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,480
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

1653
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,560
In 1998, Congress passed that son of a bitch.

1654
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,880
And Section 1201 provides for felony liability

1655
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,320
for anyone commercially engaged in bypassing a DRM system.

1656
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,880
And get this, if you're commercially doing it,

1657
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,200
you know, like some of these Kodi box manufacturers?

1658
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:05,280
Five years in prison, $500,000 fine for your first offense.

1659
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,920
How many Congress people do you think

1660
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,240
had actually used the internet when this law was enacted?

1661
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:09,800
I know, right?

1662
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,800
98?

1663
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,920
Even non-commercial bypass of DRM is subject to liability.

1664
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,920
And it also makes just even talking about DRM exploits

1665
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,800
legally risky.

1666
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,320
And yet, use of Section 1201 of the DMCA

1667
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,760
to threaten security researchers who discover flaws

1668
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,560
is widely used too.

1669
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,040
And the beautiful thing is, thanks

1670
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,760
to US trade representatives, I mean, you know,

1671
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,440
hurrah everybody, they've convinced other countries

1672
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,480
around the world to adopt a version of this rule

1673
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,000
as part of our trade policies.

1674
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,680
So you want to do trade with us, you

1675
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,640
got to protect intellectual property.

1676
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:47,520
We don't even need some of these huge TPPs.

1677
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,720
We just, if you want to work with us, you got to respect it.

1678
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,760
This is where the W3C comes in.

1679
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,160
These sons of bitches over the W3C

1680
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,800
have really sunk us all.

1681
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,320
And this is where I think Linux users may

1682
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,560
be able to eventually, it's not just Linux users, actually,

1683
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,680
it's any platform users.

1684
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,680
But I think it has to start with Linux users.

1685
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,680
Could maybe change the tide, move the dial,

1686
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,960
whatever stupid little saying you want to give it.

1687
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:19,080
But the W3C and the implementation

1688
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,120
of EME, encrypted media extensions,

1689
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,600
is really what enabled all of this.

1690
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,280
It was sort of the final straw.

1691
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,800
It was the straw that, you know, whatever the fuck.

1692
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,720
In 2013, Netflix and a few other media companies

1693
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,680
convinced the W3C to start work on a DRM system for the web.

1694
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,920
This DRM system, encrypted media extensions,

1695
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,800
EME represented a sharp departure

1696
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,960
from the W3's normal business practices.

1697
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:48,080
First, the EME would not be a complete standard.

1698
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,960
That's a huge deviation.

1699
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:55,360
Second, the organization would specify

1700
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,320
an API through which publishers, i.e.

1701
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,320
businesses, large corporations, and browser

1702
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,360
vendors, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Mozilla,

1703
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,680
would make DRM work.

1704
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,240
I want you to think about that for a second,

1705
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:17,640
because that means you have to be on the approved list.

1706
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,600
You have to be Google.

1707
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,280
You have to be Apple.

1708
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,040
You have to be Microsoft to make this work.

1709
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,600
The actual content decryption module, the CDM,

1710
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,520
wouldn't be defined by the standard.

1711
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,280
That means that EME was a standard name only.

1712
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,640
If you started a browser company and followed

1713
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:35,160
all of the W3's recommendations, you still

1714
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,280
wouldn't be able to play back a Netflix video.

1715
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,400
That's the killer.

1716
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,480
If you followed all of the W3 standards

1717
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,720
today, you wouldn't be able to play the video.

1718
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,120
That's not a fucking standard.

1719
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,280
It's not an open web.

1720
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,560
That's not a standard.

1721
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,080
That's not a standard, right?

1722
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,920
You have to get Netflix's permission

1723
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,200
to play back that video, regardless

1724
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,320
of whether it's not a standard.

1725
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,720
That's not a standard.

1726
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:02,240
And that is a, oh, man.

1727
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,640
What it basically means is you are enshrining

1728
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,920
the current browser monopolies, because you can't now

1729
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,240
create a competitor to Chrome or Firefox.

1730
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,040
Yeah, absolutely.

1731
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,520
And play back encrypted media extensions.

1732
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,880
It also twists things a little bit.

1733
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,480
It's not like you and Netflix establishing a trust

1734
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,120
relationship.

1735
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,960
It's them and these companies you happen

1736
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,160
to use as the middleman.

1737
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:25,280
Right, right.

1738
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,360
My middlemans.

1739
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,120
Yeah, you're right.

1740
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,760
That is also really creepy.

1741
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,360
In a web which every publisher gets

1742
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,200
to pick and choose which browsers you can visit,

1743
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,560
their sites, is very different from the historical web.

1744
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,800
I think we should go with the traditional web.

1745
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,000
The old days.

1746
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,160
Technologies that have stood in the way

1747
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,800
of this permissionless interoperability,

1748
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,460
for instance, patent-encumbered video,

1749
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,760
have been seen as impediments to the idea of open web,

1750
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,280
not standardization.

1751
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,000
Look at Flash.

1752
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,600
Steve Jobs's thoughts on Flash open letter,

1753
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,200
iOS's refusal to implement Flash,

1754
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,240
the really limp attempts to implement Flash

1755
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,120
on Android that never went anywhere.

1756
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,920
Flash died not because we don't like it, but because of mobile.

1757
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,600
Because mobile wouldn't do Flash.

1758
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,200
That's why Flash dies, is dying, right?

1759
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,560
And now is essentially gone, is because mobile

1760
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:16,840
refused to implement it.

1761
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,280
Because it wasn't a standard.

1762
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,760
And now, thanks to mobile, projects like YouTube DL

1763
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,800
allow me to download video from over 200 websites

1764
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,800
because they're all trying to be mobile compatible

1765
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,080
and they've got to serve this shit up as an H.264 file.

1766
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,240
And this is the opposite of all of that.

1767
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,640
This is actually the op- this is like enshrining Flash forever.

1768
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,280
This is not Flash this time.

1769
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,440
This time it's encrypted media extensions,

1770
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,740
which each manufacturer, Netflix,

1771
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,880
Hulu, they all get to brew their own now.

1772
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,380
This is the opposite of what the W3C used to be about.

1773
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:55,680
This is the opposite of what we used to expect from an open web.

1774
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,040
When the W3C starts making technologies that only work

1775
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,200
when they're blessed by a handful of entertainment

1776
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,640
companies, they're putting their thumbs,

1777
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:07,160
they're putting their fists on the scale in favor of ensuring

1778
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,060
that the current browser giants get the majority

1779
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:13,740
and enjoy a permanent regime.

1780
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,400
How many times have you heard somebody say,

1781
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,400
well, I use Chrome because it works with Netflix

1782
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
before Firefox could?

1783
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,040
You know, this has a lot of parallels

1784
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,080
with the whole net neutrality thing that's going on now, too.

1785
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,560
That's interesting, you're right.

1786
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,920
It kind of does, doesn't it?

1787
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,960
Yeah, it kind of does, only this is worse

1788
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,920
because this is locking up intellectual content

1789
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,160
and creative things that humanity has created

1790
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,120
and wrapping them up in a DRM that is only accessible once

1791
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,200
a certain vendor has blessed it.

1792
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,720
And it's cute for modern day companies

1793
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:53,000
that want to make a great profit and impress their shareholders,

1794
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,900
but what about 45 years from now?

1795
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,240
What about 65 years from now when we want

1796
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,160
to look back at the classics?

1797
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,200
Well, what if all that shit's wrapped up in DRM?

1798
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,840
How does that impact humanity?

1799
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,720
And I hadn't thought about this.

1800
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,040
There seems to be an unavoidable harsh reality to me.

1801
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:17,600
The W3C wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for WebKit

1802
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,640
and Chrome's dominance.

1803
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,200
If Mozilla Firefox was the predominant browser,

1804
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,240
this is my personal opinion, but if they

1805
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,280
were the predominant browser, if they had a 70% market share

1806
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:33,240
right now, would we be getting this W3DRM encrypted media

1807
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,920
extension standard rammed down our throats?

1808
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,880
Or would they have to do something that was

1809
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,240
open to the general web?

1810
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:42,280
Something tells me things would be a lot different.

1811
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,200
We're only in this position right now.

1812
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,480
We're only getting screwed.

1813
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,520
And it's not like we're getting a little screwed.

1814
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,820
It's like humanity.

1815
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:52,800
It's like Disney on a whole new scale.

1816
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,200
It's Disney for all of the content.

1817
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,020
It's Disney's copyright imperialistic behaviors

1818
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:00,880
for all intellectual property.

1819
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,240
For as long as the DRM technology is possibly valid

1820
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,560
and these companies are around to ping a request,

1821
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,360
this DRM is going to work.

1822
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,440
And it's going to screw over people

1823
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,320
for years and years and years.

1824
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,200
And I don't feel like this would be possible if Firefox

1825
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,660
had 70% of the market share.

1826
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:21,040
Now, I say this completely understanding

1827
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,120
that Firefox supports encrypted media extensions.

1828
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,520
And I understand that they are.

1829
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,440
But I feel like they had no option.

1830
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,840
They didn't.

1831
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,320
They really didn't.

1832
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,920
So when you think, what can we do, well, part of me

1833
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,800
feels like what we could do is we could all

1834
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,240
switch to the new Firefox.

1835
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,960
It's pretty fucking great.

1836
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,680
Firefox Quantum 57, I've been running it since it came out.

1837
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,560
It is faster than Chrome.

1838
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,280
It just has less load on my system.

1839
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,240
Like, I can load up Firefox and have

1840
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,680
it load a whole bunch of tabs in the background.

1841
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,000
And it doesn't feel like my system is doing anything.

1842
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,680
Like, it just feels like, I don't know.

1843
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,100
Like, I look at my cores, because I always

1844
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,880
have the little system stats up in the bar.

1845
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,640
And my cores are just sitting there at nothing.

1846
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,920
Meanwhile, I'm blasting through Firefox pages like a maniac.

1847
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,160
And all my tabs are loading up.

1848
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,400
When I got like 16 tabs, 15, 10 tabs on Chrome that I close

1849
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,920
and then it reloads, all my CPUs are pegged for a while.

1850
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,000
And I'm like, oh, awesome.

1851
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,800
Look at Chrome, man.

1852
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,300
Look at that.

1853
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,120
It's multi-process, multi-core.

1854
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:22,760
It's so awesome.

1855
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:23,760
Really browse it now.

1856
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,320
Yeah, but now when I launch Firefox,

1857
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,480
it does the same damn thing.

1858
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:31,360
It uses just a total, total, total, like 70% less

1859
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,520
of the CPU.

1860
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,080
I think it's getting pretty damn competitive.

1861
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:37,240
And you look at, like, they're so serious about some

1862
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:40,040
of the technologies that they're investing in that, like, Rust

1863
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,840
is an ends to a means.

1864
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,280
Rust, the programming language, is an ends to a means

1865
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,780
to what they're trying to accomplish.

1866
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:49,840
And Rust itself is a technological miracle.

1867
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,460
So maybe now is the time, as Linux users,

1868
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,960
we make the hard cut.

1869
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,440
We start using Firefox, and we start advocating Firefox

1870
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,200
like we advocate the Linux desktop.

1871
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,800
And I think this is the key piece.

1872
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,120
If we can advocate the use of Firefox

1873
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,120
like we were able to advocate the use of the Linux desktop,

1874
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,360
maybe over time we could start retaking a little bit

1875
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,440
of that market share.

1876
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,840
And you were so inspired, Wes, by the new release

1877
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,280
that you ended up putting that shit on your phone.

1878
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:15,760
I did.

1879
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,440
It's true.

1880
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,280
You maniac.

1881
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,880
Are you going to set it as the default browser?

1882
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,760
Right now I'm picking, but I think I will.

1883
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:22,360
I think I will.

1884
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,680
I've been kind of fiddling between them, but really.

1885
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,600
I might try it.

1886
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,920
Really?

1887
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,720
Yeah, you get the sync going.

1888
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,960
It's a good time.

1889
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:32,960
Mr. Daredevilin, you want to wrap us up on this topic

1890
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,480
before we move on?

1891
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,560
Yeah, so I actually think Firefox

1892
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,280
is a little bit in just as bad position as Chrome

1893
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,840
and as Google in here, actually.

1894
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,640
They were just as much as pushing for the ORM.

1895
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,960
The only big difference is Google

1896
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,440
can decide to do whatever they want with Chrome,

1897
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,440
and we could potentially attempt to override whatever

1898
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,200
is being done in Firefox.

1899
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,920
Because of its more open dynamics,

1900
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,040
we should be able at least to, by just injecting

1901
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,040
contributors over and over, take actually more ownership

1902
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,280
of the code and actually get that to a point

1903
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,360
that we have to say.

1904
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:13,160
Now, all those cases are difficult.

1905
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,280
And this started way before we were talking about DRM.

1906
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,840
It started when we started talking about Osm.js,

1907
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,520
the WebAssembly.

1908
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,080
Because if WebAssembly starts being OK

1909
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,680
and people were mostly, oh, because of the performance

1910
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,520
was good, it meant that people were

1911
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,040
willing to compromise with the ability of the JavaScript

1912
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,320
code that runs in their browser in exchange of speed.

1913
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,160
That's actually when the problem started.

1914
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,400
Not so much DRM and DRM, it's just as a consequence

1915
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,000
of that, I think.

1916
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,120
And us actually wanting to use those services.

1917
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,520
And just as a final point is, well, it comes down

1918
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,440
to have a way to the browser work out

1919
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,160
a sandbox that is isolated, that does

1920
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:59,600
run these DRM for this company and that other company,

1921
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,320
that we can make sure that it's only that one.

1922
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,320
At least this should give us the option of, OK,

1923
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,640
I want to access this service.

1924
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,800
I already compromised to this service.

1925
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,680
Now I'm actually allowing them to execute this code.

1926
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,520
But at least it's isolated in that context.

1927
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,440
That could be an implementation that

1928
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,400
would be more OK with than maybe what's actually

1929
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,280
been happening now where it uses more of the holistic system

1930
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,000
because it requires that for the rendering and everything.

1931
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,160
Yes, it sounds like you're advocating for something

1932
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,160
more trying to put the user back in control

1933
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,840
rather than the system where we're left being, you know.

1934
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,120
Absolutely.

1935
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,560
Hard-like system is what I would really love to see.

1936
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,760
But that day is never coming, at least so far.

1937
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,720
I have to just resign to cubes.

1938
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,120
That's basically where I find myself.

1939
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,440
I feel like Mozilla didn't really

1940
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,080
have much of an option in implementing this stuff either

1941
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,760
because if they didn't, then they're not

1942
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,240
providing what their users want.

1943
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,280
And then they're, by consequence,

1944
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,360
going to lose market share.

1945
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,200
Yeah, no, I think you're right about that.

1946
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,080
And I think, Chris, you were spot on just

1947
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,760
with the dominance of Chrome and WebKit.

1948
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,160
And just like, how used are we to all the proprietary stuff

1949
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,520
Chrome bundles in for us?

1950
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,400
And we just use it.

1951
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,360
And it's like, it's useful.

1952
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,320
Oh, yeah, I can cast to my TV, all these things.

1953
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,520
But it just really hits home that these

1954
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,000
are things that are not open or are not part of the open web.

1955
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,580
Well, what I feel like is if there's

1956
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:32,840
anybody that can swallow rough edges or deal

1957
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,440
with inadequacies, which really isn't even

1958
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,840
fair to prescribe to Firefox.

1959
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,520
But if there's anybody that can, it's

1960
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:41,560
Linux users who have come up through the bad years

1961
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,920
of the Linux desktop.

1962
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,920
And we're kind of like, I know I have.

1963
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,040
I will just speak for myself.

1964
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,680
But I've spent the last couple of years

1965
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,580
just sort of kicking back, my hands behind my head,

1966
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:57,680
leaning back in my seat going, finally, it's here.

1967
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:01,680
I've got the same proprietary crappy application

1968
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,560
that everybody else has, no compromises.

1969
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,800
I can do everything everybody else can finally

1970
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,720
after all these years of the Linux desktop advocacy

1971
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:14,280
and fighting for it, I am on application parity.

1972
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,760
And that's what Chrome gave me.

1973
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,160
Chrome gave me application parity with all the other mother

1974
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,160
effers out there who have had something I haven't

1975
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:22,480
had for all these years.

1976
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,000
But the reality is it's like Walmart.

1977
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,680
Walmart can be convenient as hell here in the States.

1978
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,360
But the reality is you're killing other businesses

1979
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,520
by using Walmart.

1980
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,320
You know what I mean?

1981
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,880
And it's time to start shopping with the independent mom

1982
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,120
of pop shops.

1983
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:40,360
And I feel like we as Linux users

1984
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,920
are more equipped to do than just about any other type

1985
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,480
of computer user.

1986
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,600
That's my personal opinion.

1987
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:53,120
I feel like if we could give the market share to Firefox,

1988
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,840
even just another 10%, and build and advocate,

1989
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,560
you go home on the holidays, maybe

1990
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,960
switch people back to Firefox.

1991
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1992
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:01,820
Is that crazy?

1993
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,320
And I've seen a number of relatives

1994
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,060
too running older Firefox versions that haven't updated.

1995
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:07,960
So that's also a good time to just go

1996
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,600
get them all the new hotness.

1997
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,060
And also Firefox seems to be making moves to double down

1998
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,040
on privacy concerns.

1999
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,880
There is more things coming to Firefox in future versions

2000
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,760
that are going to be pretty good,

2001
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:21,160
isolating out tracking to each site gets

2002
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,200
their own silo of information and things like that

2003
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,760
that I think are going to be compelling,

2004
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,520
not in their implementation details,

2005
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,040
but in their overall approach.

2006
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,040
They're going to kind of take the iPhone approach.

2007
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,160
And we don't need to use the cloud services.

2008
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,560
We just want to sell the individual product

2009
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,040
and protect your data.

2010
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,440
And I think that sales pitch could really

2011
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,320
sell for the web browser.

2012
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,760
Mozilla has a unique relationship with the web

2013
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,080
and what their motivations are as a result, especially

2014
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,960
compared to someone like Google, who obviously needs the web,

2015
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,200
but has other motives in mind.

2016
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,240
Mos and Rats, that's all well and good

2017
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,640
until Walmart goes and purchases all the small mom and pop

2018
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,640
shops.

2019
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,560
Dammit, Mos and Rats.

2020
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,560
Fair enough.

2021
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:00,120
Shut up.

2022
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:00,960
Dammit.

2023
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,040
All right, well, before we get into the Gen 2

2024
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,680
challenge for the week, let's take a moment and thank Ting,

2025
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,640
talking about voting with your wallet.

2026
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,380
This is a better way to do mobile.

2027
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:12,200
In fact, Ting recently posted on their blog

2028
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,800
a super concise description of Ting.

2029
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,000
Ting is a no-contract carrier that

2030
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,720
offers pay-for-what-you-use rates,

2031
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:24,080
as opposed to requiring customers to select a plan.

2032
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,400
In this way, mobile isn't a high fixed cost.

2033
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,640
A Ting customer's bill can vary with how much

2034
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,040
they use each month.

2035
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:37,600
As a result, the average bill on Ting is $23 per month.

2036
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,480
And you can get started with a $25 promo code

2037
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,080
if you go to linux.ting.com.

2038
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,920
And I couldn't say it better than myself.

2039
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:48,760
I've tried to.

2040
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,400
In fact, it's so simple to explain

2041
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,800
that it almost feels like you have to unexplain the way

2042
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,080
the other competitors do it.

2043
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,240
It's just a smarter way to do mobile.

2044
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,840
You pay for what you use, it has nationwide coverage.

2045
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,160
They have a CDMA and a GSM network.

2046
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,560
And you can probably guess the towers

2047
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:07,680
that those networks are.

2048
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,220
So you just pick the one that works best in your area.

2049
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:12,600
They got a control panel that you turn stuff on and off

2050
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,320
as you need it.

2051
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,240
They can get a SIM for like $9.

2052
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,360
It's even available on Amazon Prime.

2053
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,160
I mean, it's just awesome.

2054
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,960
linux.ting.com.

2055
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,760
It really is a better way to do mobile.

2056
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,100
Whether you want to have a security device, my buddy Chase

2057
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,560
from Unfilter, he has some Ting mobile devices,

2058
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,920
SIM cards in his security cameras.

2059
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:33,400
And they send him like, I don't know, like four pictures

2060
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:35,160
a week.

2061
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,000
Well, why would you pay for like 20 gigs of data

2062
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,720
That's insane.

2063
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:42,220
When you're maybe using eight megabytes a week, right?

2064
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:44,200
And that's the perfect.

2065
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,720
You can get that SIM card, and you

2066
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,440
could put it in an Internet of Things device.

2067
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,640
You could put it in a phone.

2068
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,240
Oh, it's perfect.

2069
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:52,160
You could put it in your daily driver.

2070
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,880
The use cases are just all over the place.

2071
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,220
Because there's no contracts.

2072
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,320
There's no other termination fees.

2073
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:59,360
So if it doesn't work for you, just turn it off.

2074
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,520
It's $6 a month for the line.

2075
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,640
And then you can manage all the different features

2076
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,520
through their dashboard.

2077
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,160
I think it's perfect for people who really just,

2078
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,940
where that expense is somewhat trivial,

2079
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,440
and you just need to get stuff done.

2080
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,680
It's just the perfect backup internet connection.

2081
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:14,640
Your main thing goes out.

2082
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,800
You still need to go get those files and do stuff.

2083
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,400
Boom, Ting.

2084
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,160
$6 a month.

2085
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,860
If you don't use it, that's all you pay.

2086
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,640
When I was doing just 100% IT contracting, I had,

2087
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:26,200
Ting wasn't a thing then.

2088
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:26,960
The dark days.

2089
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:27,840
I remember this.

2090
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,840
I had a plan.

2091
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,140
I almost won't even admit this.

2092
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:36,200
But you have to understand, I was billing $120 an hour.

2093
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,840
So understand that.

2094
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,800
I had a plan that was $120 a month that sat in my drawer.

2095
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,520
Just for when I was traveling, or when my internet connection

2096
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,560
went down, or for when I was at another client that

2097
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,720
had crazy firewall rules, or I needed

2098
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,880
to do external testing, that I just kept in my laptop bag

2099
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,520
all the time, it was always powered on.

2100
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,160
And it was probably, I mean, I probably

2101
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,960
used no more than one gig a month on that thing.

2102
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:03,440
Wow.

2103
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,120
Wow.

2104
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,580
I would do it so different now.

2105
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,280
So different now.

2106
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,680
I got three lines now on Ting.

2107
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:08,760
Linux.Ting.com.

2108
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,360
Go there, learn more, save $25 off a device

2109
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:16,640
or off your first month by going to Linux.Ting.com.

2110
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:21,720
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

2111
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,680
So Mr. Payne over there has been installing

2112
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,480
Gentoo throughout the show.

2113
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:27,760
How's it going so far, Wes?

2114
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,960
We're still compiling.

2115
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,480
So I'm checking in right now.

2116
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,520
What are you building at this moment?

2117
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,640
Same position we were from last time.

2118
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,680
I'm sorry, what?

2119
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,560
Yeah, that's right.

2120
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,240
I'm sorry, what?

2121
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,200
That's right.

2122
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,480
So you're saying I literally have nothing

2123
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,000
new to talk about?

2124
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,480
That's true.

2125
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,680
Yeah, we're just updating the world.

2126
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,480
See, but the thing is, Wes, is I plan this whole segment.

2127
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,720
This whole segment.

2128
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,640
Well, it's gone well.

2129
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,920
So we've got all of our file systems formatted right now.

2130
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:50,640
What did you do?

2131
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,720
Did you go extend to four?

2132
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,880
XFS.

2133
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,840
Oh, really?

2134
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,000
Atta boy.

2135
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:55,560
Why not?

2136
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,120
I mean, I'm not trying to slub it here.

2137
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,600
No, XFS is my thing.

2138
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,040
I really think that's the way to go.

2139
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:01,520
Good job.

2140
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,880
OK, so you went XFS.

2141
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,280
Did you do like a home partition, or how did you?

2142
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,680
Yeah, I was just keeping it pretty simple here.

2143
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,200
So everything's just one partition?

2144
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:08,960
Yeah, just one partition.

2145
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:09,640
Then you have a swap?

2146
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,120
I would never run a real system that way.

2147
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,280
Do you have a separate boot?

2148
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,280
No, not yet.

2149
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:14,840
Really?

2150
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,240
We might add that on there, but.

2151
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,360
And you have a swap?

2152
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,280
No, no swap either.

2153
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,480
I didn't give it that much brand.

2154
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,980
I wonder if you could do a swap file.

2155
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:24,240
You could do a swap file instead.

2156
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,800
I'll probably add a swap file, yeah.

2157
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,880
Yeah.

2158
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,880
Hmm.

2159
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,080
So what do you think, Beard?

2160
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,580
Is this sort of unimpressive?

2161
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,720
I have an important forward-looking question

2162
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:36,260
that is going to decide how long this process is going to take.

2163
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,040
Desktop environment?

2164
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,720
Yeah.

2165
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,760
Yeah, I think we should talk about that.

2166
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:39,680
That's a good question.

2167
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,960
I chose not to do system D as the init system,

2168
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,840
so open RC is where we're going with this.

2169
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,160
I figured if we were doing the GEN2 challenge,

2170
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,960
but just regular C, user land, all that stuff.

2171
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,840
Fair enough, fair enough.

2172
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,400
So after this, we're going to get our use flags configured,

2173
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,520
everything there, compile the kernel,

2174
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,040
and configure the rest of the system.

2175
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,960
I have a suggestion.

2176
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:02,520
Well, I don't even know if I want to say this out loud.

2177
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,100
I feel like we should have talked about this off air,

2178
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,220
but I have a suggestion for the desktop.

2179
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,120
What do you think about the latest Enlightenment?

2180
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,320
Oh.

2181
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,160
Yeah.

2182
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,920
And what about Wayland and the latest Enlightenment?

2183
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,360
Do you want to try it?

2184
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:17,240
That might be interesting.

2185
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,760
Is this stupid?

2186
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,160
Here's the thing, we have enough time.

2187
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:22,960
So people that are GEN2 users could let us know,

2188
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,240
is this completely dumb?

2189
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,360
Should we go in latest Enlightenment and latest Wayland

2190
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,200
and just roll with that?

2191
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,200
That might be fun.

2192
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,040
Check it out.

2193
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,880
That would be great.

2194
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,760
That would be great, but I think we need the feedback

2195
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,520
because I don't want to do something

2196
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,760
that's almost guaranteed to fail,

2197
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,800
especially the thing is, this is in a VM.

2198
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,760
What is the VM environment again?

2199
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:41,600
A virtual box.

2200
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,600
So that is an important factor here.

2201
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,160
We got to remember the fact that we're trying

2202
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,320
to do this in virtual box.

2203
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,400
Right.

2204
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,280
And I don't want the virtual box video driver to.

2205
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,920
Now I suppose if we, well, but there's a lot of compiling.

2206
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,960
I suppose we could, if we get it compiled,

2207
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,240
I could then boot into it from my physical machine

2208
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,320
for actually running the desktop.

2209
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,160
That might be an option.

2210
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,240
What kind of, did you do a VMDK?

2211
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,760
What did you do for the disk?

2212
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,440
Yeah, so it's, no, it's just a raw VHD.

2213
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:09,160
Oh, so you would like rub that up?

2214
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,600
Yeah.

2215
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,440
Rub that up.

2216
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,280
I like that.

2217
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,120
I'm going to use that term.

2218
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:16,360
So, okay, so you would grub that up, boot into that,

2219
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:20,600
and then we could VLC RTMP stream your whole desktop

2220
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,360
to the OBS machine.

2221
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,280
Yeah, we could do that.

2222
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,920
Yeah, I don't see why not.

2223
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,320
If we could get enlightenment working,

2224
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,400
then we could do enlightenment

2225
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,520
with full 3D acceleration on the stream.

2226
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,360
That would be pretty cool.

2227
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,440
Oh, that would be beautiful, okay.

2228
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:33,280
That kind of seems like.

2229
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,760
That seems like the goal to aim for.

2230
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,400
That kind of seems like the way we should go.

2231
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,720
So where do you want to go with this?

2232
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:43,760
What are you building specifically right now again?

2233
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,400
I was updating the world set.

2234
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,460
Okay, when you're done, should this be bootable?

2235
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,840
No, not yet.

2236
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,680
So we're not even.

2237
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,500
We're not even going to get.

2238
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,340
It's not bootable yet, no.

2239
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:55,120
We're not even going to get bootable in this episode.

2240
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,520
No, no, we're not bootable.

2241
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:58,400
Okay.

2242
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,200
Come on, Chris, these things take time.

2243
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,840
This isn't just a story we're following, it's a saga, Chris.

2244
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,640
So this is why people go with these Gen 2.

2245
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:11,760
I was just looking at this branch of different Gen 2 systems,

2246
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,120
these remixes of Gen 2.

2247
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,760
I think this is why people do this.

2248
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,560
I can't believe I used to do this per server back in the day.

2249
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,800
This is mind-numbing to think about this.

2250
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,040
I mean, I must have had 35 Gen 2 servers back in the day,

2251
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,920
maybe 40 servers.

2252
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:32,680
And I used to do this on each one of them?

2253
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,600
That's crazy.

2254
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,180
Well, the thing is you do them all in parallel,

2255
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:36,920
so it only takes the time of one.

2256
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,840
Yeah, and I definitely use the hell out of disk CC.

2257
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,360
Disk CC allowed me to distribute the compiling

2258
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,680
across multiple systems.

2259
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:48,400
And we are limiting this to one system as we build this,

2260
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,640
so I guess that's a disclaimer.

2261
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:50,480
That's true, yeah.

2262
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,120
I mean, if you want the classic long,

2263
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,360
forever compiling Gen 2 experience.

2264
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,760
Not doing Plasma, dude.

2265
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,600
Yeah.

2266
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,440
No, I'm not doing it.

2267
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,920
That will take months.

2268
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,960
I knew where you were going, and we're not doing that.

2269
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,280
I think Enlightenment or, what else, Wes?

2270
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,760
What would be your Enlightenment backup, XFCE?

2271
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,880
Open box, nice and light.

2272
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,720
That's true.

2273
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:14,540
LXDE?

2274
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:15,380
Yeah, that might be fun.

2275
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,220
LXQD.

2276
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:17,040
Yeah, there we go.

2277
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,360
I was actually thinking LXQD, yeah.

2278
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,560
I was thinking, Mumbler, do you have any suggestions

2279
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,720
of super minimal desktops to build on Gen 2?

2280
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:24,560
I3.

2281
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,600
I3, I3 would be a good one.

2282
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,520
More awesome, yeah.

2283
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,520
Yeah, I like I3, or Sway,

2284
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:32,880
if we're talking about doing Wayland.

2285
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:33,840
What about Lumina?

2286
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,080
Yes.

2287
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,160
Interesting.

2288
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:41,000
I think we should, okay, we need a poll.

2289
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,320
It needs to either be Enlightenment or Lumina.

2290
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,520
I thought Sway would be interesting,

2291
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,960
although we could talk about Sway at any time.

2292
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,520
Well, okay, I'm okay with three,

2293
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,080
I'm actually pretty open to a three-way

2294
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:52,920
if you wanna do a three-way.

2295
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,440
Yeah, we could always do multi-desktop configuration.

2296
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:57,560
Well, no, no, I mean, we could do a three-way vote,

2297
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,240
and the audience could decide,

2298
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,960
and whatever they pick, let's do that.

2299
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:05,740
So I think we should, I'm gonna embed a straw poll

2300
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,760
in the show notes for this week's episode,

2301
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,420
and we probably won't get a lot of votes

2302
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:11,360
because we're way into the episode,

2303
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,720
but I feel like I'll also drop it

2304
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,760
in the chat room for the live stream,

2305
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,160
but I feel like we'll do three options.

2306
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,520
So it's Enlightenment,

2307
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:20,800
Sway,

2308
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,420
and Lumina.

2309
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,680
Yeah, well, the only thing I,

2310
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,400
the only one I was, the only thing I wanted,

2311
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,680
do we want it, instead of, well, no,

2312
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,640
I feel like Sway, we should give a serious consideration.

2313
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,720
But we could also talk about it in the future.

2314
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,960
Yeah, I was just, I'm trying to think about LXQ.

2315
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:45,960
All right, so let's do Enlightenment, Lumina, and Sway,

2316
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,120
and we'll do a dedicated thing to LXQ in the future.

2317
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,960
That's the way to do it.

2318
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:51,720
I think that's the way to do LXQ.

2319
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,600
All right, so we'll put a link in,

2320
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,640
or I'll embed it in the show notes.

2321
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,240
You go to jupiterbroadcasting.com,

2322
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,800
look for episode 225 of The Unplugged Program,

2323
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,280
and then vote on which one you want us to go with,

2324
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,640
and Wes will try to build that, I guess,

2325
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,160
maybe next episode, maybe?

2326
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,000
Yeah, maybe.

2327
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,320
Do you wanna just leave this build going?

2328
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,320
Yeah, I think I will, yeah.

2329
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,240
I'm composing the straw poll right now.

2330
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:15,360
It'll be in the show notes,

2331
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:17,400
and if you're gonna stick around for the post-show,

2332
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,100
I'll let you guys vote that are listening live.

2333
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,200
But I think that's probably where

2334
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,540
we should leave it right now.

2335
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,100
I'm proud of you, you're going.

2336
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:24,760
I'm watching it right now, you're building the way.

2337
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:27,280
I'm really, you're, how did you do this?

2338
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,280
Is this a screen session, or what am I looking at here?

2339
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,440
Just, I logged you into the machine with T-MUX.

2340
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,700
So you're watching it too over there?

2341
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,840
Yep. Ah, cool.

2342
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,680
That's right, I am.

2343
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,000
Nice, and then we're taking that,

2344
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,240
and we're capturing that from an SSH session,

2345
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:42,240
and putting that up on the live capture.

2346
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,880
We'll have some better methods in the future.

2347
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:44,920
This was just last-ditch.

2348
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,280
Yeah, well, we're actually,

2349
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,920
it's actually kind of fun for us internally.

2350
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,080
We're coming up with different ways

2351
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,320
we could capture your Gentoo build over there,

2352
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,340
because it's like, there's no X session.

2353
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:57,200
So there's not a lot of things we can work with

2354
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,360
to remotely capture that and put it on a video capture.

2355
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,160
What was that terminal sharing thing?

2356
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:08,160
ASCII Cinema, or Paiobu, or screen, or T-MUX, or teleconsole?

2357
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,360
Yeah, what was the first one, Pobi?

2358
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,720
ASCII Cinema, ASCII Cinema.

2359
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,160
Right, right, right, right, right.

2360
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,920
That's for recording, not for streaming.

2361
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,000
Yeah, it didn't seem to have a live stream option.

2362
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,960
Our thinking was we would kind of play

2363
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:23,480
with a couple of different options

2364
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:24,880
on the pre-show next week,

2365
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,240
and kind of dial in the one that works the best,

2366
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,600
and then just sort of use that.

2367
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,200
So if you want to join us live next week,

2368
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,400
go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for that,

2369
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,000
because that's probably what we'll be spending

2370
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,440
the live stream doing,

2371
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,120
is trying to figure out how to stream

2372
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:43,000
a barely bootstrapped Gentoo system to do a live stream.

2373
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Beautiful. Yeah, I know, right?

2374
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:45,840
But in the meantime,

2375
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,040
go to linuxunplugged.reddit.com to give us your feedback,

2376
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:50,840
your thoughts, and all of that.

2377
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,080
We appreciate that.

2378
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,760
And your ideas on the Gentoo Challenge,

2379
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,200
and please, please, please go to the show notes

2380
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,840
and vote on the desktop environment that Wes should deploy.

2381
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,960
We need your votes.

2382
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,320
And if you want a little more Wes Payne,

2383
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,640
you want a little more beard, you want a little me,

2384
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,800
you know, just a little me,

2385
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,160
go check out the most recent user error.

2386
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,640
Shouldn't disappoint.

2387
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:11,800
If you want a little more poppy,

2388
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,720
you want a little more wimpy,

2389
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,480
check them out at the Ubuntu podcast,

2390
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:18,680
always delivering a solid performance.

2391
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,920
And last but not least,

2392
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,600
check out the whole damn network

2393
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,760
over at at jupytersignal on the Twitters.

2394
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,320
Yeah, I said Twitters.

2395
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,920
Deal with it, people, and we'll see you next week.

2396
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,840
We'll be right back.

2397
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:14,520
Well, what do we call this one?

2398
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,520
What do you call this thing?

2399
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,520
What do you call it?

2400
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:17,520
JBtitles.com.

2401
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,520
Go there and vote.

2402
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:23,240
And if you're in any of the chat rooms, Discord or IRC, please bang suggest.

2403
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:29,200
But Eric, didn't you have, you had something we wanted to add to the post show, didn't

2404
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,200
you?

2405
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,200
Eric, did I mute you?

2406
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,200
No.

2407
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,200
No, you're not muted.

2408
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,200
No, it's not my fault this time.

2409
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,200
That's okay, dude.

2410
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:40,120
I'm just going to give you your spotlight on a large Linux podcast, and you just go

2411
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,880
ahead and totally AFK, it's cool.

2412
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:43,880
JBtitles.com.

2413
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,840
We did just keep on talking.

2414
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,720
All right, so I need to finish up this poll.

2415
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:53,320
So what should Wes install, right?

2416
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,320
Don't you think that's the way to go?

2417
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,360
What should Wes install?

2418
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,600
What are our options again?

2419
01:35:58,600 --> 01:35:59,600
I'm sorry, I'm just-

2420
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,680
From architect, you should add DWM to that list.

2421
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,680
Fuck you.

2422
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,680
From Wes.

2423
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:05,680
Enlightenment, Sway, and-

2424
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,680
Yes.

2425
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,680
Sway.

2426
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,680
Plasma.

2427
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,680
Sway.

2428
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,680
No, plasma is not a fucking option.

2429
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:12,680
That looks cute.

2430
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,680
No, we're going to do that separate.

2431
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,680
No, yes, separate.

2432
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,680
Although I guess let them decide.

2433
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,680
No, no, separate.

2434
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,680
No, separate, separate.

2435
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,680
Okay.

2436
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,680
There was a third one.

2437
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,680
BST one.

2438
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,680
Luminous.

2439
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:22,680
Oh, luminous.

2440
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,680
Yes, yes.

2441
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,680
What is it called?

2442
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,680
Lumina.

2443
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,680
Oh shit, I just hit reload.

2444
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,680
What desktop?

2445
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:31,000
This is like Groundhog Day.

2446
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Should Wes.

2447
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I'm just going to say should Wes build, because that's really what you're doing, right?

2448
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Yeah, you do.

2449
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
No, not Enlightenment.

2450
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I hate it.

2451
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Sway.

2452
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Sway.

2453
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Okay.

2454
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Illumina.

2455
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Is it Illumina?

2456
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Yeah.

2457
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Illumina.

2458
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Illumina.

2459
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Illumina.

2460
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Illumina.

2461
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Yeah, it's Illumina.

2462
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,920
Why do I feel like it's not Illumina?

2463
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,280
I don't feel like it's Illumina.

2464
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,480
No A at the beginning.

2465
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,480
Just Illumina.

2466
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,480
Illumina.

2467
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:58,480
Illumina.

2468
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,480
No, no.

2469
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,640
No A at the start.

2470
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,640
Just Illumina.

2471
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,640
Hmm.

2472
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,880
Okay, what do I search for to get that?

2473
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:05,880
Because I'm doing Illumina.

2474
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:06,880
Oh, oh, I see.

2475
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:11,600
No, I'm not doing an A. I'm doing an I. That's what our...

2476
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,600
I'm doing...

2477
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,600
Yeah, so Illumina.

2478
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,640
Oh, I really fucking hate that.

2479
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,560
I really don't like that at all.

2480
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,080
Okay, so it's Illumina desktop environment.

2481
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,520
That would be a good build, though.

2482
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,400
That would be a pretty quick build, right?

2483
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,320
So that's pretty good.

2484
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:29,280
Okay, so Illumina desktop environment is the appropriate name.

2485
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,680
I think we should use the full names.

2486
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,720
And we should be specific.

2487
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:33,720
Which version...

2488
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,680
Hey, Discord, IRC, can you help me?

2489
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:40,440
Which version of Enlightenment specifically supports Wayland?

2490
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,520
Because it has to be that one.

2491
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,680
We could have also done Mate.

2492
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:48,160
No, I'm talking about Wayland here.

2493
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,160
Oh, yeah.

2494
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:50,160
Is Mate...

2495
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,760
The newest version should all support Wayland.

2496
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,760
22, 21, shit.

2497
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,760
Wait a minute.

2498
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,760
Wimpy, I'm like...

2499
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,760
Drive by right there?

2500
01:37:58,760 --> 01:37:59,760
You got whip braced.

2501
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,760
No, it doesn't.

2502
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:01,760
I love it.

2503
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:02,760
I don't know why, but something...

2504
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:03,760
Wimpy, you're so polite.

2505
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,760
You know what?

2506
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:05,760
You're...

2507
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:06,760
You obviously...

2508
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:16,680
You know what?

2509
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,680
I just love it.

2510
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:18,680
No, no.

2511
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,680
No, it doesn't.

2512
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,680
Good for you.

2513
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:21,680
Well, okay.

2514
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:25,480
So, if we're just doing Wayland, we shouldn't put Element...

2515
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:26,480
Or...

2516
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,520
I guess I got Elementary OS on the mind.

2517
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,280
I have been thinking about...

2518
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,840
I have been thinking about, instead of going all in on 97...

2519
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:35,000
Dan's evil mission is complete.

2520
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,720
Dan showing up here every single week has been making me think, like, oh, fuck, maybe

2521
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:38,720
I should just...

2522
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:42,000
If I'm gonna go LTS, maybe I should just go Elementary OS, because my son's running that

2523
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,560
already, and it's working great for him.

2524
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,280
It's been working great for him for, like, two and a half years, so...

2525
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,280
Yeah.

2526
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,280
Damn it.

2527
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,840
I blame Dan the rabbit.

2528
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,000
Okay, so Elementary OS is not what I'm thinking of.

2529
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,240
I'm thinking of...

2530
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:56,240
What is it?

2531
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,240
Lumina.

2532
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:58,240
Lumina.

2533
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,240
Lumina.

2534
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,240
All right.

2535
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,240
I don't know why, though.

2536
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,240
I get those two confused.

2537
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,240
So, we got Lumina desktop, Enlightenment, and...

2538
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,240
Sway.

2539
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:05,240
Sway.

2540
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,240
Sway.

2541
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:35,240
Sway.
