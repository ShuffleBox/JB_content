WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Hey Chris, did you see the Gnome Foundation received a whole bunch of money lately?

00:03.600 --> 00:11.560
Yeah, they got $400,000 in total, like $300,000 is going to the foundation and another $100,000 is going to GIMP.

00:11.560 --> 00:15.680
That's awesome. It's all coming from this mysterious handshake.org.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.240
I gotta be honest, Wes, I did not know about handshake.org, I don't think, before I saw this.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.200
Kind of a sleeper project, but it's interesting.

00:23.200 --> 00:29.960
Yeah, it is. It's kind of promising what has always been hoped for, which is decentralized, permissionless naming.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.400
Like DNS and certificate trusts, and it works with DNS in a way.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.880
Put that another way, an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS server.

00:39.880 --> 00:43.440
This is very fascinating and a great idea.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.760
I'd love to know more about them, so we might reach out in the future and have a chat with them, but yeah, this is great.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.440
Even if we haven't heard about them, that they have this kind of money to slosh around,

00:51.440 --> 00:56.320
not only seems to benefit us a lot, but does make me think like, okay, what's going on over there?

00:56.320 --> 00:59.560
Hmm, perhaps this will relate to something else we're going to talk about today.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.240
Strokes the beard randomly.

01:02.240 --> 01:08.200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 261 for August 7th, 2018.

01:19.160 --> 01:24.240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's fully staffed and ready to podcast.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.040
My name is Chris.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.120
My name is Wes.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.120
And my name is Brent.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.400
Hello, guys, we have a great show coming up today.

01:30.400 --> 01:37.800
261 is packed full of great community good news, really, including new features that are coming to Linux,

01:37.800 --> 01:42.840
great news for friends of the show, new features that are surprising even Microsoft,

01:42.840 --> 01:46.600
and hope for those of us that want to play Windows games on Linux,

01:46.600 --> 01:51.200
as well as a couple of great apps, an update on our community PeerTube instance,

01:51.200 --> 01:55.720
and a breakdown of what's got our attention in the new Android Pie release.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.400
That's a ton of stuff this week.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.760
Absolutely packed.

01:58.760 --> 02:03.000
And not only do you have your humble hosts, myself, Wes, and Brent,

02:03.000 --> 02:07.040
but you have that virtual log, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:07.040 --> 02:08.520
Hello, what's up?

02:08.520 --> 02:10.720
Greetings, hello.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.920
I don't know if it comes across, but that's a full room this week.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.240
I'm excited too, I think they're raring to go.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.760
I'm raring to go, Wes.

02:18.760 --> 02:24.360
Tell you what, I've been out there in the heat, charging myself like Superman,

02:24.360 --> 02:27.360
preparing myself to podcast this week,

02:27.360 --> 02:31.800
because the news has even reached the halls of Microsoft.

02:31.800 --> 02:36.200
It's undeniable the power of developers on Linux.

02:36.200 --> 02:44.520
July ended with 3.97 million starts of PowerShell Core,

02:44.520 --> 02:49.360
82% of which were all on Linux.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.880
They were expecting those numbers to be reversed,

02:51.880 --> 02:54.360
and they thought it would be on Windows 10.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.200
This is from a little birdie tells me that would be in a position to know

02:58.200 --> 03:00.920
that they were expecting the numbers to be the exact opposite.

03:00.920 --> 03:05.640
They thought that Linux would be around 20%,

03:05.640 --> 03:08.320
and Windows 10 would be around 80-ish percent.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.720
I mean, that's how it normally goes.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.320
And they got the numbers back from the, you know,

03:12.320 --> 03:14.200
insight metrics that they collect,

03:14.200 --> 03:22.680
and 82% of the PowerShell start instances happened on Linux boxes.

03:22.680 --> 03:27.480
That's a, I mean, that's Microsoft's own shell, okay?

03:27.480 --> 03:29.160
I mean, that's why that really gets me.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.880
It's not like it's Bash, okay?

03:31.880 --> 03:33.040
It's PowerShell.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.920
I'm really curious to know what all those people are using it for.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.880
I mean, not that they are not legitimate uses.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.360
I'm just genuinely interested.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.760
See, I've always had a theory, the whole PowerShell Core coming to Linux thing

03:42.760 --> 03:47.720
was really a gift to system administrators who wanted to use Linux

03:47.720 --> 03:50.440
and still manage a bunch of Windows boxes.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.920
And I wonder if that's a bit of what's going on here.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.400
Oh, sure. Yeah, it's your little open source tie-in into that system.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.560
There's also certain things about PowerShell that are very appealing

03:59.560 --> 04:01.880
when you compare it to certain other shell environments,

04:01.880 --> 04:03.760
which I am not an expert to get into,

04:03.760 --> 04:06.800
but we did cover that in a past episode, if people want to know.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.880
I just thought that was a fascinating stat to start with right there.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.520
I also love hearing that 82% of anything is on Linux.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.080
I think that's a really good thing for us.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.240
That's very true. That is very true.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.000
I want to give a special shout out to not one,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.720
but two fine gentlemen from the Elementary OS Project.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.520
Hello to Dan and Cassidy. Good to have you guys here.

04:25.520 --> 04:26.440
How's it going, Bill?

04:26.440 --> 04:31.280
Guys, I feel like we should start on a journey.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.000
I want to go on a journey with you guys to talk about where we're at.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.280
But the reason why they're both here, one of the reasons, at least I assume,

04:37.280 --> 04:41.960
is last week Cassidy announced that after quite a while at System76,

04:41.960 --> 04:45.480
he is going full time at Elementary OS.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.200
And that's massive.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.480
For anybody who's ever had a side passion project

04:51.480 --> 04:53.400
that they were super committed to,

04:53.400 --> 04:56.080
there's always been that agony to go full time.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.120
I'm pretty familiar with that.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.080
So Cassidy, I'm just super happy for you, man,

05:00.080 --> 05:01.880
because I can imagine how good that must feel.

05:01.880 --> 05:02.920
So congratulations.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.120
Thank you. Yeah, I'm really stoked.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.320
So we are going to get to that,

05:07.320 --> 05:11.240
as well as some other potentially interesting community news.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.160
But the crew voted,

05:13.160 --> 05:17.840
and we decided to start with just a bit of a TechSnap security notice in a way.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.720
Really here, it's this vulnerability notice

05:20.720 --> 05:24.800
for a flaw in the Linux kernel TCP implementation,

05:24.800 --> 05:28.880
which makes it vulnerable to an easy denial of service attack.

05:28.880 --> 05:34.160
Linux kernel versions 4.9 and above can be forced to make a very expensive call

05:34.160 --> 05:38.720
to the TCP collapse queue and the TCP prune queue calls

05:38.720 --> 05:42.040
for every single incoming packet,

05:42.040 --> 05:44.280
which would lead to a denial of service.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.600
They say can, but of course that would.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.200
An attacker can induce a denial of service condition

05:49.200 --> 05:55.120
by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.960
Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous 2A TCP sessions

05:58.960 --> 05:59.880
on a reachable port.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.600
Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IPs.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.040
But the impact is a remote attacker may be able to trigger

06:06.040 --> 06:09.920
a denial of service condition against a system with an open port

06:09.920 --> 06:12.320
and it's on anything above kernel 4.9.

06:12.320 --> 06:17.800
Yeah, that's rough, especially if you're running a server out there on the internet.

06:17.800 --> 06:22.240
It looks like with less than two kilopackets per second of an attack traffic,

06:22.240 --> 06:26.120
you can then just totally, totally load a box, delay all the network traffic.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.880
That's not really good if you are trying to surf webpages.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.360
This is how podcast wars will be fought in the future

06:31.360 --> 06:35.360
once they become big business franchises.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.840
That's so funny to even think.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.360
The podcast wars, when it's just five podcast companies left,

06:40.360 --> 06:43.200
they began exploiting old Linux boxes on the internet

06:43.200 --> 06:44.640
with denial of service attacks.

06:44.640 --> 06:48.120
I mean, when you're too busy making podcasts to patch your box,

06:48.120 --> 06:48.960
that's your problem.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.080
Who can patch?

06:50.080 --> 06:50.680
Who can patch?

06:50.680 --> 06:53.080
Anyways, the crew wanted to get you.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.760
The crew being those of us that chatted about it earlier today,

06:56.760 --> 06:58.720
which was a few of us thought, you know what?

06:58.720 --> 07:00.720
If we're going to talk about this on the show,

07:00.720 --> 07:04.200
we should probably get it out there in sort of like the more you know kind of thing.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.840
And there's no real workaround except an updated kernel.

07:06.840 --> 07:07.880
So go look for those.

07:07.880 --> 07:08.400
Yeah.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.760
OK, now here's the news I've been avoiding,

07:12.760 --> 07:13.960
even though it's the beginning of the show,

07:13.960 --> 07:17.640
I've been delaying to get to this point

07:17.640 --> 07:20.560
because I feel like it's going to be perceived as an attack

07:20.560 --> 07:22.520
and it is not an attack, it is an analysis.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.960
And we start with a piece that was written

07:25.960 --> 07:30.160
about common causes of Fedora workstation crashes

07:30.160 --> 07:33.520
and the fact that they have been traced back to Gnome, Shell,

07:33.520 --> 07:37.280
JavaCrypt extension, JavaScript extensions crashing.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.760
So here's the scenario.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.800
And this is a write up that we'll have linked in the show notes

07:40.800 --> 07:44.200
at linuxunplug.com slash 261 if you would like to read it yourself

07:44.200 --> 07:47.400
or if you've been experiencing some instability issues.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.880
Now this is predominantly the worst on Fedora 28

07:50.880 --> 07:52.160
because it's using Wayland.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.920
And here's the scenario.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.480
A Gnome shell extension crashes.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.400
That takes out the shell.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.280
When the shell goes out, it takes out Mutter,

08:01.280 --> 08:04.720
which is the thing that's talking Wayland,

08:04.720 --> 08:08.360
that is the display server, and you lose your entire desktop

08:08.360 --> 08:12.000
because a shell extension crashed.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.400
That's very upsetting.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.320
And so the developers have started

08:16.320 --> 08:19.960
talking about ways to potentially resolve this issue.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.400
There's been a few different discussions really.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.200
So this isn't any one particular developer's idea.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.880
It's been kicked around a lot, even at this year's Gwadek.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.720
The idea could be to perhaps just sort of enhance

08:31.720 --> 08:33.400
the existing behavior in Gnome Shell

08:33.400 --> 08:36.280
where when it crashes and it comes back,

08:36.280 --> 08:39.680
the shell, when it comes back, all extensions are disabled.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.480
And it is up to the user to sort of go through and play

08:42.480 --> 08:44.800
Russian roulette and re-enable their extensions

08:44.800 --> 08:46.800
until they get to the thing that crashes.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.440
Of course, we all know in the real world,

08:48.440 --> 08:49.800
you don't crash immediately often.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.160
It's a day or two later.

08:51.160 --> 08:53.360
So it's really hard to actually figure out which one it is,

08:53.360 --> 08:54.920
even if you're checking the logs.

08:54.920 --> 08:58.560
But that's sort of the most easy course to take

08:58.560 --> 09:00.600
is you just sort of change the way

09:00.600 --> 09:03.880
the shell crash behavior works.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.520
Another possibility that has been considered

09:07.520 --> 09:11.200
is decoupling Gnome Shell and Mutter.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.800
But obviously, that would require major architecture

09:14.800 --> 09:17.680
changes, something we've talked about on this show before,

09:17.680 --> 09:20.960
and also likely changes in the way extensions behave

09:20.960 --> 09:23.440
and the creation of some sort of IPC communication

09:23.440 --> 09:25.760
system in the background.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.360
Then there's a third proposal, perhaps in some ways

09:28.360 --> 09:31.960
the easiest proposal, but the most controversial proposal.

09:31.960 --> 09:36.120
And that's discontinuing unlimited extensions,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.880
introducing a limited API they can use.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.600
Instead of hot patching, because this is how it works right now,

09:42.600 --> 09:45.800
like the old Mac OS Classic extensions that literally hot

09:45.800 --> 09:51.240
patched Mac Classic, right now extensions on Gnome Shell

09:51.240 --> 09:55.040
are hot patching the Gnome Shell code itself.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.440
Obviously, this is risky.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.040
And if you introduced an API that the extensions could use,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.160
and you could even limit that API,

10:02.160 --> 10:05.920
it would mean that basically all of the existing extensions

10:05.920 --> 10:08.120
would have to be completely re-implemented,

10:08.120 --> 10:09.680
and likely some of their feature sets

10:09.680 --> 10:11.920
that they take advantage of now, because they can just

10:11.920 --> 10:14.680
insert themselves into the code of the shell,

10:14.680 --> 10:17.040
they would lose that access, and that functionality

10:17.040 --> 10:19.160
would be gone.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.120
So this is a difficult point that Gnome is approaching.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.440
And they're not necessarily taking any action right now.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.480
These are just things that they're concerned about.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.560
And there's also a conversation at the same time.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.280
And again, just discussions.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.160
And this is how this is supposed to work.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.120
And we should give them the space and the room

10:37.120 --> 10:38.600
to make these discussions.

10:38.600 --> 10:42.080
But also ongoing right now are discussions

10:42.080 --> 10:45.680
around removing the theme capability from Gnome.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.640
I'm going to let that sit in for a second.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.320
One theme, their theme.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.560
No more custom distro themes.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.040
And that's a big one.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.000
Think about how Canonical sort of makes their Gnome shell

10:59.000 --> 10:59.600
theirs.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.480
Fedora puts their touch on it as well.

11:01.480 --> 11:03.080
Everybody does.

11:03.080 --> 11:07.600
And that's sort of a kind of distinguishing feature

11:07.600 --> 11:08.800
of Gnome 3 in a way.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.240
And really that distinguishing choice

11:12.240 --> 11:15.160
is one of the standout features of the Linux desktop,

11:15.160 --> 11:17.400
to have to have that level of choice.

11:17.400 --> 11:21.680
But I have seen what an absolute shit show that code really is.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.320
You're hot patching CSS.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.440
You're going in there, and you're yanking out

11:26.440 --> 11:28.520
lines of code in CSS and putting in new ones.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.080
And then you're reloading the shell

11:30.080 --> 11:33.360
and seeing what the hell happens if the shell even loads again.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.960
That's how you create a Gnome shell theme.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.840
And the way anybody gets it done right now is they fork.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.840
That's why everybody forks themes now.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.480
Because so much of that super crazy ass hard initial work

11:43.480 --> 11:44.520
has been done.

11:44.520 --> 11:47.080
So people are just building on top of other themes now.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.800
Because you got to kind of be a masochist

11:48.800 --> 11:50.520
to go back and do that to yourself.

11:50.520 --> 11:54.000
And I watched somebody do it at a canonical event.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.480
Let me tell you, that was one of the things that,

11:56.480 --> 11:58.600
I'm not joking, made me switch to Plasma.

11:58.600 --> 12:04.440
When I saw how that was being done, I completely lost faith.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.160
And that was one of the things that made me switch to Plasma.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.720
When I saw that, I went, holy shit.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.160
So I can understand why they would

12:12.160 --> 12:14.400
want to get rid of that functionality entirely.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.880
Not only that, but it creates consistency

12:16.880 --> 12:18.480
for developers.

12:18.480 --> 12:22.760
And it solves security potentially and stability

12:22.760 --> 12:24.760
issues potentially.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.280
And it solves a problem they call visual fragmentation,

12:28.280 --> 12:30.180
which sounds just great.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.000
Across the Gnome desktop ecosystem

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
exists visual fragmentation.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.520
And it's very real.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.720
And it's a problem for app developers.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.440
Since very few distributions ship Gnome as is,

12:40.440 --> 12:43.760
it's hard to determine what visual identity Gnome is.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.160
And therefore, it's difficult to know what visual system

12:46.160 --> 12:47.680
to build your applications for.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.740
The biggest offenders continue to be downstream projects

12:53.740 --> 12:57.340
that theme Gnome extensively by overriding the default icons

12:57.340 --> 13:00.320
and style sheets and insist that part of their own brand

13:00.320 --> 13:01.480
identity.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.600
But so long as that practice carries on,

13:03.600 --> 13:07.440
this fragmentation will continue.

13:07.440 --> 13:11.040
Now, I thought to myself, holy crap.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.680
That would be a massive change.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.200
And I was really curious to know what won Mr. Daniel

13:16.200 --> 13:17.240
Ford, I thought.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.720
So I went to his Twitter feed.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.520
And he says, you have to think about the fact

13:20.520 --> 13:25.720
that Gtk, I should say, Gtk+, is used outside of Gnome.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.520
And that right there, I think, brings

13:29.520 --> 13:30.960
this whole thing into perspective

13:30.960 --> 13:37.000
is it really underscores how in the bag Gtk is, Gtk+,

13:37.000 --> 13:38.440
that toolkit is, for Gnome.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.000
It really is the Gnome Shell desktop toolkit.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.760
And what do you think about this entire proposal, Dan?

13:43.760 --> 13:45.340
Do you think it's going to go anywhere?

13:45.340 --> 13:50.040
Do you think it's just sort of skunkworks talk right now?

13:50.040 --> 13:51.640
Or are you concerned this may actually

13:51.640 --> 13:52.800
progress into something that could

13:52.800 --> 13:54.680
be difficult for elementary OS to deal with?

13:54.680 --> 13:57.200
Because I would have to imagine you guys really

13:57.200 --> 13:59.960
rely on these mechanisms quite a bit

13:59.960 --> 14:01.880
to create the elementary look.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.200
So we actually went out to Guadec.

14:04.200 --> 14:08.880
And we participated in the talk, the theming kind of discussion

14:08.880 --> 14:12.200
API overall talk.

14:12.200 --> 14:17.880
The takeaway is that there's a lot of different parties

14:17.880 --> 14:19.360
that have competing interests.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.160
There's Gnome as a platform.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.560
There are other Gtk platforms like elementary.

14:26.560 --> 14:34.040
There are Gnome downstreams like Ubuntu and Pop OS.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.680
We have app developers.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.640
And we have users.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.920
And they all have different things they care about.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.520
And the kind of overarching theme of the discussion

14:42.520 --> 14:44.500
is, how can we make everyone happy?

14:44.500 --> 14:47.440
And I don't think that there's anyone

14:47.440 --> 14:51.040
on the either inside or outside of Gnome

14:51.040 --> 14:53.800
that wants to introduce a sweeping change that's

14:53.800 --> 14:57.080
going to make any of these parties really upset.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.120
I think we're all trying to work together.

14:59.120 --> 15:03.800
And the kind of overarching idea that came out of that talk

15:03.800 --> 15:08.800
was, we need to make it easier for downstreams from Gnome

15:08.800 --> 15:13.240
to write style sheets that are fully compatible with Adwaita

15:13.240 --> 15:15.680
so they can keep doing their branding

15:15.680 --> 15:18.160
without adding an extra burden for developers.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.080
So is that your way of saying something's going to change,

15:21.080 --> 15:23.600
but it probably won't be the end of the world for people

15:23.600 --> 15:25.880
that want to have their own downstream identity?

15:25.880 --> 15:27.580
I'm not necessarily sure something

15:27.580 --> 15:30.280
will change as far as the internals of Gtk.

15:30.280 --> 15:35.360
But I think that in terms of more and better documentation

15:35.360 --> 15:36.800
or more and better tooling.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.760
Oh, OK, I follow you.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.520
That would be a really positive development.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.200
Yeah, so I think that everybody wants

15:41.200 --> 15:43.920
to make sure that everybody's freedoms are still

15:43.920 --> 15:45.880
preserved, right?

15:45.880 --> 15:49.400
It's a real pain for developers if we start locking down

15:49.400 --> 15:51.760
things, because then it makes our development environment

15:51.760 --> 15:52.880
hostile, right?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.000
That's not fun.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.560
So nobody really wants to do that.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.800
We want to make sure that third-party developers have

15:59.800 --> 16:02.760
a stable and consistent platform to target.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.280
So if they choose to write an app for GNOME,

16:05.280 --> 16:08.140
that it works how GNOME apps should work.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.320
And if they choose to write an app for elementary,

16:10.320 --> 16:13.040
that it works how elementary apps should work.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.120
We just want to make sure that our developers have

16:15.120 --> 16:16.600
something sane to target.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.120
And it seems that the way to do that

16:19.120 --> 16:22.140
is to make it easy for people to write

16:22.140 --> 16:26.160
style sheets that are compatible with Adwaita or style

16:26.160 --> 16:29.400
sheets that are more compatible with elementary OS.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.120
All right, OK.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.640
So you've convinced me I won't be making a prediction

16:32.640 --> 16:34.760
at the end of the year that elementary OS announces

16:34.760 --> 16:36.680
the switch to Qt in 2020.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.700
So OK, all right, I'm convinced for now.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.640
So do you have any other comments or thoughts

16:41.640 --> 16:42.280
on this story?

16:42.280 --> 16:48.880
I know one of their concerns was visual fragmentation.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.580
Do you have any thoughts about that

16:50.580 --> 16:52.140
as an issue for the GNOME desktop?

16:52.140 --> 16:53.340
You have your Ubuntu look now.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.440
You got your Fedora look now.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.840
SUSE looks a certain way.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.840
Antigros looks there a certain way.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.140
They all are shipping a GNOME shell,

17:00.140 --> 17:02.440
but they all do look a little different.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.440
Even the way they function is a bit different

17:04.440 --> 17:06.480
due to different extension implementations

17:06.480 --> 17:08.600
or lack thereof in some cases.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.820
Do you have any thoughts on that particular concern

17:10.820 --> 17:13.880
just as GNOME shell as a brand, as an identity itself?

17:13.880 --> 17:16.120
Yeah, I think that people who try

17:16.120 --> 17:17.740
to make the conversation about branding

17:17.740 --> 17:19.480
like don't understand the problem.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.000
It's not about branding at all.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.800
And people try to get down on designers

17:23.800 --> 17:24.960
and talk about control.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.160
And it's not really about control either.

17:27.160 --> 17:30.320
The thing is, when we started that discussion,

17:30.320 --> 17:32.400
everybody in the room had an example

17:32.400 --> 17:34.480
of an application on their computer

17:34.480 --> 17:37.280
that was broken because it was developed against a style

17:37.280 --> 17:39.800
sheet that they weren't running.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.720
And so that's what the problem is that's trying to be solved.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.200
It's not necessarily about branding.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.760
Like, yeah, Ubuntu wants to have their brand, but it's also

17:49.760 --> 17:51.300
about trying to make a good experience.

17:51.300 --> 17:54.160
Yeah, it isn't about trying to take away people's ability

17:54.160 --> 17:57.040
or enforce a brand or anything like that.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.360
It's about making sure that applications aren't broken

18:00.360 --> 18:01.600
is what we all care about.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.440
A fundamental level of consistency

18:03.440 --> 18:05.120
so that you actually have a platform.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.720
Yeah, we just want you to load an application

18:07.720 --> 18:11.560
and not have a spinner that's crazy huge

18:11.560 --> 18:13.080
or text that's invisible.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.920
Or style sheets are super powerful,

18:15.920 --> 18:18.640
and they can make your app look really crappy.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.800
And then developers get complaints from users.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.600
And then they're like, hey, what the hell?

18:22.600 --> 18:25.560
You changed the style sheet that I built my app against,

18:25.560 --> 18:26.600
and now it doesn't work.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.600
And we're trying to make people happy,

18:29.600 --> 18:31.160
and it's a super hard problem.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.800
Yeah, Pobi, I don't know about you,

18:32.800 --> 18:34.880
but I feel like I've seen this movie before.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.080
It kind of goes something like this.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.420
Hey, here's an idea, and then the internet freaks out.

18:38.420 --> 18:40.440
You're going to take away my toy.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.880
And then it kind of ends up being not quite as big of a deal

18:43.880 --> 18:44.960
as everybody expected it.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.400
Do you think that's what's happening here,

18:46.400 --> 18:48.320
or do you think this could be a major shift?

18:48.320 --> 18:50.440
Considering the talk about extensions, too.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.880
So this is one of the pitfalls of us

18:52.880 --> 18:55.120
doing open source development.

18:55.120 --> 18:57.400
You can imagine that there are massive bun fights

18:57.400 --> 19:02.160
inside Apple and inside Google and inside Microsoft

19:02.160 --> 19:04.200
when they're talking about their OSs.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.920
And all the relevant parties and all the people

19:06.920 --> 19:10.560
who have vested interest in whatever that feature is

19:10.560 --> 19:12.200
will all be discussing this.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.680
And then it comes to a conclusion,

19:13.680 --> 19:17.700
and a decision is made, and the solution is published.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.360
Whereas with open source, you have

19:20.360 --> 19:22.160
people who have different vested interests

19:22.160 --> 19:24.680
from different parties, like Dan and Cassidy

19:24.680 --> 19:27.720
from Elementary and people from Endless

19:27.720 --> 19:30.040
and people from Canonical and people from Red Hat,

19:30.040 --> 19:33.600
all getting together and discussing this stuff in the open.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.320
And when there's a whole load of peanut gallery outside

19:37.320 --> 19:41.240
who are getting snippets of conversations from one party,

19:41.240 --> 19:43.560
from one side of the conversation,

19:43.560 --> 19:46.160
and then rebroadcasting that, it doesn't help,

19:46.160 --> 19:48.440
because everyone has a slightly different perspective.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.160
Dan has a different perspective than I would, I'm sure.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.200
So yeah, it's totally exactly.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.240
What's the name of that gal who went and observed

19:56.240 --> 19:58.480
the monkeys forever?

19:58.480 --> 19:59.480
What was that gal?

19:59.480 --> 20:00.640
She fell in love with a monkey.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.160
She loved a monkey.

20:01.160 --> 20:01.400
What was that?

20:01.400 --> 20:01.760
Come on.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.040
Come on.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.160
That's Jane Goodall.

20:03.160 --> 20:03.640
Yeah.

20:03.640 --> 20:03.840
Yeah.

20:03.840 --> 20:04.320
Thank you, Brent.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.200
Yeah.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.760
Yeah, I feel like that's got to be our approach with this stuff.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.220
We can get the binoculars out.

20:09.220 --> 20:11.640
We can get ourselves a fancy jungle suit

20:11.640 --> 20:13.920
and all that kind of stuff.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.960
But we only can really observe.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.480
We can only observe here.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.120
The process is the process.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.920
They will go through whatever process that is.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.960
And we just happen to get to watch it.

20:24.960 --> 20:30.720
And it's a neat opportunity for us, especially for podcasters.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.840
But it is a really hard line to walk,

20:33.840 --> 20:37.920
because taking away themes and taking away extensions

20:37.920 --> 20:40.200
causes an emotional reaction.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.520
And then you want to respond to that.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.680
So I think it's a, my point is it's just,

20:44.680 --> 20:47.140
I think sometimes these things start somewhere

20:47.140 --> 20:49.040
that can be scary to the end user in a degree.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.800
And I don't mean to say that to belittle people,

20:50.800 --> 20:52.760
but it is kind of like a, it's a jarring thing.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.800
Maybe that's a better word.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.480
It's jarring to the end user.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.240
I don't know.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.400
I think part of your observation,

20:58.400 --> 21:01.940
like the fact that we can observe what's going on, yes,

21:01.940 --> 21:02.440
we can.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.280
But it's open source.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.680
You could also get involved.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.720
There's nothing stopping someone doing a Google Summer of Code

21:07.720 --> 21:13.000
project to isolate and separate out extensions

21:13.000 --> 21:16.320
or build something that does some validation of extensions

21:16.320 --> 21:18.400
or captures the trace of an extension

21:18.400 --> 21:20.320
at the point when it falls over or something.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.640
There's plenty of opportunities to improve what we have.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.440
It doesn't have to be, well, we're

21:24.440 --> 21:26.880
going to have to throw this away.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.960
There's an opportunity, because it's open source,

21:28.960 --> 21:30.120
for people to get involved.

21:30.120 --> 21:33.000
But it's difficult when there's lots of parties.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.560
Yeah, OK.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.440
So just, we don't have to spend a lot more time on this.

21:37.440 --> 21:41.400
But while I have your ear, one more question to you

21:41.400 --> 21:46.320
is, wouldn't we be better off if it was all just one look

21:46.320 --> 21:51.520
and one standard and it was sort of the way Windows and Mac

21:51.520 --> 21:52.040
are?

21:52.040 --> 21:53.920
I'm not saying I want it that way.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.880
But I am saying, if your goal is to attract more developers

21:56.880 --> 22:01.800
and more end users, wouldn't that be better?

22:01.800 --> 22:02.680
I don't know, would it?

22:02.680 --> 22:04.760
I mean, which project gets to decide

22:04.760 --> 22:06.200
what that one look would be?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.360
Well, the Gnome project.

22:07.360 --> 22:07.920
Right.

22:07.920 --> 22:12.040
And maybe other people have, so long

22:12.040 --> 22:14.320
as there's a feedback loop there that

22:14.320 --> 22:16.760
allows people who are consumers of the work

22:16.760 --> 22:19.160
that the Gnome project do to feedback.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.200
And there is at Guardec, and there are mailing lists,

22:21.200 --> 22:23.840
and there's IRC, and all kinds of ways to feedback to Gnome

22:23.840 --> 22:25.680
to say, hey, look, that's not working.

22:25.680 --> 22:26.880
We need to do something else.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.520
That's exactly what is happening now,

22:28.520 --> 22:30.800
is this extension thing isn't working.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.160
This theme thing isn't working.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.400
People are providing feedback.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.080
It doesn't have to be, yeah, they

22:35.080 --> 22:36.440
could come up with one theme.

22:36.440 --> 22:39.320
But consumers would decide whether that's a good theme

22:39.320 --> 22:41.600
or not, really, and you'd find out.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.640
And this is part of the process.

22:43.640 --> 22:46.960
As much as we sometimes, you and I hate it,

22:46.960 --> 22:48.720
but it is part of the process just to watch

22:48.720 --> 22:51.440
and see where they go and talk about it a little bit,

22:51.440 --> 22:53.680
I think it is worth exploring.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.240
I think it's worth exploring the way they do extensions.

22:57.240 --> 23:01.920
I think they're a reasonable way to extend a desktop when

23:01.920 --> 23:04.520
you have a team that does have limited resources.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.000
I mean, they did just get some money,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.840
but it's only going to last them so long.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.320
And development takes time and money.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.480
It takes years.

23:12.480 --> 23:15.680
So when you have those realities,

23:15.680 --> 23:19.000
extensions bypass that, and you don't

23:19.000 --> 23:20.620
have to wait on that core team to bring

23:20.620 --> 23:21.960
in functionality to the desktop.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.440
So I think they have merit.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.760
And ironically, I'm sure just totally coincidentally,

23:26.760 --> 23:32.040
really, there was a post on how the Plasma project does

23:32.040 --> 23:32.960
their extensions.

23:32.960 --> 23:33.640
Is that right?

23:33.640 --> 23:35.560
Yeah, and it was, you'd be surprised to learn

23:35.560 --> 23:37.520
it may be technically superior.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.720
Yeah, surprise, surprise, spoiler alert.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.920
And anyways, this conversation goes on.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.040
And I say, let's all just wait and see.

23:45.040 --> 23:45.800
Don't worry.

23:45.800 --> 23:50.040
And these developers are also users of the desktop.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.920
They're not going to break their own desktop.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.640
So we'll see where this goes.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.980
I actually am really happy to see them asking

23:56.980 --> 23:58.180
some of these hard questions.

23:58.180 --> 24:01.360
I cover it more on Coder Radio this week.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.520
Not safe for work, in a not safe for work way,

24:03.520 --> 24:06.400
just as a warning to you if you want to go listen to it.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.040
And I think this is a technical debt

24:09.040 --> 24:11.160
that Gnome has needed to pay off for a long time.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.660
And now they're looking at that bill and going, OK, right.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.520
So how are we actually going to pay for this?

24:15.520 --> 24:17.480
What solution do we want to implement?

24:17.480 --> 24:19.400
What pain are we willing to endure?

24:19.400 --> 24:21.280
And that's the conversation's beginning.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.680
And it's a necessary one.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.960
So I'm all for it.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.000
I think that's where this is leading.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.520
It just starts at a place where it may startle you a little bit.

24:29.520 --> 24:30.720
It may be a bit jarring.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.000
Right, and as always, we see the parts

24:33.000 --> 24:35.360
that bubble up into the surface of drama.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.960
And work continues all the while.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.160
Yeah, no kidding, right?

24:39.160 --> 24:39.840
Yeah.

24:39.840 --> 24:44.840
Speaking of work continuing, so Mr. Cassidy joins us.

24:44.840 --> 24:48.440
He's here as now a full-time employee of Elementary OS.

24:48.440 --> 24:52.360
Normally, I would say Cassidy James is here from System 76,

24:52.360 --> 24:54.200
and he works over at Elementary OS.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.360
But now I say, formerly of System 76,

24:57.360 --> 25:00.200
now joining us on the show is Mr. Cassidy James

25:00.200 --> 25:03.360
of Elementary OS.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.320
Hey, how's it going?

25:04.320 --> 25:05.760
Hey, congratulations.

25:05.760 --> 25:10.960
So I grok that the project was the benefactor

25:10.960 --> 25:12.480
of a recent contribution.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.320
And you guys must have looked at the numbers

25:14.320 --> 25:17.520
and said, hey, I think I can make that work full time.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.080
Is that essentially what happened?

25:19.080 --> 25:21.960
Yeah, I mean, it's multiple things

25:21.960 --> 25:23.920
that came together kind of all at once.

25:23.920 --> 25:28.200
We've had great success with OS purchases from the website,

25:28.200 --> 25:31.120
app purchases from App Center, and other avenues

25:31.120 --> 25:32.900
like Patreon and Bounty Source.

25:32.900 --> 25:35.920
And then on top of that, we had a really generous person

25:35.920 --> 25:37.800
from the community, from the elementary community,

25:37.800 --> 25:40.040
who liked what we were doing and reached out and said,

25:40.040 --> 25:41.760
hey, I'd like to help you guys out.

25:41.760 --> 25:42.560
What can I do?

25:42.560 --> 25:45.360
And we worked with them and just figured out

25:45.360 --> 25:47.680
that bringing another person on full time

25:47.680 --> 25:50.440
was the right thing at the right time, and that's me.

25:50.440 --> 25:51.920
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.840
Congratulations.

25:52.840 --> 25:53.340
Huge.

25:53.340 --> 25:53.840
Thank you.

25:53.840 --> 25:54.800
Super exciting.

25:54.800 --> 25:58.040
And I think you guys, one of the reasons I love it

25:58.040 --> 26:00.200
is, first of all, both you and Daniel

26:00.200 --> 26:02.380
obviously super committed to the project here.

26:02.380 --> 26:04.840
And you have a good product.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.600
I have my son on it still, and it's just been a solid product.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.640
It's a good product.

26:08.640 --> 26:12.680
I think what you guys have needed is more execute power.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.680
Let me tell you, somebody who is in that same exact position,

26:15.680 --> 26:17.080
I think that's what you've needed.

26:17.080 --> 26:19.360
And bringing you on gives the project more power

26:19.360 --> 26:20.760
to execute on certain things.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.040
So it sounds like some of those things,

26:22.040 --> 26:24.040
because you call them out in your blog,

26:24.040 --> 26:28.560
is spending time with app developers and other parties

26:28.560 --> 26:31.200
to keep elementary OS financially sustainable.

26:31.200 --> 26:35.680
So that sort of came across to me as a bit vague.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.240
Essentially, what I read from that

26:37.240 --> 26:40.760
is you're going to do a little developer advocacy,

26:40.760 --> 26:42.900
try to maybe reach out to a few developers

26:42.900 --> 26:45.960
and convince them to bring their application over to elementary.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.440
Am I interpreting that right?

26:47.440 --> 26:48.000
Yeah.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.420
So there's really three areas of focus

26:50.420 --> 26:52.760
I've had over the past few years and looking

26:52.760 --> 26:55.560
to continue focusing on those areas.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.720
It's the writing and communicating with people.

26:57.720 --> 27:02.040
We do monthly App Center spotlights on our medium,

27:02.040 --> 27:04.200
monthly progress reports of development.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.320
We do developer tips, articles, things like that.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.960
So writing, I love to write.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.980
And Dan and I both tag team on the Medium site quite a bit.

27:13.980 --> 27:17.760
So that's one way of outreaching to developers.

27:17.760 --> 27:21.120
But then there's also the more direct interaction

27:21.120 --> 27:21.800
with developers.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.200
That's helping people bring their apps to App Center,

27:24.200 --> 27:26.320
focusing on the developer experience of App Center

27:26.320 --> 27:28.480
dashboard itself.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.940
Those areas are really interesting,

27:29.940 --> 27:32.240
and I haven't had as much time to focus on them.

27:32.240 --> 27:33.740
And so it's great to be full time now

27:33.740 --> 27:35.120
being able to focus on that.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.560
And then the third thing, which is

27:36.560 --> 27:38.120
I've always been doing with elementary,

27:38.120 --> 27:40.720
is design guidance and input, obviously.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.800
Work on the human interface guidelines, sketches.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.500
Something I've started doing more recently

27:45.500 --> 27:49.880
is organization-wide projects to improve the overall experience.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.440
So it's kind of a scattershot, and it's kind of all over.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.720
But that's kind of what's exciting about it,

27:53.720 --> 27:55.280
is that I'm pretty deeply involved

27:55.280 --> 27:56.800
in different parts of elementary.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.040
And now being able to focus full time on that, I think,

27:59.040 --> 28:02.360
means a lot more meaningful results from that.

28:02.360 --> 28:05.160
Yeah, and you may find you start digging in on something,

28:05.160 --> 28:06.240
and you get a lot of traction there.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.160
And that's something you'll have flexibility

28:08.160 --> 28:09.600
to dedicate time to now.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.680
Whereas before, it would have been like, well,

28:10.680 --> 28:13.000
how the hell am I ever going to be able to pull that off?

28:13.000 --> 28:13.720
Exactly.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.620
There's one in there that we haven't really talked about.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.320
And I bet you're not going to tell me much,

28:18.320 --> 28:21.200
but I just got to ask, dedicate time

28:21.200 --> 28:24.040
to working with OEMs with an S.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.040
What was that about?

28:26.040 --> 28:29.800
So this is something I've been doing on the side.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.120
There's several OEMs out there who ship elementary OS

28:33.120 --> 28:34.800
as an option.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.560
I think, what is it?

28:38.560 --> 28:40.600
Tuxedo computers.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.440
There's one called Obsidian.

28:42.440 --> 28:46.200
There's Slimbook that you can order elementary OS on.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.960
And I've been talking with them, obviously,

28:47.960 --> 28:50.360
because we're really interested in getting their feedback

28:50.360 --> 28:50.920
as an OEM.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.320
That's a really unique perspective

28:52.320 --> 28:54.360
where you're directly interacting with customers,

28:54.360 --> 28:58.760
paying customers of hardware who are paying $1,000 or however

28:58.760 --> 29:00.200
much for a computer.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.680
So I haven't had the time personally

29:02.680 --> 29:05.440
to dedicate to that in the past, but being

29:05.440 --> 29:08.200
able to actually interact with them and talk to them about it

29:08.200 --> 29:11.040
would be a great thing, I think, for everybody,

29:11.040 --> 29:13.520
for people who want to purchase a computer with elementary

29:13.520 --> 29:14.240
preloaded.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.000
Right.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.200
I hope to see that expand.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.440
That'd be really cool.

29:17.440 --> 29:17.920
All right.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.560
So let's get Dan in here for a second.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.640
So Dan, I mean, obviously, you and Cassidy are friends,

29:22.640 --> 29:25.720
but there must have been other people you could hire.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.840
So what made you think Cassidy was the right one

29:27.840 --> 29:29.640
with some limited resources?

29:29.640 --> 29:30.280
You got time.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.520
You got some flexibility now.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.980
All of a sudden, this guy comes in.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.120
He says, hey, if I can help out somehow.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.600
Was it specifically, but you have to hire Cassidy?

29:37.600 --> 29:40.000
Or was it your thought, no, you know what?

29:40.000 --> 29:40.960
This is the way to go.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.000
This is the right call.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.960
So we've had a lot of internal discussions

29:44.960 --> 29:50.260
about what kind of skill set should our next hire have.

29:50.260 --> 29:53.640
And there's been a lot of talk about, well,

29:53.640 --> 29:54.720
they need to be a developer.

29:54.720 --> 29:57.960
Or, well, maybe we need somebody who is good at marketing.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.760
Or, well, maybe we need another designer,

29:59.760 --> 30:02.280
because our design team has so many things that we just

30:02.280 --> 30:03.440
don't have time to get to.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.400
And our developers are making it up,

30:05.400 --> 30:07.440
and we're stacking technical debt, right?

30:07.440 --> 30:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.040
And so there's all these conversations about,

30:10.040 --> 30:12.880
who should our next hire be, and what should they be good at?

30:12.880 --> 30:15.600
And kind of the beautiful thing about hiring Cass

30:15.600 --> 30:19.080
is he'll never admit it, but he's great at everything.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.160
Cass is an amazing UX designer.

30:22.160 --> 30:26.320
Cass actually is a developer, and he has published a couple

30:26.320 --> 30:27.960
apps in App Center.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.800
You see all of his blog posts on our blog.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.560
He helps me manage all of our social media accounts.

30:34.560 --> 30:37.720
He's really good at putting people together.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.920
He has all this great insider knowledge

30:39.920 --> 30:42.560
of how a hardware company works.

30:42.560 --> 30:48.600
He's kind of this amalgam of knowledge of everything.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.240
It's a really, really great opportunity

30:51.240 --> 30:52.880
to be able to hire him on, to be honest.

30:52.880 --> 30:53.720
Yeah, I think so.

30:53.720 --> 30:57.280
And the man grows a good beard, too, which never hurts.

30:57.280 --> 30:58.000
That doesn't hurt.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.320
Plus 10 hireability right there.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.920
So Cassie, are you going to stay in the Colorado area,

31:05.920 --> 31:07.400
or what are your plans long term?

31:07.400 --> 31:09.720
Are you going to move out to the coast,

31:09.720 --> 31:10.920
or are you going to stay put?

31:10.920 --> 31:13.840
Well, I'm pretty rooted here in Denver, Colorado.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.520
I love it here.

31:15.520 --> 31:18.800
My family vacationed here growing up almost every year,

31:18.800 --> 31:20.360
so I really love it here.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.260
So I'm planning on staying here.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.680
My wife has a job out here as well,

31:23.680 --> 31:26.880
so we're pretty rooted here.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.840
I know Dan has been lightweight looking at apartments

31:29.840 --> 31:31.440
and things in the Denver area, so that

31:31.440 --> 31:33.560
might be an interesting move at some point.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.320
We'll have to see.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.840
Yeah, that's not a bad idea, Dan.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.920
Although right now, you're kind of on my route

31:37.920 --> 31:40.080
for certain places I go, so we get

31:40.080 --> 31:41.920
to hang out from time to time.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.320
I'd be a little disappointed, but I could make a trip

31:44.320 --> 31:45.240
to Denver, I suppose.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.880
Then I get to hang out with both of you guys, so.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.800
And then you'd be there with System76, too.

31:48.800 --> 31:49.280
Yeah.

31:49.280 --> 31:49.760
Exactly.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.480
Now it's a party.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.480
Now that would definitely be a party.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.640
I'll bring the fish.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.280
It'll be a good time.

31:55.280 --> 31:55.880
All right, guys.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.280
Well, congrats to both of you.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.160
I think it's going to be really good for the project.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.920
Looking forward to the new release, too.

32:00.920 --> 32:01.920
I mean, think about it.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.660
The future releases with both of you

32:03.660 --> 32:05.160
there working on that kind of stuff.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.120
And I hope you find a path to sustainability,

32:07.120 --> 32:08.780
so that way this position remains.

32:08.780 --> 32:10.200
It's something you can keep doing, Cassidy,

32:10.200 --> 32:11.480
because I think that'd be really great, too.

32:11.480 --> 32:14.920
Obviously, for not just you, but for the project as well.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.280
So everybody go, when the new release comes out,

32:17.280 --> 32:20.440
put a little dollar amount in there for Cassidy

32:20.440 --> 32:22.440
and for Daniel for the whole project, because.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.720
Keep this gravy train coming.

32:23.720 --> 32:28.580
Yeah, well, at least keep food on their plates, I suppose.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.620
Speaking of keeping foods on plates,

32:30.620 --> 32:34.160
why don't we do a little food keeping here for the program?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.240
do.co slash unplugged.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.160
You can go there and get a $100 credit for the Digital Ocean

32:39.160 --> 32:40.800
platform.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.680
Infrastructure on demand in less than 55 seconds.

32:43.680 --> 32:47.120
You can build and deploy a lot in 60 days with a $100 credit.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.520
So go to do.co slash unplugged.

32:50.520 --> 32:53.160
I'm trying to come up with a new way to describe Digital Ocean.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.240
Do you have anything that comes to mind?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.720
Because I can say it's like super crazy fast,

32:57.720 --> 33:00.560
all SSD-based infrastructure that you can spin up on demand.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.800
That is accurate, yeah.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.480
But I feel like I need something new.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.520
Some spice?

33:04.520 --> 33:05.920
Yeah, something to change it up.

33:05.920 --> 33:06.760
You know what I mean?

33:06.760 --> 33:09.960
Like something that has a beat, something that's exciting,

33:09.960 --> 33:11.360
something that's fresher than me.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.200
Because I feel like we could use a little freshness.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.280
I don't know.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.440
I'll tell you what, I'll just mix a little something live.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.080
Oh, you've got a little secret sauce for us?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.480
Yeah, you just play backup, OK?

33:20.480 --> 33:21.200
You do my backups.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.600
Digital Ocean's cloud computing platform

33:27.600 --> 33:29.960

34:26.560 --> 34:27.600
Good job, dude.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.760
I know what I'm doing.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.320
So also, just to give you a mention,

34:30.320 --> 34:32.840
they have a new guide up they posted a couple days ago

34:32.840 --> 34:36.640
by using a CDN to speed up static content delivery.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.680
And when you look at the pricing of Digital Ocean

34:38.680 --> 34:41.080
and you look at the ways you could utilize Digital Ocean

34:41.080 --> 34:44.600
and the benefits of using a CDN, it's a no-brainer way

34:44.600 --> 34:46.720
to use Digital Ocean, especially if you go to dio.co

34:46.720 --> 34:49.320
slash unplugged to get that $100 credit.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.200
Did you say $100?

34:50.200 --> 34:51.080
$100 credit.

34:51.080 --> 34:51.720
What?

34:51.720 --> 34:52.920
I say $100 sometimes.

34:52.920 --> 34:53.640
I know.

34:53.640 --> 34:56.040
You know what else is fantastic is those great folks.

34:56.040 --> 34:58.040
So great I had to move my microphone arm in there.

34:58.040 --> 34:58.960
Did you catch that?

34:58.960 --> 35:01.040
I wanted to give you a little studio ambiance.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.580
It's Linux Academy.

35:02.580 --> 35:04.000
Those people over at Linux Academy,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.520
they are hardworking folk.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.920
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

35:08.920 --> 35:11.040
I just got a little sneak peek at something

35:11.040 --> 35:12.200
that's coming down the pipe.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.000
Oh, niggly piggly.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.360
It's so cool.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.960
I might reach out to them and try

35:15.960 --> 35:17.960
to set up an interview here in the near future

35:17.960 --> 35:19.960
to have them do a little overview of one

35:19.960 --> 35:21.360
of these things they're working on.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.200
I just so desperately want to say what it is,

35:23.200 --> 35:25.840
but I don't think I'm allowed to because it's in development.

35:25.840 --> 35:27.540
You know how they feel about that stuff.

35:27.540 --> 35:29.000
But they're always working on stuff.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.160
It's a platform to learn about Linux.

35:31.160 --> 35:34.800
Anything that Linux runs on or that you can run Linux with

35:34.800 --> 35:37.040
or on top of or inside of it, I mean, it's, yeah.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.200
That's a giant list.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.960
Turns out it's most of Microsoft's stuff these days.

35:40.960 --> 35:41.460
Woo.

35:41.460 --> 35:42.320
Cool.

35:42.320 --> 35:45.200
Yeah, and they've got courseware on that as well as AWS

35:45.200 --> 35:47.880
and OpenStack and, of course, the Linux Essentials

35:47.880 --> 35:50.000
and the Google Cloud Platform and Docker

35:50.000 --> 35:52.080
and trying to wrap your head around big data

35:52.080 --> 35:54.760
or just basic DevOps concepts, really.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.440
And now, really, some great courseware for reals, really.

35:58.440 --> 35:59.360
I like saying really.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.340
On security.

36:19.560 --> 36:22.800
They'll work with your busy day and days and days and days.

36:22.800 --> 36:23.680
I understand.

36:23.680 --> 36:24.880
But they'll work with you on that.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.480
That's like the hardest part, when you're like, OK,

36:26.480 --> 36:27.720
I want to learn something.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.800
Now I've got to go find the resources to learn.

36:29.800 --> 36:30.680
No, it's just right there.

36:30.680 --> 36:31.160
It pops up.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.000
You log in.

36:32.000 --> 36:32.880
You keep reading.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.360
There's also something that just makes it real,

36:34.360 --> 36:36.440
when you just see, this concept is going

36:36.440 --> 36:38.400
to take me two hours to master.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.240
And then I go, oh, OK, two hours.

36:40.240 --> 36:40.800
I can do that.

36:40.800 --> 36:41.680
Yeah, I can do that.

36:41.680 --> 36:42.840
And then you can get study tools.

36:42.840 --> 36:43.800
And you can get lesson audio.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.720
And they've got videos and interactive diagrams

36:45.720 --> 36:46.600
and all of that stuff.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.840
So it's a great platform.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.480
And it gets you ready for the big certs.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.720
It's got instructor mentoring, human beings that help you

36:51.720 --> 36:52.320
if you need help.

36:52.320 --> 36:53.600
Yeah, it's great.

36:53.600 --> 36:54.400
Human beings.

36:54.400 --> 36:55.200
You're real humans.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.280
I would never have thought.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.000
I know.

36:57.000 --> 36:57.880
Powered by Linux.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.960
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.800
Speaking of powered by Linux, Ting.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.840
Yeah, the Ting infrastructure runs on Linux.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.800
linux.ting.com.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.320
linux.ting.com.

37:07.320 --> 37:10.540
That's where you go to save $25 off a device

37:10.540 --> 37:12.040
if you want to buy one from Ting.

37:12.040 --> 37:13.280
And I'll tell you more about that here in a second,

37:13.280 --> 37:14.540
because they've got a good one.

37:14.540 --> 37:16.540
Or if you bring one, they've got CDMA and GSM.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.720
You get $25 in service credit.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.400
Pay for what you use wireless as Ting's secret sauce.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.800
It's a fair price for however much you talk, text, and data

37:23.800 --> 37:24.700
you use.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.740
And there's no contracts, no early termination fees,

37:27.740 --> 37:30.360
no quote unquote agreements.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.880
And you can manage the entire thing.

37:31.880 --> 37:34.360
Turn stuff on and off, individual services even,

37:34.360 --> 37:37.720
like text messages on or off, right from their control panel.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.480
It's super, super easy.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.800
You can set usage alerts.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.040
They have fantastic customer service.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.920
But I wanted to tell you about a great deal right now.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.680
If you just want to get a nice, clean, performant Android

37:48.680 --> 37:50.920
phone that's going to get updates for a little while,

37:50.920 --> 37:53.760
friends, I'd like you to consider the Motorola G6 Play.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.880
I've talked about the Moto series before.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.940
They're the ones where I legitimately

37:57.940 --> 37:59.240
don't mind the skin.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.120
It's so minimal.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.640
It's not getting in your way.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.920
You don't feel like spending $800 on a smartphone.

38:04.920 --> 38:05.600
Which I don't.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.800
But you'd like to have something that's no contract,

38:07.800 --> 38:09.480
that you're not paying for monthly.

38:09.480 --> 38:10.120
I do.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.360
Yeah, linux.ting.com.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.700
Then you go to their store page.

38:12.700 --> 38:16.040
You can get the Moto G6 Play for $174.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.180
You own it.

38:17.180 --> 38:19.360
And then you just pay for your usage.

38:19.360 --> 38:19.920
That's it.

38:19.920 --> 38:20.600
That's awesome.

38:20.600 --> 38:21.880
Yeah, no contract.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.900
It's multi-network too.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.240
So if GSM is better in your area or CDMA,

38:25.240 --> 38:26.640
you can utilize that.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.040
It's really, really nice.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.400
It's got a fingerprint scanner.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.320
It's got a bunch of nice features built in,

38:31.320 --> 38:34.400
like an SD card reader, 13 megapixel rear camera,

38:34.400 --> 38:36.920
4,000 milliamp battery.

38:36.920 --> 38:39.080
They say you can get 36 hours on a single charge

38:39.080 --> 38:40.440
with that sucker.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.080
And it's got a Snapdragon quad core processor in it.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.440
It's a great phone.

38:44.440 --> 38:49.240
And you can own the whole dang thing for $174.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.200
That's not bad.

38:50.200 --> 38:50.920
That is not bad.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.360
And you can go up to 128 gigs with microSD.

38:54.360 --> 38:55.000
Whoa.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.640
I think it comes with 32 gigs built in,

38:56.640 --> 38:57.960
but you can go up to 128.

38:57.960 --> 39:01.280
If you can get off that got to have the latest and greatest

39:01.280 --> 39:03.280
sort of ride, then this is a secret weapon

39:03.280 --> 39:04.240
to save in some money.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.800
It really is nice, 5.7 IPS screen.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.200
It's a higher, it's a 1440 by 720,

39:11.200 --> 39:13.480
which is not bad for a 5.7 when you're not trying

39:13.480 --> 39:14.960
to kill battery life all day.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.480
You know, if this podcasting thing doesn't work out,

39:16.480 --> 39:17.760
you could be just a phone salesman.

39:17.760 --> 39:18.720
I think you've got it.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.440
I really like these phones.

39:20.440 --> 39:23.280
When you find the right phone, it's like, I don't know.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.760
Something about it, it's like, this

39:24.760 --> 39:26.000
because everybody's always buying

39:26.000 --> 39:27.920
like the iPhone or the Samsungs or the Pixels.

39:27.920 --> 39:28.960
The easy choices.

39:28.960 --> 39:30.320
Yeah, and it's like, oh, cool.

39:30.320 --> 39:31.840
So you spend $1,000 on a phone.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.960
But if you didn't need X, Y, whatever that one thing is,

39:35.960 --> 39:38.280
you could get these motos, and they're just great phones.

39:38.280 --> 39:40.280
$174, linux.ting.com.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.520
All right, I've said my piece.

39:41.520 --> 39:44.120
I just think that's a great phone and a great service.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.040
I get excited, Wes.

39:45.040 --> 39:45.840
I can't help it.

39:45.840 --> 39:47.840
I love gadgets.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.200
Not as much as I love Linux and free software.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.920
So I don't mix those two together.

39:51.920 --> 39:55.600
I have not bought an Android device since the Nexus 6P.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.080
It's been a while.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.560
It may change.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.960
After a while, the OnePlus is starting

39:59.960 --> 40:00.640
to look better and better.

40:00.640 --> 40:01.400
It is.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.960
But I got to save my pennies right now

40:02.960 --> 40:08.640
because I think this week's news has sealed the deal for me

40:08.640 --> 40:10.440
on buying a ThinkPad.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.680
As you guys know, I've been on the fence for weeks.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.200
We had Barton on last week.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.960
And we were talking about the XPSs,

40:15.960 --> 40:19.400
plus my XPS has been one of the best computers I've ever owned.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.520
It's still my daily driver for so many things.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.920
I prepped today's show on my XPS 13.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.240
I took it down to Texas.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.640
Just a solid system.

40:27.640 --> 40:30.240
And one of the things I love about my XPS 13

40:30.240 --> 40:33.160
is I get firmware updates through Nome Software.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.800
And Plasma Project has announced that they're

40:35.800 --> 40:37.960
bringing that same functionality to Discover.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.160
So you'll be able to get beautiful firmware updates

40:40.160 --> 40:41.480
on the Plasma desktop.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.600
And I know it's silly.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.080
But that's something that really matters to me.

40:45.080 --> 40:49.200
It makes it feel like a complete consumer product in a way

40:49.200 --> 40:52.480
that just hasn't really been there on Linux before.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.480
I just love LVFS.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.160
And I love that my XPS 13 got firmware updates that way.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.160
You mean saying that I don't have to boot into DOS

40:59.160 --> 41:01.840
to update my firmware anymore is somehow good for Linux?

41:01.840 --> 41:02.480
I don't get it.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.520
Or the modern version of that really

41:04.520 --> 41:07.080
is you have to keep your Windows partition around.

41:07.080 --> 41:07.960
That sucks.

41:07.960 --> 41:11.560
And so it is such a censure for me

41:11.560 --> 41:16.080
now that Lenovo has joined the LVFS project.

41:16.080 --> 41:19.080
And the laptop I've been looking at, the T480,

41:19.080 --> 41:22.320
is on the supported list of hardware.

41:22.320 --> 41:24.440
And I got a couple of notes, emails,

41:24.440 --> 41:26.520
with screenshots from listeners.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.560
They're like, hey, I just got this on my ThinkPad

41:28.560 --> 41:30.320
two days before this went public.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.360
Oh, it just shows up.

41:31.360 --> 41:34.480
Yeah, I guess the timing went that the images started

41:34.480 --> 41:38.080
showing up in the stable repos while Richard was on vacation

41:38.080 --> 41:40.680
so he couldn't get back to write the blog post on time.

41:40.680 --> 41:44.480
But he writes, bringing Lenovo to LVFS has been a lot of work.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.920
It needed changes to the low-level FW update

41:46.920 --> 41:51.960
library, which is fwupd, and even LVFS admin portal itself

41:51.960 --> 41:53.800
for various vendor-defined reasons.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.720
I love that term.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.180
In other words, they had particulars

41:57.180 --> 41:58.920
they wanted taken care of.

41:58.920 --> 42:02.520
He says, we've been working in semi-secret for a long time,

42:02.520 --> 42:04.640
and I'm sure it's been frustrating to all involved

42:04.640 --> 42:07.600
not being able to speak openly about the grand plan.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.480
But I do think Lenovo should be applauded for their work done

42:10.480 --> 42:13.120
so far due to the enormity of the task

42:13.120 --> 42:16.760
rather than chastise about being to the party

42:16.760 --> 42:17.840
a little late.

42:17.840 --> 42:22.400
Then he writes, if anyone from HP is reading this,

42:22.400 --> 42:25.720
you're now officially late.

42:25.720 --> 42:32.120
This is, to me, this is the censure for that T480.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.720
But there's only one person here who

42:33.720 --> 42:35.760
I believe has authority to speak on this topic,

42:35.760 --> 42:38.360
and that would be Popey, because he owns 35.

42:38.360 --> 42:39.880
Hello, Popey.

42:39.880 --> 42:42.700
Did you have any hint this was coming?

42:42.700 --> 42:46.280
And when you saw the news, how excited were you?

42:46.280 --> 42:47.440
I was very excited.

42:47.440 --> 42:52.400
It's always good to see more hardware appearing in the LVFS.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.600
Do you think this is indicative of other things that

42:54.600 --> 42:58.520
may be in the works at Lenovo?

42:58.520 --> 43:00.280
I don't know.

43:00.280 --> 43:03.000
I know it's something that Richard has

43:03.000 --> 43:04.400
been working on for a long time.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.960
We had him in the office recently

43:05.960 --> 43:10.720
when we had a GNOME software design sprint.

43:10.720 --> 43:13.120
He came in for a day, and we chatted over some stuff,

43:13.120 --> 43:17.680
and he was telling us a little bit about the amount of work

43:17.680 --> 43:21.000
that goes on to get companies on board with LVFS.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.200
And it's certainly a labor of love for him.

43:23.200 --> 43:26.080
So it's really good to see he's succeeded with Lenovo.

43:26.080 --> 43:27.240
Boy, do we appreciate it.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.000
Amazing.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.320
It just makes a difference for so many users in such a big way.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.960
It's such an appreciated.

43:34.960 --> 43:39.040
Not having to boot into Windows or create some shonky boot disk

43:39.040 --> 43:41.560
and get your firmware that way.

43:41.560 --> 43:43.360
Just pressing a button, reboot.

43:43.360 --> 43:47.080
And it's cross-distro, which is also

43:47.080 --> 43:48.800
so great for somebody like me who

43:48.800 --> 43:50.880
seems to not be able to last more than a year on a distro

43:50.880 --> 43:52.400
anymore, which is actually a lot better than it used to be.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.320
Just accept it now.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.080
There's nothing wrong with it.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.560
I am really elated by this news.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.400
What do you think of my choice poppy on the T480?

43:58.400 --> 44:00.280
You think that's a solid choice for a travel laptop?

44:00.280 --> 44:02.280
It's an excellent choice, of course.

44:02.280 --> 44:03.480
Hey, that's all I need.

44:03.480 --> 44:04.360
Validation.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.160
Yeah.

44:05.160 --> 44:06.200
OK.

44:06.200 --> 44:07.160
I feel good.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.640
With the poppy-approved little stamp out.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.960
That's like when I discovered that Jeremy Clarkson bought

44:10.960 --> 44:11.800
a VW Golf.

44:11.800 --> 44:15.360
I'm like, oh, that kind of validates my new interest.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.560
That's how I feel poppy is with the ThinkPads.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.640
He's like my Jeremy Clarkson for ThinkPads.

44:19.640 --> 44:20.440
He has earned it.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.440
Oh, my god.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.520
Please, no.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.240
I thought you'd like that.

44:25.240 --> 44:27.440
All right, well, moving on, just a few other things.

44:27.440 --> 44:30.400
Eric, the IT guy, is in the Mumble Room today.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.640
And you may recall that name because not only does he

44:32.640 --> 44:35.400
chime in from time to time, but he chatted with me

44:35.400 --> 44:39.120
a few weeks back about Jupiter Broadcasting's efforts

44:39.120 --> 44:42.160
around setting up PeerTube.

44:42.160 --> 44:45.680
And he is back with many encoding jobs

44:45.680 --> 44:48.280
later to give us kind of an update on where things are at

44:48.280 --> 44:50.160
and some other things that are in the works.

44:50.160 --> 44:53.400
So Eric, thanks once again for all your work on the PeerTube

44:53.400 --> 44:54.200
stuff.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.160
And where do you think we should start with the update?

44:56.160 --> 44:58.320
Yeah, I try and chime in whenever my son's not

44:58.320 --> 45:01.480
playing with my mixer.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.360
Yeah, that is always fun when he reaches for the EQ.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.680
So just you know what I do is I just swat at them.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.440
I find that where he just swatted them.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.960
They seem to learn.

45:11.960 --> 45:14.440
Wes is looking at me like, I think you're joking.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.920
But he's like, no one, Chris.

45:15.920 --> 45:16.440
I'm not sure.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.280
Well, it helps that Dylan's a natural broadcaster.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.360
So you don't need to worry about him.

45:19.360 --> 45:19.960
He's quick.

45:19.960 --> 45:20.560
He dodges.

45:20.560 --> 45:21.720
That's what, that's what.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.000
Yeah, yeah, all right.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.040
So what do you think, Eric?

45:24.040 --> 45:26.080
Where do we start with the PeerTube?

45:26.080 --> 45:28.040
Is there any significant new developments?

45:28.040 --> 45:29.920
I know there's been some back end changes.

45:29.920 --> 45:32.800
We've had a whole bunch of encoding jobs going.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.640
Kind of the 30,000 foot view, we've

45:35.640 --> 45:37.880
rebuilt PeerTube about three times

45:37.880 --> 45:40.840
on three different setups and operating systems.

45:40.840 --> 45:44.160
And we've settled on Ubuntu.

45:44.160 --> 45:48.480
And we've got a nice big VM, thanks to some

45:48.480 --> 45:50.080
of the guys in the community.

45:50.080 --> 45:54.800
They've donated a huge VM with, I think, 16 cores.

45:54.800 --> 45:57.240
If you're on the Macedon server, you've

45:57.240 --> 45:59.560
seen that about every couple of hours,

45:59.560 --> 46:01.240
a new video is being posted as I'm

46:01.240 --> 46:04.880
going through 10 plus years of Jupyter broadcasting

46:04.880 --> 46:07.520
backlog, where in the next few days,

46:07.520 --> 46:10.920
transcoding jobs should finish for BSD now.

46:10.920 --> 46:15.120
I don't know if anybody watches that, but it's there.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.400
Nice.

46:16.400 --> 46:16.960
I kid.

46:16.960 --> 46:17.440
I kid.

46:17.440 --> 46:18.080
I love you guys.

46:18.080 --> 46:19.240
That was solid, dude.

46:19.240 --> 46:20.400
Well done.

46:20.400 --> 46:23.240
Nicely delivered.

46:23.240 --> 46:27.400
So we're, I think, I think, ask Noah's up there.

46:27.400 --> 46:30.040
BSD now is almost done.

46:30.040 --> 46:31.480
Several of the other shows are done,

46:31.480 --> 46:33.920
and then the rest are on their way.

46:33.920 --> 46:37.320
So once the active shows have all

46:37.320 --> 46:40.160
had their backlogs ported over, then I

46:40.160 --> 46:42.600
want to try and start on some of the shows that

46:42.600 --> 46:43.560
aren't active anymore.

46:43.560 --> 46:46.400
So we've got the entire catalog there at some point.

46:46.400 --> 46:49.240
Yeah, and this started as, hey, YouTube

46:49.240 --> 46:50.760
is pulling down our stuff sometimes,

46:50.760 --> 46:53.920
or man, wouldn't it be great to just help lend

46:53.920 --> 46:56.880
some attention towards a project that is helping replace YouTube?

46:56.880 --> 46:58.720
Because we've talked about the issues of that,

46:58.720 --> 47:01.400
especially for free software coverage.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.320
And so that's really, I think, where Eric and I started

47:04.320 --> 47:04.840
with this.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.440
But then we started going, wouldn't it

47:06.440 --> 47:08.640
be really great if you could go to one place

47:08.640 --> 47:11.360
and have the entire archive available, at least as far

47:11.360 --> 47:13.720
as we have it in video?

47:13.720 --> 47:18.560
And so that, I mean, I can't imagine the amount of CPU heat

47:18.560 --> 47:19.960
that work must be creating, Eric.

47:19.960 --> 47:21.640
So how long does that take?

47:21.640 --> 47:22.720
Is that a manual process?

47:22.720 --> 47:25.680
Are you SCPing MP4 files around, or how are you

47:25.680 --> 47:26.560
doing that part?

47:26.560 --> 47:30.040
So what's fun is it's a two-step process right now.

47:30.040 --> 47:35.400
So for the backlog, PeerTube is using YouTube DL.

47:35.400 --> 47:42.200
And it's got a scripted job that I run and just point to.

47:42.200 --> 47:45.120
There's the Jupyter feed web page

47:45.120 --> 47:48.040
that I just point the YouTube DL script towards.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.440
And so it'll pull in the backlog.

47:49.440 --> 47:53.800
But then manually, once I catch the tweet

47:53.800 --> 47:55.680
that a new show has been published,

47:55.680 --> 47:58.960
I go up, pull down the current.

47:58.960 --> 48:01.200
So when this episode gets published,

48:01.200 --> 48:04.480
I'll go down and pull that down with WGIT

48:04.480 --> 48:07.080
and then SCP it up to the server and manually,

48:07.080 --> 48:11.200
or actually manually, add it in through the web UI.

48:11.200 --> 48:17.360
And there's been some people notice that when I do that,

48:17.360 --> 48:20.080
there's a disclaimer that the video hasn't

48:20.080 --> 48:22.640
been transcoded yet, so quality is not so great.

48:22.640 --> 48:26.200
We've actually, as a community, been submitting pull requests

48:26.200 --> 48:27.340
for new features.

48:27.340 --> 48:30.040
And one of the new features that we have requested

48:30.040 --> 48:34.800
is the ability to basically set importance.

48:34.800 --> 48:39.600
So I want the server to be busy all the time.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.200
So if you don't have anything that's

48:41.200 --> 48:44.040
been published in the last week, chew on the backlog.

48:44.040 --> 48:46.420
But as soon as one of the new shows gets published,

48:46.420 --> 48:48.760
I want you to drop everything else you're working on

48:48.760 --> 48:50.480
and go and transcode this.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.040
That's a great idea.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.440
I need to double check on it.

48:53.440 --> 48:57.480
But they just sent out an email, PeerTube did,

48:57.480 --> 49:03.920
earlier this afternoon, stating that version 1.0 beta 3 was

49:03.920 --> 49:04.600
just released.

49:04.600 --> 49:07.320
So we should be expecting a full version here

49:07.320 --> 49:11.600
within the next couple of weeks with a lot of really nice

49:11.600 --> 49:13.000
features and bug fixes.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.600
And they're changing up some of the things on the back end.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.160
I mean, this project has exploded.

49:18.160 --> 49:20.520
I don't think they had a clue just how popular this

49:20.520 --> 49:21.760
was going to be.

49:21.760 --> 49:22.400
Well, yeah.

49:22.400 --> 49:24.920
I was just looking at their active instance site, which

49:24.920 --> 49:26.300
I'll have linked in the show notes.

49:26.300 --> 49:28.000
You can see the other PeerTube instances out there.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.880
And there's a whole bunch of them taken off.

49:29.880 --> 49:31.120
A lot of 1.0 versions.

49:31.120 --> 49:33.880
So it's good to see that they're still chugging away.

49:33.880 --> 49:36.160
Because I know that they've been super busy with their fundraiser

49:36.160 --> 49:36.840
stuff.

49:36.840 --> 49:38.240
Well, so what's the site people go

49:38.240 --> 49:40.640
to to kind of see some of the hard work you've been doing?

49:40.640 --> 49:41.620
What's the URL?

49:41.620 --> 49:45.600
So the official URL is getjupiter.com.

49:45.600 --> 49:51.240
And that's a restricted instance.

49:51.240 --> 49:53.720
That is official Jupyter broadcasting content only.

49:53.720 --> 49:58.560
But if you jump over to peertube.linuxrocks.online,

49:58.560 --> 50:01.660
it's tied into the Linux Rocks Macedon instance.

50:01.660 --> 50:04.280
And that is where community members

50:04.280 --> 50:06.200
can submit videos, things they've seen,

50:06.200 --> 50:07.520
things they've produced.

50:07.520 --> 50:10.160
I know there's a couple of us, like myself, who haven't done,

50:10.160 --> 50:13.560
who are getting our feet wet with podcasts that have uploaded

50:13.560 --> 50:16.720
a few videos just so we've got somewhere to publish it and say,

50:16.720 --> 50:19.040
hey, go check out this video and tell me what you think.

50:19.040 --> 50:21.520
And did we end up implementing the chapters, or not

50:21.520 --> 50:22.720
the chapters, but the channel?

50:22.720 --> 50:25.180
So if you want to just see all of Linux unplugged,

50:25.180 --> 50:26.520
you can just go to that channel.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.080
How does that work?

50:27.080 --> 50:28.800
Because if you go there right now, it's all BSD now

50:28.800 --> 50:29.160
all the time.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.720
And like you said, nobody watches that.

50:30.720 --> 50:33.720
So is there a facility for that on PeerTube?

50:33.720 --> 50:35.920
They're still fleshing out some of the functionality

50:35.920 --> 50:36.960
around channels.

50:36.960 --> 50:42.400
But if you go to getjupiter.com and you register for an account,

50:42.400 --> 50:43.440
I know, another account.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.200
I'm sorry, but that's how it works.

50:46.200 --> 50:49.120
If you register a new account, you can actually

50:49.120 --> 50:50.600
subscribe to individual channels.

50:50.600 --> 50:52.200
So if you want to get that Noah guy,

50:52.200 --> 50:55.160
you can just go and subscribe to Ask Noah and get those.

50:55.160 --> 50:57.200
That's the only thing people listen to around here.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.080
So OK.

50:58.080 --> 50:59.600
Well, Eric, thank you very much.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.240
We should probably keep moving because we

51:01.240 --> 51:03.160
want to also talk about Android P and get to some pics.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.040
But I really do appreciate that work.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.680
So getjupiter.com is where people will see it.

51:07.680 --> 51:10.640
And I think it's good timing because I

51:10.640 --> 51:14.040
think it's going to play into our overall plan

51:14.040 --> 51:16.840
to get our back catalog in shape one day.

51:16.840 --> 51:21.920
Well, and one last quick note, that effort for PeerTube

51:21.920 --> 51:24.000
has actually led to another project

51:24.000 --> 51:26.680
that we've been working on, a couple of us,

51:26.680 --> 51:29.880
where Jupyter Broadcasting now has an official GitLab

51:29.880 --> 51:31.520
instance that we're managing.

51:31.520 --> 51:35.760
So at some point, we're going to move all the PeerTube scripts,

51:35.760 --> 51:39.480
perhaps a code for JBots, the caster soundboard,

51:39.480 --> 51:42.560
things like that, we're going to be hosting on Jupyter

51:42.560 --> 51:45.440
Broadcasting hosted instances.

51:45.440 --> 51:47.200
With a cool URL.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.000
It's the great GitHub Exodus.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.280
We're just a little late to the party.

51:51.280 --> 51:52.480
We're a little late to the Exodus party.

51:52.480 --> 51:53.480
But yeah, we're setting it all up.

51:53.480 --> 51:54.600
We'll have our own official site.

51:54.600 --> 51:57.320
So if you hear us talking about, which I have a suspicion,

51:57.320 --> 51:59.000
there will be more projects added to that list

51:59.000 --> 51:59.960
in the near future.

51:59.960 --> 52:01.360
Well, maybe not in the near future,

52:01.360 --> 52:02.520
but in the distant future.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.280
It'll just be one resource you go to.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.160
So if it's the soundboard, if it's the, yeah.

52:06.160 --> 52:06.840
It's so easy.

52:06.840 --> 52:08.360
Yeah, the bot and all that kind of stuff.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.240
Yeah, so that's all stuff Eric's been helping us with,

52:10.240 --> 52:11.400
set up the back end stuff.

52:11.400 --> 52:12.960
And it's kind of bringing together

52:12.960 --> 52:14.720
several initiatives, which is great.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.440
So all right.

52:16.440 --> 52:17.960
Well, check out more of that, and I'll

52:17.960 --> 52:21.440
have links to what Eric was talking about in the show notes.

52:21.440 --> 52:24.240
Keep up the good work, Eric, and everybody else helping Eric.

52:24.240 --> 52:28.040
And let's talk about Android P for a moment.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.280
It was released this week.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.200
And I don't have a lot to really cover on it,

52:31.200 --> 52:34.000
other than I noticed a few things that stand out,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.880
other than your typical new features,

52:35.880 --> 52:38.080
like adaptive battery and adaptive brightness.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.000
So adaptive.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.240
There's a lot of, there's a big vibe

52:42.240 --> 52:44.000
of monitoring you in this thing.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.960
So like app actions, which will predict

52:45.960 --> 52:48.880
what you want to do next based on your other activity.

52:48.880 --> 52:53.080
Or application slices, which try to figure out

52:53.080 --> 52:56.040
what you're searching for and show you content from an app.

52:56.040 --> 52:59.960
And there's also this new dashboard

52:59.960 --> 53:02.800
that helps you understand how you're spending

53:02.800 --> 53:04.600
your time on your device.

53:04.600 --> 53:08.000
And the app timer that lets you set limits on apps

53:08.000 --> 53:09.720
and graze out the icon on your home screen

53:09.720 --> 53:12.280
when you've used it too much.

53:12.280 --> 53:13.600
Too much Twitter for you, Wes.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.240
I know.

53:14.240 --> 53:14.760
Oh, god.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.120
I'm so embarrassed.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.760
And then there's other nice features,

53:17.760 --> 53:20.080
like do not disturb, which silences visual interruptions.

53:20.080 --> 53:21.560
And then there's the wind down mode,

53:21.560 --> 53:24.360
which turns on a nightlight, and then turns on do not disturb,

53:24.360 --> 53:25.920
and then fades the screen to grayscale.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.040
I'm willing to try that out.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.160
We'll see.

53:28.160 --> 53:32.400
But the digital well-being stuff is a little scary to me.

53:32.400 --> 53:34.720
And I don't know if it's just me being RMS,

53:34.720 --> 53:39.520
or if this isn't just the mecca of metrics for Google

53:39.520 --> 53:40.880
to collect here.

53:40.880 --> 53:42.880
Imagine now all of the things they

53:42.880 --> 53:44.880
can add to the profile that's already enormous

53:44.880 --> 53:47.800
that they have about you, all of these things about how you

53:47.800 --> 53:50.360
because in order to monitor all of this stuff,

53:50.360 --> 53:53.080
they've had to build in hooks to watch.

53:53.080 --> 53:55.560
And then they have to be collecting this information

53:55.560 --> 53:58.680
and storing it and storing it in a dashboard.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.900
It seems like it would just be almost negligent for them

54:01.900 --> 54:04.540
not to also eventually have a copy of that information,

54:04.540 --> 54:06.440
even if in this first release they don't.

54:06.440 --> 54:07.640
I mean, right, yeah.

54:07.640 --> 54:08.680
You just want more data.

54:08.680 --> 54:10.120
That's kind of the rule.

54:10.120 --> 54:12.700
And it's all being sold to us under the premise

54:12.700 --> 54:14.360
of digital well-being.

54:14.360 --> 54:15.480
Well, I mean, you can't.

54:15.480 --> 54:17.400
How are you going to do all your machine learning

54:17.400 --> 54:18.940
if you don't have all the data, Chris?

54:18.940 --> 54:19.960
Yeah, that's true.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.520
You've got to have all the data.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.760
Bobi, have you flashed all of your Android devices

54:23.760 --> 54:24.520
with Android P?

54:24.520 --> 54:26.600
Are you running it on everything now and got the frame?

54:26.600 --> 54:27.520
No.

54:27.520 --> 54:31.480
No, because as is always the case,

54:31.480 --> 54:35.160
I am bottom of the pile because I've got a OnePlus 3T.

54:35.160 --> 54:39.160
So I seriously doubt that will get in Android P anytime soon.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.920
Yeah, I joke, though, but it is kind of a serious thing.

54:41.920 --> 54:44.320
It's like, now we wait.

54:44.320 --> 54:46.360
Now we wait for the code dump.

54:46.360 --> 54:49.440
And then we wait for all the other lag of the projects

54:49.440 --> 54:53.640
that are based off that code dump to actually catch up.

54:53.640 --> 54:55.040
It is not quite.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.840
I mean, it is far better than the alternative in many ways.

54:57.840 --> 55:01.840
But it is not quite the glorious free open source ecosystem

55:01.840 --> 55:04.480
that perhaps we once naively thought long ago.

55:04.480 --> 55:07.600
So Cassidy, you've been giving it a go, though, quite seriously.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.880
I'd be curious to know about your first impressions,

55:09.880 --> 55:11.340
including maybe some of the new nav stuff

55:11.340 --> 55:12.800
if you had a chance to give it a go.

55:12.800 --> 55:13.300
Yep.

55:13.300 --> 55:15.240
I got the update over the air yesterday.

55:15.240 --> 55:18.120
And I've actually really been enjoying it.

55:18.120 --> 55:21.400
The new navigation is optional and off by default

55:21.400 --> 55:22.620
on existing hardware.

55:22.620 --> 55:25.040
But I guess it's going to be the default on new hardware

55:25.040 --> 55:27.160
from Google, at least, in the future.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.040
But I turned it on.

55:28.040 --> 55:28.920
I really enjoy it.

55:28.920 --> 55:32.280
I actually really enjoy the digital well-being stuff.

55:32.280 --> 55:33.280
Oh, yeah.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.960
I think I have a different perspective on this maybe

55:35.960 --> 55:38.320
because we do something similar.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.800
And we've done it for a long time,

55:39.800 --> 55:43.240
just really not as well fleshed out, I guess,

55:43.240 --> 55:44.320
in elementary OS.

55:44.320 --> 55:49.160
And that's the tool called Zeitgeist,

55:49.160 --> 55:51.260
which is something that, on your device,

55:51.260 --> 55:54.900
it tracks what you open, what files you access,

55:54.900 --> 55:56.280
what applications you use.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.480
It keeps all of that information on the device.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.840
But then that can power some really interesting things

56:00.840 --> 56:02.640
in the OS.

56:02.640 --> 56:04.960
And we've been talking, actually, how we could expand

56:04.960 --> 56:08.840
our privacy settings to be more like this digital well-being

56:08.840 --> 56:13.140
where the user's in control of what apps they themselves can

56:13.140 --> 56:13.760
open when.

56:13.760 --> 56:16.600
And we have something called parental controls right now.

56:16.600 --> 56:18.600
And we've been talking about maybe rebranding

56:18.600 --> 56:20.360
that as something like digital well-being

56:20.360 --> 56:23.760
because I think it's a really interesting topic of setting

56:23.760 --> 56:30.560
restrictions for yourself for how you use your device.

56:30.560 --> 56:32.960
Devices these days are made to be so addicting

56:32.960 --> 56:35.600
that I think it can be important to impose limits on yourself

56:35.600 --> 56:39.000
as long as it's you doing it and it stays on the device locally.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.760
Yeah, I really have no problem with people setting

56:40.760 --> 56:42.400
their own limits on themselves if they

56:42.400 --> 56:44.040
have control over those limits.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.600
It seems like it kind of speaks a little bit about trust.

56:46.600 --> 56:48.800
The idea, as you describe it, coming from you,

56:48.800 --> 56:49.960
it sounds very interesting.

56:49.960 --> 56:51.880
But I think maybe some of this is just you.

56:51.880 --> 56:52.480
It's a concern.

56:52.480 --> 56:54.280
I don't know if it's actually even an issue.

56:54.280 --> 56:56.920
It, to me, is just when I hear it,

56:56.920 --> 56:58.640
I can't help but wonder it a little bit.

56:58.640 --> 57:00.260
And there's this voice in the back of my head

57:00.260 --> 57:03.000
that always goes, well, RMS was usually right about this stuff.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.280
It could be nothing, right?

57:04.280 --> 57:05.080
It could be nothing.

57:05.080 --> 57:09.200
And I think, too, if you have a hard time with controlling

57:09.200 --> 57:11.360
how much you use these devices, building something in

57:11.360 --> 57:13.280
is probably good.

57:13.280 --> 57:16.480
And I think the intention here from the companies

57:16.480 --> 57:18.960
is a good one, I think.

57:18.960 --> 57:20.280
So yeah.

57:20.280 --> 57:24.160
So Android P, coming to a phone near you in 2021.

57:24.160 --> 57:26.540
But you can go read about it with the link in our show

57:26.540 --> 57:27.280
notes.

57:27.280 --> 57:29.040
It does look like a nice refresh.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.840
If I had a phone it would run on, I'd give it a go.

57:30.840 --> 57:33.240
There's some good security improvements baked in as well,

57:33.240 --> 57:35.120
and runtime stuff.

57:35.120 --> 57:37.640
In fact, the one that I noticed, I think you called it out

57:37.640 --> 57:41.800
in our chat, was that it is now using TLS by default

57:41.800 --> 57:43.400
and DNS over TLS.

57:43.400 --> 57:44.160
That's nice.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.320
More encryption.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.040
Yeah.

57:46.040 --> 57:50.560
Yeah, I do not mean to besmirch the good name of Android P,

57:50.560 --> 57:53.480
because as everyone knows, we love P.

57:53.480 --> 57:54.000
Right?

57:54.000 --> 57:55.600
It's just complicated.

57:55.600 --> 57:56.480
It's, yeah.

57:56.480 --> 57:57.000
Yeah, it is.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.320
It's a complicated relationship.

57:58.320 --> 58:02.280
So let's make things easy for a little bit with a snap.

58:02.280 --> 58:05.960
There is a new app that I found this week in the Snap store,

58:05.960 --> 58:06.480
I guess.

58:06.480 --> 58:08.540
And it's called Transitions DJ.

58:08.540 --> 58:13.080
And it is a, to me, I guess, I don't mean to say it badly.

58:13.080 --> 58:15.360
I don't mean to talk it down, but it's

58:15.360 --> 58:18.800
like a light version of Mix, M-I-X-X-X.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.800
It's nice.

58:19.800 --> 58:22.560
It's a cool little app, and it's used for mixing music.

58:22.560 --> 58:25.920
It's great for live production or just making a mix

58:25.920 --> 58:26.720
that you like.

58:26.720 --> 58:30.680
It has cross fading, tempo adjustment, looping, cue points,

58:30.680 --> 58:32.560
tempo synchronization.

58:32.560 --> 58:35.280
And it also has a online database

58:35.280 --> 58:39.680
it can pull down of song structures that you can use.

58:39.680 --> 58:40.200
Really?

58:40.200 --> 58:42.040
You get the beats and the bars and the beats

58:42.040 --> 58:45.060
and the bars and the phrases to help you mix it up.

58:45.060 --> 58:47.920
And it's a snap to install.

58:47.920 --> 58:50.320
It's really, it's actually quite literally a snap.

58:50.320 --> 58:54.040
You just do snap, install, transitions, DJ.

58:54.040 --> 58:56.120
And then you'll be the star of the party.

58:56.120 --> 58:57.360
Yeah, so that looks pretty cool.

58:57.360 --> 58:58.080
That is neat.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.840
Yeah, you got a summer party.

58:59.840 --> 59:03.160
Then there's a tool that I didn't know anything about,

59:03.160 --> 59:05.540
but I knew it was something the Intercept was working on.

59:05.540 --> 59:09.600
That's the outfit that Glenn Greenwald works for and others.

59:09.600 --> 59:12.520
And their parent company, First Look Media,

59:12.520 --> 59:15.360
has been investing in a tool to help them manage

59:15.360 --> 59:17.160
PGP encrypted emails.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.840
But not the emails so much themselves, but the keys.

59:19.840 --> 59:22.760
From the beginning of First Look Media,

59:22.760 --> 59:25.620
they've been using PGP or GBG encryption

59:25.620 --> 59:27.280
for all of their emails.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.360
And they've tried to make it as simple as possible

59:29.360 --> 59:33.760
by creating a new open source tool called GPG Sync.

59:33.760 --> 59:36.640
They've developed it in order to offload

59:36.640 --> 59:39.160
the most complex part of encrypted email, the key

59:39.160 --> 59:41.480
management part of encrypted email.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.520
And they take it out really away from the users,

59:43.520 --> 59:46.360
the fiddling from the users, and they kind of move it

59:46.360 --> 59:47.680
into the IT staff realm.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.600
So this is sort of a pick for those of you in IT

59:49.600 --> 59:51.640
that might want to solve this for your end users.

59:51.640 --> 59:52.920
So here's how it works.

59:52.920 --> 59:55.360
GPG Sync is designed to make it so everyone

59:55.360 --> 59:57.920
within your organization always has

59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.880
the correct public keys for everyone else

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.080
in your organization without even having to think about it.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.280
I want that.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.400
I want that right now.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.120
Yeah, I was thinking like, and I heard this, like,

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.120
oh, we could use this here.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.120
That'd be kind of cool.

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.780
We could all be talking encrypted.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:14.400
Although we just don't really.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.160
When's the last time you've emailed me or I've emailed you?

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.120
Ever?

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:20.920
Very rarely.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.680
Probably once.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.440
Maybe once, yeah.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.280
I think about it twice.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.240
Yeah, that's weird.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.080
It's very odd.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.400
Yeah, so the tech staff generates a PGP key called

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.440
the authority key.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.880
And they also recommend you use YubiKey with this.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.640
They create a list of all the PGP fingerprints

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.160
that all members of the organizations

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.600
should keep updated called a key list.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.320
They digitally sign the key list with the authority key.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.760
And then they upload both the key list and the signature

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.480
to a website that is accessible from a public URL.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.140
All members of the organizations then

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:54.660
install GPG Sync and subscribe to that key list.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.080
You can also subscribe to as many key lists as you'd like.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.180
So if you had multiple projects or companies

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.600
you were working with, they could all

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.720
have their own key list.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.260
And you could subscribe to them.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.880
You can stay up to date on all of them

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.240
from multiple organizations.

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.000
When someone joins your organization,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.280
the tech staff helps them generate the PGP key,

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.120
adds their fingerprint to the key list,

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.860
and re-signs it with the authority key.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.100
And then they upload it to the same URL.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.400
If a user migrates to a new key, the tech staff

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.860
adds their new fingerprint to the key list,

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:25.600
and also leaves their old one on the list as well.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.260
And now each member of your organization

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.600
doesn't have to track down everyone else's public keys

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.080
and make sure they're authentic.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.120
You don't even have to hold regular key signing parties,

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.360
though you probably could.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.600
The users don't actually have to do anything.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.800
They just write encrypted emails to their colleagues,

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.480
and it just works.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:41.320
That's pretty neat.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.680
Yeah, so you're just delegating trust

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.640
to IT, which you do for so many other things

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.160
anyway in an organization like that.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.680
And it's just a nice way to keep it all in sync.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.080
And in a Windows organization, you

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.280
are the domain admins have access to all that stuff.

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.200
They get master keys.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.880
So yeah, there you go.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.400
There you go.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.720
It's called GPG sync, and version 0.20 came out this week.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.360
So congratulations to First Lock Media

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.720
for putting that together.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.160
So there's a couple of app picks for you.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:07.720
How about that?

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.480
Boom, boom, boom.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.680
A couple of app picks right there, pow, pow, pow.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.680
And you can find all of those at linuxunplug.com.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.880
Slash 261.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.920
Wow, how about that?

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.200
261, Wes.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:19.960
Good job.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.400
Holy smokes, holy smokes.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.660
Well, that just about brings us to the end

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:23.960
of this week's broadcast.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.840
If you want to get more Wes Payne, go check out what?

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.320
Techsnap?

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:29.280
Yeah, techsnap.systems.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.320
Nice.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.720
If you want a little more poppy, he

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.280
was just recently on Late Night Linux

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.520
in their most recent episode.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.560
Did a fine job there.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.080
And also, that excellent Ubuntu podcast.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.120
So you always can check out more poppy at there as well,

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.800
ubuntupodcast.org.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.120
And you can find Cassidy and Dan.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.660
It will have links to their social profiles

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.060
and their websites in our show notes.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.480
So you can get their stuff there.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.680
And Brent, is there anything you want

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:56.160
to mention before we get out of here this week?

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.560
Anywhere you want to send folks?

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.600
Yeah, I think sending people to at BrentGervais on Twitter

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.320
is a good place.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.440
Just come and say hi if you don't have anything better

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:04.960
to say, but I'd love to say hi.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.840
Check that.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.280
All right, very good, sir.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.820
All right, you know, one of these days,

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.240
we've got to get another barbecue planned.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.320
OK, get another barbecue planned.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:11.960
We need it.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:12.960
Yeah, smoked meats.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.800
We do need it.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.000
Hey, I encourage you to follow me on Twitter too.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.520
Why not?

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.080
We're all doing it, at chrislas.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.920
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.660
And if you join us live on Tuesdays,

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.360
you get a nice Linux rounded meal,

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.280
because the pre-show starts around 1.30 Pacific time.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.360
And then the show starts around 2 PM-ish.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.440
And then we tend to go till about 3, 3.30-ish,

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.480
whatever that might be.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.200
And then we hang out till that Noah Chalaya guy shows up.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.560
And then we do a little handoff to him,

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.480
and the Ask Noah program fires up.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.640
It's a beautiful, beautiful afternoon of Linux.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.360
Now, a lot of people say, but Chris, I got to work.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.040
And to that I say, no, you don't.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.540
Just put this on in the background.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:52.640
And you say, and they come to you and say,

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.200
why aren't you working?

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.200
You say, boss, this is my extended training.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.560
Don't you want me to be better at my job?

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.060
And if they say no to that, then you're

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.320
working at the wrong place.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.840
All right, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.840
of the Unplugged program.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.120
I hope you enjoyed everything.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.800
Don't forget, links are on the Linux Unplugged website.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.840
Our live stream is at jblive.tv.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.640
You can also get it on our YouTube channel

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.600
at youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.760
Thanks so much for being here.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.960
See you back here next Tuesday.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:45.960
I'll see you guys next time.

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:53.360
Here we go.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.480
We're bringing it in now for a landing.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.400
Soft, gentle, JB landing.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.800
Yeah, keep your seats buckled.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.320
And drink it if you still got it,

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.460
because I'll probably smack into the ground a little hard.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:07.480
I tend to do that.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.160
Well, thank you, everybody, for making it to the show today.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.400
What are we going to do for $300?

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:15.080
I know it's a ways off, but if we start talking about it now,

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.080
you know what I'm saying?

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.200
We have time to execute something great.

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.960
I'm putting that out there.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.040
What are we going to do for $300?

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.000
All right, jbtitles.com.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.760
And what are we going to do for titles?

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.200
Write the heck down.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:22.600
Let's go.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600
Thank you, Mumba Room.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.680
You guys were great.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.720
A rowdy riotous Mumba Room.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.960
Anybody cooking like we are?

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.400
It's, what do you say, probably 83 in here, 84 in here

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.560
right now, maybe?

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.520
My entire state is on fire.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.320
That's, that is.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.000
Literally.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:37.800
Yeah.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.600
Yeah, that's awful.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.160
I mean, that's what we need here in Europe to rain.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.280
Rain would be really good.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:43.800
Yeah.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.400
Rain is hot as balls.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.760
I appreciate that everybody's suffering with this thing.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.320
That's nice.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:49.760
That's good.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.800
That's why we do this, to distract us all.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.000
I'm not suffering right now, and yet I still

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.200
have my glass of wine.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.280
And now it's pretty decent, because we

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.200
have half the midnight here.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.520
So it's pretty cool now.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:03.000
It's good.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.720
Yeah, I bet.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.160
Well, that's, you know, when you're

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.840
on vacation and in the Mumba Room,

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.040
that's real dedication right there, I got to say.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.640
You're the best.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:14.720
I'm your servant.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.200
All right.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.720
Well, now let's pick a title then.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.920
And then I think we've checked all of our boxes.

01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.480
I liked there was something, Gnome Gnome on the Range.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.240
That was one that went by at one point.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.000
Tech Mav.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.800
Yeah, we got to get the boat going.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
It's a long one.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.200
We need your help to sort this out.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.840
We can't pick from a series of ones.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:33.760
I resisted the urge to ask when the release is

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.040
going to be Dan and Cassidy.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:35.760
You know, I didn't.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.200
I saw you squirming.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200
It was on your mind.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.360
I just wanted to say, I believe Dan's birthday came and went,

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.160
and that was the deadline, as far as I was concerned.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.120
When it's ready, as always.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:07:12.280
Just a thanks to Jess when it's ready.
