WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
it's called slap and it's a sublime like terminal based text editor so yes sublime

00:05.960 --> 00:11.120
text comes to your terminal I think it's actually I don't know it does I think

00:11.120 --> 00:15.720
it's actually a pretty beastie installation because it runs on I think

00:15.720 --> 00:19.680
it runs on node and you have to install it using npm but it didn't try no I

00:19.680 --> 00:23.760
wasn't I wasn't I wasn't actually compelled but I don't know is a big

00:23.760 --> 00:27.060
sublime text fan so I sent this over to him this morning to give us his full

00:27.060 --> 00:32.520
review isn't that funny like I think for some people the you know if you're if

00:32.520 --> 00:36.600
you're a javascript dev then it's a it's probably like a super easy installation

00:36.600 --> 00:41.520
for you that's a good point this beer is delicious West I know right I was

00:41.520 --> 00:47.240
surprised it is really good oh it's a blonde ale yeah for an easy beer in the

00:47.240 --> 00:51.080
in a warm afternoon mm-hmm all right I want the West take on the VR

00:51.080 --> 00:55.800
backpack it's a PC that doubles as a backpack for VR but then you can put in

00:55.800 --> 01:01.840
a big old docking station whoa it's a desktop PC HP is making this thing what

01:01.840 --> 01:05.240
do you think of these backpack PCs have you seen many of these so my first worry

01:05.240 --> 01:08.960
what if you're walking uphill you're working up a sweat on a sunny day is

01:08.960 --> 01:14.120
that going to ruin the PC water damage yeah I mean yeah yeah well I think they

01:14.120 --> 01:18.160
envision like you're in the living room still it's for VR but without having to

01:18.160 --> 01:21.820
have all the cords all over right I I actually think it'd be awesome is like a

01:21.820 --> 01:26.800
live stream broadcaster like put put Linux on this put OBS on this connect it

01:26.800 --> 01:30.600
to some LTE modems and now you got yourself a portable broadcasting machine

01:30.600 --> 01:34.080
on your back seems like it'll all come down to weight distribution and heat you

01:34.080 --> 01:38.120
know like is it comfortable to wear can you do it right multiple hours right it

01:38.120 --> 01:41.560
could enable citizen journalism in fact if you built an LTE modems into this

01:41.560 --> 01:47.880
thing I mean I enable citizen journalism with like a pie and cell phone to just

01:47.880 --> 01:51.840
yeah Nexus 5 well I guess you don't really need a PC you know what they ought

01:51.840 --> 01:55.880
to do you know they ought to do us they ought to just make the VR headset

01:55.880 --> 02:00.200
super-powerful here's an idea why don't they put a PC in a headset that's crazy

02:00.200 --> 02:04.440
talk or I was thinking like it what's the size like on this can you get

02:04.440 --> 02:08.520
smaller could we get like a knock and then one of the little things that you've

02:08.520 --> 02:12.800
just duct-taped on your the back of your shirt yeah it's got a 1080 graphics card

02:12.800 --> 02:17.720
it's got the Kaby Lake a7 processor you got to buy the dock separately the

02:17.720 --> 02:22.520
dock is $600 on top of a $2,500 computer and I'm sure that dock works with all

02:22.520 --> 02:26.560
kinds of other systems you're like yeah I'd say that's definitely future-proof

02:26.560 --> 02:30.320
look at all those ports I see three I mean how could you not buy this with all

02:30.320 --> 02:48.920
of those killer VR apps this is Linux unplugged episode 200 for June 6 2017

02:48.920 --> 02:53.200
welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's been going for

02:53.200 --> 02:59.240
200 episodes strong my name is Chris my name is West hello West I don't think

02:59.240 --> 03:03.200
we've missed an episode I don't think so we've had like some holiday specials

03:03.200 --> 03:08.960
yeah flashbacks oh absolutely this week we're postpone we're perspiring for

03:08.960 --> 03:14.880
perspirating perspiring perspiring conspiring and postponing it is getting

03:14.880 --> 03:19.320
a little warm here we're gonna hold off on the 200th birthday celebration for

03:19.320 --> 03:23.120
July 4th more about that in a little bit instead after we get through kind of a

03:23.120 --> 03:27.680
shorter compact amount of project updates and stuff we're gonna do a love

03:27.680 --> 03:34.640
letter a love song and maybe maybe a maybe a little more they'll tell you

03:34.640 --> 03:38.400
more about that for gnome 3 I'm you know I'm loving gnome 3 I think it's a great

03:38.400 --> 03:42.200
desktop and we're gonna cover some ways you can make it better and why I'm

03:42.200 --> 03:46.440
pretty positive on the future of the gnome shell some things that are coming

03:46.440 --> 03:50.680
up very soon to gnome at things that are long long down the road but I think are

03:50.680 --> 03:54.360
gonna have great long-term impacts in fact one of them is developing even

03:54.360 --> 03:58.120
today as we go on the air so we're gonna cover things to make known better for

03:58.120 --> 04:01.480
you today even if you're not a gnome user please stick around as after we get

04:01.480 --> 04:04.200
through the updates because I kind of want to just show you how the other side

04:04.200 --> 04:08.200
is living this week better or for worse we want to get your feedback on that and

04:08.200 --> 04:13.080
then we'll talk about sort of where GTK is going where the gnome shells going

04:13.080 --> 04:18.560
improvements to mutter GTK for and a company out there that's making some big

04:18.560 --> 04:24.920
hires that could have big long-term impacts on the direction of no so 200

04:24.920 --> 04:30.320
a packed episode a packed packed episode and before we go into it too far you

04:30.320 --> 04:33.040
know we have one thing we got to do every single week we got to start it we

04:33.040 --> 04:36.280
got to start right here sometimes I like to wait a little bit but I'm feeling I'm

04:36.280 --> 04:39.680
feeling in the community spirit time appropriate greetings virtual log

04:39.680 --> 04:49.880
greetings so we have we have the virtual lug joining us every single week but to

04:49.880 --> 04:55.840
celebrate our 200th episode on July 4th on America's birthday now known as

04:55.840 --> 05:00.560
Linux own plugs birthday we're gonna have a virtual lug barbecue the virtual

05:00.560 --> 05:05.800
lug becomes real at least some of us yeah yeah way it's official the meetup

05:05.800 --> 05:09.280
is set up you can find it at meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you can

05:09.280 --> 05:15.400
make it we'll be cooking and grilling and sous vide all the things yeah yeah I

05:15.400 --> 05:21.560
think my lady will be here is that right yeah idea will make it the kids will be

05:21.560 --> 05:26.560
here this could be a lot of fun I think Angela's gonna make it so you are you

05:26.560 --> 05:31.840
are also welcome to bring a significant other or or somebody else we won't say

05:31.840 --> 05:35.880
no yeah what happens at the studio it stays that's right that's right it's

05:35.880 --> 05:39.400
like mini Vegas right here so meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting that's

05:39.400 --> 05:42.480
when we're gonna be celebrating our 200th episode but since we're not doing

05:42.480 --> 05:48.120
that today we have some work to get done oh we got some really really great

05:48.120 --> 05:51.880
information in an interview that happened over at Engadget or no I'm

05:51.880 --> 05:57.060
sorry ours technica with folks on the Android project they talked to Android

05:57.060 --> 06:02.440
execs Dave Burke and Stephanie's yacht kubertson I you know what I shouldn't

06:02.440 --> 06:06.040
have even started nope I shouldn't have I'm trying to learn just Android execs

06:06.040 --> 06:09.560
just yeah and I could have just left it at that nobody would have cared no it

06:09.560 --> 06:12.920
would have been fine but I just kept going you'd think I haven't been doing

06:12.920 --> 06:19.120
this maybe 101 you'll be oh my gosh anyways you don't care about half the

06:19.120 --> 06:21.720
stuff in here I'm betting unless you're a huge Android fan and you're probably

06:21.720 --> 06:26.280
listening to different podcasts if you are or additionally but there was

06:26.280 --> 06:31.040
something in here that was really good and juicy for us Linux users they talk

06:31.040 --> 06:36.880
in here about the really freaking old Linux kernels and if you have not

06:36.880 --> 06:40.960
listened to a recent episode we've kind of gone over this a little bit current

06:40.960 --> 06:46.600
Android pixel the one that like Wes has got there is that in his pocket it is

06:46.600 --> 06:52.980
shipping with a really old version of the Linux kernel one from 2014 and that

06:52.980 --> 06:57.400
was an LTS kernel which is no longer being maintained by Greg KH pointed he

06:57.400 --> 07:00.840
made on Greg is a point he made a lot of noise about in fact he even did like one

07:00.840 --> 07:04.880
more like sympathy release of patches because he knows so many Android devices

07:04.880 --> 07:11.280
oh yeah 3.18 dot 31 yeah which is no longer getting support upstream so

07:11.280 --> 07:15.880
Google is now essentially running a unsupported unmaintained version of

07:15.880 --> 07:20.000
Linux kernel and hopefully back porting fixes I mean it works so well for my

07:20.000 --> 07:23.920
router Chris I thought maybe on the phone it would be good too of course and

07:23.920 --> 07:28.520
this is by the way best-case scenario this is on the pixel so if you got like

07:28.520 --> 07:34.080
a Samsung s6 or something in your pocket I'm betting it's even worse and so

07:34.080 --> 07:40.120
rightfully so rightfully so ours asked them about this and they say what is

07:40.120 --> 07:44.000
your thinking about the Linux kernel you ship a super old one right now from 3

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
dot 18 that's from 2014 what are you gonna do about this you're stuck

07:48.000 --> 07:53.440
maintaining this until 2019 because the pixel yeah and and so Burke comes right

07:53.440 --> 07:59.080
back and says well we have 4.4 working internally now here's the problem with

07:59.080 --> 08:02.640
4.4 is that means they're not shipping it yet it means it might be shipping on

08:02.640 --> 08:07.320
the next Android device possibly that's a possibility the next official Google

08:07.320 --> 08:12.840
Android device but if they don't have shipping now that's not that's not very

08:12.840 --> 08:19.160
4.4 is already getting old yeah and it's maintained until February of 2018

08:19.160 --> 08:23.420
Google wants to provide three years of security updates so it's gonna have to

08:23.420 --> 08:29.680
maintain kernel 4.4 on its own from 2018 for basically the beginning of 2018

08:29.680 --> 08:34.360
until 2020 it's a long time so even though they're just so we it's great

08:34.360 --> 08:38.160
they got 4.4 internally but it's it's like not enough too little too late it

08:38.160 --> 08:41.920
is I think a big problem and I think it's one that could really kind of bite

08:41.920 --> 08:44.960
them in the butt especially because what's holding them back isn't their

08:44.960 --> 08:51.320
their effort or their enthusiasm for it it's silicon manufacturers and this if

08:51.320 --> 08:55.240
you recall goes back to project treble yeah where they're trying to abstract

08:55.240 --> 08:59.200
away the hardware manufacturers so they say take the pixel for example it's a

08:59.200 --> 09:03.760
Qualcomm device so we have to stick with what Qualcomm supports now we're gonna

09:03.760 --> 09:07.080
try to be more prescribed about which kernel version you have to ship with a

09:07.080 --> 09:11.680
new device and we're going to work with the Lenaro community where's my bell

09:11.680 --> 09:15.480
that's a key that's a key point the Lenaro community that is an

09:15.480 --> 09:18.600
organization in group that is structured in kind of like two main

09:18.600 --> 09:22.800
parts Lenaro is for my understanding and this is my rough understanding is Lenaro

09:22.800 --> 09:27.440
has a has a core fork of the company that's super focused on Linux kernel and

09:27.440 --> 09:33.680
drivers and Linux core subsystems on ARM then they have another fork of the

09:33.680 --> 09:38.200
company the second branch of the company which is really focused on ARM chips you

09:38.200 --> 09:41.040
know the whole system on a chip ecosystem environment getting those

09:41.040 --> 09:43.560
vendors to work with patents and licensing and all that stuff that's

09:43.560 --> 09:48.440
that's my rough understanding of Lenaro so what they are planning to do from

09:48.440 --> 09:52.280
reading this entire interview now I'm summarizing for you is they're planning

09:52.280 --> 09:57.200
to work with Lenaro to essentially pick up Greg KH's work and Lenaro may become

09:57.200 --> 10:01.680
sort of an extended LTS maintainer with their own fork of the Linux kernel that

10:01.680 --> 10:05.160
Android is using and they say in the interview that they're gonna get more

10:05.160 --> 10:10.680
directly involved with that interesting so we could have like an Android fork of

10:10.680 --> 10:14.600
the kernel that gets maintained for an additional year outside of what the

10:14.600 --> 10:18.200
standard I should be like pleased because I want more official or better

10:18.200 --> 10:22.880
maintenance or more upkeep or to be like this feels like a compromise on all sides

10:22.880 --> 10:26.880
mr. Veritunda you had a question about communities maybe moving to other

10:26.880 --> 10:33.240
projects well it just occurs to me okay right that there are hold on say again

10:33.240 --> 10:38.680
you cut yourself off it just occurs to me that there are already embedded links

10:38.680 --> 10:42.960
projects out there like you know open wrt and LED project which have recently

10:42.960 --> 10:46.320
merged again which already target no Android or sort of you know on

10:46.320 --> 10:50.400
platforms I don't understand quite why okay everyone's trying to reinvent the

10:50.400 --> 10:54.560
wheel okay when it comes to sort of like these kind of projects because I mean

10:54.560 --> 10:58.140
you know open wrt very up-to-date with their lake of tunnels they get in lake

10:58.140 --> 11:03.160
expects and they have a good ecosystem in packages and stuff so why can't they

11:03.160 --> 11:06.960
base it around that well you know I don't think they're gonna base it on

11:06.960 --> 11:09.720
open wrt that if they're gonna do it they do it something like a fuchsia or

11:09.720 --> 11:13.080
whatever it's called their new the new OS that's not Linux based that they're

11:13.080 --> 11:18.600
toying around with I think though the real answer is is that Android is just

11:18.600 --> 11:23.080
simply its own beast now it's its own ecosystem it's its own everything it's

11:23.080 --> 11:27.560
it's it is its own market force and so it just doesn't matter what you what

11:27.560 --> 11:34.560
else is out there because it's so huge you you still enjoying the pixel are you

11:34.560 --> 11:42.220
it's are you well I just heard a lot of questions about the WWC event and the

11:42.220 --> 11:46.880
pre-show and I thought maybe Wes has been looking over the fence and you know

11:46.880 --> 11:50.160
because I I look at these things and I I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go on some

11:50.160 --> 11:54.080
sort of Android rant here but I find it a little disappointing I feel like

11:54.080 --> 11:58.800
Google is a pretty big company with a lot of really smart people and I think a

11:58.800 --> 12:04.040
lot of them get open source and Linux there I think you're right about that

12:04.040 --> 12:07.920
yeah but yet it feels like they've really compromised on this stuff and

12:07.920 --> 12:11.120
they just keep compromising on this stuff and I mean I would certainly say

12:11.120 --> 12:16.080
it is not up to it's not it's not so far away but it's certainly not up to the

12:16.080 --> 12:24.800
fit and finish of iOS or an iOS device for me that's okay the pixel is at the

12:24.800 --> 12:28.400
point where it's like pretty much good enough in that like it's not ugly it

12:28.400 --> 12:32.360
doesn't offend me to have in my pocket or carry around the performance is good

12:32.360 --> 12:35.520
it doesn't bother me with lots of the old Android you know oh why is my app

12:35.520 --> 12:38.440
just stalling or whatever so I don't see those things so it is like day-to-day

12:38.440 --> 12:43.120
use cases the camera I like and it's fast so those problems are mostly gone

12:43.120 --> 12:46.560
at least in my day-to-day uses yeah it doesn't have the kind of

12:46.560 --> 12:49.720
seamlessness it doesn't have all the thought that's put into it obviously but

12:49.720 --> 12:53.500
you're touching on something there at WWE I'm not I'm wondering are you an

12:53.500 --> 12:59.480
Android user WWE yes I'm stuck on some older versions right now unfortunately

12:59.480 --> 13:04.960
I think I'm on KitKat on my phone is your phone nearby because if you go in

13:04.960 --> 13:08.160
today about I'd be curious and what do you think do you think like this stuff

13:08.160 --> 13:11.080
like the kernel version on the phone and stuff is it just something that only

13:11.080 --> 13:14.440
matters to me because I even understand what a Linux kernel is it maybe I'm the

13:14.440 --> 13:17.520
only one that thinks this matters because it works right at the end of the

13:17.520 --> 13:22.520
day it's a tool I think it matters because you want it to be secure I think

13:22.520 --> 13:26.840
most people would want their phone to be secured in the most average of users

13:26.840 --> 13:34.240
because of the ecosystem how people like the vendors are pretty much it's Google

13:34.240 --> 13:38.920
works with these third-party vendors whoever it is that they're not in

13:38.920 --> 13:43.920
control of it like Apple is they're the ones who are being bent over the barrel

13:43.920 --> 13:48.760
and being told oh no we're not going to support this right there's no if all

13:48.760 --> 13:55.560
calm says we're done they're done yeah exactly so it's like like I want this is

13:55.560 --> 14:02.020
why I'm sad like a good to phone or edge or whatever didn't take off as well as

14:02.020 --> 14:07.600
it should have because or in Firefox mobile sure yes and do well because we

14:07.600 --> 14:12.280
were stuck with these companies that don't you know get that there are people

14:12.280 --> 14:17.440
that want these phones either cheap secure ones or maybe they want a more

14:17.440 --> 14:23.920
for a better one that's secure and it's not happening yeah I would I would love

14:23.920 --> 14:27.440
so the pixel to me seems like a premiumly priced phone so I would love

14:27.440 --> 14:31.680
if that meant you get premium and I would love it if it meant you got

14:31.680 --> 14:35.040
premium security to how has there not been more of an enterprise angle here

14:35.040 --> 14:39.720
to say that again run I said or reasonable security I mean the fact that

14:39.720 --> 14:45.080
it's they're gonna update to that was released two years ago I mean you think

14:45.080 --> 14:49.000
they're back porting right they're back porting fixes and whatnot well they say

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
that but we don't know yeah I mean and part of it is well that's a good point

14:54.000 --> 14:58.560
like part of it is they're back porting they're back porting the big things that

14:58.560 --> 15:02.880
they are aware of that doesn't mean they're getting everything I think it's

15:02.880 --> 15:06.440
I think it's a little naive to assume that every fix makes it onto the bug

15:06.440 --> 15:10.800
list and every security patch isn't just which isn't just considered a bug fix is

15:10.800 --> 15:16.480
properly addressed in fact Linus himself says that he considers security fixes

15:16.480 --> 15:20.800
and but and just like bugs to be the same kind they're the same level of fix

15:20.800 --> 15:24.600
it they're just fixes and I wouldn't be surprised if that mentality isn't a bit

15:24.600 --> 15:28.400
pervasive and so sometimes things that might be a little iffy on the

15:28.400 --> 15:31.880
security side are just marked as a bug fix nobody notices because the

15:31.880 --> 15:35.440
developers himself found it or herself found it makes the fix submits it it

15:35.440 --> 15:38.560
gets accepted and it's patched and it just rolls out the next version of the

15:38.560 --> 15:42.680
kernel and because there was never a CVE attached to it it means that it just

15:42.680 --> 15:47.000
sits there rotting in these old kernels right I mean it's like it works okay I

15:47.000 --> 15:49.760
guess if you have the you know just update your kernels which I think is

15:49.760 --> 15:52.400
pretty much what the kernel community would tell you right just update your

15:52.400 --> 15:55.800
kernel we try hard not to break things update your kernel that doesn't work

15:55.800 --> 16:01.240
when you have based your project on this 14 relationship so ww's on 3.4 kernel

16:01.240 --> 16:10.000
3.4 ouch I have an Android 6 I think that's not super old but it's in there

16:10.000 --> 16:14.360
it's getting there now well I also have a Nexus device so I you know the fact

16:14.360 --> 16:17.720
that I'm and I think it's some like probably six months or so they said

16:17.720 --> 16:23.480
they're gonna just continue my device entirely so that's fantastic oh wow yeah

16:23.480 --> 16:27.640
I so very tune do you think it's kind of a shame that Android isn't known for one

16:27.640 --> 16:36.080
of Linux is better traits which is supporting older hardware yeah there you

16:36.080 --> 16:38.840
go you're good you're good you just got to hold down that push to talk you're

16:38.840 --> 16:43.280
good you just got a hold of that yes okay so the like I said okay I mean

16:43.280 --> 16:47.480
Linux is pretty much well known for running on old hardware and you know

16:47.480 --> 16:51.080
even if you go back to sort of like the the kind of last incarnations of you

16:51.080 --> 16:55.600
know PCs ten years ago you can still run a pretty modern kernel on that kind of

16:55.600 --> 17:01.100
hardware you try and do that on a phone not a chance because you know for one

17:01.100 --> 17:04.280
thing here are the hardware match actually stand up start to update the

17:04.280 --> 17:09.560
drivers to fix you know new problems Carol and new systems or anything like

17:09.560 --> 17:13.640
that so I don't know what's going on with that yeah it is it is a bit it's a

17:13.640 --> 17:18.160
bit of a shame you know that's a bit of a downer let's talk about a part of a

17:18.160 --> 17:21.600
solution this is just a natural segue it's ting I mean really a part of it is

17:21.600 --> 17:25.480
the carrier there and ting is a mobile is mobile in a totally different it

17:25.480 --> 17:29.920
totally different light it's a much simpler approach it's a much more

17:29.920 --> 17:33.880
understandable way to do mobile and they don't have like this huge branding

17:33.880 --> 17:38.600
strategy where they need to integrate in a certain part of their branding to the

17:38.600 --> 17:41.560
phone which holds up releases they just they don't even play in that arena

17:41.560 --> 17:46.640
that's why I love ting those are the top features for me but what really draws

17:46.640 --> 17:50.960
people in is the way that the payments system works so it's it's just six

17:50.960 --> 17:55.560
dollars for a line just six thought so you want two phones you want one phone

17:55.560 --> 17:58.200
okay it's six dollars one second phone six dollars you want third phone six

17:58.200 --> 18:02.000
dollars really simple and then you're just your usage on top of that so your

18:02.000 --> 18:06.160
minutes your messages and your megabytes and it's really clear and you often the

18:06.160 --> 18:09.800
average ting bill for a line is like 23 bucks they have nationwide coverage

18:09.800 --> 18:13.600
there's no contracts there's no real determination fees you just pay for what

18:13.600 --> 18:18.640
you use they have a very very well built control panel they have a full range of

18:18.640 --> 18:23.320
devices or you can bring your own CDMA or GSM you pick and if you bring one

18:23.320 --> 18:25.600
they'll just give you a service credit which probably pay for more than your

18:25.600 --> 18:29.040
first month they have such great customer service too and check out their

18:29.040 --> 18:33.320
blog as a small business owner who uses ting I got to say it really does work

18:33.320 --> 18:35.560
well for a small business and they've been featuring a couple of different

18:35.560 --> 18:41.720
businesses recently I I probably would say I encourage family plans Morris you

18:41.720 --> 18:45.320
know if you got kids or people you just want to have several people or in my

18:45.320 --> 18:48.480
case when we had a nanny for a while we actually got her a phone so we always

18:48.480 --> 18:51.160
knew we'd have good reliable communications with her when she had the

18:51.160 --> 18:56.960
kids and to us that was worth the six bucks a month and now you look at it and

18:56.960 --> 19:00.160
I'm now I think about it so much more as a business owner about how I can when we

19:00.160 --> 19:03.240
have events and things like that how I can use ting and they actually just

19:03.240 --> 19:08.240
highlighted a lavender farm oh yeah business pretty cool you can get

19:08.240 --> 19:14.680
started by doing us a favor visit linux.ting.com linux.ting.com take $25

19:14.680 --> 19:19.040
off a device or get a service credit and then visit the blog and read around if

19:19.040 --> 19:21.880
you even if you're not ready to switch yet check out all the stuff just so you

19:21.880 --> 19:27.080
are familiar with so when that time does come and it will my friend you will be

19:27.080 --> 19:32.200
ready you will be prepared linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for

19:32.200 --> 19:36.560
sponsoring the unplugged program linux.ting.com little community service

19:36.560 --> 19:39.120
announcement before we move on because I've seen a few people getting caught by

19:39.120 --> 19:44.600
surprise your old version of Skype that you've been hanging on to clinging on to

19:44.600 --> 19:49.560
version 4.3 yeah the cute version of Skype is being retired before our

19:49.560 --> 19:55.760
barbecue on July 1st 2017 well it goes away no more Skype for you you will not

19:55.760 --> 20:00.520
be able to use it you must switch over to the new Skype for Linux beta which I

20:00.520 --> 20:04.800
think as we record right now is at version 5.3 it's really getting pretty

20:04.800 --> 20:07.560
good actually yeah I was gonna say what do you what do you think about I know

20:07.560 --> 20:12.040
like there were some early issues we had here in the studio with it you tell me

20:12.040 --> 20:15.400
you've been using it now for weeks on tech snap working pretty good yeah it

20:15.400 --> 20:18.800
really does seem to be the video picture seems fine the audio quality seems

20:18.800 --> 20:22.200
pretty good I haven't had any crashing or it seems like much better than it was

20:22.200 --> 20:25.440
when the beta first launched and it's nice that it has you know the Linux

20:25.440 --> 20:28.160
hopefully this time around there you know it feels like they're doing Linux

20:28.160 --> 20:31.320
with Linux in mind from the get-go so hopefully we won't end up with like oh

20:31.320 --> 20:34.080
yeah never mind you'll never get updates again yeah I know the word on

20:34.080 --> 20:38.840
the street is is that that that Linux client is the new Skype for life like

20:38.840 --> 20:42.600
all platforms guys see that they're treating it seriously yeah so it is

20:42.600 --> 20:46.080
actually pretty decent the thing is is there's they really they have no choice

20:46.080 --> 20:49.920
because all the competitors are getting pretty damn good too and WebRTC is maybe

20:49.920 --> 20:54.600
yeah thing now yeah WebRTC is looking pretty good like Jitsi is is great I use

20:54.600 --> 21:00.440
that a lot for guests yeah because I can just send them a URL and Skype really

21:00.440 --> 21:04.280
has to up their game that's pretty much what it comes down to I have I'll leave

21:04.280 --> 21:09.880
this more as a resource linked for folks in the show notes but I hear this

21:09.880 --> 21:13.920
question a lot what's the difference between Google Chrome and Chromium on

21:13.920 --> 21:20.000
Linux specifically like why do I want to run Chrome over Chromium or do I maybe

21:20.000 --> 21:24.200
want to run Chromium for privacy reasons so I guess the main difference is just a

21:24.200 --> 21:29.760
couple is colorful logo on Chrome blue only logo for Chromium obviously user

21:29.760 --> 21:33.240
metrics are sent if they're turned on report crashes are sent if they're

21:33.240 --> 21:39.080
turned on out-of-the-box video and audio codecs for Chrome are AAC, HD64, MP3, Opus,

21:39.080 --> 21:45.520
Theora, Vorbis, VP8, VP9, and WAV. It has the sandbox to PP API non free flash

21:45.520 --> 21:50.160
plug-in which they maintain it's code tested specifically the sandbox is

21:50.160 --> 21:55.360
turned on by default single deb and RPM package and it stores them in slightly

21:55.360 --> 21:59.200
different locations because one's called Google Chrome and one's called Chromium

21:59.200 --> 22:04.320
the major differences on the Chromium side so here's what you don't get by

22:04.320 --> 22:11.320
using Chrome you don't get HD 64 out of the box it's dependent on your distro it

22:11.320 --> 22:16.280
does support the Netscape API and those are unsandboxed which is how it runs

22:16.280 --> 22:20.480
flash which means it's a little more dangerous version of a flash living on

22:20.480 --> 22:24.840
the edge it's quote-unquote considered maintained by distributions not by

22:24.840 --> 22:29.640
Google directly and the sandboxing depends on the distribution you can go

22:29.640 --> 22:33.920
to about colon sandbox to confirm if yours is on or not pretty much

22:33.920 --> 22:36.440
configures that in the same save in the same place except for the folders hold

22:36.440 --> 22:41.400
Chromium also you don't get that colorful logo right new only and maybe

22:41.400 --> 22:46.080
the other big thing is is the new releases are and testing are depending on

22:46.080 --> 22:50.200
patched up by the distro right which is kind of a big difference whereas when

22:50.200 --> 22:53.760
you install the deb or RPM of Google Chrome it adds a repo and then you get

22:53.760 --> 22:58.600
updates from the gooks I end up running Chrome myself I just go straight Chrome

22:58.600 --> 23:01.880
I have Chromium like over here on a system I don't use a lot it's not like

23:01.880 --> 23:05.400
one of my mains my mate like the soundboard system right here I have

23:05.400 --> 23:08.480
Chromium on that but this system that I'm here presenting I want to make sure

23:08.480 --> 23:12.400
that HD 64 and a AC work that's kind of if it's just a browser because hey I

23:12.400 --> 23:16.400
might need to look up something on Stack Overflow works just yeah so I just wanted

23:16.400 --> 23:20.700
to pass that along so that way you guys would just maybe could reference this or

23:20.700 --> 23:23.280
reference that link in the show notes that people ask you because I get the

23:23.280 --> 23:26.800
question at time yeah you know the Google GOG they're not good old games

23:26.800 --> 23:30.520
anymore they're having a sale the AI war fleet command is the one I picked up

23:30.520 --> 23:34.680
today it's pretty cool-looking game it's like this you you have a whole

23:34.680 --> 23:38.540
bunch of bots and you send them to fight off against each other and it's that

23:38.540 --> 23:43.920
sounds fun it actually it was but you're telling me there's a Linux oh oh my god

23:43.920 --> 23:49.600
jeez good old games autoplay fail oh sorry guys if you didn't just so you

23:49.600 --> 23:53.560
know that hurt me more than hurt you this is oh yeah oh yeah full-on full-on

23:53.560 --> 23:56.640
Linux support $1.99 right now for some of these games it's like some of these

23:56.640 --> 24:00.120
games are 80% off or something that's why I mentioned it it's their summer

24:00.120 --> 24:03.280
sale going on right now okay I'm gonna have to take a look after the show no

24:03.280 --> 24:09.480
sponsorship intended no no what is it called no product placement this is just

24:09.480 --> 24:12.640
the loose of the game I picked up this morning before the show and it looks

24:12.640 --> 24:16.560
pretty good and with that big old sale going on it's kind of neat it's kind of

24:16.560 --> 24:20.600
neat they have a whole bunch of other stuff on there too so yeah $1.99 crazy

24:20.600 --> 24:25.680
$1.99 you can't go wrong with that can't go wrong with that all right mr. West we

24:25.680 --> 24:29.680
are gonna be talking about gnome a lot today that's kind of what I wanted to

24:29.680 --> 24:32.640
make the bulk of this show about was just so we had an episode that was just

24:32.640 --> 24:35.680
sort of dedicated to this where the title kind of matches with the contents

24:35.680 --> 24:39.840
about assuming we have a gnome title you can do it guys hint hint hint hint

24:39.840 --> 24:43.920
hint so this is one of our last community updates for the week before we

24:43.920 --> 24:47.080
get into the gnome topic and that's just because it sort of segues us perfectly

24:47.080 --> 24:52.680
into it there is a collaboration going on right now at canonicals office in

24:52.680 --> 24:57.640
Taipei where gnome developers and Ubuntu developers are in attendance and

24:57.640 --> 25:04.920
they're working to greatly improve gnomes high DPI support oh so hot damn

25:04.920 --> 25:10.880
if canonical hasn't even yet shipped an Ubuntu based desktop and they're already

25:10.880 --> 25:14.320
I mean this is the exact kind of collaboration I wanted to see yeah when

25:14.320 --> 25:17.960
Ubuntu switches to gnome and they're working on something called a

25:17.960 --> 25:21.880
fractional scaling which is more like how unity and I think elementary OS is

25:21.880 --> 25:26.760
Luna desktop instead of just like one or two you can have like in between there

25:26.760 --> 25:31.800
yes exactly and it kind of requires a whole reworking our gnome supports one

25:31.800 --> 25:36.760
to one and two to one scaling only and on multi monitor systems is the same DPI

25:36.760 --> 25:41.080
scaling across all displays which drives me crazy and so it's annoying some of

25:41.080 --> 25:45.040
the issues this hack fest is aiming to fix is to support different fractional

25:45.040 --> 25:48.280
scaling values in mutter and gnome shell by upscaling the widgets and then

25:48.280 --> 25:51.760
downscaling to the requested value at the compositing time so they want to

25:51.760 --> 25:54.480
draw shell you at a higher resolution they're going to draw the UI for the

25:54.480 --> 25:58.080
shell at a higher resolution than what the logical pixels correspond to then

25:58.080 --> 26:02.120
they'll do non integer scaling adaptations and they're also working on

26:02.120 --> 26:08.480
ex whale and client support to a degree so I I'm I'm really really really happy

26:08.480 --> 26:12.040
about this because this particular type of high DPI support is really sort of

26:12.040 --> 26:17.520
next-level high DPI so yeah and this is one area that I would like I mean it you

26:17.520 --> 26:20.720
know it impacts buying decisions it impacts how I want to build system oh

26:20.720 --> 26:24.200
yeah sure so that's good really change a lot of stuff yeah and so there's more

26:24.200 --> 26:28.680
info in the blog post at the blog.nome.org site that we have LinkedIn here

26:28.680 --> 26:34.080
for the developer who's going a really cool to see this happening also crazy

26:34.080 --> 26:37.520
the canonical as offices in Taipei yeah they're just all over the place today I

26:37.520 --> 26:42.200
learned today yeah indeed so that's pretty neat and when when do we see the

26:42.200 --> 26:48.080
fruits of that labor who knows who knows maybe that but maybe that'll get things

26:48.080 --> 26:51.320
a little bit just a little bit closer so that way your terminals look even better

26:51.320 --> 26:55.400
I actually can't need those sexy terminals I actually kid but you know

26:55.400 --> 27:01.120
the the high DPI terminal that's no joke that is that is no joke Wes you know

27:01.120 --> 27:06.320
you're a gnome user right that's right okay so let's let's get let's get ready

27:06.320 --> 27:09.900
to talk about gnome because I I have many things to discuss here and the

27:09.900 --> 27:13.880
future looks bright Wes is running the gnome shell I'm running the gnome shell

27:13.880 --> 27:16.800
live in person we probably have some people in the chat room and in the

27:16.800 --> 27:19.600
mumble room running the gnome shell maybe you at home are running the gnome

27:19.600 --> 27:22.920
shell that's so exciting so let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for

27:22.920 --> 27:27.240

performance regardless of which one you get a simple intuitive API lightning

27:47.200 --> 27:52.880
fast networking highly available block storage and now check this out cloud

27:52.880 --> 27:57.480
firewalls you will have a central location to define access rules and

27:57.480 --> 28:01.120
apply them to all of your droplets they will enforce these rules on the network

28:01.120 --> 28:05.080

can play around with that $5 rig two months for free do unplugged over at

28:19.240 --> 28:23.480
digitalocean.com let's start with my favorite gnome

28:23.480 --> 28:27.680
extension getting a really solid update this is the one that I think everybody

28:27.680 --> 28:34.160
who starts installing a gnome extensions installs this one and I want to

28:34.160 --> 28:37.080
actually maybe stop for a second because I know I just realized I'm gonna get

28:37.080 --> 28:42.240
flamed but yes I I'm this is gonna come across as like hey load your gnome

28:42.240 --> 28:46.280
system up with all these extensions and have that at Haas just go crazy this is

28:46.280 --> 28:51.280
a disclosure here the Linux unplugged show recommends that you have a balanced

28:51.280 --> 28:55.980
diet approach to your extensions don't overdo it moderation is key people we're

28:55.980 --> 29:00.440
just gonna give you some cool ones right here off the top we're not advocating

29:00.440 --> 29:04.100
you run a thousand extensions and a lot of you plasma users will probably be

29:04.100 --> 29:08.520
laughing at us as we do this but so dash to dock is a very popular gnome

29:08.520 --> 29:13.720
extension maybe the most popular that takes the favorites and puts it as a

29:13.720 --> 29:18.680
dock a persistent dock that can hide well version 59 which is available right

29:18.680 --> 29:24.920
as we go on the air has added multi monitor support boy we're getting real

29:24.920 --> 29:28.240
folks yeah multi monitor groups now it's just the same damn dock on each screen

29:28.240 --> 29:32.080
right now but there are a couple of nice things there's also improved high DPI

29:32.080 --> 29:37.120
support ding ding ding ding and if you're not using something like the app

29:37.120 --> 29:41.240
indicator extensions that puts them up in the by your clock if you're like you

29:41.240 --> 29:44.200
still have that little tabby default gnome thing where all your tray icons go

29:44.200 --> 29:47.280
they've specifically built in some smarts to to make sure that they're not

29:47.280 --> 29:51.120
blocking that anymore so dash to dock solid extension you already knew about

29:51.120 --> 29:55.080
gets a pretty good update so go update now let's start with something new that

29:55.080 --> 29:59.320
maybe you haven't seen big props to Joey over at OMG Ubuntu for just really

29:59.320 --> 30:06.560
killing it yeah dude is recognized a need for a gnome coverage and is

30:06.560 --> 30:12.200
killing it arc is a new applications menu for gnome shell so not everybody

30:12.200 --> 30:16.400
likes the activities overlay this fixes that arc menu is an alternative app

30:16.400 --> 30:19.920
launcher for gnome shell replaces the activities button the top bar with a

30:19.920 --> 30:25.480
traditional start menu style launcher and it works nicely with things like

30:25.480 --> 30:29.800
dash to dock and panel extension what happens when you super key does it does

30:29.800 --> 30:33.280
it can I still type to complete that's what I want to know I think so although

30:33.280 --> 30:37.360
the big thing I miss from other versions I don't know see for me I'm not big on

30:37.360 --> 30:41.520
this is being existed in an extension I will not be installing yeah I like just

30:41.520 --> 30:45.160
that yeah super key to type three letters and launch I'm good but I want

30:45.160 --> 30:48.320
you know this comes up because I'm kind of playing with like what systems would

30:48.320 --> 30:52.160
I have for my mom right and so one of the problems I have I like the like

30:52.160 --> 30:56.720
mate approach of you know explorable but it doesn't work well once they've

30:56.720 --> 30:59.800
migrated to like they know the applications it's way too tedious yeah

30:59.800 --> 31:03.240
they do need some I like that like I love that about the gnome desktop and I

31:03.240 --> 31:07.080
don't understand why they chose arc as the launcher name it's a bad name it's

31:07.080 --> 31:11.520
named it's good it's overlapping with the most popular gnome theme and I I did

31:11.520 --> 31:16.480
some digging I can't tell I don't think the projects are related I don't know

31:16.480 --> 31:20.940
it's very confusing very confusing this one's also gonna confuse a lot of you

31:20.940 --> 31:26.880
xmonad awesome tiling window manager users out there g tile is an extension

31:26.880 --> 31:33.440
for gnome that turns gnome when you want it into a tiling desktop and once it's

31:33.440 --> 31:36.900
installed you click a little tile icon in the gnome menu up top you'll see a

31:36.900 --> 31:40.240
little overlay come up with a whole bunch of squares the g tile overlay will

31:40.240 --> 31:43.760
hover over an open window and then you can click one or more of the squares to

31:43.760 --> 31:48.660
place the window in that area so it's like a grid the row of icons then

31:48.660 --> 31:52.320
display the dimension control and the controls of the screener is titled right

31:52.320 --> 31:55.000
there so you can see what the screen title is if you just want to divvy up

31:55.000 --> 31:58.400
your screen into 16 equal chunks you can do that by choosing four by four the

31:58.400 --> 32:01.280
really nice thing about g tile is you're not locked into tiling new windows

32:01.280 --> 32:05.880
aren't automatically put on the grid boom and existing windows aren't locked

32:05.880 --> 32:10.120
so you have the best of both worlds and that's one that I might actually end up

32:10.120 --> 32:14.000
installing because there are times where I want to organize AF and then there are

32:14.000 --> 32:16.920
times where I want to just be wild yeah that one's one of my favorites

32:16.920 --> 32:20.520
especially because like the default of just left and right is not enough oh go

32:20.520 --> 32:26.880
on yeah it's not worth even bothering oh really it's it if the reason to do

32:26.880 --> 32:30.600
tiling is because you're you're using your keyboard g-tiles a hundred percent

32:30.600 --> 32:35.600
miles controlled oh the reason I yes I guess I kind of agree the reason why the

32:35.600 --> 32:38.640
reason why I like tiling though for me we just before organizing a whole lot of

32:38.640 --> 32:42.960
windows and stuff right every time you every time you close that window or you

32:42.960 --> 32:47.160
know the next day you open it it's not there that you the reason I do it is I

32:47.160 --> 32:50.880
organize my tiling so that it the next time I load the application it's all

32:50.880 --> 32:55.100
tiled together in the same way yeah g-tiles always you have to do it

32:55.100 --> 32:59.760
manually every single time what I really want is I want perfect never fail

32:59.760 --> 33:03.440
placement of my windows when I hook up my second screen I want I want all my

33:03.440 --> 33:09.800
windows to go right back where I had them perfectly there's there is a an option

33:09.800 --> 33:13.840
for people who want the tiling that does have features that are more like recall

33:13.840 --> 33:19.120
into tiling this called a shell shape and it's not really an extension it's a

33:19.120 --> 33:24.160
replacement for gnome shell so it's it's gnome shell but it's a modified gnome

33:24.160 --> 33:27.280
shell to make this possible because the reason why g-tile doesn't have these

33:27.280 --> 33:32.880
features is because gnome itself can't do the the full-blown structure based on

33:32.880 --> 33:36.220
the way it's built well Michael you're a you're a you're a fan of the gnome

33:36.220 --> 33:40.240
workflow so what is it about the gnome quote-unquote workflow that you try to

33:40.240 --> 33:46.560
adapt over on the plasma desktop well I'd say the the the style of having

33:46.560 --> 33:49.640
everything all in one so when you like the act the activities overview where

33:49.640 --> 33:54.160
you have the windows and you have the the the top bar and the the dock and the

33:54.160 --> 34:00.520
workspace I guess it's a dock to all that in one thing and also the flow of

34:00.520 --> 34:04.120
having all the workspaces in a vertical structure rather than a grid yeah

34:04.120 --> 34:08.720
because it's a lot easier to scroll up and down on your mouse or rather than

34:08.720 --> 34:12.080
having a keyboard shortcut where you got to do the different arrows in different

34:12.080 --> 34:18.160
directions and stuff you know there's that but the I don't know if you could

34:18.160 --> 34:23.720
give the whole one-click button start searching for whatever you want as a as

34:23.720 --> 34:26.840
a gnome thing I'm not really sure what started that just like a launcher thing

34:26.840 --> 34:30.400
in general and krunner does a fair job of that I mean windows does that yeah so

34:30.400 --> 34:33.700
yeah yeah when it's actually I know I think about it's probably when I give

34:33.700 --> 34:36.640
the nod to quicksilver myself I think that's where it started was quick so

34:36.640 --> 34:40.440
quick silver and then the gnome dude came over in synapse and yeah well

34:40.440 --> 34:44.640
Windows Vista had it and now I think about it huh so what's older quick

34:44.640 --> 34:49.280
silver somebody in the chat room go do some sleuthing online you what's older

34:49.280 --> 34:54.160
the mag launcher quick silver or Windows Vista I wonder although Windows Vista

34:54.160 --> 34:57.160
probably was in development before a quick silver ever hit the market so

34:57.160 --> 35:00.520
there's that okay I've got I just got a couple more extensions unless would you

35:00.520 --> 35:05.080
have any other workflow things well I mean the other thing is I do like the

35:05.080 --> 35:09.160
dynamic workspace and that's the only thing that's not possible in plasma I

35:09.160 --> 35:13.160
that would be really nice to have but as far as like the gnome workflow that is

35:13.160 --> 35:17.520
really cool yeah yeah I do like to have workspaces as well there's there's also

35:17.520 --> 35:20.280
this one more thing that has absolutely nothing to do with anything and it's

35:20.280 --> 35:23.960
really the only thing that bothers me that I can't have on plasma there's an

35:23.960 --> 35:28.480
extension in gnome called quick close overview and all it does is allow you to

35:28.480 --> 35:32.600
middle click a window in the overview to like grid thing and just close it from

35:32.600 --> 35:37.200
there and that is such a huge time-saver hmm you know what this is so stupid but

35:37.200 --> 35:42.000
you know what I miss when I'm on plasma is none of the plasma applets whatever

35:42.000 --> 35:46.640
they're called the check the Bitcoin price work they all just unfortunate and

35:46.640 --> 35:49.760
I and right now it's just it's so much fun right there you're watching at it

35:49.760 --> 35:53.480
it's fun I really that's the glint in your eye I really you know there's small

35:53.480 --> 35:56.520
things about like I really like the top bar on gnome especially when I have the

35:56.520 --> 36:01.200
top icons extension that way all of my system tray stuff is up there and then

36:01.200 --> 36:05.280
it's the rest of the UI is completely just my my application I'm using full

36:05.280 --> 36:09.600
screen I just have a very tiny thin bar with the time day an elegant little bar

36:09.600 --> 36:12.720
I like it yeah especially what's very functional theme and then you hit you

36:12.720 --> 36:16.640
hit the super key and you got a you got a pretty good built-in launcher they can

36:16.640 --> 36:19.760
even launch things like the display control panel and stuff like that which

36:19.760 --> 36:22.560
is between that and then like the improvements to dash to dock it's really

36:22.560 --> 36:28.160
kind of the whole deal so quicksilver came out three years before Vista oh it

36:28.160 --> 36:33.800
might be quicksilver then damn that is a long time ago yeah I'm surprised even

36:33.800 --> 36:36.640
remember the name of it or surely someone will tell us about an obscure

36:36.640 --> 36:41.480
window manager that was doing it totally I would think so let us really yeah and

36:41.480 --> 36:47.040
the command line actually yeah right the original launcher I got one more

36:47.040 --> 36:50.640
extension okay am I the flight I might have to and again I'm just telling you

36:50.640 --> 36:54.560
these are this one kind of feels like maybe a lighter one that maybe wouldn't

36:54.560 --> 36:59.960
wouldn't wreck things this is a Nautilus a git integration extension now hold on

36:59.960 --> 37:03.720
don't get don't get excited what don't get excited it's not like you're not

37:03.720 --> 37:07.680
checking in out of github with Nautilus here I actually think it's better than

37:07.680 --> 37:12.560
that though it is instead a simple extension that just adds important

37:12.560 --> 37:16.700
information about the current local git directory you're browsing so when you

37:16.700 --> 37:22.720
browse into a git directory on your file system it gives you relevant things like

37:22.720 --> 37:28.200
the git directory info the status of the git files you can open a remote URL you

37:28.200 --> 37:34.600
can select a specific branch you can compare commits in Nautilus so this

37:34.600 --> 37:38.920
again I the reason why I bring this up because I have this picture I have this

37:38.920 --> 37:43.240
picture after going to Dell of developers that buy smart Sputnik laptops

37:43.240 --> 37:49.360
by the millions to SSH into Ubuntu boxes and they're they're pushing and

37:49.360 --> 37:53.600
pulling help me cloud github with their continuous integration and they're doing

37:53.600 --> 37:56.920
all this stuff and now when they want to browse a local github directory they've

37:56.920 --> 37:59.640
checked out they get a bunch of great additional information just overlaid

37:59.640 --> 38:02.440
right into their file manager I'm gonna have to try this and because the damn

38:02.440 --> 38:06.120
thing's not trying to be a whole github client it's not like it's some huge hack

38:06.120 --> 38:11.120
in the extension it's just pretty simple information yeah wow it's pretty good

38:11.120 --> 38:13.000
that's great I mean I know a lot of people get this kind of you know you

38:13.000 --> 38:16.120
already have it maybe in your terminal and stuff so it seems super helpful yeah

38:16.120 --> 38:21.320
yeah I think it's pretty nice it would be great if they added things like side

38:21.320 --> 38:26.240
by side diff and there's PPAs out there if you're on the Ubuntu's and of course

38:26.240 --> 38:32.640
it's up on the GNOME extension site and github and then ladies and gentlemen the

38:32.640 --> 38:37.160
one that out of all of these I think I will be setting up for our studio

38:37.160 --> 38:42.000
machines if they stay known is app folder management so this is an

38:42.000 --> 38:45.040
extension that allows easy management of app folders directly from the

38:45.040 --> 38:48.480
applications view that looks nice yeah so you can create folders and as a

38:48.480 --> 38:51.600
bonus feature it's possible to change columns in the folder and stuff like

38:51.600 --> 38:56.320
that so it's actually you can you get additional nice features but you can

38:56.320 --> 38:59.320
create new app folders you get a nice dialogue to do it you can add those

38:59.320 --> 39:02.520
applications with cool sub menus and stuff you can remove applications from

39:02.520 --> 39:07.080
the folders you can delete the app folder and the files go the application

39:07.080 --> 39:11.440
icons go back it's sort of like how on Android or iOS you can you can move all

39:11.440 --> 39:17.320
of your launcher items into folders and it creates a dynamic folders and it kind

39:17.320 --> 39:20.800
of seems like a obvious feature like I when I thought about this is like I was

39:20.800 --> 39:26.000
kind of amazed that this isn't built in so this adds that a lot of the kind of

39:26.000 --> 39:29.240
customization that you would probably assume that you do so here in the studio

39:29.240 --> 39:33.040
I could do like you know we could have in one folder we could have the x32

39:33.040 --> 39:36.400
mixer stuff you could have the Skype stuff the mumble stuff easy for me yeah

39:36.400 --> 39:40.440
and we are back so no I'm just crashed on us that's kind of ironic I'm not

39:40.440 --> 39:45.400
joking summary of the show folks this is a this is a bit of an awkward thing for

39:45.400 --> 39:48.120
me right now this is my love song to gnome because I think it's such a great

39:48.120 --> 39:52.200
desktop and I think it has such a strong future and yet I think I'm switching

39:52.200 --> 39:54.880
away and I'm gonna be talking about that more but I just I want to continue

39:54.880 --> 39:58.280
being positive about gnome but I do have to acknowledge that we just had to stop

39:58.280 --> 40:02.760
broadcast and we had to stop and re-edit here and all of that because no crashed

40:02.760 --> 40:08.340
on us again so we are going down a path but and this is a system by the way the

40:08.340 --> 40:13.320
one that crashes the most is the system with almost no extensions just for the

40:13.320 --> 40:18.560
record the only extension that has is dash to dock and the ping extension

40:18.560 --> 40:24.560
yikes there you have it yeah yeah it's good times it's good times do any other

40:24.560 --> 40:30.480
machines suffer from this in the studio we have three gnome desktops that crash

40:30.480 --> 40:37.680
every day they're all similar hardware Nvidia arch core i7 like a generation

40:37.680 --> 40:42.800
ago yeah it's happening quite a bit that's kind of wow yeah yeah that's a

40:42.800 --> 40:47.520
bit of drag it really is like yesterday I was in the middle of working and so on

40:47.520 --> 40:52.200
my system upstairs gnome crashes three times it crashed crashed crashed and the

40:52.200 --> 40:54.960
reason I know is because I was looking at the log and looking at journal CTL and I

40:54.960 --> 40:59.760
can see it crashing reloading crashing and then reloading and every time it

40:59.760 --> 41:03.320
crashes I just get a segfault and then I then I get a whole bunch of like a

41:03.320 --> 41:06.840
bunch of errors from extensions and I get a whole bunch of garbage from when

41:06.840 --> 41:09.840
gnome starting up and looking for icons and loading caches and stuff and then

41:09.840 --> 41:15.360
and then it dumps again and then it tries again dumps again and here it

41:15.360 --> 41:18.040
seems to dump twice or something like I haven't quite because it's always when

41:18.040 --> 41:20.640
I'm in the middle of like broadcasting so I don't like I don't study it like I

41:20.640 --> 41:26.320
do at my workstation and then on Sunday before Linux action news I was just

41:26.320 --> 41:30.080
sitting here nothing was happening on this computer in front of me with except

41:30.080 --> 41:32.720
for Chrome but I wasn't even using the mouse or keyboard I was just sitting

41:32.720 --> 41:38.240
here chatting with Joe before the next action news and it crashed on me that

41:38.240 --> 41:44.000
sucks yeah so that's three different systems all with similar builds though

41:44.000 --> 41:47.720
yeah I haven't seen very much of that but I don't have any Nvidia systems

41:47.720 --> 41:52.080
running gnome right now or systems that are up for very long it's making me like

41:52.080 --> 42:00.440
rethink like goes go minimal go small go go X F C E go L X D E just go tiny

42:00.440 --> 42:03.280
desktop for the OBS machine because I just don't want that to be a factor

42:03.280 --> 42:09.080
instability we wanted big like we have a lot of people that are you we have

42:09.080 --> 42:12.440
different people some people use Linux more some people use Linux less they're

42:12.440 --> 42:15.620
using all of these systems yeah and so we wanted something very approachable we

42:15.620 --> 42:18.760
wanted something people who might be familiar with and so gnome shell seems

42:18.760 --> 42:23.160
like a good idea yeah yeah and it's also my if I'm gonna use a Linux desktop it's

42:23.160 --> 42:26.040
my preferred Linux desktop so if I gotta sit in front of a bunch of Linux

42:26.040 --> 42:30.320
machines all there it just works yeah and then I'm comfortable and I'm quick

42:30.320 --> 42:35.360
when I'm on air and my my my sort of muscle memory to use the computer I can

42:35.360 --> 42:38.760
rely on that while I'm talking so I can edit something on OBS while I'm still

42:38.760 --> 42:42.120
talking and I it it all changes when you're in a desktop environment you're

42:42.120 --> 42:47.120
not super familiar with but I think the crashing it almost it almost impacts does

42:47.120 --> 42:52.200
it hit tech snap yet oh it's you know maybe not it's almost hit every show

42:52.200 --> 42:56.480
I've done I'm sure it will at some point this same machine before it was running

42:56.480 --> 43:01.640
gnome ran for a year with I was gonna say yeah right and it's only been and

43:01.640 --> 43:04.120
these the machines that are exhibiting crashes now it's only been with the last

43:04.120 --> 43:08.080
couple of months because they too have been running gnome 3 on arch for quite a

43:08.080 --> 43:15.560
while now so anyways yeah yeah there you go I guess that's all I have I don't

43:15.560 --> 43:18.960
see oh yeah you're right beards totally right that's what I was thinking I was

43:18.960 --> 43:21.760
getting confused because it's happened on this show multiple times yeah yeah I

43:21.760 --> 43:24.720
couldn't quite but it did happen it did happen to text nap yes that's kind of a

43:24.720 --> 43:28.600
trick it's kind of a trick and it's even with systems that are pre minimal gnome

43:28.600 --> 43:33.680
shell desktops they're just kind of the stock basic stuff yeah yeah it happens I

43:33.680 --> 43:37.340
guess it happens anyways we shouldn't let it drag down the show because there

43:37.340 --> 43:39.640
is still actually a lot of really good stuff to talk about for gnome what's

43:39.640 --> 43:42.560
coming up and things like that so you can find links to all the extensions we

43:42.560 --> 43:46.560
talked about I think the the one that was sort of appealing to me a bit was

43:46.560 --> 43:49.640
g-tile for light usage but I don't actually think I'll end up using it but

43:49.640 --> 43:53.440
app folders the one we were just talking about app folders does seem like it

43:53.440 --> 43:56.280
would be a good way to go especially if you have other people using your system

43:56.280 --> 44:00.680
and if you are using get a lot the get integration stuff yeah I'm gonna give

44:00.680 --> 44:04.400
that a try just because you know I don't know how much I'll actually use it but

44:04.400 --> 44:06.960
it seems like it would be handy if I just happen to navigate into a git

44:06.960 --> 44:10.720
folder why not now I'm gonna just toss randomly a topic bomb into the mumble

44:10.720 --> 44:13.760
room there but does anybody else have like a gnome tweak or extension or

44:13.760 --> 44:17.560
setting or something that they do for their gnome desktop that makes it great

44:17.560 --> 44:20.320
and usable for them that you would want to pass along to somebody else trying

44:20.320 --> 44:23.520
out gnome for the first time I got two real quick here I get caffeine should

44:23.520 --> 44:26.560
probably be talked about caffeine is pretty useful yeah the other one that I

44:26.560 --> 44:29.480
don't have installed now but I've used in the past is like it's one that just

44:29.480 --> 44:33.360
installs a Wi-Fi refresh button it doesn't refresh when you open the list

44:33.360 --> 44:36.280
of Wi-Fi those are two great ones caffeine keeps your system awake and

44:36.280 --> 44:39.480
yeah the refresh button should just be built into gnome to refresh the Wi-Fi I

44:39.480 --> 44:43.240
thought so I thought I might be heard something the moment yeah I was just

44:43.240 --> 44:47.280
gonna say that I think auto move windows is an extension that's pretty

44:47.280 --> 44:51.360
much vital for my usage okay I've seen that one a lot what does it do it allows

44:51.360 --> 44:56.160
you to specify what applications which which workspace and a specific

44:56.160 --> 45:02.400
application goes to do you get to say where in the window or is it just go to

45:02.400 --> 45:07.280
workspace to but you don't get to say where in workspace to technically gnome

45:07.280 --> 45:12.000
remembers where you want it if you have this like the location of the pixels

45:12.000 --> 45:15.840
wise but it doesn't remember the workspace and this kind of makes it

45:15.840 --> 45:19.200
combine the two the only negative thing it doesn't have is that it doesn't if

45:19.200 --> 45:22.040
you have more than one monitor it doesn't remember the other monitor but I

45:22.040 --> 45:25.320
think there are is someone else working on a different extension for that that

45:25.320 --> 45:29.680
function okay I kind of like that when I have multiple monitors that my second

45:29.680 --> 45:34.440
monitor stays static when I switch workspaces so I'll throw slack chat

45:34.440 --> 45:38.840
telegram maybe a live stream I'm watching VLC something like that I'll

45:38.840 --> 45:43.040
throw that on my second vertical screen and then I'm switching between four

45:43.040 --> 45:47.400
virtual desktops on my main screen and the slack chats and all that stuff stay

45:47.400 --> 45:51.400
persistent across those desktops lights I can definitely you know there are use

45:51.400 --> 45:54.800
cases for both ways I think yeah oh yeah yeah yeah that's the hard part yeah

45:54.800 --> 45:58.920
because you sometimes it is nice to have a separate that's all yeah yeah there's

45:58.920 --> 46:05.640
one more it's the Maximus to extension it's a automatically removes a title

46:05.640 --> 46:11.920
bar or you know the top part of the window when you maximize hmm nice oh

46:11.920 --> 46:16.520
oh yeah okay okay make it a little tighter oh yeah so it like gives you

46:16.520 --> 46:21.080
more more real estate for your window yeah yeah okay good one anybody else in

46:21.080 --> 46:24.280
the number room have any other ideas they don't want to toss in for their

46:24.280 --> 46:29.640
perfect gnome setup chaotic has a sound input output chooser that's a good one

46:29.640 --> 46:32.640
yeah and that's really nice because you hit the menu and then right there in the

46:32.640 --> 46:36.040
drop-down menu you can choose what your output devices and that's handy it's

46:36.040 --> 46:38.720
really nice if you have like a couple of Linux systems of mine in the past when I

46:38.720 --> 46:43.040
booted up they always defaulted to the HDMI audio out and so I always had to

46:43.040 --> 46:45.440
just change that really quick and that drop-down makes that super easy now what

46:45.440 --> 46:53.240
I want yeah exactly yeah one that I find quite useful is the num lock and caps

46:53.240 --> 46:56.800
lock indicator on the top bar as well as my keyboard doesn't have that at all

46:56.800 --> 47:00.600
doesn't so yeah I got a couple of keyboards that like smaller keyboards now

47:00.600 --> 47:03.360
that I have that don't have any lights on them for what the keyboard and them

47:03.360 --> 47:07.200
like yeah so that's a good one too yeah all right and then Yuri in the chat

47:07.200 --> 47:11.000
room says that not only does he give a plus one to caffeine but the taskbar

47:11.000 --> 47:16.320
which I played with a bit oh I have not yeah it's it's kind of nice to have a

47:16.320 --> 47:20.320
taskbar so it just puts a really small taskbar of all your open windows across

47:20.320 --> 47:25.160
all your desktops and it's nice but I find myself because I've used known for

47:25.160 --> 47:30.800
so long now that I never click it I very rarely click it because if I really lose

47:30.800 --> 47:34.560
a window I just hit the activities overview and I see everything and I feel

47:34.560 --> 47:39.560
like it's it's one of those things where if you just switched from a desktop that

47:39.560 --> 47:42.600
has a taskbar you're gonna be inclined to add it and you're just gonna probably

47:42.600 --> 47:47.520
use it forever however if you sort of follow my take a balanced approach to

47:47.520 --> 47:50.320
how many extensions you have I would encourage you to just try to follow the

47:50.320 --> 47:53.840
workflow of gnome and maybe cheat by putting dash to dock on the side where

47:53.840 --> 47:57.480
you can see dots for which apps are running back in my day we learned the

47:57.480 --> 48:01.440
gnome workflow and we stuck to it you know I've said it I've said it a hundred

48:01.440 --> 48:05.800
times but you know that's what happens when you have 200 episodes the way I

48:05.800 --> 48:10.160
made gnome work for me when I first switched like back when 312 came out

48:10.160 --> 48:15.440
yeah oh those were the days yeah that was like the note 310 3.8 310 and 312

48:15.440 --> 48:19.680
were like okay no I'm starting to get no it's like where plasma has been now for

48:19.680 --> 48:24.240
like releases and after release where it's just unquestionably getting better

48:24.240 --> 48:28.360
and better and it's like features that you like every release has several

48:28.360 --> 48:33.640
features you want and I decided at that point alright I'm gonna try to make a go

48:33.640 --> 48:37.840
of this and what I'm gonna try to do is I'm gonna spend 30 days and every day

48:37.840 --> 48:42.800
I'm gonna try to do something the gnome way that I was sort of resisting and I

48:42.800 --> 48:48.600
that included trying it without maximize and minimize buttons which I decided

48:48.600 --> 48:51.320
after trying that for a couple days wasn't for me but I gave it a shot yeah

48:51.320 --> 48:55.280
but like the things I did get wrapped my head around was dropping the taskbar

48:55.280 --> 49:00.080
using the super launcher and not like installing gnome do or synaptic just

49:00.080 --> 49:03.680
like using the built-in note like using the multiple desktops embracing

49:03.680 --> 49:07.400
maximizing my screens more than I used to I used to just have tons of windows

49:07.400 --> 49:10.680
all over my screen and now I have one or two windows and then I then I switch

49:10.680 --> 49:14.480
over to another virtual desktop and using some of the snapping out aspects

49:14.480 --> 49:18.920
of gnome taking that 30-day quote-unquote challenge which was just

49:18.920 --> 49:25.560
I was personally doing for myself made my process of adopting no more of an

49:25.560 --> 49:30.560
adventure and it made tolerating the rough edges I felt at the time easier

49:30.560 --> 49:33.120
because what's only for 30 days and but then by the time I got done with it I was

49:33.120 --> 49:37.800
like oh shit oh no I'm actually working faster and better than I ever have on

49:37.800 --> 49:42.000
the Linux desktop before oh that's what they were going for and then I was a

49:42.000 --> 49:49.480
convert and it's really only been until recent stability issues and shell

49:49.480 --> 49:53.800
performance issues that I've really been and obviously the constant improvements

49:53.800 --> 49:58.800
of plasma and the great future of Qt that I've been drawn into the plasma

49:58.800 --> 50:04.560
desktop more and more but gnome shell isn't sitting still no it's certainly

50:04.560 --> 50:07.800
not I mean there's a lot of good things I think we'll both be very curious to

50:07.800 --> 50:11.360
watch this Ubuntu canonical yes we already just talked about some of the

50:11.360 --> 50:14.640
fruits of that labor already and there's other companies they're getting

50:14.640 --> 50:16.760
involved with gnome that I think are gonna make a big difference we'll talk

50:16.760 --> 50:20.240
about them here in a moment there's a big release of gnome coming up just

50:20.240 --> 50:23.200
around the corner and there's an application that I think is gonna change

50:23.200 --> 50:28.600

Gnome Shell has a big release coming and on the road to that release we're

52:04.960 --> 52:09.960
getting Gnome 3.252 it's the second milestone in the development cycle of

52:09.960 --> 52:15.200
Gnome 3.26 which is the big one and is expected to launch around September 13th

52:15.200 --> 52:18.640
the fall goes as planned now they've been doing steady improvements and

52:18.640 --> 52:21.360
there's many things we could call out I'm just gonna call out a couple of

52:21.360 --> 52:25.720
things because there's a lot that may or may not make it but what has landed is

52:25.720 --> 52:31.800
mutter 3.252 and it's a big update to mutter it fixes some performance issues

52:31.800 --> 52:35.480
not the big ones that I've outlined in user error but it fixes some especially

52:35.480 --> 52:40.880
on non Wayland builds it improves copy and paste operation between the Wayland

52:40.880 --> 52:46.120
and x11 display servers which is huge yeah and it fixes some glitches that

52:46.120 --> 52:49.680
hoping that occurred when opening windows and maximizing windows under

52:49.680 --> 52:54.080
Gnome and a few other issues that people have talked about including support for

52:54.080 --> 52:57.160
other stuff so new mutter really great super excited about the new mutter

52:57.160 --> 53:00.720
which will be landing in the new version of Gnome like I said there's gonna be

53:00.720 --> 53:03.760
other stuff in Gnome some which may make it some which may not but it looks like

53:03.760 --> 53:09.920
one that is gonna make it is a new Gnome disk utility this is great this is

53:09.920 --> 53:13.520
getting to be a fully baked application now it's available for testing if you

53:13.520 --> 53:16.360
want to try it and it's gonna bring a number of improvements under the hood

53:16.360 --> 53:20.600
and cosmetically for example it offers a more clarified meaning of the

53:20.600 --> 53:24.120
encryption settings and in mounting options well that's good yeah and it

53:24.120 --> 53:28.880
implements an intensive autoclear switch for unused loop devices it also is going

53:28.880 --> 53:32.040
to support different types of mime reading for disk so it can give you some

53:32.040 --> 53:35.280
of the names and model types and information that's on there it's gonna

53:35.280 --> 53:39.200
prompt users to stop running jobs that are running on devices before you eject

53:39.200 --> 53:43.760
them which is really nice I'm surprised and do that before actually and it will

53:43.760 --> 53:47.160
also have the ability to implicitly autoclear the handling for the lock and

53:47.160 --> 53:51.960
auto mount buttons and also will have a new app menu entry that lets users

53:51.960 --> 53:56.400
create an empty disk image adds a tooltip for the autoclear switch displays

53:56.400 --> 54:01.080
the UUID of selected volumes by default and implements hints for your pass

54:01.080 --> 54:08.440
phrase fields and removes the unused erase disk dialog this is like a usable

54:08.440 --> 54:11.760
tool now yeah I've kind of avoided it just because I'm more familiar with

54:11.760 --> 54:17.360
other tools and what not yeah exactly but hey yeah yeah it I've played around

54:17.360 --> 54:20.840
with the current version a little bit before the show and they're really

54:20.840 --> 54:24.360
they're really putting something that is confusing and difficult and they're

54:24.360 --> 54:28.360
making it easy to use they're gonna make it easier to create blank images so you

54:28.360 --> 54:31.960
can use the ad super helpful yeah you can use them for like as volumes to

54:31.960 --> 54:36.000
store stuff you know put your porn in here put your home clips in here put

54:36.000 --> 54:39.240
your documents in this one then lux encrypt them and now you have these lux

54:39.240 --> 54:43.760
encrypted volumes on your on your system that you can mount and unmount easily

54:43.760 --> 54:48.320
using gnome disk that's really neat isn't really neat so that's a gnome 3.2

54:48.320 --> 54:52.800
6 if you're a gnome user is just looking like such a solid freaking release let's

54:52.800 --> 54:57.440
talk about an app that I think is gonna help the whole gnome ecosystem yeah it's

54:57.440 --> 55:01.700
called builder and you can find out more with the link in the show notes it's an

55:01.700 --> 55:05.720
IDE for gnome that's focused on bringing the power of the gnome and GTK platform

55:05.720 --> 55:10.040
to users and developers in a way that's never really been accessible before and

55:10.040 --> 55:15.040
they're they're they're doing it in such a smart way so not only is the

55:15.040 --> 55:19.800
development just continuing along at a pretty good pace with great features but

55:19.800 --> 55:25.760
they're intelligently adding in support for new features of GTK when the timings

55:25.760 --> 55:29.680
right they've got autocompletion for some of the favorite GTK languages the

55:29.680 --> 55:35.600
things go like C C++ Python Vala rust those things that's awesome yeah so it

55:35.600 --> 55:40.480
makes creating gnome desktop applications much more possible much

55:40.480 --> 55:45.160
easier much more straightforward using a tool that's really really well supported

55:45.160 --> 55:50.000
right now by no so that's gnome builder and I think it's gonna have a big impact

55:50.000 --> 55:54.800
in the long term applications for gnome making them good like look at this this

55:54.800 --> 55:59.080
it's basic but it's really nice it's got an integrated system-wide profiler for

55:59.080 --> 56:02.600
performance along with like I remember when they launched it a couple years ago

56:02.600 --> 56:06.160
and I was like okay great that that seems neat but boy like you know now

56:06.160 --> 56:09.360
it's got performance profiling for your apps and stuff to might have to give this

56:09.360 --> 56:14.720
a shot just yeah some Python because that's and mark down yeah oh mark down

56:16.720 --> 56:23.000
and then I want to talk about a company that in some parts in some ways I should

56:23.000 --> 56:29.960
say is a little mysterious to me and I hope to know more someday but they seem

56:29.960 --> 56:34.960
to have a lot of passion around gnome and they have some funding and they're

56:34.960 --> 56:40.360
making some hires it's endless do you remember endless oh yeah yeah the

56:40.360 --> 56:43.240
creators of the endless computer with the endless operating system about this

56:43.240 --> 56:47.320
a little bit mm-hmm yeah endless OS oh look look at this

56:47.320 --> 56:50.720
way look at this we can explore we can you want to do what you want to explore

56:50.720 --> 56:54.040
let's we can explore in English let's do that let's explore in English endless OS

56:54.040 --> 56:58.480
is a free Linux based operating system that makes using a computer simpler and

56:58.480 --> 57:03.400
accessible for everyone endless OS works easily from the moment you turn it on

57:03.400 --> 57:07.600
just like a smartphone apps are open from the home screen with one simple

57:07.600 --> 57:12.800
click endless OS is designed to be useful even when you're offline quality

57:12.800 --> 57:16.120
content is always at your fingertips so you can find the information you need

57:16.120 --> 57:21.960
when you want it there's an encyclopedia with over 50,000 articles plus tens of

57:21.960 --> 57:26.440
useful information about parenting health culture and so much more there's

57:26.440 --> 57:30.640
a built-in App Center where you can access over 100 applications and add any

57:30.640 --> 57:35.560
favorites to the desktop the best part is they're all free and pre-installed

57:35.560 --> 57:41.080
endless OS is a great tool for school work or home it comes with LibreOffice

57:41.080 --> 57:45.480
completely free so you never have to pay for software licenses there's a word

57:45.480 --> 57:49.840
processor for creating documents a spreadsheet app for budgeting and an

57:49.840 --> 57:54.400
app to make clean and professional presentations you can also open and edit

57:54.400 --> 57:57.880
Microsoft Word PowerPoint and so if you're watching the video it's kind of

57:57.880 --> 58:02.640
obvious this is a gnome based desktop running on top of Linux and endless you

58:02.640 --> 58:06.240
might remember them they had like the bamboo covered ducks remember seeing

58:06.240 --> 58:10.640
those they have these endless computers they have this circular dome computer oh

58:10.640 --> 58:14.760
yeah that's right yeah this thing that kind of looks like a subwoofer almost it

58:14.760 --> 58:18.960
really and then they have mission the mission mini which is so cute yeah the

58:18.960 --> 58:22.760
little okay I want it I kind of want it yeah and this is this is for a different

58:22.760 --> 58:27.960
market than us like the mission of one is a $249 Intel NUC that's wrapped in

58:27.960 --> 58:31.640
bamboo though I mean that's that's like the most badass looking NUC ever look at

58:31.640 --> 58:39.120
run arch on that that's fine damn right so endless is doing some hires a long

58:39.120 --> 58:45.280
time canonical employee Michael Hall recently left canonical Wow and I

58:45.280 --> 58:50.320
believe has gone to endless and other individuals I probably should name have

58:50.320 --> 58:57.800
also been contracting and working with endless several actually so they seem to

58:57.800 --> 59:00.840
have some funding they seem to have some products they have a couple of deals

59:00.840 --> 59:03.280
with a couple of different stores where they're selling this I think in

59:03.280 --> 59:07.400
California in the store so you can just go into a store that's where they're

59:07.400 --> 59:12.200
based out of okay well yeah I think they have two offices right now and they are

59:12.200 --> 59:17.400
actively contributing my understanding upstream to know because they they plan

59:17.400 --> 59:21.400
to base this thing around no and they plan to use flat packs to distribute

59:21.400 --> 59:26.360
their software it could be it could be interesting because they are specifically

59:26.360 --> 59:29.600
hiring people to work on the community and to work on the code of the gnome

59:29.600 --> 59:37.000
desktop you don't often get a lot of companies that that do that for first

59:37.000 --> 59:40.440
for an end user type like you'll get companies that want to improve the ARM

59:40.440 --> 59:45.080
code or the power management but you don't all I mean not a lot these days do

59:45.080 --> 59:48.880
we get companies that want to come in and specifically make the Linux desktop

59:48.880 --> 59:54.040
better they they're trying to build computers for like the next billion

59:54.040 --> 59:59.120
people essentially so you know they bit ambitious bit ambitious they they say

59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.240
our team were small but global we were in 17 countries we have assembled a

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.740
world-class team across design software hardware and operations united one goal

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.040
to make computing available for users everywhere using Linux and gnome would

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:17.400
be a great way to do it absolutely yeah I'm I'm fast like the gnome you know it

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.600
seems like their their base is pure enough for this kind of thing like where

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.880
you can build on it and you can get something that's simple enough for

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.880
people to use especially with what we're talking about like the gnome the disk

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.520
manager things like that where we've been griping for a long time about like

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:34.440
yeah you know we don't have these features for things you've redefined

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.520
things you're building from the ground up now but maybe we're at the point

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:44.160
where what we what they have is like is it's really sound if I recall the idea

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.960
is that they're going to they're gonna deliver updates forever or something

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.320
like I can't remember why I can't remember what the endless part comes in

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.000
but yeah you could be right West I'm gonna you know what they probably say on

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.320
their website endless os.com if you guys want the endless OS comes with

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.000
everything your family needs there you have it can we get a clip of that yeah

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.760
could be right West just right there yeah it's pretty cool company and they

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:11.200
seem to be pretty involved with gnome so you you combine that now with things

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.960
like gnome builder and the path of GTK so I also thought maybe we'd talk a

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:21.440
little bit about GTK 4 which is oh coming down the road not it's not going

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.960
to be like a game changer like GTK 3 was from GTK 2 there's gonna be some things

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.480
that change right now they're at GTK 3.91 it's available that's going to

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:41.280
become GTK for the toolkit they have support for mac OS now GTK apps will be

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.520
a target mac OS probably a smart thing cuz cute can do it yeah totally and now

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.320
you can run on so now you build a run on Windows you can run GTK apps on a

01:01:48.320 --> 01:02:00.000
Mac yeah there's a lot of other work they have queued up for GTK 4 which you

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.960
can follow up in the show notes if you want but it's it's actually just want

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.880
the cocoa apps on GTK right like that you know somebody needs to do the

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.240
reverse let's get some of the Mac apps on the Linux desktop yeah I either way I

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:14.400
think it's it's the future is bright if you look at GTK 4 they seem to be where

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.360
they really have their senses about where it's going like there's there's

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.280
some improvements there's some things they're adding like some nice Vulcan

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.440
support in there yeah I mean there's some good stuff but it's not like a

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:28.520
throwing everything away and we will have forks for a decade because of the

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.000
change it's not gonna be that dramatic yeah yeah it's gonna be Rick I says I'm

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.960
sure GTK on the Mac will be just as native as it is on Windows hey at least

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.760
you can run gimp on Windows it can happen and that's all that matters

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.600
that's all that matters I've used that really actually more times than I can

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.040
count so it really does it is actually quite useful yeah and you know I think I

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:52.440
think Apple killed off their X server a while ago and so did they think so I

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.740
just remember seeing it yeah so I think without this you wouldn't have a way

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.740
because you could always do X on the Mac and then run the GTK apps but now I

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:04.080
think with this this will solve that problem so future is bright not only for

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.780
GTK and GTK 4 but the future is also bright for the gnome desktop for the

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.080
companies you're getting involved you've got such this is such a debug term but

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.240
you have quote-unquote bilateral support if I could political term we have

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.720
bilateral corporate support for the gnome desktop we've already got canonical

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.280
working on ways to improve it you got system 76 working on ways to make it

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.600
more palatable to consumers you got endless working on ways to make it more

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:29.600
palatable to the next billion computer users gotta be endless yeah and they're

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.040
and they're hiring actual people and paying them to work on this stuff gnome

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.520
4 is just around the corner it's all pretty good it's all pretty good it's

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:41.000
happening it's funny it's like what kind of dick am I for now switching away

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.200
right but you're the gnome desktop Chris where are you I know it is the year of

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.920
the gnome desktop and I'm like all right well peace out guys thanks for all the

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.740
fish and I'll be over here in plasma land trying to make it as gnome as

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:58.160
possible this is the curse that you have bestowed upon yourself oh man I mean

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.560
what are you going to do are you go wait till Ubuntu comes out in October with

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:10.280
their gnome version and hope that doesn't crash get pushed to no man they

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:15.280
go yeah we'll take that or no it's gonna go no we're fine we're not gonna do well

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:20.720
like in the case of this fractionated coconut oil high high DPI scaling they

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.400
are it's a gnome developer and a canonical employee working together in

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:28.600
the same room and canonical you know has the nice thing about that is the guy

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:31.960
shared this on Google Plus canonical has a whole bunch of high DPI monitors they

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.160
can put in the room for testing which he didn't have access to so it's not like

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.880
they're just developing it in a in a in a in a room somewhere in some white room

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.680
and they're just gonna throw the coat over the fence they actually you know

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.480
have the guy on the gnome project working on this in their office so

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.080
that's like that's a whole new level of collaboration for them it really is it I

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.480
think the future is bright there maybe maybe I'll be back sooner than later you

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.040
know cuz this like this crashing problem if this went away the performance issues

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.280
I suffer with I feel like yeah you know what I could read I could reload the

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.440
gnome shell every few days easy enough right it's easy enough it's not ideal

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:10.800
it's easy enough but the crashing that's that's where I draw the line right that's

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.680
where that impacts business mm-hmm and so if but I but I am I am confident that

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:20.960
whatever it is it will eventually get worked out if it is an Nvidia bug issue

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:27.800
if it's a if it's a gnome issue if it's a will be green again some weird USB bus

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.840
issue for all I know it's weird that also when gnome shell crashes our audio

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.280
cuts out a little bit in OBS I don't know what that's about either way our

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.600
problem to figure out no one's making good progress so this is sort of my love

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.680
song to gnome as I begin to switch away for a little while I'm sure I'll be back

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.760
one day friend but thank you for all the great times gnome shell thank you for

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:49.960
all the fun extensions and the enthusiasm and energy around gnome shell

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:55.040
is higher than ever cool great extensions are being created that weren't around a

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:59.840
year ago Joey over at OMG Ubuntu is doing great write-ups making it clear

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.720
and easy how you get this stuff that he's talking about which is one of the

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.840
things Joey really excels at is he's like here's the thing that's really

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:10.160
great here's a few screenshots of it and oh by the way if you're on one of these

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:15.000
distros this is how you get it I love that I tried to do that too we have

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:18.020
links to everything we talked about in the show notes it is going to be the

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:23.120
note the year of gnome it really is so don't take my switching away as a sign

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:28.080
that it's it's going away and I'm condemning it I'll be back I'll be back

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:35.120
in the meantime I heard plasma 5.10 hurt hit the arch repo stable today oh boy

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.320
so all they got to do is go upstairs and update my system and I got plasma time

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.800
for Chris tries a tiling window manager all over oh don't start that again I

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.880
want to see this time on Wayland what about plasma desktop and window rules

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.120
maybe that'll just do what I want where it puts everything where I want I don't

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.560
know maybe I'm dreaming let me know linux unplug dot reddit.com don't forget

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.640
the barbecue is official meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting if you can

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.600
make it telegram group bit.ly slash JB telegram join us live Jupiter

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:31.280
broadcasting.com slash calendar. Wes say goodbye. Goodbye.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:43.840
okay producer Michael did you leave or are you gonna can you break me the bad

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.200
news am I am I gonna be screwed with my dreams and hopes for plasma window rules

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:55.480
no that'll do it that'll do what I want good it's awesome okay good I think I

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.240
when I read your comment the chairman was like oh that might not be a good way

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:04.480
to go I said I was saying I do this okay awesome so like oh good good good window

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:11.440
rules is it's it's more complicated to set up but it is awesome so it's

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.560
actually you have to you have to set up individually so you set the window

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.600
however you want it and then you apply a window rule and then what the best part

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.920
about is that once you set it to however you want like regular just movement

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.200
moving around and stuff it's detecting what the current settings are so if you

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.920
try to just make a window rule in the system settings it's a pain in the butt

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.200
but if you do it from right clicking a title bar it'll give you an option is

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:38.200
like oh okay just activate this and whatever you currently have it will use

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.500
that setting okay so it's actually not that hard to do if you know what to do

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.920
in the right order okay but the other part is that plasma has built-in tiling

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.600
essentially it doesn't have the automatic you know it's gonna tile it

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.480
based on what people expect tiling window managers to do okay but it has

01:08:56.480 --> 01:09:01.560
these shortcuts where you can do you know horizontal top and bottom the site

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.120
left left and right like people you know are used to it also does quarter tiling

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:13.320
so you know the bottom right tiling okay but none of that is none of that has a

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:18.740
shortcut by default the functionality is in the system it is there you have to

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:22.120
manually go and put what shortcuts you want that I've run into that before and

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:26.520
been confused trying to get those shortcuts right yeah what I do is with

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.480
my keyboard the it's perfect because the you know that the insert home page up

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:42.080
that little set of six things cluster I have I have a super plus the top left

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.440
like the insert key is top left of the screen tiling and then you know etc for

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:51.960
the rest of them and home and end or like horizontal tiling hmm it's like

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.000
what I do is set it up I want to can keep it however it is I just set it I

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.640
just use the shortcut puts it where I want and then use window rules to

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.200
remember it okay that sounds actually pretty maybe we need like a plasma 101

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.160
yeah I may if I end up switching to a few yeah I'm actually working on doing

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:18.680
that all right my idea is to like kind of how to use plasma and avoid the you

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.040
know the headaches of not understanding well how to use everything yeah cuz

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.200
like I've got the gnome thing down like I can stall gnome a couple extensions oh

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:42.760
yeah it's there but I don't have I would like to get there in plasma too
