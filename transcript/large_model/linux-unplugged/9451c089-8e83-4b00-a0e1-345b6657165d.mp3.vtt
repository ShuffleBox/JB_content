This is Linux Unplugged, episode 17 for December 3rd, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.520
Hi everyone, and hello planet Earth! Your weekly Linux talk show welcomes you to the

00:40.520 --> 00:45.080
closing act of 2013, pour yourself a cold one, and join us around the penguin-shaped

00:45.080 --> 00:50.120
table. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey Matt, here we are, episode 17, it's the

00:50.120 --> 00:55.000
final hours of 2013, and it's been a big year, Matt. Oh, it's been huge. I guess this

00:55.000 --> 00:58.040
is supposed to be the year of Steam, but now that we're coming to an end, the only thing

00:58.040 --> 01:02.520
I can think about is Bitcoin. Oddly enough, yeah, I can understand. Yeah, well, yeah,

01:02.520 --> 01:08.120
recently Bitcoin has been sitting above $1,000 right now on Bitstamp, which is where you

01:08.120 --> 01:13.040
could actually cash out today if you wanted to. The price is $10.45. Other exchanges have

01:13.040 --> 01:17.240
it higher. Those exchanges are full of crap, and I think it's interesting because I have

01:17.240 --> 01:20.760
to hold myself back. I don't want to talk about it in the Linux Unplugged show, Matt.

01:20.760 --> 01:25.360
That's all I'm thinking about. Oh yeah? Alright, so you know this week, Matt, I had a grab

01:25.360 --> 01:31.080
bag called a Dev Random, because I'm funny like that, and I had several topics I wanted

01:31.080 --> 01:35.760
to dig into, sort of suss out, and I wanted to start with some of our follow-up this week,

01:35.760 --> 01:41.840
but before we get into that follow-up, I wanted to ask you, have you opened the boxes yet,

01:41.840 --> 01:45.840
Matt? I have. I did my, usually when I get a review item, and this is something I've

01:45.840 --> 01:48.960
done for probably over 10 years, is I get a review item, I pop it out of the box, I

01:48.960 --> 01:53.040
plug it in, make sure everything's working, looks good, drool for a while, then I cry

01:53.040 --> 01:57.880
myself to sleep when I put it back in the box. Yesterday, Matt got three boxes from

01:57.880 --> 02:03.560
System76 on his doorstep. You got the Leopard Extreme in there, and you got two laptops.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.880
You got the new Kudu laptop and their Ultra Pro laptop. Can't wait to try those things

02:07.880 --> 02:12.880
out. Oh, they're just gorgeous, gorgeous machines. Is the Leopard Extreme heavy? What's it look

02:12.880 --> 02:17.320
like, Matt? Is it nice? I remember carrying it in the last time, and yeah, it has some

02:17.320 --> 02:21.520
weight to it. That is solid hardware. You're going to be shown up on Sunday with a car

02:21.520 --> 02:25.120
full of gear. That's going to be awesome. Can't wait to try that out. And we even got

02:25.120 --> 02:28.180
a little bit of extra time to try these things out. I'm going to be banging on the Leopard

02:28.180 --> 02:31.560
Extreme for like a week solid, so we'll have like an extended report on how that thing

02:31.560 --> 02:37.800
performs on the big show. Well, speaking of the big show, so this week I want to talk

02:37.800 --> 02:44.200
about Sailfish OS and the YoloPhone as sort of a follow-up. I don't know how many of you

02:44.200 --> 02:47.440
out there, if any of you out there listen to Unplugged and don't listen to the Linux

02:47.440 --> 02:52.520
Action Show, you're a crazy son of a bitch if you do that. What's the matter with you?

02:52.520 --> 02:56.520
But one of the things that happened, the biggest thing that happened, we talked about Mint

02:56.520 --> 03:01.760
16, mate and cinnamon edition, of the latest release from the Linux Mint project. You would

03:01.760 --> 03:07.160
think that would be the thing that dominates the dialogue from the Linux Action Show audience.

03:07.160 --> 03:14.480
No. No, pretty much everybody was talking about our coverage of YoloOS, or the YoloPhone

03:14.480 --> 03:20.880
and Sailfish OS, and so Kyle wrote in to the Linux Action Show, and I broke into the Linux

03:20.880 --> 03:26.520
Action Show's house, I ripped open their little sack they have hanging on their refrigerator

03:26.520 --> 03:30.960
that holds the Linux Action Show feedback, and I stole it for this show, and so we're

03:30.960 --> 03:34.280
going to read Kyle's email, even though it was directed to the Linux Action Show, we're

03:34.280 --> 03:39.120
going to break all the rules and tie the knots together and cover it here. He writes, Hi

03:39.120 --> 03:43.560
Chris, I'm sure you got more than a few of these emails this week, but hear me out. I

03:43.560 --> 03:47.440
was interested to hear what you and Matt might have had to say about Yolo's launch of their

03:47.440 --> 03:51.780
new phone and OS on this week's show, and I was disappointed to see you dismiss it out

03:51.780 --> 03:56.680
of hand. You spent numerous segments and even a whole Linux Unplugged and Koda Radio talking

03:56.680 --> 04:01.760
about Canonical's dismal mobile efforts, and when similar small groups of devs not

04:01.760 --> 04:08.280
only creates a 1.0 version of their Linux-based OS, but actually ships it on non-vaporware

04:08.280 --> 04:12.720
phone, you blow it off like it's no big deal and don't even bother to research some basic

04:12.720 --> 04:18.560
facts about it. Sailfish OS does run Android apps. In fact, he linked us to some demos

04:18.560 --> 04:24.120
online that show that, and it will run on Android hardware in the future. This is actually

04:24.120 --> 04:28.840
one of their main strategies for expansion into China. The device has only been out for

04:28.840 --> 04:32.740
a few days, and already community members have got Google Play Store support up and

04:32.740 --> 04:36.800
running on it. This is exciting and just the sort of thing to expect from an enthusiastic

04:36.800 --> 04:42.280
Linux community. In fact, smacks the table, Yolo's efforts to provide open source compatibility

04:42.280 --> 04:46.400
for Android hardware helped out Ubuntu Mobile's efforts and represent a real contribution

04:46.400 --> 04:50.700
to the open source community. Furthermore, the MakePlay Live project you got so excited

04:50.700 --> 04:58.200
about is using Mer, which Sailfish OS is also based on, and which Jala is dedicated to supporting

04:58.200 --> 05:03.080
in a similar way to how the Linux kernel gets contributions. There was a developer-oriented

05:03.080 --> 05:08.880
talk by one of the Jala devs on a subreddit a while back that outlined how Sailfish OS

05:08.880 --> 05:12.760
is just one aspect of their broader plans for Mer, which sounds very exciting in terms

05:12.760 --> 05:17.480
of spreading Linux adoption through devices like the improv. Sorry if I came across as

05:17.480 --> 05:23.680
a bit of a fanboy that Matt's always telling to settle down. I know you've probably been

05:23.680 --> 05:27.720
in damage control since Amazon dropped their bomb on you, and you haven't had much time

05:27.720 --> 05:31.880
to research the topic, but I think you might want to give Jala's a second look. At the

05:31.880 --> 05:36.320
very least, I hope you review Sailfish OS once it hits the Nexus 5. On another note,

05:36.320 --> 05:38.960
I can't afford to buy a new t-shirt with the cost of the international shipping, but

05:38.960 --> 05:42.520
I will start a subscription on filter next week. I hope you get over the financial problems

05:42.520 --> 05:46.960
on Amazon that they've dumped on you and continue making great content for the community.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.720
Thanks, best, Kyle. So interesting points, Matt. What are your thoughts?

05:50.720 --> 05:55.440
So here's the deal. We never said, and it's interesting how if you're not really enthusiastic

05:55.440 --> 05:59.360
in a positive way, you're automatically negative. There can never be a gray area, and I noticed

05:59.360 --> 06:03.600
that, because that's not what happened. What actually did happen is that, as he pointed

06:03.600 --> 06:07.600
out, it's very early on, so at this moment in time, until I have something in front of

06:07.600 --> 06:12.760
me that I can really hold on to, like say, I don't know, a Firefox OS, that I can actually

06:12.760 --> 06:16.480
have an opinion on, we're at a meh moment right now, because there's nothing to really

06:16.480 --> 06:22.680
judge. It sounds cool, but Firefox OS actually addresses a specific need. It brings low-end

06:22.680 --> 06:27.640
smartphones, accessible smartphones to people that might not otherwise be in the Android

06:27.640 --> 06:28.640
market.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.840
If I understand the other side of this argument, what their point is, here's what they would

06:32.840 --> 06:37.880
say to that. They would say, hey, dude, look, Sailfish OS is coming from the folks that

06:37.880 --> 06:42.560
made me go, Nokia, we've got industry ties, we've got a proven track record, we've got

06:42.560 --> 06:49.160
a community that's already built, we are here, we are the proven recipe, and we've just shipped,

06:49.160 --> 06:51.720
and meanwhile, you're talking about Firefox OS and Ubuntu Touch.

06:51.720 --> 06:56.200
I'm talking about something I can install on a phone and see right now. Now, again,

06:56.200 --> 07:00.880
I've not researched this heavily, so if I can do that today, I'm excited. If I can't,

07:00.880 --> 07:03.080
I will be excited tomorrow.

07:03.080 --> 07:06.720
When Kyle says, yo, dawg, you're going to be able to install it on Nexus 5, I think

07:06.720 --> 07:12.720
to myself, actually, that's when it crosses the line from interesting concept to practical

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
product.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.720
Bingo.

07:14.720 --> 07:19.400
It might be a limitation in just the fact that there's a lot of things to focus on these

07:19.400 --> 07:26.680
days. Unless you can actually play with it, it just maybe doesn't spark that interest

07:26.680 --> 07:32.240
internally. But I go back to that I think my senses from the Linux action show audience

07:32.240 --> 07:37.800
and the Linux unplugged audience is there's just straight up mobile exhaustion.

07:37.800 --> 07:45.080
Android didn't just kind of pull ahead, Android dominated everybody in a major way.

07:45.080 --> 07:48.200
And not necessarily in a positive way, it just kind of happened. It's kind of like when

07:48.200 --> 07:50.800
you spill something all over your keyboard, it's there.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.800
You know what I mean?

07:51.800 --> 07:55.760
It makes the deployment and the adoption rate of Windows look quaint.

07:55.760 --> 07:56.760
Oh, yeah.

07:56.760 --> 08:03.840
And so I think in that shadow, it's hard to conjure up any genuine excitement because

08:03.840 --> 08:10.080
it just seems like, it honestly seems like cavemen going up against the United States

08:10.080 --> 08:11.080
government.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.840
Oh, I wouldn't go that far. I think that once we, again, going back to, as you pointed

08:14.840 --> 08:18.640
out, once we have something tangible in our hands, I can experience the performance of

08:18.640 --> 08:22.800
those Android apps running on this. I can experience the flow of the phone, then I can

08:22.800 --> 08:26.280
make an educated judgment based on that experience, but we're not there yet.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.280
I guess.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.280
He's asking me to be excited about nothing.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.280
Okay.

08:29.280 --> 08:34.680
But okay, let's say six months down the road, I can buy a Nexus 5 and guaranteed I hook

08:34.680 --> 08:39.440
it up to the USB port of my computer, I flip a few buttons and I can install Sailfish OS

08:39.440 --> 08:40.440
on it.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.440
Sure.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.200
I'm still probably not going to do it. I mean, I might do it in the sense of try it out,

08:45.200 --> 08:49.600
give it my, you know, give it a go, try it for a couple of weeks, but the reality is

08:49.600 --> 08:53.000
I want applications that are on Android.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.880
I want, if I'm going to have a mobile device, I want badass mapping. I want Waze, right?

08:59.880 --> 09:04.400
I want to have all of these things that are just now come to be expected on a mobile device.

09:04.400 --> 09:10.920
I want Netflix on a mobile device. For that 15 minutes where, you know, we have to wait

09:10.920 --> 09:14.760
for something and I, oh my God, I got to do something to occupy my two kids who are running

09:14.760 --> 09:20.600
around like crazy, let's put SpongeBob on the phone for 15 minutes and it gives me a better

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
piece of mind.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.920
I want that on my mobile device. Can they offer that? I don't think so. And if they

09:24.920 --> 09:25.920
can, how long do they can?

09:25.920 --> 09:28.720
But do we know? But do we know yet? I mean, that's just it. I mean, and I'm not defending

09:28.720 --> 09:32.420
the email, but I'm just saying, I honestly don't know. I mean, perhaps, possibly, maybe

09:32.420 --> 09:35.960
it addresses something in a fashion we haven't experienced yet. If it does, that's cool.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.560
But yeah, I mean, for myself, I just, because I think those are valid points, but I think

09:39.560 --> 09:45.280
at the end of the day, until it's in my hands, in my universe, in my world, it's theory.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.200
That doesn't mean it's theory for the developer, it just means for the end user it is.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.640
Here's what they have to do. They have to make it good enough. And I think they're actually,

09:51.640 --> 09:55.320
I think this is why people are really excited about Yala and Sailfish OS is I think they

09:55.320 --> 09:59.360
are on the verge, like out of the gate, out of all the projects out of the gate. Because

09:59.360 --> 10:04.360
Ubuntu Touch has a bunch of phony icons that don't do anything and they're relying on their

10:04.360 --> 10:07.360
community who-

10:07.360 --> 10:08.360
Doesn't really care.

10:08.360 --> 10:14.280
Right, to make core functions of their operating system, right? So Yala comes along and they

10:14.280 --> 10:19.440
have Sailfish OS and it's a 1.0. It's a straight up respectable 1.0. And they're like, and

10:19.440 --> 10:23.460
I think these people are like, hey, you assholes, this is almost getting good enough. And I'm

10:23.460 --> 10:29.560
not saying you have to replace Android one to one for somebody like me to switch, because

10:29.560 --> 10:35.360
I will jump when it's, when it's all they got to do is I just got to change a few habits.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.360
You know, I got to, I mean, I got to twist my arm a little bit, but man, I'll switch

10:38.360 --> 10:43.560
to get off of Android. I, Android's doable, but I, you guys, I've documented the copious

10:43.560 --> 10:45.040
amount of problems I had with Android.

10:45.040 --> 10:49.400
Well, and see, that's just it. And I'm holding out hope and I would love to see this. I would

10:49.400 --> 10:53.300
love to see it to where it provides me the same seamless experience, potentially even

10:53.300 --> 10:58.360
a better experience than what Android does. And that includes, not only it runs Android

10:58.360 --> 11:03.280
apps, but if it runs them at native speeds, performance, feel, I don't want to feel like

11:03.280 --> 11:06.880
I'm running wine or something. I want it to feel good. If it does that, it very well may,

11:06.880 --> 11:11.640
I don't know if it does, that's awesome. But until I see it, I have no opinion because

11:11.640 --> 11:13.220
I can't judge it, you know?

11:13.220 --> 11:17.680
So we, we, I want to, I want to make sure I may, I stress that I do believe we need

11:17.680 --> 11:22.360
something like this. So I got the Nexus five. It's an amazing piece of hardware. It really

11:22.360 --> 11:28.880
is great, but it, there's a creepy factor to every time I get a new Android device more

11:28.880 --> 11:34.420
and more is a proprietary, it's closed up. Like now the photo management application

11:34.420 --> 11:39.320
that shipped with the Nexus five is, is, is Google plus photos. Your, your, your photo

11:39.320 --> 11:44.560
gallery is now integrated in with Google plus and they've deprecated the original gallery

11:44.560 --> 11:48.920
app, right? And it's just abandoned where it's just totally abandoned. It totally sucks.

11:48.920 --> 11:54.960
And so I, as, as somebody who is cognizant of these types of deficiencies, this bothers

11:54.960 --> 11:59.040
me and it makes me want to switch. I don't think it ever make Joe user want to switch.

11:59.040 --> 12:03.920
And this is where, this is where the fundamental lack of enthusiasm comes from for me is how

12:03.920 --> 12:10.240
can I get excited about something that 70% of our audience will likely never use?

12:10.240 --> 12:13.800
The same could be said for desktop Linux five years ago though. And so I would say that,

12:13.800 --> 12:16.680
you know, that, that was the argument of, well, it's just a hobby operating system.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.600
When obviously it's not, it's, it's a very core experience for a number of people, myself

12:20.600 --> 12:25.000
included, yourself included. So I, I'm going to be, I'm going to go out on the optimistic

12:25.000 --> 12:29.120
level of if it can in fact provide me with what I'm looking for, I will be its biggest

12:29.120 --> 12:31.160
advocate. If it doesn't, I won't care.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.120
So you're in a wait and see approach.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.120
I'm a wait and see guy. Yeah. I'm very, and I look at that. It's like, I don't get too

12:36.120 --> 12:39.920
bent into licensing. I prefer open source licensing, but I don't, it's not a lifestyle

12:39.920 --> 12:43.600
for me. I'm not a developer. I just, I have a preference, but I'm not married to it.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.320
Right. You have more security in products that use an open source license.

12:47.320 --> 12:51.880
Right. Absolutely. I would prefer that. Absolutely. Hands down. We'll even take a hit on, you

12:51.880 --> 12:54.960
know, user experience to a degree within reason.

12:54.960 --> 12:55.960
Yeah.

12:55.960 --> 12:56.960
Certainly.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
Or the amount of hoops you might have to jump.

12:57.960 --> 12:58.960
Oh yeah.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.200
Yeah. I, that's where I fall down too. And I will see, we'll see, you know, all companies

13:03.200 --> 13:07.880
go through their rockstar moment and then they fade and, and, and maybe as that happens

13:07.880 --> 13:12.360
to Google, Android, more and more people look for alternatives. And, and by that point,

13:12.360 --> 13:15.960
these operating systems and these devices will be at a stage where they've had enough

13:15.960 --> 13:20.040
to R and D and development and progress for that. They're ready to pick up that slack

13:20.040 --> 13:25.620
and that would be amazing. So, you know, as, as sailfish OS comes out for other, for other

13:25.620 --> 13:29.400
devices that I can get my hands on, I'm totally going to check it out. I'm keeping my mind

13:29.400 --> 13:36.560
open, but I'll be honest. Um, I couldn't, I couldn't push myself to research the Yala

13:36.560 --> 13:40.440
announcement enough to like know it in and out. Like I researched it enough to know what

13:40.440 --> 13:44.960
the important moments were and, and, and highlight some of those important stories in the show

13:44.960 --> 13:48.760
notes. So folks wanted to go look in the show notes of last week's last, they could go get

13:48.760 --> 13:54.600
that info. However, you know, myself, I was like, I, I more like wanted to cover it in

13:54.600 --> 14:00.320
the show just to document the important moment for the, for the project itself and not much

14:00.320 --> 14:03.120
more than that. And, and that really seemed to bother people.

14:03.120 --> 14:09.840
Well, and they, it's comical because again, it's, we're victims of a, you know, we as

14:09.840 --> 14:13.520
the Linux community tend to, we're almost religious about things and sometimes that's

14:13.520 --> 14:18.600
not okay. I'm going to be brutally honest. It's, it's stupid. It's really annoying.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.480
And quite frankly, it's, it's a real turnoff to people that aren't Linux people. I'm

14:22.480 --> 14:26.520
calloused enough to where I, it's fine. Whatever. But, but regular people are looking at this

14:26.520 --> 14:30.640
thinking, wow, you people are nuts. So, I mean, you know, for me, I need something tangible.

14:30.640 --> 14:34.600
I'm about a user experiences and that includes the benefits of the open source licensing

14:34.600 --> 14:38.200
because there are, there are tangible benefits to that. So, I mean, I put that in the same

14:38.200 --> 14:42.160
bucket, but a great analogy is looking at the difference between the steam box. We're

14:42.160 --> 14:46.040
all really excited about that. You ask my 17 year old nephew what he's excited about

14:46.040 --> 14:50.760
who was really excited about steam box last week until he saw a trailer for kill zone

14:50.760 --> 14:54.440
for the PlayStation four. Right. He couldn't give a rat's butt about the box anymore because

14:54.440 --> 14:58.760
something visually tangible is in front of them that he'd be like, Ooh, drool. And that's

14:58.760 --> 15:02.000
what Androids got over these other operating systems. So I think we're going to have to

15:02.000 --> 15:06.840
overcome that. Yeah. So yeah. Good point. All right. Well, so Kyle, when he wrote in

15:06.840 --> 15:11.520
mentioned the the shirt drive with the problems we've been having with Amazon. So I got a

15:11.520 --> 15:15.800
little update. We had a lot of people say, Hey guys, love the shirt. Don't want a long

15:15.800 --> 15:20.200
sleeve t-shirt. I want a hoodie. So we added a hoodie. So if you go to teespring.com slash

15:20.200 --> 15:25.120
Jupiter 2014, you can grab a hoodie. This is helping us get to our 2014 goal or at least

15:25.120 --> 15:29.000
helping us get through 2013. This is a logo we'll be rolling out in 2014. So now we got

15:29.000 --> 15:33.920
a hoodie available. We've got a woman's tee. Also, if you want to get one for your lady

15:33.920 --> 15:38.000
or maybe that's all in the same, same, same addresses before just in the pull down or

15:38.000 --> 15:43.760
pull down. And now it all goes towards to go all 319 out of 499. That's a great there.

15:43.760 --> 15:47.320
Oh, it just went up to 319. Do you see change? You know what? You know what? I'll tell you

15:47.320 --> 15:51.200
something, Matt. I'll tell you something. The bulk of that is the Linux action show

15:51.200 --> 15:55.320
audience. Now there's a good mix of Coder radio in there too. Sure. But the bulk of

15:55.320 --> 16:01.120
it is is a Linux unplugged and Linux action show audience that have right here alone have

16:01.120 --> 16:07.440
almost got us to 320 shirts. I'd love to see that flip over to 320, 325 during the show

16:07.440 --> 16:13.880
the goal here is is we have we have commissioned a new logo for the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

16:13.880 --> 16:18.480
We were planning to roll this out in about March of 2014. Yeah, you know, it's one of

16:18.480 --> 16:22.720
those things like we're really proud of ourselves because like we were working like way ahead

16:22.720 --> 16:26.440
of the game. Like we had secrets we were going to roll out in months. And I was like, yeah,

16:26.440 --> 16:32.600
this is awesome. We're just like we're ruling. And then we had a falling out with Amazon

16:32.600 --> 16:37.600
and the way that a lot of people contribute and support our network was removed. Now what

16:37.600 --> 16:41.640
we're trying to do is close that financial gap. I sold some Bitcoin so that way we can

16:41.640 --> 16:45.600
stay we can keep the lights on. But we are definitely still hurting. And this shirt we've

16:45.600 --> 16:49.640
launched over at Teespring.com slash Jupiter 14. This is an effort for us to continue to

16:49.640 --> 16:53.600
fund the network through the remainder of 2013. And also, oops, hi there to get you

16:53.600 --> 16:57.320
guys a little bit of swag. So that way you got yourself something. Maybe you want to

16:57.320 --> 17:01.440
give it up for the holidays or something like that. And that new logo is so gorgeous. Display

17:01.440 --> 17:02.920
it, right? Just display it.

17:02.920 --> 17:03.920
No, totally.

17:03.920 --> 17:09.160
So based on your popular demand, we now have a hoodie. How awesome is that?

17:09.160 --> 17:13.120
That is fantastic. No, it's definitely been very popular. And I think it makes sense.

17:13.120 --> 17:19.140
I think people see the value in not only participating in the program itself by helping to support

17:19.140 --> 17:23.600
it through buying this, but I think they also value the fact that, hey, I get to represent.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
Yeah, dude.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
Yeah.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.520
You know what? That new logo looks good on black like that.

17:27.520 --> 17:30.760
Oh, it looks excellent. It pops like crazy. It's awesome.

17:30.760 --> 17:37.520
So thank you, everybody who has already picked up a shirt. And if you haven't gotten one

17:37.520 --> 17:43.000
yet, go to teespring.com slash Jupiter 2014. We're trying to get to 500 shirts. We're not

17:43.000 --> 17:49.760
there yet. And if we don't get to 500 shirts, none of them will ship. You won't get charged.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.440
Don't worry. You won't get billed. But none of them will ship. So hopefully we can. And

17:53.440 --> 17:56.680
that'll help us fund the remainder of the year. And thank you, everybody.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
All right, man.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.800
Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning, too. A lot of people have the mindset of,

18:00.800 --> 18:05.400
well, I might do it later, but someone undoubtedly will buy it. Every single purchase helps make

18:05.400 --> 18:07.400
this happen. So definitely jump on.

18:07.400 --> 18:12.280
We have an email. So there's a few recurring topics that we've talked about. Like on Tech

18:12.280 --> 18:16.920
Snap, one of them is drive fragmentation. On this show, it's the whole philosophy of

18:16.920 --> 18:20.720
to swap or not to swap. I've got an email about that that I want to touch on here in

18:20.720 --> 18:24.840
just a second. But first, we should probably thank our first sponsor of The Unplugged Show.

18:24.840 --> 18:29.640
And that, my friends, is Ting. Ting is mobile that makes sense. My mobile service provider

18:29.640 --> 18:34.680
and Matt's mobile service provider, and they freaking rock. So Ting, what's great about

18:34.680 --> 18:39.920
them? No contracts, no early termination fees, and pay for what you use. Pay for what you

18:39.920 --> 18:45.960
use. Messages, megabytes, minutes, they all get added up at the end of the month. Whatever

18:45.960 --> 18:50.020
you just use, that's what you pay for. Flat dollars, six months per line, and just whatever

18:50.020 --> 18:53.560
you need on top of that. That's great if you sometimes use the phone, sometimes you don't

18:53.560 --> 18:59.480
use the phone. And every Ting service includes hotspot and tethering, caller ID, voicemail,

18:59.480 --> 19:03.400
and their amazing Ting dashboard. But something that was pointed out to me in the Linux Action

19:03.400 --> 19:08.720
Show subreddit this week that we don't mention is Ting also doesn't have roaming charges.

19:08.720 --> 19:13.000
There's no additional charges for voice roaming within the US as long as you have a CDMA signal,

19:13.000 --> 19:17.720
you should be fine. The Ting network has agreements in place with Verizon that allows you to just

19:17.720 --> 19:22.000
roam over to the Verizon network and use that service, and you don't get dinged for it.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.600
It's one of the really nice little perks among the many other things with Ting. Now, of course,

19:26.600 --> 19:33.320
the average Ting bill is around $33 per month. Think about that. $33 per month is the average

19:33.320 --> 19:39.280
Ting bill, and that's your smartphone with data, text messaging, all of that contract

19:39.280 --> 19:43.760
free with no early termination fees. Now, I just got my Nexus 5 on the Ting network.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.760
Ting has a bunch of really great devices at all ranges of prices. Right now, if you go

19:47.760 --> 19:54.520
to linux.ting.com, that's right, linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first month of service

19:54.520 --> 19:58.600
if you already have a Sprint compatible device. If you don't have a Sprint compatible device,

19:58.600 --> 20:04.440
they'll give you $25 off your first device. When you buy this device, you own this device.

20:04.440 --> 20:09.120
They're not leasing it to you on like a house on a mortgage where you pay into it every

20:09.120 --> 20:13.640
single month and after two years, you now own a completely out of date smartphone. No,

20:13.640 --> 20:19.880
like a computer, when you buy it, you own it. As an active consumer, as people out there

20:19.880 --> 20:23.840
who are aware of the differences in that kind of setup, this is something I think we can

20:23.840 --> 20:28.360
all elect to be involved in is let's change the dynamic of the mobile market because it's

20:28.360 --> 20:33.040
obvious the mobile devices, even if you don't think they're that hot, are going to play

20:33.040 --> 20:37.960
a huge role in the computing platform going forward. The problem is the cards are stacked

20:37.960 --> 20:42.520
against us right now. Ting is changing all of that and they're doing it in a very dynamic

20:42.520 --> 20:45.960
way. It's starting with no contract, starting with no early termination fees and starting

20:45.960 --> 20:50.400
with the fact that you own your phone and then they price it at a rate that is absolutely

20:50.400 --> 20:53.880
reasonable and not only that, but if you're in a contract right now and you want to get

20:53.880 --> 20:59.240
out of that contract, Ting has an early termination relief program where they will pay up to $75

20:59.240 --> 21:03.160
per line that you need to cancel. That's huge people because you can start saving right

21:03.160 --> 21:08.240
now if you switch to Ting and you can get started by going to linux.ting.com. Man, I

21:08.240 --> 21:12.600
love Ting. I've been using them for a while and as a long time customer now, I've got

21:12.600 --> 21:17.680
to tell you, that dashboard, that dashboard, Matt, it's like nothing anybody else has.

21:17.680 --> 21:23.200
I know that as a Ting customer, when you signed up, when I handed that note to you and said,

21:23.200 --> 21:26.520
Matt, have at it, tell me what you think, that dashboard was it, wasn't it? That was

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
awesome.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.920
It was really the big point for me and I still use it frequently because there are times

21:29.920 --> 21:33.760
to where if I'm not going to be using the phone for a while or maybe I just don't need

21:33.760 --> 21:36.960
any, I know I'm not going to be getting any important calls, I'll literally just go ahead

21:36.960 --> 21:40.920
and toggle it off. I can keep the phone calls from coming in completely by using the dashboard.

21:40.920 --> 21:47.360
This is a great point. So as you know, back when I was in IT, I would have several different

21:47.360 --> 21:57.040
Blackberry devices and one Windows mobile device and I never used the Windows mobile

21:57.040 --> 22:01.600
device. I was down with Blackberry, man. I was a Blackberry guy. But I only needed one,

22:01.600 --> 22:06.640
right? But the company I worked for, they had to pay for all three lines all the time,

22:06.640 --> 22:10.560
every single month. And then when like another tech needed to try something out for their

22:10.560 --> 22:15.280
client, there's no transferring. Like unless you want to call the Verizon rep and ask them

22:15.280 --> 22:18.560
after you explain to them what it is you're even trying to do, Ting does it all through

22:18.560 --> 22:22.660
their dashboard with a couple of clicks unless you get right back to work. It's so awesome.

22:22.660 --> 22:26.280
So we'll get started by linux.ting.com. And by the way, you need to order your device

22:26.280 --> 22:31.400
by December 13th if you just want to get FedEx Ground or December 19th for FedEx Express

22:31.400 --> 22:35.220
in order to guarantee delivery by December 23rd. So if you're giving somebody the gift

22:35.220 --> 22:39.160
of Ting for the holidays, get your order in before December 13th for the cheap shipping

22:39.160 --> 22:45.280
or December 19th for the express shipping to get that guaranteed by December 23rd. So

22:45.280 --> 22:51.920
a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Love those guys. Okay, Matt. So

22:51.920 --> 22:56.560
I want to cover this email that came in from Bab because it's a topic that we talk about

22:56.560 --> 23:02.280
a lot. No, it's all good. Oh, it's good. It's good. I thought where this is going. I'm about

23:02.280 --> 23:06.760
to get... Actually, I think we do have one of those at the end of the show. Oh, no. We

23:06.760 --> 23:10.040
have to have at least one because otherwise, what's the point? I tell you what, we got

23:10.040 --> 23:13.760
one that's going to get people really fired up next. Yeah. Okay, but this one comes in

23:13.760 --> 23:17.840
from Bob. It's safe territory. We're not going to get anybody too upset. He says, hi, guys.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.400
Just a quick note. Chris mused that maybe the day is near that you could run with a

23:21.400 --> 23:26.760
machine without a swap partition. Well, this intrigued me. And for the last year, I've

23:26.760 --> 23:32.360
been running my 8 gigabyte laptop with no swap partition and have not noticed any issues

23:32.360 --> 23:36.920
even when giving it a pretty thorough workout. In fact, it worked so well that I honestly

23:36.920 --> 23:40.760
forgot about it. One thing that had bugged me though was that the Hibernate hasn't been

23:40.760 --> 23:44.780
an option on Ubuntu for me. I just assumed it was a config issue or the hardware not

23:44.780 --> 23:50.260
being supported. I found out I could run pm-hibernate command, but it would just simply not Hibernate.

23:50.260 --> 23:54.680
My frustration boiled over today and I went digging for clues. It looks like it may just

23:54.680 --> 23:59.920
simply be a case that a swap partition is required for Hibernate to work as where the

23:59.920 --> 24:05.600
memory image is written out before the machine shuts down. I goled, that's groaned out loud,

24:05.600 --> 24:09.920
when I found this out. I cannot yet confirm this is an issue, but I thought I'd share

24:09.920 --> 24:15.120
experiences for the benefit of all. Bab. Yeah, that is true. That is true. Interesting. That

24:15.120 --> 24:22.360
is the downside to running without swap. All my machines have swap right now. Do you do

24:22.360 --> 24:28.680
swap partitions still? I do. Honestly, it's just a legacy habit. It's almost like building

24:28.680 --> 24:32.200
machines and putting a floppy drive in it. You do something out of habit. It's like,

24:32.200 --> 24:35.960
why the hell am I putting this thing in here? Actually, Matt, I don't mean to age you, but

24:35.960 --> 24:41.640
it's now CD-ROMs, Matt. It's not floppy drives anymore. What? It's CD-ROMs now, yeah. I've

24:41.640 --> 24:48.040
got my cassette tape drive sitting right here. It works. Magnetic media is the future. God.

24:48.040 --> 24:52.600
Why hibernate when you can just either suspend or boot? What kind of system takes that long

24:52.600 --> 24:56.420
to boot anymore? I don't know. I'd put it out to the mumble room if anybody in here

24:56.420 --> 25:01.480
has a strong feeling on swap partitions. Anybody in the mumble room running swap free these

25:01.480 --> 25:09.960
days? Yes, kind of. I use swap files instead. Can I jump in quickly? You only need swap

25:09.960 --> 25:13.920
if you're using a laptop and you want to put it into hibernate. If you've got more than

25:13.920 --> 25:19.680
two gigs of RAM, you do not need swap. Swap is only used for hibernation. Well, what about

25:19.680 --> 25:27.440
crashing? That's not true. Yeah. That's completely incorrect. Here we go. And it's on. Basically,

25:27.440 --> 25:31.440
I actually need a swap partition. Let's say you've got three gigs of RAM. What is swap

25:31.440 --> 25:36.720
used for? I use a swap partition in order to compile my kernel. Usually, I don't have

25:36.720 --> 25:42.680
a five or six gigs partitioned or put on my rig, so I use a swap file. I knew this would

25:42.680 --> 25:50.160
be a hot topic. I have 12 gigs of swap. Even on machines, I have 144 gigs of RAM. Yeah,

25:50.160 --> 25:56.000
I do too. If you have no swap at all, the only negative thing I had is you can't hibernate.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
That's it. No, there's no negative things. First of all, if you don't have any swap space,

26:01.000 --> 26:04.780
as soon as you're out of memory, the kernel either has to start killing random processes

26:04.780 --> 26:09.880
or panic. There's no other option. Okay, but you've got four gigs of RAM. It's not an

26:09.880 --> 26:16.880
issue anymore. Yes, it is. Five or two gigs of swap, I think, should be enough. Just as

26:16.880 --> 26:21.520
a safety, I mean, it's five or two gigs. You already have a good partition or a swap file.

26:21.520 --> 26:25.400
Yeah, exactly. Oftentimes, you will make the swap only 512 megabytes or something, which

26:25.400 --> 26:33.160
is just enough so that really inactive stuff can get out of your way because free RAM is

26:33.160 --> 26:37.120
wasted RAM. You use as much of your RAM as you can for your file system cache and things

26:37.120 --> 26:41.920
like that. If a program is completely idle, why have it wasting memory that could be being

26:41.920 --> 26:47.920
used for cache if you could swap it out? This is my philosophy too. Just to be safe.

26:47.920 --> 26:53.720
Having even just that little bit means that a program can be swapped out. Right, but if

26:53.720 --> 26:57.640
the program is always idle and its memory is not in use, then it's even worse than just

26:57.640 --> 27:01.480
wasting it. You may as well just write it to the disk even if it's slow. It's not being

27:01.480 --> 27:06.200
used. Who cares if it's slow? The important thing is that a lot of applications will adjust

27:06.200 --> 27:13.800
their behavior based on memory pressure. For example, the ZFS file system will free up

27:13.800 --> 27:19.040
some RAM when there's memory pressure, but for those couple of seconds while that's happening,

27:19.040 --> 27:21.360
there's nowhere for the program to go.

27:21.360 --> 27:40.360
If you have even just a little bit of swap, most of the time if you need swap, you'll

27:40.360 --> 27:43.600
know that you'll need a swap partition. Why do we need a swap if you've got more than

27:43.600 --> 27:58.920
four gigs of RAM? Because it's using more than four gigs of RAM. All right, there you

27:58.920 --> 28:05.080
go. So you can see, I did that as a pure demonstration that this is not a cut and dry topic, right?

28:05.080 --> 28:10.200
That was Chris making a point right there. I think there's no total right answer other

28:10.200 --> 28:14.040
than you should use some swap unless you're somebody who thinks you shouldn't, and that's

28:14.040 --> 28:18.200
really the way to leave it. It's so funny because you can see how fired up people are,

28:18.200 --> 28:23.560
which moves us perfectly to our next email from Michael who says, it's time to move on.

28:23.560 --> 28:28.000
Get ready for this. This is going to play right into Alan's cards, Matt. If any of those

28:28.000 --> 28:31.520
BSD guys are listening, maybe they could just skip ahead a couple of minutes. He says, hi

28:31.520 --> 28:36.040
Chris and Matt. Long time viewer of the Linux Action Show and a short time viewer of Linux

28:36.040 --> 28:40.720
Unplugs since it's, well, new. Put both of your flame suits on boys because I'm about

28:40.720 --> 28:46.880
to get some backlash from the listeners about this. I'm done with Linux. I'm done with the

28:46.880 --> 28:52.400
Linux community especially. I found Slackware in 2002 and I immediately fell in love. I

28:52.400 --> 28:57.800
was an everyday Windows user and thought of a virus-free system and that seemed amazing

28:57.800 --> 29:02.920
to me. I learned that right away more learning was required. No problem. I'm a math geek

29:02.920 --> 29:07.160
so I should be able to figure out all of this Linux stuff with no problem, right? Well,

29:07.160 --> 29:11.840
long story short, I've been on Linux for about 10 years. I loved it at first, but there were

29:11.840 --> 29:16.520
always little things that bothered me. I didn't think that there was anywhere else to go though.

29:16.520 --> 29:21.080
I didn't want to get a Mac and I certainly didn't want to go to Windows again. The community

29:21.080 --> 29:26.160
of Linux users was driving me crazy with their irrational views and immature ways of expressing

29:26.160 --> 29:31.000
those views. I have yet to meet a chill Linux guy. Now hold on. I think you and I are pretty

29:31.000 --> 29:37.920
chill Linux guys. I'm literally the most... Oh, man. I mean, yeah. Not only do I run every

29:37.920 --> 29:44.480
operating system there is in my office, but yeah, go ahead. Keep going. Okay. All right.

29:44.480 --> 29:49.780
Funny enough, I found out about an alternative through Jupyter broadcasting. Hearing Alan

29:49.780 --> 29:56.480
talk about BSD on TechSnap made me very curious as I'm sure it has a lot of other Linux guys.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.320
I tried it out and everything seemed basically the same. I didn't even have to learn much

30:00.320 --> 30:04.600
of anything except a different device name or something. He says, I use the system to

30:04.600 --> 30:08.120
build and install ports. I explore it and get actively involved in the mailing list

30:08.120 --> 30:11.760
and forms. Studying and passing on my own limited knowledge to those who could benefit

30:11.760 --> 30:16.100
from it. I pursued my new journey in other open source software world, learned the differences

30:16.100 --> 30:21.160
in BSD and GNU licensing and the fragmented nature of Linux distributions realizing the

30:21.160 --> 30:27.640
free BSD community was more mature and well distributed about industry, education and

30:27.640 --> 30:34.200
research. Everything steered me towards working with and on BSD, even though I expect some

30:34.200 --> 30:37.920
of the listeners to get upset about this email and typical Linux fashion.

30:37.920 --> 30:42.600
Well, so here's the thing. I've actually had fair dealings with both communities, mostly

30:42.600 --> 30:45.880
with Linux community, but with the BSD community as well. And I'm going to go out on a limb

30:45.880 --> 30:50.520
and actually agree them that truth be told, at the end of the day, when you look at hard

30:50.520 --> 30:54.560
numbers of my own personal experiences, I can't speak for other people out there. There

30:54.560 --> 31:01.720
is a vast maturity difference. It's pretty, it's pretty significant. I don't get as much

31:01.720 --> 31:03.880
monkey poop slinging with the BSD guys.

31:03.880 --> 31:04.880
Is it that?

31:04.880 --> 31:05.880
Oh yeah, it's ridiculous.

31:05.880 --> 31:10.600
Is it that it's a more narrow, narrow, more narrow spectrum on the conversation?

31:10.600 --> 31:13.760
The BSD guys, they didn't, the ones I dealt with, they don't give a flying crap if I'm

31:13.760 --> 31:16.920
on board or not. They're just there to answer questions to be polite about it. They're not

31:16.920 --> 31:17.920
fanboys.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.040
You don't think it's a factor of a smaller community that's more focused. Do you think

31:20.040 --> 31:22.440
it's the fact that the people there are there to get some work done?

31:22.440 --> 31:25.560
Yeah. I mean, that was, again, everybody's experience is going to vary. I'm going to

31:25.560 --> 31:29.120
get flamed no matter how I put this, but my, my personal experience is just that when I

31:29.120 --> 31:34.160
asked stupid BSD questions as a newbie, I didn't feel like I was going to be punished like

31:34.160 --> 31:35.160
you do with the arch forms.

31:35.160 --> 31:39.840
Oh, okay. That is interesting. Yeah. Sometimes like, when you mentioned, I'm using your

31:39.840 --> 31:44.480
to install a VLC and then like 10 people pound on you. Oh, you should be using.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.960
The BSD guys didn't drop links in a post. That was my, that's my number one pet peeve.

31:47.960 --> 31:51.880
It's like, look, they're asking a dumb question. That's fair. Answer the question, then mention,

31:51.880 --> 31:55.480
Hey, by the way, use the search feature. Don't, don't be a douchebag and put a link.

31:55.480 --> 32:01.320
Oh my gosh. All right. Mumble room. So let me ask you, what do you think? Mumble room.

32:01.320 --> 32:06.000
Why is the BSD community generally considered more civil and calm than the Linux community?

32:06.000 --> 32:17.040
Anybody have any, the average age of a free BSD developer is 10 years older than a Linux

32:17.040 --> 32:18.040
developer.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.800
Yeah, that's there too. I'm not saying that's a good thing or a bad thing or whatever, but

32:21.800 --> 32:27.280
I think that shows that BSD, yeah, it does help. I think that shows that free BSD has

32:27.280 --> 32:33.880
a more technical, technically oriented, more server oriented user base than Linux, which

32:33.880 --> 32:35.880
obviously is on the desktop.

32:35.880 --> 32:39.600
I don't know. I don't know. It might be a wash there, but I definitely think the, the

32:39.600 --> 32:43.360
age thing probably plays component. I'm 40 years old. The guys I'm dealing with are probably

32:43.360 --> 32:45.720
40 and up. You know,

32:45.720 --> 32:48.980
Popey, what do you think? So you're sitting, you're sitting from the perspective of canonical

32:48.980 --> 32:53.760
who's, you know, sees a huge Linux user base. What do you think?

32:53.760 --> 32:56.760
Right. I don't speak for all of canonical.

32:56.760 --> 33:00.440
I know, but I'm curious because you have a unique perspective on this as somebody who's

33:00.440 --> 33:03.200
involved in a very large Linux project.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.200
Personal experience.

33:04.200 --> 33:08.640
So yeah, we have like, you know, a fairly significant community and like any community,

33:08.640 --> 33:15.360
we have people who are objectionable and say things that are unsavory and are unpleasant

33:15.360 --> 33:21.640
to people. Same as any other community, same as Windows and OS X fans and yeah, iPad fans

33:21.640 --> 33:22.640
and whoever.

33:22.640 --> 33:26.800
I don't think it's necessarily unique to the Linux community that you get doofuses that

33:26.800 --> 33:30.800
make other people feel uncomfortable. I think that's just people being dicks and their dicks

33:30.800 --> 33:31.800
wherever they are.

33:31.800 --> 33:32.800
Yeah.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.800
See, that's the thing.

33:33.800 --> 33:39.600
Hold on here. I'd like to point out too that he felt a need to write a letter saying that

33:39.600 --> 33:48.960
we're all a bunch of dicks because he's switching to previous dicks. It's exactly the same thing.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.960
He's doing it too.

33:51.960 --> 33:56.560
It's all anecdotal at this point anyway that this is true. The claim is all anecdotal.

33:56.560 --> 33:57.560
It's not like we actually have data for this.

33:57.560 --> 33:58.560
And everybody's mileage is going to vary.

33:58.560 --> 34:03.160
Also, when you look at the documentation, the Arch forums, sorry, just one thing. The

34:03.160 --> 34:07.280
Arch forums are not representative of the entire Linux community. Neither are the Ubuntu

34:07.280 --> 34:08.280
forums.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.040
I was using polar opposite ends of the spectrum. I was comparing Ubuntu community to the Arch

34:12.040 --> 34:17.960
forum community. It runs hot and cold. It depends on the time of day, the time of year,

34:17.960 --> 34:22.120
what it looks like outside, what the weather is, whether someone's pissed off or whatever.

34:22.120 --> 34:27.080
Yeah. I've always assumed it's been a volume because there's more people in a community.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.740
There's more chances for jackasses.

34:28.740 --> 34:32.640
But I was looking at like if I was like literally take a checkbox and go yes and no for everyone,

34:32.640 --> 34:36.440
it was awesome and everyone was no. I was running averages. And so for my averages,

34:36.440 --> 34:37.440
that was my experience.

34:37.440 --> 34:45.760
I think the problem is you get people who leave a community feel so angry that they

34:45.760 --> 34:51.680
have to, in the same way that when someone unfollows a celebrity on Twitter, they'll

34:51.680 --> 34:56.160
announce to the world, that's it, I'm unfollowing you. Or they'll leave a post on a blog saying,

34:56.160 --> 35:01.760
you know, that's it, I'm switching to Arch. Or people feel the need to have their voice

35:01.760 --> 35:05.800
heard even if it's a negative one. And yeah, and declare when they're leaving and they're

35:05.800 --> 35:07.560
going away and throwing their tongues at the pan.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.560
That's a good point.

35:08.560 --> 35:14.160
In a way, I think it's a way of natural progression. All of us usually start upon Linux because

35:14.160 --> 35:18.000
it's the largest and most common to start on. Most of the time, it's usually a choice

35:18.000 --> 35:23.680
to change to a BSD base based on what we know and what we consider to be what rubs us right

35:23.680 --> 35:29.680
and what floats our boat. That might be why the way of uniting together under the BSD

35:29.680 --> 35:32.640
umbrella will be a little bit more civil versus the Linux.

35:32.640 --> 35:38.480
Yeah, there's just as much fanboyism over there because they always, because I mean,

35:38.480 --> 35:43.760
they just like pretty BSD, right? Or PC BSD. But then at the same time, they talk a bunch

35:43.760 --> 35:47.360
of crap and whatever about people who use Linux or whatever.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.360
Yeah, I've seen some.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.360
It's the same exact thing.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.360
Yeah, they do that.

35:50.360 --> 35:58.760
Well, I look at it like this, is I think guys like Alan who have a very set of practical

35:58.760 --> 36:03.560
expectations from the software they use. Okay, here's my background. Before I was even doing

36:03.560 --> 36:09.040
the Linux action show, I was using Linux, of course, but I definitely experimented with

36:09.040 --> 36:14.200
some free BSD file servers because at the time, there was a bug that dramatically affected

36:14.200 --> 36:20.080
Linux's performance with AdaptX SCSI cards and free BSD did not suffer from this same

36:20.080 --> 36:26.160
bug. I got massive better multi-user performance from a free BSD server than I did a Linux

36:26.160 --> 36:31.520
server. So I started deploying free BSD in quite a bit, actually. I think about seven

36:31.520 --> 36:35.880
or eight servers over the span of a six-month period that would have each of them having

36:35.880 --> 36:39.320
300, 400, 500, 700 users hanging off of each server.

36:39.320 --> 36:44.360
And in my experience doing that, free BSD was excellent. It definitely got the job done.

36:44.360 --> 36:49.920
But where for me, I started to have some problems, it started to fall down, was this was really

36:49.920 --> 36:55.600
early on in the Sombud project developing their WinBind technology where you could actually

36:55.600 --> 37:02.640
bind to an Active Directory, import the Active Directory NTIDs as UIDs and actually set file

37:02.640 --> 37:08.520
permissions based on entries in the Active Directory. And this became an absolutely mission

37:08.520 --> 37:12.400
critical function of our file servers because this was during the transition from NT4 to

37:12.400 --> 37:17.080
Active Directory. And the only place I could get that initially was on SUSE Enterprise

37:17.080 --> 37:21.260
Linux and so we ended up going that route. And I found it interesting though that I was

37:21.260 --> 37:25.800
very happy with free BSD, but then as I needed something that was really kind of emerging,

37:25.800 --> 37:30.520
I ended up having to go back to Linux and that's always kind of kept me there.

37:30.520 --> 37:33.360
That's weird because Samba would be in the ports tree, so it'd be just as updated on

37:33.360 --> 37:37.400
free BSD as it is anywhere else, unless you're talking about development that is only happening

37:37.400 --> 37:38.400
on SUSE because of their corporate package.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.660
I don't remember what the details were, actually, to be honest with you, because it was so early

37:41.660 --> 37:46.160
on that there were so many bugs, but I find it to be more like one-

37:46.160 --> 37:48.080
Because Samba is actually developed on free BSD.

37:48.080 --> 37:56.000
Here's what I find it to be like. There is a definite range of crossover where both operating

37:56.000 --> 38:01.760
systems can do the same tasks, serve a web page, handle a print job, whatever it is.

38:01.760 --> 38:02.760
And there's other-

38:02.760 --> 38:04.200
I can't think of anything that either of them can't do.

38:04.200 --> 38:08.480
Right. And well, there's other ranges. Come on, let's be fair. There's other ranges where

38:08.480 --> 38:13.780
you start to get more into the desktop spectrum where there is some rationale behind using

38:13.780 --> 38:17.080
Linux and there's other areas where there's some rationale behind using BSD. And I think

38:17.080 --> 38:23.240
what happens is, as people make the transition and whatever kind of requirements they have,

38:23.240 --> 38:25.800
when BSD fills those, they're kind of surprised all of a sudden.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.800
They're like, wait a minute. This whole thing's been out there this whole time and it has-

38:28.800 --> 38:33.400
It's this one cohesive system that's done by this group and it all makes sense and it's

38:33.400 --> 38:38.120
well-documented. It's rational. This is so awesome. And people are like, holy shit, this

38:38.120 --> 38:41.980
has been here the whole time and there's this massive realization about it.

38:41.980 --> 38:45.520
And I think as a lot of people out there, they come to this realization, they're like,

38:45.520 --> 38:50.920
holy crap, and they make this move just like our writer here has done, Michael. But at

38:50.920 --> 38:56.280
the same time, I've been that person who's made that switch like on my router and on

38:56.280 --> 38:59.720
my file server, and I've been like, it's awesome. But I haven't been able to make that switch

38:59.720 --> 39:02.000
in other areas that I use.

39:02.000 --> 39:09.320
So at the end of the day, I think Linux is a little more diverse in the sense that you

39:09.320 --> 39:15.480
have a larger range of users from people who just want to play Minecraft to people like

39:15.480 --> 39:20.160
Alan who are building these crazy, amazing infrastructures on Scale Engine. And there's

39:20.160 --> 39:26.880
just this crazy range of users. And that sometimes leads to all this public drama and there's

39:26.880 --> 39:32.160
all of this... I think the GPL also adds to a little bit more of this advocate mindset.

39:32.160 --> 39:37.640
I think the BSD license is a little more practical in some senses and the GPL is a little more

39:37.640 --> 39:42.440
advocate-based. And I think that also is a base of some of the attitude maybe?

39:42.440 --> 39:47.320
Well, I think that the GPL is great. I think it's awesome. But there are headaches with

39:47.320 --> 39:51.120
it at times as well. It really just depends on what your goals are. From an idealistic

39:51.120 --> 39:54.880
point of view, it's wonderful. It's great. But it's not always the most practical thing

39:54.880 --> 39:59.080
in the world. And I guess the best examples of that is you don't really ever see a whole

39:59.080 --> 40:07.080
ton of monetized open source desktop applications for home users. I know it's like a niche within

40:07.080 --> 40:10.920
the niche within a niche, but I'm kind of putting that out there with a closed source

40:10.920 --> 40:13.900
license that's readily possible because no one is going to take your code and run with

40:13.900 --> 40:17.920
it unless they've hired it. So I think there's facets like that. But where it's like you

40:17.920 --> 40:22.920
have maybe the BSDs to where maybe people would see that as more of a – it's just

40:22.920 --> 40:27.920
less – well, quite frankly, it's less verbiage in the license itself really. It's

40:27.920 --> 40:31.520
almost – I hate to say it, but it's almost easier to understand. You pretty much know

40:31.520 --> 40:35.600
where you stand. So there are advantages there. I'm not saying one is better than another.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.120
I'm just saying I think they serve different purposes and so they probably appeal to different

40:39.120 --> 40:44.640
people. As far as BSD itself, I don't have a ton of experience using it. I just had good

40:44.640 --> 40:46.160
experiences with the community.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.280
Have you ever tried out PC BSD?

40:49.280 --> 40:54.880
I have. I was actually an early tester way back in the day. I love the PBIs. I still

40:54.880 --> 40:55.880
do.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.880
Oh, yeah. We've talked about that.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.400
Yeah, I really, really do. I still think that's – I think they nailed it. The port system

41:00.400 --> 41:04.280
is awesome on its own anyway. But that's just a no-brainer. But no, I mean it has its

41:04.280 --> 41:08.480
advantages. It definitely interacts with your hardware differently as far as detection.

41:08.480 --> 41:12.800
It's less about bleeding edge, more about stability. Yeah, it definitely kind of feels

41:12.800 --> 41:15.640
like an old comfy chair that you know how it's going to work. You don't have to like

41:15.640 --> 41:20.640
cross your fingers. It has some certain advantages, but it doesn't mean that PC BSD was perfect.

41:20.640 --> 41:24.400
It definitely had some challenges along the way. But I think it's interesting to watch

41:24.400 --> 41:27.640
and it's a hell of a great alternative. If Linux isn't your bag and you want to try

41:27.640 --> 41:30.840
something else, I really – I recommend checking it out, certainly.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.960
You know, if this is just – we're just scratching the surface.

41:33.960 --> 41:34.960
We're all over the place.

41:34.960 --> 41:39.040
I just want to get in deep on BSD. Go listen to BSD Now. It comes out every Friday on the

41:39.040 --> 41:42.560
Jupiter Broadcasting Network. You heard from Alan. He's on there. He's my co-host on

41:42.560 --> 41:47.280
TechSnap. He's the host of TechSnap. And also Chris Moore, the creator of PC BSD. He co-hosts

41:47.280 --> 41:51.360
that with Alan and they do it every week live on Wednesdays. It comes out for download on

41:51.360 --> 41:56.800
Fridays over at JupiterBroadcasting.com. They just – BSD Now just had an interview with

41:56.800 --> 42:03.040
– this guy, he's not only one of the founders of the FreeBSD Project. I believe he also

42:03.040 --> 42:05.760
was one of the co-creators – Alan's probably going to yell at me. I believe he was one

42:05.760 --> 42:11.920
of the co-creators of SysInstall but also the inventor of ports, which is amazing. His

42:11.920 --> 42:17.320
name is Jordan Hubbard and they did an interview with him on last week's BSD Now if you guys

42:17.320 --> 42:18.480
want to go check that out.

42:18.480 --> 42:21.160
All right, Alan. Boy, see, now I'm in TechSnap mode.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.160
Do what happens.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.160
Hey, I've been upgraded.

42:23.160 --> 42:30.920
So look, I thought we'd – last week when we were gearing up for our Linux Mint review,

42:30.920 --> 42:34.160
one of the things – because people always kick around, like, Linux Mint is the perfect

42:34.160 --> 42:39.120
distro for new users, right? So I brought the wife in and I said, okay, honey, here's

42:39.120 --> 42:43.160
Linux Mint. Have at it. So I'm going to bring her in in just a second to get her opinion

42:43.160 --> 42:47.160
on Linux Mint and kind of share some of her thoughts on some of the things she ran into.

42:47.160 --> 42:51.580
But before we get to that, I want to say thank our second sponsor this week and that is Digital

42:51.580 --> 42:53.000
Ocean.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.500
Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

42:57.500 --> 43:03.360
easy to spin up cloud server. And it is crazy easy. Users can create a cloud server in 55

43:03.360 --> 43:09.600
seconds and pricing plans start only $5 per month for 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

43:09.600 --> 43:13.440
one CPU, and one terabyte of transfer.

43:13.440 --> 43:17.400
Digital Ocean has data centers in New York, San Francisco, and Amsterdam. The interface

43:17.400 --> 43:22.420
is simple. They've got a control panel that is amazing. Power users can replicate at a

43:22.420 --> 43:24.800
large scale and they even have a straightforward API.

43:24.800 --> 43:29.760
I've got an Archbox running over on Digital Ocean at $5 per month that distributes all

43:29.760 --> 43:34.600
of the content for Unfilter supporters and also some additional content for just fans

43:34.600 --> 43:39.520
of the Unfilter show. I have all of that running through a $5 a month Digital Ocean instance

43:39.520 --> 43:42.860
and I'm looking at this Archbox. I'm like, damn, son, I got more resources available

43:42.860 --> 43:48.400
to me. And I'll tell you, that SSD, it really actually, even on a system that's up in the

43:48.400 --> 43:54.400
cloud, makes a big difference. Not only do the updates just rock on that thing, but anytime

43:54.400 --> 43:59.880
I'm interacting with it, IO contention is never a problem for me.

43:59.880 --> 44:05.460
Maybe I sound a bit like a jerk here, but I hate waiting on my disk. I do not spend

44:05.460 --> 44:09.560
time getting memory and CPU to only wait on the damn disk. And SSDs solve that problem.

44:09.560 --> 44:15.480
You combine that with Digital Ocean's incredible connection, it has been rocking. I downloaded

44:15.480 --> 44:22.460
the Unfilter supporters show using BitTorrent Sync at two megabytes a second from my Digital

44:22.460 --> 44:27.040
Ocean VPS. And I got to tell you, that's just the peak of it. I've seen 10 megabytes a second.

44:27.040 --> 44:31.020
I've seen more coming out of that thing. It's awesome. And by the way, Digital Ocean is

44:31.020 --> 44:35.120
offering a fantastic deal for listeners of Linux Unplugged. If you'd like to try out

44:35.120 --> 44:38.320
Digital Ocean for two months, because they're going to give you a $10 credit, and if you

44:38.320 --> 44:42.340
get the $5 server like I've got, it's going to get you two months, when you use our special

44:42.340 --> 44:49.380
promo code Linux Unplugged December. Linux Unplugged December will get you a $10 credit

44:49.380 --> 44:53.780
on a Digital Ocean account that you can go try out. Digital Ocean has these droplets.

44:53.780 --> 44:58.300
It's all based on KVM virtualization. They deploy to these SSD drives with their amazing

44:58.300 --> 45:04.780
hardware that's all backed up by RAID storage, ECC RAM, and these droplets let you spin up

45:04.780 --> 45:11.380
a server in no time. You can pre-pick from Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, several others. You

45:11.380 --> 45:13.920
can have them pre-configured with the LAMP stack. You can have them pre-configured with

45:13.920 --> 45:18.540
Docker. You're ready to go. They've got a flexible API, and they even have, if you can

45:18.540 --> 45:22.300
believe this, hourly pricing. So if you just need to test something for a little bit on

45:22.300 --> 45:26.860
the public web, you can throw it up on a Digital Ocean VPS, take advantage of their hourly

45:26.860 --> 45:30.660
pricing, bang on it for a while, because it's up on the web. It's public. It's got one terabyte

45:30.660 --> 45:34.220
of transfer. It's got these SSD storage, so you can have hundreds of people bang on it

45:34.220 --> 45:39.340
to actually get real world testing and only pay what you use for like, you know, what,

45:39.340 --> 45:42.460
a half hour? That's nothing. In fact, I was just talking with Michael Dominic from our

45:42.460 --> 45:46.460
Coda Radio program. He had a project over the last week where he spun up 10 Digital

45:46.460 --> 45:51.500
Ocean servers for a little while. He didn't spend like 17 cents. It's crazy. Their web

45:51.500 --> 45:56.220
administration panel is awesome, but Digital Ocean also offers a vast collection of tutorials

45:56.220 --> 46:00.980
in their community section on their website. Users can submit articles to that section,

46:00.980 --> 46:04.660
and if Digital Ocean publishes it, you'll get paid $50 per published piece. So I'll

46:04.660 --> 46:09.340
have a link for that in the show notes. Go check out Digital Ocean. We have a brand new

46:09.340 --> 46:14.700
promo code. It's going to get you a $10 credit on Digital Ocean service. That's Linux Unplugged

46:14.700 --> 46:20.380
December. Brand new code. Go over there. Try it out. You guys are so many things. Here's

46:20.380 --> 46:23.940
like a little taste of, I've been thinking about setting up an XMPP server on Digital

46:23.940 --> 46:29.300
Ocean, a Zimbra server on Digital Ocean. I've already got BitTorrent Sync and a web server

46:29.300 --> 46:34.380
on Digital Ocean. I'm even thinking about taking, I don't know, maybe Asygo in the chat

46:34.380 --> 46:39.380
room could help me on the pronunciation. Quazl, the KDE, the awesome KDE IRC client, and putting

46:39.380 --> 46:43.460
the Quazl client on my Digital Ocean VPS. That way I'm just always logged into the Jupiter

46:43.460 --> 46:49.140
Broadcasting IRC chat and I can connect from my front end on my KDE desktop. It's just

46:49.140 --> 46:55.140
so many things you can do and at $5 per month to have an awesome Linux powered VPS in the

46:55.140 --> 47:00.520
cloud that you get root access to, oh man, go check out Digital Ocean and use the promo

47:00.520 --> 47:05.260
code Linux Unplugged December and take advantage of that two month offer. It's so great. A

47:05.260 --> 47:09.580
lot of people out there have been trying this out and their support is fantastic. So go

47:09.580 --> 47:13.700
try it out. DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged December and thanks to Digital Unplugged for

47:13.700 --> 47:18.260
sponsoring Linux Unplugged. When I say Digital Ocean Unplugged, it kind of fits.

47:18.260 --> 47:21.380
Hey, that works for me. These guys are awesome.

47:21.380 --> 47:26.100
So Matt, let's bring the wife in here. Andrew, are you with us? Are you here there, Andrews?

47:26.100 --> 47:33.300
All right, so over the last week I had you try out Mint here and there, Spotty, and I

47:33.300 --> 47:36.820
wanted to bring you into the show. Did you get a completely new Linux user's perspective

47:36.820 --> 47:42.660
on Mint? Did you think was Linux Mint the distro like if you were going to switch, could

47:42.660 --> 47:47.820
I put a Linux Mint computer in front of you and have you actually be successful?

47:47.820 --> 47:53.660
Well, only if you actually like set it up for everything that I would use it for first.

47:53.660 --> 47:54.660
Yeah.

47:54.660 --> 47:58.900
Because I tried their App Store and it just really didn't do it for me.

47:58.900 --> 48:01.900
Yeah, so what was the problem? Because I mentioned a little bit on last, but I don't know if

48:01.900 --> 48:03.380
I gave it its due.

48:03.380 --> 48:07.700
Well, basically, I mean, it's great that it's broken down into like five or six main

48:07.700 --> 48:12.420
categories I think, or maybe there are like 10. Anyway, it was good the way they had internet,

48:12.420 --> 48:16.660
photo, whatever. But after looking at like the photo things, that's where I went first

48:16.660 --> 48:23.180
since I'm so photo centered, I was really discouraged. It looked like I would need to

48:23.180 --> 48:29.740
have like minimum five programs just to import a picture or try out a lot of different programs

48:29.740 --> 48:33.860
just to see what would be the best to import pictures.

48:33.860 --> 48:39.020
Yeah, you kind of felt like there was like you could string several programs together

48:39.020 --> 48:43.520
to get what you wanted, but you wanted like plug the camera in, one program comes up and

48:43.520 --> 48:45.300
takes care of all of the things you needed.

48:45.300 --> 48:46.300
Yeah.

48:46.300 --> 48:48.980
And it's not that that wasn't there, but you just didn't find it in the App Store.

48:48.980 --> 48:54.500
Well, I definitely didn't. The descriptions are very technical and I think I'm a little

48:54.500 --> 49:00.100
better than the average user, but I'm still an average user. So, having that it says I

49:00.100 --> 49:06.300
know what a GUI is, that's great. That's kind of what I would expect as a typical user.

49:06.300 --> 49:12.180
Yeah, they all kind of advertise the GUI aspect. Now, there was a little bit of a bumpy road.

49:12.180 --> 49:16.860
So, when I'm testing out a distro and I want to try it on full hardware acceleration, I

49:16.860 --> 49:24.220
don't want to use virtualization, I have this external USB 3 hybrid drive. It's like SSD,

49:24.220 --> 49:32.180
it's like a 32GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive, spinning drive. And that's what I load the

49:32.180 --> 49:35.780
distros on and then the Bonobo lets you choose what device you want to boot from. So, I just

49:35.780 --> 49:39.820
choose the external USB device and I boot from that. And so, here I am, I'm like, here

49:39.820 --> 49:44.580
you go wife, I'm going to give you this Bonobo and you just sit down here and you use Linux

49:44.580 --> 49:48.500
Mint and Ange is like, oh cool, I'm going to get to use your System76. And then what

49:48.500 --> 49:49.500
happened Ange?

49:49.500 --> 49:53.480
Okay, so this is great. So, he's like, all right, here you go and he turns it around

49:53.480 --> 49:58.860
and I'm sitting pretty much where Chase does when they do unfilter, so they face each other.

49:58.860 --> 50:05.140
And I go to click on something and nothing happens. So, I try the corners.

50:05.140 --> 50:07.900
And I'm not watching because the screen isn't facing me at this point. So, I'm just like,

50:07.900 --> 50:09.820
I'm figuring like she's making mistakes.

50:09.820 --> 50:16.140
Yeah, and I like double click the computer icon and the whole screen like freaks out

50:16.140 --> 50:21.140
and I don't know what's going on. And I was asking him like, how do I do anything because

50:21.140 --> 50:26.260
I didn't have a, oh gosh, all I can think of is calling it a start bar. What is it called

50:26.260 --> 50:27.260
when it's on Linux?

50:27.260 --> 50:30.180
Well, you can call it the start menu. Everybody knows what you're talking about.

50:30.180 --> 50:34.460
Okay, well that menu wasn't even there. And so, when I asked what do I do and what do

50:34.460 --> 50:39.820
I even do, he scoffed. I was like, well, okay. So, then I turned it towards him and he was

50:39.820 --> 50:45.380
like, what did you do? And he's like, oh, he had unplugged the hard drive before he

50:45.380 --> 50:47.860
turned around the laptop.

50:47.860 --> 50:53.420
Her first experience with Linux Mint 16 was total crash fest because me being the dumbass,

50:53.420 --> 50:55.800
I'm turning around the laptop and I'm like, well, we don't need to have all these things

50:55.800 --> 51:00.620
connected as I'm moving the machine. So, I unplugged the USB devices. And then of course,

51:00.620 --> 51:04.540
the USB device was the actual operating system's hard drive.

51:04.540 --> 51:11.100
So, then he got it up and running and I was like, oh good, it's a start bar. That's a

51:11.100 --> 51:17.260
good start. And he said, well, do something. So, I went to digitalblastforme.com from the

51:17.260 --> 51:23.900
suggestions on Twitter. I got a new background, which surprisingly felt just normal. I did

51:23.900 --> 51:28.380
that without any problems. Just right-click the right resolution, set his background just

51:28.380 --> 51:32.060
like Windows, just like Mac. Super easy.

51:32.060 --> 51:36.100
And then, let's see, what was the other thing I tried? Oh, I did the sticky note. That was

51:36.100 --> 51:37.100
good.

51:37.100 --> 51:40.180
Oh yeah, you liked that. In fact, you wanted me to add that to your Mac. I remember that.

51:40.180 --> 51:46.500
Yeah, because I never – Okay, well, on my Mac, I have a really old version of Office

51:46.500 --> 51:51.340
for Mac. And it's slower than Molasses. And I don't like TextEdit because of the lack

51:51.340 --> 51:57.180
of formatting. So, I need something where I can just throw stuff temporarily so that

51:57.180 --> 52:01.100
I can keep it there and then get it later.

52:01.100 --> 52:08.100
Yeah. Well, so your overall, I guess, to encapsulate it, it was, yeah, I could use it, but you

52:08.100 --> 52:13.500
didn't feel like – Now, do you feel like that would be the case if I gave you Windows

52:13.500 --> 52:16.820
today? I have to completely set it up for you. Is that any different than if you were

52:16.820 --> 52:17.820
switching to Windows?

52:17.820 --> 52:24.180
No. No. I mean, the answer is, I think I could be just fine on Windows, surprisingly.

52:24.180 --> 52:26.300
Do you think you could be just fine on Mint?

52:26.300 --> 52:30.980
No, because I don't know if you recall, but you're like, go find a program. So,

52:30.980 --> 52:36.260
I went to Firefox and I typed photo programs for Mint.

52:36.260 --> 52:41.220
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, Windows 7 versus Windows 8, which one would you feel more comfortable

52:41.220 --> 52:42.220
with?

52:42.220 --> 52:45.140
Oh, I don't even want to look at Windows 8.

52:45.140 --> 52:46.140
Good answer.

52:46.140 --> 52:47.140
I don't know.

52:47.140 --> 52:48.140
Good answer.

52:48.140 --> 52:49.140
Yeah.

52:49.140 --> 52:54.180
I was a big fan of Windows 2000. I didn't even like XP. So, no, I don't even want

52:54.180 --> 52:57.220
to try 8. No.

52:57.220 --> 52:58.220
It's pretty bad.

52:58.220 --> 53:02.540
Yeah. Well, thank you for trying that. You were a good guinea pig, and I think in the

53:02.540 --> 53:06.180
future I might have you try elementary OS and see what you think about it, and maybe

53:06.180 --> 53:08.540
we'll have you come back on Linux Unplugged and share your thoughts.

53:08.540 --> 53:09.540
Yeah.

53:09.540 --> 53:10.540
That would make Ryan 516 happy.

53:10.540 --> 53:17.180
Yeah. Well, you're a Mac user, and elementary OS is the closest Mac OS experience, I think,

53:17.180 --> 53:22.460
on Linux right now, without being just a rip-off theme. They really try.

53:22.460 --> 53:26.300
I think pair OS might be fun, just to see how different it is.

53:26.300 --> 53:27.300
Pair OS. Yeah.

53:27.300 --> 53:28.300
Yeah.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.300
That would be my choice.

53:29.300 --> 53:30.300
Okay. All right. Well, thanks, Ange.

53:30.300 --> 53:31.300
Yep. No problem.

53:31.300 --> 53:32.300
All righty.

53:32.300 --> 53:33.300
Thank you.

53:33.300 --> 53:37.220
So, Matt, we got one more little bit of email I wanted to get to before we go. Actually,

53:37.220 --> 53:40.300
it wasn't even email. I keep calling that because we've gotten so much email recently,

53:40.300 --> 53:44.340
but this was actually a subreddit post, and I'll read it, and then we'll jump into the

53:44.340 --> 53:49.660
mumble group and see what the guys think. But he says, hello, I got a show idea for

53:49.660 --> 53:55.700
you. Tiling window manager roundup. I feel the Linux action show has not showcased many

53:55.700 --> 54:00.860
tiling window managers. They can be really customizable and, in turn, boost your productivity

54:00.860 --> 54:06.140
when it comes to certain tasks. I personally run an i3wm setup, and although I sometimes

54:06.140 --> 54:11.460
use KDE No Man's Cinnamon, I always keep coming back to good old i3. My main suggestion is

54:11.460 --> 54:17.460
go over to reddit.com slash r slash Unix Porn. They regularly will show off how beautiful

54:17.460 --> 54:22.740
a tiling window manager can be, both new and old. So he wanted us to take the tiling window

54:22.740 --> 54:26.140
manager challenge. And I got to say, Matt, I just-

54:26.140 --> 54:29.140
Are you as excited as I am?

54:29.140 --> 54:32.220
Yeah. I think so. Like, for me, I've been actually-

54:32.220 --> 54:37.660
I think it's worth doing. I think, in fairness, despite what we might feel, that we need,

54:37.660 --> 54:42.460
we need, because remember the Arch thing? Oh, that stupid Arch crap. That was me. I

54:42.460 --> 54:47.540
was Mr. Oh, Arch is stupid. I will never use Arch, and now I'm basically using Arch. So

54:47.540 --> 54:51.860
based on that, even though I've tried it and I was never impressed with it, I have to eat

54:51.860 --> 54:55.380
my own dog food and actually at least try it. Then I can dog on it intelligently.

54:55.380 --> 55:01.820
But Matt, KDE is so nice. I'm liking KDE these days. All right, so I got to, let's jump in

55:01.820 --> 55:06.860
the Mumba room. Let's ask the Mumba room, guys, what do you think? Do Matt and Chris

55:06.860 --> 55:11.020
have to take the tiling window manager challenge?

55:11.020 --> 55:12.340
It would definitely be interesting.

55:12.340 --> 55:16.660
If you do it, you got to do all of them and there's about 11.

55:16.660 --> 55:19.780
I don't want to do all of them. I want to narrow it down to one or two.

55:19.780 --> 55:22.380
I'm sure there's more than 11.

55:22.380 --> 55:28.800
We've talked about Awesome and Window End, and we've done Awesome and Exnomad on the

55:28.800 --> 55:34.660
show before. At both times, I felt like I was just doing a fan service because to me,

55:34.660 --> 55:41.360
I feel like I'm compromising a modern desktop experience. I come from the 80s, people, where

55:41.360 --> 55:45.980
we didn't have desktops. God damn it, we finally have desktops and I want the best possible

55:45.980 --> 55:50.660
desktop possible. Why the hell would I go back to a tiling window manager?

55:50.660 --> 55:53.220
Windows 1.0 was a tiling window manager.

55:53.220 --> 55:55.220
Yeah, exactly. That puts it in perspective.

55:55.220 --> 56:06.180
I think if you're going to do it, you don't need to do all 25,000 of them. You only really

56:06.180 --> 56:14.860
need to do a dynamic tiling window manager, which would be i3.

56:14.860 --> 56:19.360
And then you need to do, because most of the others, they're all forks of DWM. Even Awesome

56:19.360 --> 56:25.020
is just a fork of DWM. I'd probably do i3, Awesome and Exmonad because those three seem

56:25.020 --> 56:27.220
to be the three main ones.

56:27.220 --> 56:28.220
Well, the one I hear the most about-

56:28.220 --> 56:29.220
You need to do-

56:29.220 --> 56:33.260
It's been at least a month or two with each one to really learn them.

56:33.260 --> 56:34.260
A month?

56:34.260 --> 56:35.260
Yeah.

56:35.260 --> 56:36.260
That's not going to happen.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.260
No.

56:37.260 --> 56:39.860
You need to just use the right poison.

56:39.860 --> 56:42.620
I use my- I have my fling with Exmonad and i3.

56:42.620 --> 56:47.060
And then I'll go surf YouTube with links and, you know, I mean, it's just kind of like

56:47.060 --> 56:48.060
clickbait.

56:48.060 --> 56:49.060
To me, tiling windows managers are just not-

56:49.060 --> 56:50.060
TTY4, TTY4.

56:50.060 --> 56:53.760
Tiling window managers are for pretentious idiots who just want to feel cool about using

56:53.760 --> 56:55.760
and can be-

56:55.760 --> 56:56.760
Ouch.

56:56.760 --> 56:57.760
Not at all.

56:57.760 --> 56:58.760
That is exactly-

56:58.760 --> 56:59.760
I completely agree.

56:59.760 --> 57:02.620
Okay. All right. So there we go.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.260
The links and YouTube thing may have been a little much.

57:04.260 --> 57:07.060
I think we got to try out i3. I think we got to try out i3.

57:07.060 --> 57:10.380
That would be fair because we can settle on one and really put it through its paces.

57:10.380 --> 57:13.200
This is the one that we always- Everybody keeps coming back to i3. This is the one we

57:13.200 --> 57:17.620
hear the most about these days. And we've done Exmonad, we've done Awesome window manager

57:17.620 --> 57:22.020
on the last show. Maybe it's time to try out i3. Now, I'm not saying immediately because

57:22.020 --> 57:27.540
we've got a lot of stuff lined up on the big show, but maybe the end of the year.

57:27.540 --> 57:31.060
I'd say that once we get through our big stuff, I think once we're looking for topics, I think

57:31.060 --> 57:35.660
it's a great- I think it's a fair thing. I mean, we tried Arch, it worked out. Who knows?

57:35.660 --> 57:39.220
Maybe we'll have a passing affinity, maybe.

57:39.220 --> 57:43.440
You know what, Matt? You're right. You're right. I said the same thing about Arch and

57:43.440 --> 57:45.180
now here I am running Arch everywhere.

57:45.180 --> 57:49.020
It just allows us to at least- For myself, I can speak intelligently and be like, you

57:49.020 --> 57:52.500
know what? I really love it because of Blank or I really hate it because of Blank. I can

57:52.500 --> 57:56.580
actually point to something directly versus just saying, no, I don't want to try it. That

57:56.580 --> 57:57.580
kind of thing.

57:57.580 --> 58:00.260
Although, I'm going to tell you one of the reasons I like Arch is because I get the most

58:00.260 --> 58:02.260
current KDE anywhere.

58:02.260 --> 58:06.780
Right? Yeah, yeah. And that's a benefit we weren't even aware, really fully rationalizing

58:06.780 --> 58:10.660
that we missed. We heard it, but we never really materialized in front of us, I guess.

58:10.660 --> 58:14.380
What I'm going to do is I'm going to set up an i3 desktop that is powered on the backend

58:14.380 --> 58:15.380
by Kaywin, right?

58:15.380 --> 58:16.380
Oh, there you go.

58:16.380 --> 58:17.380
There you go.

58:17.380 --> 58:18.380
I see where you're going with this.

58:18.380 --> 58:23.060
I will have wobbly windows, although I will never get wobbly windows, but I know it's

58:23.060 --> 58:26.900
there. I know it's there. If I ever needed it, I know it's there. Look, before we run

58:26.900 --> 58:32.060
this week, it is getting close to the holiday season, and I've gotten a lot of crap from

58:32.060 --> 58:37.940
our very own mumble room about talking about Steam and Humble too much, but I don't know.

58:37.940 --> 58:41.260
If you're like me, every now and then around the holiday season, I get the gaming itch.

58:41.260 --> 58:45.620
Even if I don't have the time, it's baked into my brain. It's time to game, and there's

58:45.620 --> 58:49.940
a new Humble bundle, which we will probably talk about on the last, but it'll be several

58:49.940 --> 58:55.540
days into it. Now it's just launched. There's a new Humble bundle out, and there's a couple

58:55.540 --> 59:00.000
of games on there that make the entire thing worth it. Serious Sam 3, BFE, and Natural

59:00.000 --> 59:03.180
Selection 2, which Natural Selection 2 is that game where you get to play as the human

59:03.180 --> 59:04.540
or the alien?

59:04.540 --> 59:06.260
That's the one I like, yeah.

59:06.260 --> 59:10.380
Thirteen days left on this Humble bundle. Alls I'm saying is I want all of you to go

59:10.380 --> 59:14.100
over there and dominate this thing for Linux again. Let's just go over there and remind

59:14.100 --> 59:18.740
them why they go through all the effort on porting some of this S to Linux, because if

59:18.740 --> 59:24.960
you look at this lineup, one, two, three of the games are not available for Linux. This

59:24.960 --> 59:30.140
is not a trend we can allow, my friends, and the trend must be our friend, so therefore

59:30.140 --> 59:36.840
we must go over to Humble Bundle and use our Linux dollars, or Linux Bitcoins as it were,

59:36.840 --> 59:40.980
to own this chart so we can show them that it's still worth their effort to port to Linux,

59:40.980 --> 59:45.740
and the entire damn thing is worth it for Natural Selection 2. Sanctum 2 is also in

59:45.740 --> 59:51.020
there, Magica, plus all the DLC for Magica is in there. Orcs Must Die 2 is a community

59:51.020 --> 59:55.980
favorite, but it is not available to Linux, and those bastards must fix that. So go over

59:55.980 --> 59:59.020
there and buy that sucker, so that way the next time a developer gets in there without

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.820
a Linux version, Humble Bundle kicks them in the nuts.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.940
The only way it's going to happen is if we vote with our wallet, and I don't know, I

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:10.220
get a little fired up. Let's see how we're doing right now. Let's see. Okay, okay, man,

01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:17.900
are you ready? Average purchase price, $3.89. Okay, okay. Average Windows price, $3.92.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:24.140
Average Mac price, $4.29. Average Linux price, are you ready for it?

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.140
I'm ready.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.140
$4.85.

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.140
Hello, everybody.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.140
That's right.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.140
That's right.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:35.140
I don't know. I'm just thinking, those are some good games. Too bad I own all of them

01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.140
already.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140
Right? It's like, oh wow.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.660
Yeah, that's the only thing. It's Humble Bundle, it's getting a little harder for them to have

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.820
the exclusive, but that's understandable.

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:42.820
That's okay.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:46.340
That's totally cool. All right, man. Well, we have a really big Linux action show coming

01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:50.000
up on Sunday. Man, I got more stuff we could dig through, but I wanted to just, before

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.100
we run, I wanted to give people a little heads up. The holidays are coming, so Matt and I

01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:00.260
are going to do a little double recording on Tuesday the 17th, so not next week, but

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:05.300
the following week, we're going to do two Linux unplugs back to back, starting at 12

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:12.780
p.m. Pacific, and that will probably go from about 12 p.m. Pacific to about 3.30 p.m. Pacific,

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:17.620
and that'll be our live show for the 24th, too, so we won't have a live show. That second

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:22.860
episode will be released on the 24th. That way we can take the holiday week off, so if

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:27.100
you'd like to join us for a special long edition, we're going to need your help out there, too.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.620
We're going to need you in the mumble room. We're going to need your emails, so if you've

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.740
been waiting to email Linux Unplug, now's the time. Go over to Jupyter Broadcasting,

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.220
click that contact link, and choose Linux Unplug from the dropdown, because we need

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:44.540
your emails. We need your feedback. You fuel the show, and on Tuesday the 17th, without

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:48.220
you, we will have no show, so we need your feedback, and we need you in the mumble room.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.500
Join us live. Normally we're live at 2 p.m. on Pacific, but on that Tuesday the 17th,

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:58.220
we'll be starting at 12 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv. Don't forget, you can always

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:02.540
get a hold of us on the subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com. We check that

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:06.300
out for stories we should follow for the show, your feedback, threads, and all that kind

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.380
of stuff. Hey, Matt, have a great week. I'll see you on Sunday for some hardware reviews,

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.380
all right?

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:12.380
All right. See you then.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.180
All right, everyone. Well, thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode of

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:36.300
Linux Unplugged. We'll see you right back here next week.
