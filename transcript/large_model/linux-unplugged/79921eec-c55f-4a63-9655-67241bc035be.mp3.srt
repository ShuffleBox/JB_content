1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Now, Chris, I know you're an animal lover, but mostly just on the outside.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,080
You ever been curious about the inside?

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,320
No, no, that sounds like that would be something a psychopath would want to do,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,000
like cut open a cat or something.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,760
It sure does.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,440
Why are you asking me this?

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,440
Oh, well, I've got a link for you.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,960
A kind of cute, kind of disturbing new VR cat demo.

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,960
This one from Leap Motion.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,520
Yeah, I've I heard about it.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,480
I had not seen it.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,040
I don't think I need to go inside a cat, Wes.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,560
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 253 for June 12th, 2018.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,680
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,520
that's definitely not going to talk about Microsoft buying GitHub this week.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,960
Well, I mean, I mean anymore.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,880
And yes, I'm still live from the road.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,840
I'm just outside of Dallas, Texas, parked at the Linux Academy headquarters.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,960
I'll tell you more about that.

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,280
But let's bring in everybody.

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,160
My name is Chris.

23
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,240
And that right there over there is my name is Wes.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,640
Hello, Wes, you and your wonderful Seattle weather.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,280
Oh, I know, right?

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,560
It's overcast right now.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,040
Can you even imagine that, Chris?

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
No, no, no, no, I cannot.

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,560
Wes, we're going to try something a little different today.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,080
Going to reformat the show a little bit.

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,520
This is the Unplugged program after all.

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,960
And we're going to do things in blocks.

33
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,800
This is an idea I came up while I'm on the road, totally 100% open to feedback.

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,000
So here's what's going to happen for the first time.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,680
We're going to bust through a community update block of news.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,480
Then I'm going to block all of the sponsors together in one easy to navigate

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
spot in the show with all the links of the stuff I'm going to talk about this

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,720
week, because they're all launching stuff, some big stuff.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,520
I'll tell you about that.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,080
Then towards the end of the show, we're going to kick back.

41
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm going to tell you about Texas Linux Fest, what the event was like, about

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:04,280
the parties that we attended and all of those kinds of stories, and then we'll

43
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,160
wrap it up with an app pick that is extremely useful and our own Mr.

44
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,280
Wes Payne will tell us all about it.

45
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,000
But Wes, before we go any fervor, there is one duty that we must perform.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,480
We must.

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,080
We must.

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,480
We must holla at that mumble room.

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
What's up?

51
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Hello.

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,320
Hello.

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,200
Hello, everybody.

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,360
So wonderful to hear you.

55
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,080
I, uh, I'm, I'm feeling pretty good right now.

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,120
You know, I've started to acclimate to the Texas heat.

57
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,760
You're Texan through and through.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,040
Yeah, I'm not doing too bad.

59
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,640
It's 97 degrees here every single day in Keller, Texas, but, uh, I don't know.

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
You kind of get used to it after a while, if that makes any sense.

61
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,160
And it's a little less humid here than it was down in Austin.

62
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,360
So that helps a lot too.

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,560
And, uh, I got to, uh, I, I, Anthony, the CEO of Linux Academy, picked me up

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,520
Friday morning out, uh, from the campground to take me to Linux Fest.

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,360
And while we were driving, I chatted with him.

66
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,360
I said, yeah, you know, we're, we're a little concerned about the heat because,

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,280
uh, it's going to be 97 degrees.

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,440
And of course I'm going to have to run my generator to be able to run the AC.

69
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,320
And that's going to be loud and it's going to be limited.

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,600
I'm only going to run it for, you know, it's just kind of like, it was just kind

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
of convincing as I'm sometimes known to do.

72
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
It's only sometimes.

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Yeah.

74
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
It's almost like I've made a living out of it or something.

75
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,040
And so, uh, you know, super cool guy.

76
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,480
He, he gets ahold of his facilities guy Friday morning.

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,960
And by Sunday, when I got here, they had a power hookup for the RV.

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,400
So I could hook up and get full service.

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,680
Yep.

80
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,160
So I got AC, I got full power.

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,840
It's great.

82
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,320
Even, I'm even in the shade a little bit by the, by this time, it's, uh, it's,

83
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,080
um, almost about three o'clock, uh, uh, about Chicago time zone area.

84
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,360
Um, about this time, the, uh, building starts to shade the RV too.

85
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,400
So it's, it's, it's actually downright comfortable.

86
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,920
I couldn't believe it.

87
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
How did you get such a sweet spot?

88
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't know, man.

89
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,040
I was worried about it the entire time before I left.

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,560
I was worried.

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,520
Like I was, I was, I almost went out and got like this whole reflectix kit that I

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,280
was going to put out all over the windows.

93
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,840
And I was going to, I remember I was really upset when my awning got busted

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,720
because that was like a key part of, and that still would have been very useful.

95
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,960
Uh, but it was a key part of my shade strategy.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,920
Like I was very concerned about this particular aspect and it's gone way

97
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,040
better than I could have imagined.

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,720
And on top of that, we're right next to like a little pond crick thing.

99
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,120
I don't know.

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,000
They're not like what we have in Washington because there it's just like

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
any old average, like basically big ditch, but it's a natural thing and it's full

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
of fish and turtles.

103
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,080
I have a turtle pond next to the RV and so far I've counted four turtles and I'm

104
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,360
told there's some turtles in there.

105
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,480
They're as large as hubcaps, like big turtles.

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,480
So you brought one on as a guest on the show today?

107
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:48,920
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,560
He's sitting right there.

109
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,440
He's, uh, he just hasn't had much to say yet.

110
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,720
So last night I'm working out by the pond, watching the turtles, Levi and I.

111
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,160
So that was pretty cool.

112
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:00,640
Yeah.

113
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,880
And then, and then do you found this tour app?

114
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,080
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it right, but it's tour or something like that.

115
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,760
Have you seen this?

116
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,920
It's Airbnb for cars.

117
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
No, I have not.

118
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,720
And they specialize in sort of fancy cars, like, you know, so Mercedes, BMWs,

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,120
Teslas, or like really souped up Jeep Jeep wranglers and trucks for Texas.

120
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,520
And so for 60 bucks, we rented today a Mercedes with great air conditioning, a

121
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,440
white Mercedes with air conditioning that we can bop around for a couple of days.

122
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,920
Bopping around in Texas in style, no less.

123
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,560
Look at you.

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,720
You really know what you're doing.

125
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,320
Hmm.

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,120
It's been pretty good.

127
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,720
I mean, I'm getting there.

128
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,080
I've got to walk through the Linux Academy office too, and got to see some

129
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,720
of their studio space that they have here.

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,000
And, uh, I've got the OBS rig, um, loaded.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's got OBS on it.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,800
It's got Kubuntu 1804 loaded.

133
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,240
It got the capture cards of the audio interface all hooked up to it.

134
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,120
And, um, I'm going to try doing a Chromebook HDMI capture on it after the

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,360
show.

136
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
So they're, they're interesting.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,240
Yeah.

138
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,160
Their transition to Linux, uh, from the Mac is, uh, is well underway.

139
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,680
So it's been a great visit and, um, I now, I now have a new term for air

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,040
conditioning and that term is life support.

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,800
I now understand that it's life support.

142
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,080
Yeah.

143
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,600
So it was, it was a great, it was a, it was a, it was a great trip to get here.

144
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:16,920
It was hot.

145
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,800
It was 104 degrees on the drive up here and there was construction in Waco.

146
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,760
So, yeah, it took a while.

147
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,080
It took me five hours to get from Austin to Dallas and, uh, 104 degrees in that

148
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,760
drive, but so, so are you, are you homesick yet?

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,480
Are you, are you?

150
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,040
Are you missing the comforts of the JV one studio?

151
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,640
You know, actually today's kind of the day that I wasn't like some days I am

152
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,200
right, but today isn't one of those days today.

153
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm really kind of digging it.

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm kind of, I'm comfortable, you know, uh, I got the car, so I was able to go

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
out and I was able to get some babes, uh, fried chicken, which, uh, yeah, which

156
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,680
was described to me as, as fried chicken.

157
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,480
That's better than grandma's fried chicken when grandma grew up making fried

158
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,800
chicken.

159
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,760
Yeah.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,280
Yeah.

161
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,680
That's incredible.

162
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,960
It was actually pretty good.

163
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,440
So it's been a great trip.

164
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,400
There's been so much cool, like, uh, people to meet.

165
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,640
There's some people that are visiting the Linux Academy offices that are out

166
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,640
like writing software and doing startup stuff and they're building on top of

167
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,840
Linux and they're here talking to people.

168
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,240
So the thing about the thing that I'm starting to appreciate is there's like a

169
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,480
bench of people here that are like, uh, like Red Hat experts and Azure experts

170
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,960
and like expert experts, like really, like really like I shouldn't give anybody

171
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,400
ideas, but like Amazon and Microsoft and Red Hat are poaching people from here

172
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:34,920
constantly.

173
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,920
Like these people really, so they're, so Linux Academy has people out here.

174
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,360
They're just, uh, you know, getting questions answered and stuff like that.

175
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,240
They've got this new meetup space they're building to, uh, bring people in

176
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,480
from the community and so they can get questions answered.

177
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
And it's just really cool thing there.

178
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,480
So I got to see all of that that they're building out right now.

179
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,000
It's pretty neat.

180
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,200
That is really neat.

181
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:50,760
Yeah.

182
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,680
So there's probably going to be some more Linux community things going on in this

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,880
area, uh, later on down the road once they get all that stuff rolling.

184
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,080
But, uh, what do you say?

185
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,240
What do you, should we get into some, some, uh, larger open source free

186
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,800
software community news updates?

187
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,040
That's what we're here for, right?

188
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,840
Let's do it.

189
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah.

190
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,280
We'll talk about Texas Linux Fest later, but let's talk about some news items that

191
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,360
people should probably know about this week as we're, uh, it's only Tuesday and

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,560
there's things you should probably know about if you're a Copperhead OS user,

193
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,880
especially now, Copperhead OS is a security enhanced Android distribution

194
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:23,720
started in 2016, but it looks like the company behind Copperhead OS appears to

195
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,360
have run into some internal trouble.

196
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,680
Now I don't really know the specifics at this point, but the situation seems to be

197
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,160
devolving and there's clearly some kind of dispute between the founders.

198
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,160
You guys know how much I hate drama, so I don't really care to get into it, but

199
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,720
there is a Reddit post that we'll have linked in the show notes where

200
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,640
apparently one of the co-founders essentially is kicking out the other

201
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,840
co-founder from the company.

202
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,480
So that does tend to cause drama, Wes.

203
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Absolutely.

204
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,120
Especially, you know, at these really, these really small distributions or

205
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,040
companies where that makes up a lot of the culture, a lot of the history and

206
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,680
a lot of the people, you know, trying to do work and organizing things.

207
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,240
So yikes.

208
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,160
Yeah.

209
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
And my thoughts are with the users.

210
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,360
I know it almost sounds cliche to say, but it's like, okay, well now what?

211
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,880
Because, uh, you know, you have a user base who's using this because they

212
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
have very certain kinds of considerations.

213
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,480
A Copperhead OS appeals to a certain kind of user base.

214
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,080
Well, now what?

215
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,120
I don't know.

216
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
I honestly don't know where they go cause I don't follow this very carefully.

217
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,120
I see Mr.

218
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,160
Popey has entered in the room.

219
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,800
Hello, Popey.

220
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,480
Good to see you.

221
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,000
Hello.

222
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,600
Hello.

223
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,640
And Tyler's here too.

224
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,680
Tyler, welcome back.

225
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,240
It's been good.

226
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,280
I haven't seen you for a little bit.

227
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,440
Taking the night off.

228
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,240
I just got back in from, uh, driving home from Southeast Linux Fest.

229
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,360
Well, maybe we can pick your brain about that a little bit in the show.

230
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,920
What do you say?

231
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,440
Do a little Texas Linux Fest update and a little Southeast Linux Fest update.

232
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,800
Both were going on this weekend.

233
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,240
So I'd love to pick your brain about that.

234
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,760
Stick around.

235
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,680
I'm glad you're here.

236
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
Uh, yeah.

237
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,640
So this weekend was huge.

238
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,600
It was full spectrum for Jupiter broadcasting.

239
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,080
So we had BSD can going on in Canada and Alan Jude, uh, was there and it was live

240
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:04,920
streamed Tyler and Noah were at self and they were live streaming the hell out of

241
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,320
self I was at Texas Linux Fest doing no work at all, just hobnobbing with

242
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,440
everybody and, uh, uh, Joe and Popey were at a floss talk this weekend.

243
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,760
This weekend, so all of that was happening this weekend.

244
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,680
So, Popey, if you want to talk about floss talking a little bit too, we could

245
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
just do kind of a whole kind of roundabout about some of the events we

246
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,840
were at this weekend and, uh, that'd be awesome.

247
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,600
All right.

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,520
So yeah, Copperhead OS, uh, back to the news.

249
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,200
So Copperhead OS, uh, is, uh, perhaps in trouble and it might be

250
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,640
time to look for an alternative.

251
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,080
I don't know if I'm in the Mamba room has any alternative suggestions or if you do

252
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,160
West, but, uh, I'd love to hear what the audience thinks on that.

253
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,800
It's kind of a shame to see these projects.

254
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,200
Maybe things will work out fine, but it's a shame to see things go this way.

255
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,520
Especially in a security focused project where you sort of hope that calmer heads

256
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,480
will prevail as it's, you know, serious attention to details sort of work.

257
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,480
But as always, personalities, they happen.

258
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,520
That's exactly, basically just summed it up.

259
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,600
Personalities happen.

260
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,440
Uh, that's a title.

261
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,560
Somebody said, bang, suggest that.

262
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,680
That's a good title suggestion.

263
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
Uh, open source personalities happen.

264
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,240
So Plasma 5.3, speaking of refinement and working away on stuff, Plasma 5.13

265
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,440
launched today, and I think the big headline feature for most users is going

266
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,800
to be the browser integration.

267
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,000
It's a new set of features for Firefox, Chrome and Chromium based browsers.

268
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,680
They integrate in with plasma notification, pop-ups, transferring

269
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,800
files with dolphin notifications, media controls can now mute and skip videos

270
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
playing from within the browser.

271
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,840
And you can send a link to your phone with KDE connect now, and, uh, you can

272
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,120
also choose browser tabs.

273
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,760
I've not tried this at all, but I, I understand that you can try, you can try

274
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,440
to choose browser tabs somehow from K runner with an old space keyboard

275
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:48,880
shortcut.

276
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,840
That's blowing my mind.

277
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,280
I got to try that at some point.

278
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,560
So that's probably the biggest user facing new feature in Plasma 5.13.

279
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,040
The one that I have been anticipating the longest is the redesigned for system

280
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,320
settings and the new look for the lock-in for the lock screen and login screen,

281
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,840
which I think looks really slick.

282
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,760
There's also graphics, compositor updates.

283
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,040
Kaywin gain a much improved effects for blurring and desktop switching.

284
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,880
And of course, as all these updates go, there's been continued work on making

285
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,000
Wayland awesome, including the return of windows rules now on Wayland, which is

286
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
a fantastic plasma desktop feature and the use of high priority EGL context, as

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,720
well as initial support for screencast and desktop sharing.

288
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,960
Whoa, huge one, plus something that's not really just like a bullet point

289
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,240
feature.

290
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Here's tons of performance improvements, memory usage improvements, lots of

291
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,720
improvements on the system setting stuff and a tech preview.

292
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,640
That's what they're calling it of the GTK global menu integration.

293
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,600
So if you're a fan of global menus, there has been a hack available on Plasma.

294
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,960
I call it a hack, but there's been a way to get it working on Plasma for a

295
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,280
while.

296
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,760
This is official stuff.

297
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
There's going to be official stuff.

298
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,440
So that's really nice.

299
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,120
And then a small one.

300
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
It's kind of funny they're even put this in here, but I legit like it.

301
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,720
The digital clock widget allows you now to copy the current date and time to

302
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,200
the clipboard.

303
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,040
Hallelujah.

304
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,760
Wes, it's those small little usability things that when they're there, it just

305
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,240
makes sense.

306
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,400
Right.

307
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,560
So new users to me like, oh, hey, look, this is handy.

308
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,640
And when you want it or you're just trying to just trying to copy the things

309
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,360
you need to send it to someone right now and then it works and you're just

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,520
like, yes, great, perfect.

311
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,640
And now I think I think I'll leave I'll leave it as an exercise to the user.

312
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But producer Michael and I work together on a video for the Plasma 513

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,520
introduction.

314
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,960
So I'll have that linked in the show notes if you guys want to watch that.

315
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,360
That covers more stuff and shows screencasts and whatnot of all of that.

316
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,880
But big news for you, Popey, now that you're a big Plasma desktop user, you

317
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,920
must be looking forward to this.

318
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,680
Yeah, always.

319
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,040
I love just getting the fire hose of updates that come on KDE Neon because

320
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,760
because it's different for me because I'm used to Ubuntu where we have our six

321
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,560
monthly releases.

322
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,520
So I have to upgrade every six months in order to get new crack at the platform

323
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
level with KDE Neon.

324
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,920
I've got their PPA enabled or their repo enabled.

325
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,520
So I just get new stuff all the time and it's great.

326
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,040
I love it.

327
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,360
It kind of is because it's like it's the desktop stuff.

328
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,720
But your core OS is pretty much not changing much unless there's been some

329
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,080
upstream change from Ubuntu.

330
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,560
So it's kind of just the right balance in a weird way and surprisingly has not

331
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,520
broken yet for me.

332
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,760
You know, that's the other thing.

333
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,560
Sweet.

334
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,680
Always a bonus.

335
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,840
Has it broke for you at all?

336
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,680
Um, no.

337
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Oh, I was going to say it did right back at the start.

338
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,520
There was a, well, Kwin has crashed once, maybe twice, I think, but everything

339
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,200
carried on working.

340
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,480
All the applications are still running.

341
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,920
It's just the window decorations died and I just went to a TTY rerun Kwin and

342
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,560
carried on running.

343
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,480
And I carried on running for about a week with Kwin running in a TTY.

344
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,920
It was fine.

345
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,280
And it worked.

346
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,720
Yeah.

347
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
That's a testament right there.

348
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,760
The Neon updates will probably be flowing.

349
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,120
I have not tried to update my box yet because I'm doing the show right now, but

350
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,320
I think I will after the show.

351
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,840
Oh, you've learned.

352
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,560
Good job.

353
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,040
Good job.

354
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,520
I'm proud.

355
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,640
I am a little extra conservative about it when I'm on the road because like if

356
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,680
it breaks at the studio, well, I could probably just go grab another machine.

357
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,040
If it breaks while I'm on the road, I really am going to be in a, like, it'd

358
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,000
be kind of embarrassing to walk into Linux Academy with like my laptop in hand

359
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,640
and be like, uh, anybody have a thumb drive I can use?

360
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,760
That's, uh, it's not the direction I want that to go.

361
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,200
Poby, did you hear about these wine packs?

362
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,880
It reminds me just last week we talked about a couple of snaps that were quote

363
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,280
soaked in wine and now we have wine packs, which, uh, are just like the name sounds.

364
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,880
Uh, it's a packaging up of wine applications, a flat pack bundle, and

365
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,800
they have, um, Fortnite, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft as well as Internet

366
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Explorer 8, everyone's favorite browser.

367
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,080
Um, as, uh, I guess you could call it, uh, what do they call them?

368
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,240
Wine packs as a wine pack.

369
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,560
What are your thoughts?

370
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,960
I think these, um, these various, uh, tools for making containerized

371
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,320
applications are suited perfectly to this use case of having wine plus something.

372
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,640
And the reason why is often you want to have, um, a specific build of wine or a

373
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,880
specific tweaked set of additional libraries that you might install with

374
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,880
wine tricks, plus the application and that, that delicate balancing of all

375
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,280
those things someone needs to figure out and then get it all right and package it

376
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,640
all up and it works, but then you don't ever want to touch it and you don't want

377
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,040
to then, you know, update the version of wine or screw around with what's inside

378
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,680
that, that, um, that, you know, fake C drive as it were.

379
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,000
Um, and that's exactly what these containerized applications that you do,

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,240
you end up having the right version of wine and the right config for Fortnite

381
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,360
or whatever, the right version of wine and the right config for whatever other

382
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,000
game and they don't interfere with each other.

383
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,720
It's a great idea.

384
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,480
I like that.

385
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,600
And I wonder if this could be something that, um, that maybe crossover office

386
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,000
could jump on top of and, uh, bundle it with, uh, you know, bundle their

387
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,880
applications in a way or bundle wine applications in a way that make it even

388
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,520
easier for end users to install those.

389
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,160
That could be kind of a neat thing.

390
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,680
Yeah.

391
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,240
It really seems like it could open up this.

392
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm thinking about the number of people I've sort of, you know, uh, softly

393
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
pushed on the Linux.

394
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,280
Some of them are playing more games or trying to use some more, you know,

395
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,160
they're just doing more and sometimes that involves Windows programs.

396
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't want to teach them how to use wine.

397
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,160
So if I can point them at these things, that's so much better.

398
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,200
It makes it easier for them to get at, it's just, you know, click an icon or,

399
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,120
you know, download a flat pack or whatever, and just make it easy for

400
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,640
people to get all the necessary bits and pieces that make it work.

401
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm going to be curious to watch how many more of these we get with snaps too.

402
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:50,400
And, uh, I think, I think, uh, the, the whole concept is, is also potentially

403
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,720
a huge boom for piracy.

404
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,360
It could be, um, you know, you could go, you could, you could go pirate all

405
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,680
kinds of Windows applications.

406
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,160
If you can get it working right and get it in one of these, uh, containerized

407
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,560
application delivery mechanisms.

408
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,760
Well, that's already been done.

409
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,120
There are on pirate bay, there are a whole bunch of flat packs for

410
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,520
commercial, uh, Windows applications that have been bundled with wine.

411
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,600
That was done probably about eight months ago.

412
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,920
Um, but, you know, people will always bend technology to their will, even if

413
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,200
it's nefarious uses, unfortunately.

414
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,640
Yeah.

415
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,000
Um, and some ways maybe that's a way we can preserve software to way, way down

416
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,720
the road, so that'll be something interesting to watch.

417
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,080
Yeah.

418
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,960
I mean, uh, there's a, there's a mosaic snap in the store, so you can get the

419
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,360
original mosaic browser if you really, really, really want to, uh, yeah, just

420
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,680
do snap install mosaic and you can run the mosaic window, not a lot of websites

421
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,360
work with it because it's a very old web browser, but the original homepage for

422
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,680
the mosaic web browser does work.

423
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,560
And that's what it is, the homepage for that, that web browser.

424
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,880
So yeah, it is a great way to preserve software.

425
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,680
You can have it in a little container is not going to break out of that container.

426
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,280
And, um, you've got a little runtime environment that it will work in for, you

427
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,320
know, forever and for always.

428
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,240
No, hold on.

429
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,960
I got to do this.

430
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,440
This is too great right now.

431
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,600
I mean, I'm sorry if my connection gets a little shaky cause I'm going to, I'm

432
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,720
actually legitimately installing this right now as we go.

433
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,280
Well, we could use this mosaic browser isn't particularly large.

434
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,600
It's like 1.4 megs.

435
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,120
Yeah.

436
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,640
Right.

437
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,480
Oh, this is great.

438
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,080
Oh my, oh boy.

439
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,960
It's also a train wreck on high DPI.

440
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,440
Uh, surprise, surprise everybody.

441
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,640
Oh yeah, it will be.

442
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

443
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,880
I wonder if there's any webpage you can actually open on that.

444
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,960
There are a few.

445
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,760
You know what?

446
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,840
One of my favorite sites, one of the things that, uh, one of the great things

447
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,160
that I think GDPR brought us us citizens is a whole bunch of news websites,

448
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,560
can't figure out what to do, so they just threw their arms up and made text

449
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,240
versions of their websites, which is nothing on it, but the text NPR has done

450
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,160
this, CNN has done this, and it's the best thing ever.

451
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,600
In fact, if you want to try it, go to text.npr.org and it's just an all text

452
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,080
version.

453
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,640
Um, and I also, I tweeted a couple of days ago, this is what the CNN one is.

454
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,280
I want to try it in text.npr.org.

455
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's try it in the mosaic browser and see if it works.

456
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Are we going to fail on an SSL server?

457
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,280
I'd imagine.

458
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,480
Oh, it is.

459
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:07,760
Yep.

460
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,680
It's SSL.

461
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,000
Yep.

462
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,600
Damn.

463
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,680
That seemed like if anything was going to work, that would have worked.

464
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,640
But yeah, it's, you know, I hear that SSL can't be trusted, so they should

465
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,120
probably drop that cause I hear it's bad.

466
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,200
Oh, it's the worst.

467
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Just stay away from it.

468
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,200
I'll try out more.

469
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,520
Are you familiar with Gopher, Chris?

470
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,760
Cause that it's making a research.

471
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,680
So let me tell you.

472
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,080
Oh man.

473
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:25,600
Geez.

474
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,360
You, you just really showed your age there.

475
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
You want to talk about BBS's too while we're at it?

476
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,160
Oh, I thought that was on the docket already.

477
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,560
We always on the lookout.

478
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,920
For old crusty software that we can put in a stamp for a bit of a lull.

479
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,120
So yeah, if you have any ideas to, you know, where to find me.

480
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,960
Yeah, I love the idea too.

481
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,600
Cause it is in a way preserving old, old work.

482
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,680
We've been following this slow March to Linux apps landing on Chromebooks.

483
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,160
And last week we talked about how the Samsung Chromebook is getting Linux apps

484
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,040
support, even though it's an ARM based Chromebook.

485
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,800
That's a, that's just great news, but now it looks like a new Chromebook that's on

486
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,760
the market soon. Two actually that were introduced by Acer, the Chromebook 13

487
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,360
and the Chromebook Spin 13 are going to ship with this Linux app support.

488
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,560
So you guys recall Google revealed back at Google IO, we'd be covering it before

489
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,160
that even that Chrome OS would be adding support for running Linux apps within

490
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,960
Chrome OS's environment on certain select hardware because it involves as either

491
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,600
a certain modern version of the kernel or back porting certain kernel modules

492
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
and features to older versions.

493
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,800
Which is what's happening in some cases or in some cases like the Pixelbook, it

494
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,960
just has the newest version of the kernel and you're good to go if you get the

495
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
dev channel. Last week we discovered that if you subscribe to the dev channel on

496
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,520
the Samsung Chromebook Plus, you could get Linux apps.

497
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,280
And now, according to a commit that was spotted by the XDA developers, Acer's

498
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,800
new machines are going to support Linux apps at launch.

499
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,200
That's kind of a big deal.

500
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,480
So they're going to start from day one with Linux apps.

501
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,800
This is actually happening faster than I thought it would, Wes.

502
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,240
What are your thoughts? Does it seem like this is happening faster or is this about

503
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,920
what you thought it was going to be pace wise?

504
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,600
No, I agree with you.

505
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,600
It sort of felt like, OK, yeah, you know, the high end, high end stuff, the developer

506
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,400
focused stuff that's going to get this right away, the things that are already out

507
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,600
there and people are already using this sort of experimental machines on the bleeding

508
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,880
edge. Not something we'll see like launch right away or that people marketing

509
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,000
Chromebooks would necessarily think that a wide array of people, potential customers

510
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
might want. But, boy, this seems like, you know, the couple of news items we've

511
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,920
covered about this, it does seem to have some real momentum and like it's a feature

512
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,120
that's well designed enough or stable enough that they feel like they can ship it, not

513
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,000
have to worry about it. Sure, probably not a huge amount of people will use it right

514
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,360
away or at least won't know that they're using it.

515
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,160
But for the rest of us weird Linux nerds over here, it's awesome.

516
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes, weirdos. Eric, do you have a Chromebook?

517
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,480
And if you do or don't, would you consider getting one that has this Linux app support?

518
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,280
Yeah, I would definitely consider one.

519
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,120
I've been pricing out like XPS 13s and that kind of thing, but that's a little pricey

520
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,760
for my position right now. So a Chromebook might be a good way to get Linux, but not

521
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,760
at, you know, at a Cadillac price.

522
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,520
That's a good way to put it. I was thinking, too, it works well as sort of like my backup

523
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,640
Linux rig. You know, I can have I can have I can have maybe I can have a 15 inch laptop

524
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,960
and then I have a smaller Chromebook. That's sort of like my backup portable Linux rig.

525
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,680
You know, that'd be pretty nice. I think this might be the year that I buy a new

526
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,920
Chromebook. I've never, never have never bought a Chromebook. I've I've bought a used

527
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,120
Chromebook once. Of course, I played with my kids Chromebook, but I've never bought

528
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,880
a Chromebook. And so this might be the year that I finally break down and I do it.

529
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,160
What about you, Bobby? Would this put you over the edge for getting a Chromebook or

530
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,880
or a new one?

531
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,200
I actually picked up a Chromebook just last week. It was in amongst a bunch of stuff that

532
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,440
was being thrown out from the canonical offices. They were clearing out some some

533
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,200
cupboards. So I grabbed it and it's, it's quite neat, but it's out of support because

534
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,960
unfortunately, it's the very, very first Chromebook, the CR 48. So there's no chance

535
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,640
it's ever going to run Linux apps unless I wipe it and put something like Ubuntu, like

536
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,880
1310 on there or something really old and crusty.

537
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,200
I think that was the Chromebook I had. I think that was the same one. That was a

538
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,880
popular one. I don't remember why it was so popular. So yeah, I think I think I'm

539
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
going to I think I'm going to shop a little bit and I'm going to try it. Yes.

540
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,400
Check that out. Acer Chromebook. Yay. All right. So let's talk about something a

541
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,920
little sad, just a little bit. The Mars Opportunity Rover, which does have a Linux

542
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,720
angle, we'll talk about here in a second, is in danger of dying right now this week

543
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,520
from a dust storm. And engineers are delicately balancing the remaining battery

544
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,040
power. It's caught in a pretty significant dust storm. In fact, the most significant

545
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,360
I believe that it's ever been in. And if not, it's the second most significant and

546
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,160
the craft is hunkered down, trying to survive the intensifying weather. The storm

547
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,200
was first detected on Friday, June 1 by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, at which

548
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
point the rover's team was notified because whenever there's a large storm

549
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,560
near one of the rovers, they they page the team. The rover uses solar panels. So

550
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,440
a dust storm is going to have an extremely negative impact on the rover

551
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,960
opportunities, power levels and its batteries. I feel like I understand its

552
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,960
pain. You know, I feel like my rover also has suffered from similar situations.

553
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,240
Just a harsh universe out there and you got to protect yourself. And then on

554
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,240
June 6, Wednesday, June 6, opportunity was in minimal operations mode because of

555
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
the sharply decreasing power levels. Now, the brave little rover is continuing to

556
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
weather the storm. In fact, it sent a transmission to Earth Sunday morning. We

557
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,920
last heard from it, which is a good sign. So that means there's still enough

558
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,720
charge left in the batteries to communicate with home, despite the fact

559
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,640
that the storm is continuing to worsen. But the main concern isn't really the

560
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,600
dust storm itself. It's the need to keep the rover's heaters operating at a

561
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,400
minimum while maintaining minimal power levels in the batteries because it's so

562
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,000
cold. Opportunity, though, is a pretty hard little rover and maybe Linux has

563
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
contributed this a little bit. It's continually defied everyone's

564
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,640
expectations for 15 years. It was only designed to last for 90 days and it's

565
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,800
still going. So this, I mean, this is why it's such a kind of a big deal because

566
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,560
not only is it represent just a massive technological breakthrough for NASA and

567
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,960
it's just an incredible accomplishment, it's also representative of when NASA

568
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,600
and the Jet Propulsion Labs made the change to using Linux as their

569
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,800
development and control systems. Really? Yeah, it represents a really cool story

570
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,840
behind, the long term behind, the development story behind this rover was.

571
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,880
This wasn't going to be the rover initially. It was going to be a different

572
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,520
rover, completely going to be designed, controlled, managed, developed for using

573
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,440
all SGI systems. SGI top and bottom, SGI everything. But that mission took a

574
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,160
turning point and in the background, JPL and others had been experimenting with

575
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:20,400
Linux here and there. A Debian laptop had gone up on the space shuttle STS-83 in

576
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,800
97. So Debian went up into space in 97. But internally, they just weren't there

577
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,600
yet. But they had sort of like this skunk works project to move things off of

578
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,920
the SGI's and onto Linux box, onto a Linux box. And I've got the full story

579
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,440
from Linux journal from years ago linked in the show notes, but I'll just give

580
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
you the highlights of this piece. So they say, Linux originally was not intended

581
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
to be the primary development platform. Our software initially was intended for

582
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,360
use on the Mars 01 mission, which essentially would have been a repeat of

583
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,400
JPL's 97 Mars Pathfinder mission. The plan was to do all rover commanding on a

584
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,040
single Silicon Graphics workstation, as had been done on the Mars Pathfinder.

585
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,680
Our Linux support was, at that time, mainly a hedge against SGI's fortunes.

586
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,160
Wow. After the failure of JPL's Mars 98 missions, however, JPL replanned its

587
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,960
Mars strategy. The Mars 01 plans were scrapped in favor of a later launch. That

588
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,200
mission later on became the MER mission, M-E-R. The upshot was that we got two

589
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,160
years of development time that we hadn't planned on. Although it was for a

590
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,760
different spacecraft than we had planned, we had two years. In those two years,

591
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,040
Linux and the generic x86 hardware it runs on made enormous strides in both

592
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,200
CPU and graphics speeds, thanks in no small part to the graphics shipmaker

593
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:46,000
NVIDIA and its strong support for Linux on the enterprise systems. As a result,

594
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
we increasingly came to favor the faster, better, cheaper solution that was Linux.

595
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
We eventually purchased two high-end SGI's to add to our Linux boxes during

596
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,040
flight operations, but it's unclear whether we ended up using them. The Linux

597
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,960
boxes now give us equal, if not better, performance. And as a result, the MER

598
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,320
rovers are being commanded by multiple teams working in parallel on dozens of

599
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,040
Linux systems that we purchased for the mission. And now that's for 17 years

600
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,400
they've been doing this. Our software suite of applications called the Rover

601
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Sequencing and Visualization Program, RSVP for short, was developed, tested,

602
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,720
and deployed on Linux. RSVP gives MER engineers and scientists sophisticated

603
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,440
tools for commanding Mars rovers. Because of the lengthy light time delays,

604
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,680
which amount to nearly 20 minutes round trip, it's not possible to control the

605
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,800
rovers interactively. RSVP provides an immersive environment that accurately

606
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,560
displays the rover's environment and simulates its behavior. Throughout the

607
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,000
Martian night, we Earthlings use RSVP to plan a days of activities at the

608
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,400
command level and then uplink the resulting commands to the rover. The

609
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,440
rover then executes those commands during the following Martian day. So

610
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,400
there's two main components of RSVP. The Rover Sequencing Editor, which provides

611
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,280
text oriented commanding for all spacecraft commands, and Hyperdrive, which

612
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,800
provides an advanced three dimensional graphics for driving, arm motion, and

613
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,680
imaging commands. I think we call that AR these days, Wes.

614
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,800
We sure do.

615
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,600
And they say also the messages is based on RML, an XML based specification

616
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,080
designed specifically for representing rover commands and sequences. And they

617
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,280
have so much more detail in the article. But they say the automation friendly

618
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,080
Linux environment contributed greatly to the whole system's reliability. Early on

619
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,400
we wrote extensive self-tests to code, to test our code, and then set up a simple

620
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,480
cron job to run the tests every night. If any self-test failed, they were

621
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,040
reported an email message to the developer the next morning. This helped

622
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,400
us catch bugs early, while the changes that it caused them were still fresh in

623
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,640
our minds. Our aggressive self-testing was something of an experiment, and it

624
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,280
paid off handsomely. How about that?

625
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,200
This is an incredible article, and what a story. I think you really hit on it.

626
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,240
It's like the rovers have been so cool and given us such a new understanding of

627
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,240
this, you know, this neighbor in our solar system, and that you can make it all

628
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,400
happen with the technology we already think is great and use and love. And it

629
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,520
just sells Linux so well, right? You don't have to make sure that you've

630
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,480
budgeted accurately for the number of machines that you hope that you actually

631
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,240
need and all the licenses to run them. If you can get commodity parts, you can

632
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,960
just stick more Linux on it, have multiple people working on the same

633
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,800
thing, not a problem. And it's so interesting that it kind of started as

634
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,000
like this little side skunkworks hedge, and then as time went on, it's like,

635
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,440
wait a minute, this thing has just surpassed what we originally hedging

636
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,560
against. That's so Linux. That's such a Linux thing to do.

637
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,360
It is a Linux thing to do, right? You're like, well, it's free, so you can kind of

638
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,560
sneak it in. Oh, we're just running the test server on it. Oh, yeah, the backup

639
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,080
system, it's fine. And then you realize it's just easier to work with.

640
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,360
I met some Linux journal people at Texas Linux Fest, actually.

641
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,520
Is that right? Yeah, speaking of Texas Fest, they had a booth. They were

642
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,000
giving away posters and things like that. We'll talk about that in a minute.

643
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,560
So what we just did there is kind of a new format. We just did everything just

644
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,960
all back together, no stopping, no interruptions. We just did all of the

645
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,920
news right there. And now I want to stop and I want to do a sponsor block

646
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,720
because our sponsors are doing a lot of cool things this week, and you're going

647
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,280
to need links for some of this stuff. And so what we're going to do is we're

648
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,000
going to do all of them right here. And then the rest of the show, we just

649
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,640
continue on. And I want to get your feedback on if you like this because I

650
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,080
know, A, some of you have heard this before. So that makes it a little easier

651
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,160
to navigate. And B, when we talk about some of the stuff our sponsors are

652
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,440
doing, there's no clear place where in the show you go get those links.

653
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,720
So let's start by thanking Linux Academy because that's where I'm parked at

654
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,320
right now. Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged is where you go to sign up

655
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,160
for a free seven day trial. Linux Academy can help change your life through

656
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,760
affordable, high quality online cloud training. You can learn new skills, get

657
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,280
certified and train your team and advance your career. We heard from

658
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,720
several people at Texas Linux Fest who said their whole IT department has an

659
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,000
account. And a lot of people said, I just got one because I'm learning to go

660
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,320
somewhere. I'm trying to get into security. I'm trying to get into cloud

661
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,920
computing. I'm trying to wrap my head around how the Google Cloud works. It's

662
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,240
really fascinating all the different reasons people get into it. But the one

663
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
thing that remains true is that it's extremely valuable, extremely valuable

664
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,000
resource. It's a training platform to learn everything about Linux and

665
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,040
whatever Linux runs on. And back in April, they launched 70 new courses,

666
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,680
challenges and learning activities. And I mentioned it here on the show. And

667
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,600
that was a big deal. 70 is huge. It's a lot of content. And now that I'm here,

668
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,200
I have learned, little bird, I won't say much, but little birdies have been

669
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:47,520
telling me they are all focused on July. They have, they have a lot of content

670
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,200
coming out in July. Their biggest ever. It's going to be a ton of stuff. They've

671
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,760
already kind of been teasing it a little bit, including their newest pillar,

672
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,800
security. They're going to be launching a bunch of security courses and they're

673
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,920
doing a giveaway to celebrate all of it. So I'm going to put a link in the blog,

674
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,760
I'm going to put a link to their blog in our show notes at linuxunplug.com

675
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,920
slash 253. So you can get in on the swag giveaway and find out about the new

676
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,800
content that's coming out. It's massive. And to watch the whole team work on it

677
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,200
as they are from, from art people to developers, to the course authors, to the

678
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,960
executives and the admins, to the marketing folks and to the community

679
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,600
people that are trying to get the word out there. Like everybody's focused on

680
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,440
this because it's just a huge launch. It's massive. It'll blow your mind away

681
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,720
and they're really proud of it. So go to Linux Academy right now. You can sign up

682
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,480
for a free seven day trial. Try out the platform and then next month a whole

683
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,240
bunch of stuff is going to land. Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. That's

684
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,480
where you go to support the show and get a free seven day trial. Now Ting, Ting

685
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,960
has been providing my connectivity on this entire trip from the moment I left

686
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,960
Washington to right now. They have been a rock solid mobile carrier. They're smarter

687
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,360
than unlimited. If you use less, you pay less. You can go to linux.ting.com and

688
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,800
get $25 in Ting service credit or $25 off a phone. That's linux.ting.com. The

689
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,360
average bill is $23 per month per phone. You pay for what you use. A fair price

690
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,880
for however much you talk, however much you text, and however much data you use.

691
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,160
So this month my data bill is going to be more. But for the other 11 months of

692
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,880
the year, I pay hardly anything for data because I have Wi-Fi everywhere I go and

693
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,120
they have nationwide coverage. I've been able to use CDMA and GSM. Where I'm at

694
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,640
right now is a GSM town. It's a GSM town. It's been working just fine. But

695
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,280
sometimes CDMA works a little better, especially when I was in Utah. I found

696
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,600
that CDMA just worked a lot better. No contracts, nor the termination fees. You

697
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,360
can try Ting risk free and you can support the show. Linux.ting.com. They

698
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,400
give you a control panel where you can manage everything, see your usage at a

699
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,880
glance, take complete control, set usage alerts. Oh, oh, and they're doing some

700
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,320
giveaways. They have a lot of things going on. But the thing I'm going to

701
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,520
direct you to, because you've heard me do these ads before. You could probably do

702
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,640
this ad and you could make some money. Ting is doing a $100 Amazon gift card.

703
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,080
If you refer a friend or family member, you know, whoever, maybe a child.

704
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,520
You know, convince your eight-year-old. No, I'm kidding. You can't do that. Yeah.

705
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,120
Refer a friend to Ting and you win a chance to win. You get a chance to win

706
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,880
$100 in Ting gift card, Amazon cards from Ting. And you just take all the things

707
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,080
I've told you about Ting. You pay for what you use. Take your ministry message,

708
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,520
your megabytes, whatever you use. That's what you pay. $6 a month for the line. No

709
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,600
contract, nor the termination fee. Great company. Fanatical customer support.

710
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,720
CDMA and GSM. You can bring your own device or you can buy one directly. They

711
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,160
got no agenda. They don't necessarily care what you do with your device. Just

712
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,480
use it. They're not going to try to push some sort of Ting experience down on

713
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,000
your device. You say all those things and then you give them a link and you're

714
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,640
probably going to get this $100 card because you're going to sell it. You're

715
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,840
going to sell it. I know you. Start by going to linux.ting.com, either for

716
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,360
yourself or a friend or a family or if you're visiting the States. I've met

717
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,240
people traveling. They come here, they get themselves Ting and they use it while

718
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,080
they're here because it's $6 a month. Why not? It's great. I love having it. I

719
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,920
love having it. I have a CDMA and GSM now just to make it easy. I'm not

720
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,240
activating devices or nothing. They're just ready to go. linux.ting.com.

721
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,000
And finally today, big thank you to DigitalOcean. Making changes everywhere

722
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,280
in the open source community and they're making it possible for you to build

723
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,880
better applications and get things deployed in incredible speeds at

724
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,360
industry leading price performance and predictable costs. Start by going to

725
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,280
do.co.plugged. You get a $100 credit. You can apply that to your DigitalOcean

726
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,280
account and you can mess around with a new account for 60 days with a $100

727
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,880
credit. My favorite rig is $0.03 an hour. So a $100 credit is going to get you

728
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,760
far and they have incredibly fast infrastructure, enterprise grade SSDs on

729
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,400
everything from like the $5 a month rig up to the big mama jamas that have

730
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,960
hundreds of gigs of RAM and Xeons for days. Oh, and they now have flexible

731
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,200
droplets. You can mix and match the resources you need. I've got a Fedora 28

732
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,920
box running up on DigitalOcean using 250 gigs-ish of block storage. It's so

733
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,000
smooth the way all of this works. When you set up a Fedora 28 cloud instance,

734
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,440
you immediately connect your SSH key. You get the DNS all set up if you do it

735
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,000
like I do and you just log right in and get working. It's so straightforward

736
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,440
because of this dashboard. They make managing all this stuff simple even if

737
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,960
you've never done it before or if you've done it for a decade. So check it out by

738
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,920
going to do.co.plugged. Cloud firewalls that block traffic at the network level,

739
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,440
monitoring and alerting to keep you on top of what your rig is doing. Easy to

740
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,520
use, well-documented API and tons and tons of documentation. Speaking of that

741
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,880
documentation, I've told you in the past that DigitalOcean is willing to pay

742
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,720
folks that write really good documentation for DigitalOcean. Well, now

743
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,360
they're introducing something different. So I'm going to put this link in the

744
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:51,040
show notes as well. You can now write for DO-nations, for DO-nations. Okay,

745
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,800
sorry, but that's the joke. You can actually now write for DigitalOcean and

746
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,560
then what they were going to pay you contribute to an open source project or

747
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,920
a charity. For example, there's an article I have linked in the show notes,

748
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,880
how to verify downloaded files that you download on your Linux box like an

749
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:14,000
ISO. That was written by Michael Holly and he donated his $300 writer's fee to

750
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,480
the Electronic Frontier Foundation. So you can go write up something that you're

751
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,240
a technical expert on and then contribute out to a charitable donation.

752
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,800
And they're going to match too. I think they'll match up to $400, something like

753
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,360
I can't remember. So if you want to, anyways, the details I'll have linked in

754
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,480
the show notes. I think this is a super cool program. It's definitely worth

755
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,720
reading if that's something that you could possibly be good at. It could be a

756
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,560
great way to contribute documentation to a community and contribute to a charity

757
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,360
or an open source project that you like. So I'll have that linked in the show

758
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,000
notes as well. Everybody's got something going on. It's just a big, great week.

759
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,920
Check it all out and get started by going to do.co.pl and get that free $100

760
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,320
credit for 60 days, do.co.pl. Unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean, to

761
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,360
Ting, and of course to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

762
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,920
Okay, moving on now. Let's talk about Texas Linux Fest. What a hell of a party.

763
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,320
So it looks like Omnipotent had to leave. He joined me there along with a whole

764
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,680
bunch of people. We had such a great time. So let me tell you a little bit about

765
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,280
it. We won't spend too long on it, but it'll be real quick. Texas Linux Fest

766
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,840
2018 was held at the AT&T Conference Center in Austin, Texas on Friday, June

767
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:34,240
8th to Saturday, June 9th. And it was a hell of a party. Oh, Ironic Badger. Oh,

768
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,880
where are you? Hello. Hello. I'm in Denver today. You are? Well, you're good

769
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,240
to see you. Good to see you. How are you doing? How's the road been? How's the

770
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,240
trip been? Are you recovered? Are you still hung over? How has it all gone?

771
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,120
2,000 miles in two days for a British man. That's all I'll say.

772
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah, that is a lot for you. Yeah, you've done a ton of driving. Welcome to the

773
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,080
States. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's awesome. Alex, Mr. Badger there, has been

774
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,280
traveling around looking for reasons for places perhaps. And he joined us at

775
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,160
Texas Linux Fest. He made quite, I think you win for probably making the

776
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,160
furthest track to Texas Linux Fest. Thank you. Is there a prize?

777
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:20,720
Um, no. The barbecue, I guess. It was, it was so, yeah, bragging rights. How good

778
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,240
was that barbecue? Life changing barbecue. Life changing. Like people talk

779
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,520
about barbecue a lot, about Texas and barbecue. It's next level. You agree? Well,

780
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,280
I wrote a blog post about it and I used the same phrase, life changingly good. So

781
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,120
yeah, I do agree. Okay, good. It was, it was amazing. It was incredible. And it's

782
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,480
one of the funny things about Austin is if you're hanging out with Austin locals,

783
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,280
they're really passionate about discussing the best place to get food. And

784
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,560
that might just be a Texas thing because we were in the hallway here at Linux

785
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,000
Academy talking about where to get lunch and people stopped by to give us their

786
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,320
two on where we should go. It seems to be food is important in Texas and I can

787
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,640
respect that. I really can. About 500 people made it out to Texas Linux Fest.

788
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,720
There was roughly about like three to five tracks going on at the same time.

789
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,560
Really good talks. In fact, I heard a lot of people saying they're having a hard

790
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,600
time choosing which one they wanted to go to. I attended a few. Wes, I went to

791
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,840
a talk about how BPF is being used to do like Linux kernel tracing and stuff

792
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,520
like that. Oh, that sounds fascinating. Yeah, the BPF talk was probably my

793
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,560
favorite. Yeah, I was kind of creeping on the whole you guys down at the fest.

794
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,080
I looked like there were a ton of great talks. I would have had the same problem.

795
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,480
And that's always a good sign when you're at a conference, right? I mean,

796
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,680
it's a little upsetting because you can't go to every single one of them, but you

797
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,120
know it's packed. There's no filler content. Yeah, yeah, that's a good way to

798
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,080
put it. And I liked also the talk. So you've been home. So you've been pwned

799
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,400
like what to do in the next 30 minutes or something like that. I can't remember

800
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,360
what it was. It was a it was a good one. You could text nappy kind of

801
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,240
absolutely talk. Lots of lots of lots of tech snap fans there. Tons and tons of

802
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,720
Linux unplugged and Linux action news fans. That was so awesome. Every night we

803
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,360
had probably about three parties. Really, it was one of those things where you'd

804
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,560
go out and then you go out again and then the group would break off again and

805
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,920
they'd be like three separate parties. The first night we went out, it was I

806
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,960
mean, we probably had a group of 40. I don't know. I'm guessing it was huge and

807
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,720
it was because Linux Academy bought out the hotel bar and paid an obscene amount

808
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,520
of money and drinks for everybody were on Linux Academy, which was amazing.

809
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,480
So generous. There's no way I was going to cover that tab. And then and then we

810
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,680
went out to like another place. Alex, you don't remember the name of the place

811
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,480
that was on the lake, do you? It was the Hula Hut. The Hula Hut. What a place the

812
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,880
Hula Hut was. Great drinks, great atmosphere, right on a lake. And so we

813
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,760
hung out at the Hula Hut for a bit with the Linux Academy crew and another

814
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,680
group of the Jupiter Broadcasting Group. And then then from there we went to a

815
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,200
brewery where we got a little minor brewery tourie tourie and drank some

816
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,160
great ciders and shut that place down and then went home. And Saturday night

817
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,880
was the barbecue shenanigans, which were just life changing. My first thought

818
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,920
after I ate that barbecue and I'm 100% serious and I did not expect this

819
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,200
reaction was a shit. Now what am I going to do now? I have to come up with some

820
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,560
excuse to come down here soon so I can eat this barbecue again because it was

821
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,800
like I have to be back here. There's just no no question about it. So that was

822
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,360
Saturday. We did a bunch of festing and then we went out. Oh man, I can't even

823
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,560
remember. Oh Saturday we went and got some horrible pizza I think and fried

824
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,760
food. That was pretty awful. But then a few of us like Alex, we went back and

825
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,800
hung out at Lady Jupes for a while. That was pretty great. That was a lot of fun.

826
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,200
It was good to see Lady Jupes in person that's for sure.

827
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,520
Now I think it was a total blast. People take their food very seriously and so do

828
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,360
I. The whole thing was so much fun. I've adapted to the heat. I'm damn near ready

829
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,760
to move to Texas at this point. I really had a great time. It's definitely hot,

830
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,200
but for some reason it doesn't matter. You know what I mean? It's because you're

831
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,720
having such a good time you don't care. That first cafe we walked to for like 30

832
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,920
minutes Friday was the most brutal of the whole trip really. That was rough.

833
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,920
Yeah, exercising in that heat is not a good idea. No, Alex and I are both used

834
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,120
to around Seattle and London style climates so walking around in 100

835
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,520
degree sun beating right on you was quite intense. But everybody takes their

836
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,600
AC very seriously so once you get inside there is some sweet, sweet relief.

837
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:44,400
There was a thread on our Linux. Your favorite. I attended Texas Linux Fest.

838
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,440
Where's the Linux? And they're calling out people for being at Texas Linux Fest

839
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,040
and not using Linux to present, including they call it somebody from Linux Academy,

840
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,360
although I don't know who it is, and several others for using Macs and whatnot.

841
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,960
And it's got a decent amount of upvotes, 529 votes. It's got something like damn near

842
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,520
345 comments. And it's this old boogeyman that we have in the Linux community

843
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,920
where we'll collapse an entire person or an entire company down to a single

844
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,600
variable and we'll say anyone at company X is not using Linux, therefore that

845
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,480
company is disingenuous. Or that presenter isn't using Linux, they're using a Mac,

846
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,320
so therefore they're not a very good presenter for a Linux event. And it's

847
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,760
almost bigoted in a way if you think about it. Because say you take away Mac

848
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,680
user and say they're because they're white or because they're bald. Now all

849
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,320
of a sudden that's a real asshole thing to do. Now you're a dick. But when you

850
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,400
replace that variable with Linux, that's a perfectly fine thing to do apparently.

851
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,320
And it's kind of sick. It's kind of gross. It's something that I think if you

852
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,520
were coming into the Linux community and you saw that, it would kind of disgust

853
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,360
you a little bit. And I think it's because of insecurity. I think people are

854
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,880
looking to those people to be validated, to have their choices validated. And

855
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,760
when they don't have their choices validated, they're looking for, well,

856
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,120
what's wrong with this person? Why wasn't that what I expected? Why am I not

857
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,640
wrong and they are right? That's of course me playing armchair podcast therapist.

858
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,640
If you look at one of the comments, Chris, it says Linux Academy have invited

859
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,160
Chris from JB to come and convert their broadcasting workflow. The next comment

860
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,200
says, but they are an academy, so why do they need help from somebody else? Isn't

861
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,600
that the point of the open source community to share ideas and collaborate?

862
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,560
Yeah, help each other.

863
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,640
I just don't understand the hate. I don't get it.

864
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,680
Yeah. And, you know, it doesn't make you an expert on every topic, does it Wes?

865
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,040
But no, no, not at all. Right. And I think we Linux desktop users obviously

866
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,360
like that, want to promote it. And that does usually get, or at least historically

867
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,280
has gotten a fair amount of time at these, these Linux meetups and events.

868
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,600
But especially if you just have, you know, Texas Linux fest, that doesn't

869
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,240
necessarily mean it has to be desktop Linux. It doesn't really have to mean

870
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,640
anything else. And shouldn't we try to be an inclusive community of, hey,

871
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,680
we want whatever you like. Maybe you, maybe you started on the server. You

872
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,720
love using your Mac on a desktop. It works really well, especially with the

873
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,400
corporate provided PowerPoint that you're required to use or, or whatever else.

874
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,920
And just try to show that, Hey, look at all these, you know, if you come to the

875
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,880
conference and see a bunch of other people presenting on ThinkPads or see

876
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,240
people with ThinkPads showing you how great they are, that's one way to do it.

877
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,720
And complaining about it probably won't get very far.

878
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,680
Well said. Good point. And what do you think about this idea that if we bury

879
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,400
our heads in the sand and say, none of us ever use a Mac or nobody ever tries

880
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,120
Adobe premier, they only use Katie and live or they, they never try anything

881
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,560
on windows. They've never even booted windows. Are they an expert that you

882
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,960
want to hear their opinion on topics from? I mean, like, aren't they missing a

883
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,040
huge data point? Can they be trusted? What do you think of that, Wes?

884
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,480
You do need to be aware of what alternative workflows actually exist. If

885
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,440
you're going to speak to them, especially if you're coming from a world where

886
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,040
people are already using those workflows, it's much easier, especially in the open

887
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,480
source side. If you just have never touched the proprietary stuff. And sometimes,

888
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,000
honestly, I've had it in my life where I just avoid it. You know, I don't need

889
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,200
that. I know that if I try it, I'll probably get hooked and I'll start wanting to

890
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,000
use that service instead of whatever open source tool I'm using.

891
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,360
Yeah, that's the slippery slope.

892
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,880
It really is. And that can be fine, right? We've talked a lot on the show about

893
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,840
sometimes it makes sense to pay for things, even if they're proprietary for

894
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,760
your own personal life. Be pure when you can support open source when you can.

895
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,080
But none of us are perfect. And then especially going the other way, once

896
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,200
you've established a workflow, especially if you're using it for some sort of

897
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,960
commercial endeavor for your business at your workplace, you can't just change

898
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,760
because you want to. You have to be able to change because it actually works or

899
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,840
maybe is even better. Yeah. Yeah, true that. Eric, you have to use what you use

900
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,800
a Mac or Windows for your day job. Do you find that gives you a good contrast

901
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,080
of point of comparison?

902
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:12,400
So when I first started this job, I was issued a Dell laptop running Windows

903
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,400
7. They announced shortly thereafter that they moved moving to Windows 10,

904
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:23,200
which is OK for the two games I played twice a month here at home. But as far

905
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,760
as a work system, Windows 10 just isn't isn't there at all as a Linux server

906
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,400
engineer. So I was able to request a MacBook Pro, which I liked my 2015

907
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,840
MacBook, but they issued me one of the one of the one of the touchpad

908
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,160
MacBooks with the new keyboards that feel like you're just pounding on

909
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,080
concrete. But having having all three operating systems around me, I'm a

910
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,080
Linux server engineer and then I'm actually talking to you guys from my

911
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,360
from my custom built arch PC at home. So I feel like at least having some

912
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,760
exposure to all three platforms really gives me an appreciation and really

913
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,680
gives me a drive to work on what what tools can I port over to my Linux

914
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,720
system? Because yeah, I hear I may be I may be running arch, but it's still

915
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,360
the most stable platform of all three operating systems I work on.

916
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,240
Yeah, OK, that makes sense. It sort of drives you to keep pushing it forward.

917
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,480
So Poby, I'd love to hear your perspective on this because rumor has it

918
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,480
there may be a Mac user to a canonical. Someone may be using arch even at

919
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,000
canonical. So this is a controversy that you've witnessed not just a canonical,

920
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,400
but all over the place. What are your thoughts on a don't you kind of isn't

921
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,680
it isn't it good every now and then to like look at a Mac and see how they do

922
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,200
it when you're when you're working on, say, creating software for the Linux

923
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,960
desktop? Because that's good, valuable experience. And B, what about this

924
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,800
whole attitude around the whole thing? So it's not controversial at canonical

925
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,560
because we've never had a policy where you have to run Ubuntu. You run

926
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,600
whatever you need to run because actually the computer is your own. The

927
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,840
company doesn't provide you with a computer. You get a

928
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,320
chunk of money periodically and you go buy whatever you want. Soon as you

929
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,000
do your job, nobody cares what you're running on your desktop. And so that

930
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,360
means some people are running Ubuntu. Some people actually aren't running

931
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,160
Ubuntu. And that might mean they're running some other Linux distro. It

932
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,440
might be in there running a different desktop or it might be in there running

933
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,400
a Mac. And many of those people who are using Macs are using Macs because the

934
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,720
software they need to use to do their job is not available on Linux. End of

935
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,960
story. And no, GIMP and Inkscape are not alternatives. So yes, those people,

936
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,680
some of those people work in design, but some of them aren't. Some of them are

937
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,680
server people or DevOps people and they run OS 10 on a on a Mac because they

938
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,840
prefer that laptop and they do all their Linuxy stuff in VMs or on remote

939
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,080
machines. They're not part of the desktop team. So there's no real reason

940
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,400
why they should have to run Ubuntu desktop. So you may see someone who

941
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,920
works for Canonical on the server side or the cloud side who uses OS 10,

942
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,200
but it's their laptop. It's their choice. They can do whatever they want with it

943
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,560
so long as they get the job done. Personally, I can see why people have

944
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,840
this need to point out that if you're an ambassador of a distro or an

945
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,840
ambassador of a product, it makes sense for you to use it. You would never see

946
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,680
someone who works for Coke on stage drinking Pepsi. It's no different than

947
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:32,960
that, really. But if your role is in PR, you're making a massive faux pas by

948
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,240
doing that Coke Pepsi thing. But if that's not your job, if your job is

949
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,440
working on something that's completely unrelated to the Linux desktop and is

950
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,440
like a server component or an application that runs on a server, then

951
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,320
all bets are off. It's up to you what you run on it. So I think it's a little

952
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:58,640
ridiculous that people go hunting down people who are running something other

953
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,560
than the thing they want to run, right? And these same people are the people

954
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,320
who will reboot into Windows in order to run Steam and they're allowed to do

955
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,520
it, but you're not. And I don't like that attitude.

956
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,520
That's a good point too. Yeah, I think my wrapping thoughts are really around

957
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,800
this whole thing is it just makes really good practical sense to stick with

958
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:24,160
free and open source software. And it isn't necessarily worth like going to

959
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,200
the pitchforks when somebody is talking about Linux from a Mac because there

960
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,800
were other presenters that were using, I don't even know what kind of hardware

961
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,240
it was. It was ARM-based eclectic self-built small batch computers that

962
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,040
were like you had wires running to an HDMI port. And I didn't see a Reddit

963
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,720
thread started about that, but those are running Linux. So it's I think

964
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,360
important to keep in mind that you want to have an informed opinion,

965
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,080
especially if you're going to have a strong one. I have a strong preference,

966
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,600
for example, for iOS over Android. Not a big fan of it. Just think iOS is

967
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,080
slightly better. Think Android slightly worse. I think there's also serious

968
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,320
privacy trade-offs with Android versus iOS. That's a position I'm perfectly

969
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,040
comfortable defending because I've owned an Android device. I still own

970
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,120
Android devices. I've bought many many Android devices. I know how to use

971
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,160
Android very well. I'm a very competent Android user. So my preference for

972
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:32,480
iOS is based on my direct experience using Android. I feel like that's a good

973
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,200
thing because at least you know I've tried it. I'm not sitting here espousing

974
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,000
how great Siri is without trying the Echo. I'm not telling you that I think

975
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,840
iOS is better without ever trying an Android device. That would make me an

976
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,080
idiot. It's important that we don't lose sight, that we can't just white watch

977
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,280
the world and have everyone on Chromebooks or everyone on a Linux

978
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,160
desktop and pretend like Windows and Macs don't exist. Because the reality is

979
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,240
they do exist. So we have to know how to interact with them. We have to know how

980
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,520
to support them. And we have to know where we're deficient so we can make up

981
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,880
our deficiencies. And when you're committing, when you're trying to

982
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,640
convince someone to switch over to a free or open source software product,

983
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,160
and if it has deficiencies, if it does not have equivalent functionality to the

984
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,840
proprietary thing you're switching them to, you're going to lose credibility if

985
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,880
you don't tell people that. If they get over and then they discover, it's going

986
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,440
to leave a bad taste in their mouth and it's probably going to push them back

987
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,080
into the arms of commercial software harder and probably forever.

988
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,960
Exactly. Yeah, right. And it's the wrong perspective. Especially if you're

989
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,520
trying to convince someone, the nice thing to do is have a conversation. So

990
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,280
maybe we can have a conversation about this topic as like, why did we not see

991
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,360
more Linux laptops in presentations? And instead of being antagonistic or

992
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,760
an interrogation, it can be a conversation. And if you start from the

993
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,880
place of, hey, what are your workflows? I'm curious if maybe Linux could do

994
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,480
those better instead of, or just try to understand why they think a Mac works

995
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,840
well from them. That's very different. Is it a projector thing? Is it a slide

996
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,520
software thing? What is it? What are we not, what are we not proficient enough

997
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,760
in? We don't know. We don't know. It's a great point, Wes. Okay. So Tyler,

998
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,880
if you're at the mic, I'd love to hear how self went about maybe, do you

999
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,800
know about how many people were there? Yeah, I couldn't give an exact number,

1000
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,960
but definitely a healthy crowd. Pretty much filled the room during the keynote

1001
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,680
talk that Jeremy gave. And that was a good talk going over the last 10 years

1002
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:27,280
itself. He had plenty of funny anecdotes, especially stories about, including a

1003
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,400
story about a wedding that went on one of the years that they had the

1004
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:37,200
conference at a hotel. That's great. And was there a fair amount of vendors?

1005
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:42,000
From what I understand, there were fewer than there was last year from what I

1006
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,880
was told. And I think that's probably due to the overlapping in schedules with

1007
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,960
the conferences like Texas Linux Fest. So he didn't want to step on too many

1008
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,200
toes on that one. Yeah, I think that costs Texas Linux Fest a few vendors as

1009
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,080
well. And that really, I think the reason why it was going down at the same time

1010
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,600
came down to like venue scheduling or something really benign that ends up

1011
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,320
just totally being like, what was everybody thinking? It's really kind of

1012
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:10,160
a shame. So now do you regret skipping Linux Fest Northwest or do you think it

1013
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,880
was good to balance it out this week or this year? I think it was definitely

1014
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,000
good to balance it out this year. But having experienced both now, I am

1015
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,800
definitely returning to Self next year. Really? Yeah. Okay. Good plug for Self.

1016
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,760
Very nice. Maybe I'll go. So Mr. Popey, how was Floss Talk? A good get together

1017
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,880
of Linux podcasters drinking beer in a small, intimate venue. Must've been fun.

1018
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,600
Yes. Actually, it's Foss Talk. Oh yeah, thank you. Yeah. Foss Talk Live. It's

1019
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:43,040
organized by the internet's Joe Ressington. And this is a third one, I think.

1020
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,320
We went along as in the people who run Ubuntu podcast, Joe and the guys from

1021
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,440
Late Light Linux, and there's the guys from Linux Voice go along. And also

1022
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,240
there's a drunken mashup show at the end of the evening, which is variable

1023
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,200
quality, but was excellent this year, much better than they've redeemed

1024
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,640
themselves from last year. And there's a podcast recording then a break and

1025
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,680
a podcast recording then a break. So everyone gets to clear out and go and

1026
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:15,520
get another beer and then come back down into the very small cozy basement

1027
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,160
where we record the shows. And it's very intimate. There's some familiar faces

1028
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:25,120
that turn up in the audience and also some new people each time. It's lovely.

1029
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:29,360
It's really, really good fun. It's a really nice way to just have an evening

1030
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,800
out with some friends and record some silly podcasts. It's good fun.

1031
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,600
Yes, that does sound like good fun. And yes, Floss Talk, of course, is

1032
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,400
Randall Schwartz's show that I get stuck in my head because my brain does

1033
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,400
not have enough room for words. Now, I know that Joe's already put out

1034
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,520
his Late Night Linux of the talk there, and it was good. I won't lie.

1035
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,480
It made me a little bummed because the topics they chose were all the guys

1036
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,000
had very, I thought, clear analysis of challenges facing Linux. And it

1037
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,040
actually kind of motivated me to kind of want to try to fix it. Some of the

1038
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,640
things they talked about around marketing and all of that. So anyways,

1039
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,760
their episode was out. I'm assuming an Ubuntu podcast must be coming soon.

1040
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,360
Yep. Ours will go out at 3pm UK time on Thursday. We were on immediately

1041
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:21,520
after them. They were our warm up act. And we were a lot more upbeat, I think.

1042
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,440
You bring the mood up? Good. I should have known.

1043
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,080
We lifted the mood a little bit. So yeah, look out for that on our website on

1044
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:28,560
Thursday.

1045
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,040
I should have stacked them. That would have been better to stack them in my

1046
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,200
podcast player if I had known because I was like, oh, all right, we can fix

1047
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,160
this. It was kind of motivating, though. So it was good. I'm really glad that

1048
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,920
that happened. One of these days, although they're at Texas Linux Fest,

1049
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,360
there were several people saying, go to Fosdom, go to Fosdom, go to Fosdom.

1050
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,400
That's the thing to go to. So that may be in my future as well.

1051
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,960
Yes, go to Fosdom. It's amazing.

1052
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,280
So this must be your first US Fest, Alex.

1053
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,800
First time I've been to anything outside Europe, yeah. But Fosdom,

1054
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,080
you should definitely go to Fosdom.

1055
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,480
All right. There you go. Another plug for Fosdom. It might just happen.

1056
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,000
I'll go with you. You and I will both go, Wes. We'll go over there. We'll do

1057
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,040
like a Wes and Chris tour of London.

1058
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,520
Or Storm Europe.

1059
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,440
So start drinking your water now because we're probably going to be

1060
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,640
drinking a lot of beer. Yeah. Wes and Chris, Storm Europe.

1061
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,360
Fosdom's in Brussels, so you get great beer and great waffles.

1062
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,720
Ooh. Oh my, oh my.

1063
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:34,640
Yep. So I'll be fasting pretty soon to make up for the tons and tons and tons of eating

1064
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,360
because there has just been... I mean, what else are you going to do when you're in Texas?

1065
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,840
Yeah. I think you're 90% barbecue. Did you manage to steal any recipes to sneak back

1066
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,120
up here to the Pacific Northwest?

1067
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,440
I tried to bring back a few samples so that we could study them and then derive.

1068
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,840
Yeah. But somehow it all got eaten. I don't know what happened.

1069
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,480
It's some mysterious thing. Oh, Levi.

1070
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,800
I think the secret's in the cows, Wes. That's what I think it is.

1071
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,400
Oh. The secret's in the cows.

1072
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,680
Actually, speaking of secrets though, after our really great barbecue that we had at Terry Black's

1073
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,800
barbecue, we got to tour where they cook it all.

1074
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,440
No way.

1075
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,120
It's like behind the restaurant. Yeah. We just casually asked and they're like,

1076
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:19,760
yeah, man, come on in. Mind you, it was like 98 degrees outside

1077
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,160
and a humidity of like 80% or something.

1078
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:29,200
And so you go inside this barbecue pit, which is like a large greenhouse,

1079
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,000
almost only it's full of barbecue cookers, temperature shoots up to like 110 degrees.

1080
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,960
It's dry heat, but it's just incredibly hot in there where they were smoking tomorrow's meat.

1081
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,040
And the guy works in there in that Texas heat all day long.

1082
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,800
And when you step out, when you step back outside, it feels like you're stepping into

1083
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,440
air conditioning because the temperature is so hot in there.

1084
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,280
So I did try to grok a few secrets. They converted old propane tanks,

1085
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,440
like big propane tanks, like on the side of a house.

1086
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,640
They converted big propane tanks into barbecue tanks.

1087
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,440
Really?

1088
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,720
Yeah. Yeah. It was a good time. It was a really good time.

1089
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,120
And I'm going to have to do it again.

1090
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,280
So let's talk about our app pick this week, and then we're going to wrap this sucker up.

1091
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,200
It's FERP, F-R-P, a fast reversible proxy.

1092
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:18,160
And I like the way they described this, Wes, because it will help you do one of two things.

1093
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:25,760
It'll expose any HTTP and HTTPS service behind a NAT, or number two, expose any TCP or UDP service

1094
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,800
behind a NAT, which would seem to include HTTP.

1095
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,120
So what is FERP, Wes, and how is it doing it?

1096
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:38,560
It is a fast reverse proxy, and it's a Go application that's got just pretty simple

1097
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,720
I and I based command file.

1098
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,520
You run one instance on some server with a public IP address.

1099
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:50,320
So I've got one up on our dear friends digital ocean, and then you connect to it.

1100
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,920
It also has a client program.

1101
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,440
Both of them have a configuration file.

1102
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,880
The server just sort of like sets up, opens its port for clients to connect to.

1103
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,840
There is token based authentication if you have security in mind, and you probably should.

1104
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,280
Then you configure your client and sort of configure on the client side,

1105
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,000
what services you want to export.

1106
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,760
You then get that running with that client config, connects up to the server,

1107
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,880
and then they do a little magic mumbo jumbo talking to each other.

1108
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,720
Then your services are, that's it, your services are exposed.

1109
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,560
You can reach them from the public internet.

1110
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,840
It does the reverse proxy back to whatever computer is behind the NAT.

1111
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,800
It doesn't really have to care.

1112
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,720
You don't have to open anything on your firewall as long as the client can reach out.

1113
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,040
And then the stateful firewall does its job and lets the server talk back through.

1114
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,080
You're good to go.

1115
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,360
That's pretty cool.

1116
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:39,760
And I could think of all kinds of fun ways to use and abuse that.

1117
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:45,920
The other nice thing is it's also got a dashboard that comes with it, and the dashboard's pretty,

1118
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,080
it's a little more full feature than I really expected it to be,

1119
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,400
especially for something that is probably just thrown together.

1120
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,760
So there is a link that'll exist at least for a little while in the IRC room.

1121
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,240
You can go check it out.

1122
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,120
The password's admin.

1123
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,480
The username is admin.

1124
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,000
Just yeah, simple little view.

1125
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,440
It shows you all the proxies that you've set up so you can get a good idea of what's actually running,

1126
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,960
if they're online or not.

1127
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,520
Cool.

1128
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,480
Plus it's Go, so it's just like a little, you know, it's a little static binary.

1129
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,960
They've got it for different architectures, whether you're on ARM or AMD or whatever else.

1130
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,680
Have you moused over one of these pie charts for the network traffic yet?

1131
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,440
Have you seen that little bounce effect that it does?

1132
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,720
It's pretty cute.

1133
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,560
It's really neat, actually.

1134
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,240
I did not expect the dashboard part of this.

1135
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,520
That surprises me.

1136
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,360
Oh, this is really cool.

1137
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:29,120
And it's actually still responding even though myself and others in the chat room are banging

1138
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:29,680
on it right now.

1139
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,880
Yeah, no, I haven't used this a ton.

1140
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,440
It just caught my eye this week, and I thought it would be neat.

1141
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,080
In other situations, you'd probably set up some sort of a version of it.

1142
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,760
A reverse or dedicated tunnel.

1143
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,480
But for, you know, if you're just moving around a lot, you don't really know what you need,

1144
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,200
or you just need something for short term, this could be super handy.

1145
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,800
And I like how minimal the config is.

1146
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,080
So instead of having a generic VPN tunnel that you have to really carefully firewall,

1147
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,760
you know with this program that you're really only setting up a few exported services,

1148
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,840
and you can see them right there in your config.

1149
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,400
Absolutely.

1150
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,040
So that's pretty cool.

1151
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,280
Again, it's FERP, and we'll have a link to that in the show notes at linuxunplugged.com.

1152
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,360
Slash 253.

1153
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,760
Mr. Payne, before we go, you should probably tell people where they can get a little more

1154
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,800
West in their life.

1155
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,440
Oh, yeah.

1156
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,840
Well, one, techsnap.systems.

1157
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,800
Stay tuned.

1158
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,120
There'll be another one coming out sometime this week.

1159
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:17,040
Or if you're just impatient, I'm at West Payne over on the Twittersphere.

1160
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,000
Heyo, I'm at Chris LAS.

1161
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,040
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

1162
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:28,480
I'll be down in Texas for about four more days, three more days or so.

1163
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,920
And then I'm starting the long journey back up to the Pacific Northwest.

1164
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,120
Man, do I miss those kids.

1165
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,560
I'm excited about getting home.

1166
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,480
I'm almost tempted just to fly home and see them.

1167
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,440
Aw.

1168
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,560
Leave Joob's behind.

1169
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,520
We all miss you, too.

1170
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:39,920
Don't worry.

1171
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,680
Go get more episodes at linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

1172
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,520
Go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

1173
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:48,800
They're going to have their episode.

1174
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,640
And Joe put out Late Night Linux.

1175
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,000
So go grab more Linux content over there at our friend sites.

1176
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,720
And of course, join us next week live over at jblive.tv.

1177
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,320
We do this show on Tuesdays.

1178
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:07,920
And if we don't see you then, I'll see you on the download next Tuesday.

1179
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:36,400
Oh, and the boss is away, Wes.

1180
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,520
The bots will play.

1181
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,000
I thought J-Bot took the afternoon off, but it looks like the title page is actually loading.

1182
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,560
Oh, it is?

1183
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,040
Oh, good.

1184
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:43,920
I thought it was down, too.

1185
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,200
Yeah.

1186
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,880
Personalities happens not bad.

1187
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,840
That's pretty good.

1188
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,640
That's not perfect, but it's pretty, pretty good.

1189
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,200
It's close.

1190
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,600
Pretty good.

1191
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,240
Hey, Mumba Room.

1192
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:54,800
Thanks, guys.

1193
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,360
It's great to have some of you in there for the first time.

1194
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,000
You're welcome.

1195
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,280
You guys are the best.

1196
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,360
Where did you get FRP from?

1197
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:02,160
This graph thing.

1198
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,760
Wes found that.

1199
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,600
Yeah, Wes found that this week.

1200
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,360
He is a sleuther, Popey.

1201
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:08,480
It's true.

1202
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,160
I don't actually quite remember where I saw it from.

1203
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,200
Kind of neat, huh?

1204
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,480
Eric and I are wondering if we need to try Kansas City barbecue.

1205
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,160
Yeah, that's what everybody says.

1206
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,480
Although, man, do the people in Austin talk shit about Kansas City barbecue.

1207
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:27,680
You know what else they say is that you guys think it's good because you don't know any

1208
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:27,920
better.

1209
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,640
That's what they say.

1210
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,520
That's what they say.

1211
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,480
Multiple people say.

1212
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,200
People tell me.

1213
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,000
People tell me, Tyler.

1214
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,480
People tell me.

1215
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,160
Don't they also BS about Carolina barbecue?

1216
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,960
Hey, look, I have tried all the barbecues on this trip.

1217
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:47,360
I've tried North Carolina, South Carolina, Memphis, Arkansas catfish barbecue, Texas

1218
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:47,920
barbecue.

1219
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,360
And hell, if Texas barbecue didn't win, hands down.

1220
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,000
Yeah, only one got the life changing title.

1221
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,560
Only one.

1222
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,720
I didn't hear no memo in there.

1223
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:24,720
Does anybody want to visit Alabama?
