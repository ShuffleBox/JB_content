1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
I think all right, but that's not what I want to discuss in the pre-show

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,420
You know what I want to talk about in the pre-show is this might just make fedora work for me. You ready for this one?

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,480
York in fedora, you know that is the art user repository management tool

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,600
What yeah, yeah, yeah, so basically the art user repository in fedora

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,440
This is okay. That is like it right there. You think so you think this could be it I?

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,400
I think that would be sweet. Yeah, so yet another repository tool is what your it stands for

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,480
It's a wrapper for pac-man which adds automated access to the a you are you word has the same syntax as pac-man and for now

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,600
And now fedora you just couldn't use your to install a you are packages in fedora

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,280
This is no joke. I wonder if anybody that in the chat room has tried this

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,520
This is amazing because fedora 22 is really solid, but at the time I tried it

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,720
I was having a hard time getting a couple of apps. I needed her upad mumble and telegram. Yeah, definitely right

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,880
That's why that's one reason. I never really used it because I couldn't get the apps for it. Yeah, in fact

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
I think I just read somewhere that

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,500
What was it? I think they said that essentially that I can't remember where I just saw this

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,800
But there were fedora repositories have essentially kind of stopped growing in terms of software and this could really help that

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,480
I mean the a you are in in in fedora would be really I don't know how well it could possibly work

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,160
Yeah, so does it make me that actually I'm or dnf. I guess now I would think it downloads the tar. GZ stuff and builds it

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,660
Right you're just building it. So it's almost like our own version of ports from freebsd. Yeah, kind of like the a you are is really

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,260
It's yeah, it could be crazy everybody out there. Try gotta if you try it out there a dear listener. Let us know

20
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,180
Maybe I'll try it. Yeah, I might try to put in a VM

21
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,520
Well in fedora is so easy to recommend, you know

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,560
Especially people with Macs or other things where you just get a nice setup environment. Yeah, but you don't have all the packages you need

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,240
Yeah, yeah, that is always the killer. Mm-hmm. This is Linux unplugged episode 103 for July 28th

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
2015

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,160
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly talk show that surrounded the 100 mark

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,840
My name is Chris and we have a great show and I'm happy to say that Wes is in studio. Hey Wes. Hey Chris

27
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,400
Hey, how's it going buddy? Oh, it's going great. How about yourself? Thank you for making it right after the big move to Seattle

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,800
That's pretty cool. Oh, I'm happy to be here. So are you good? Are you exhausted?

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,600
I mean, come on be honest. This is my recovery session got a nice beer hanging out with the fine folks in the room

30
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,680
What could be better? Well, we got a great episode today

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,440
so we're gonna do a couple of updates on some stories that are relevant in the community of the Linux unplugged show and

32
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,720
kick those around with our virtual lug and then after that I

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Have some really awesome clips from OSCON. I went down there armed with a portable audio recorder

34
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,640
Just to record interviews exclusively for the unplugged show and it turns out going down there with this tiny little recorder as opposed to a big

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,960
Camera you get a lot more intimate personal interviews with folks

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,900
And so we've got some really good chats coming up in today's episode of Linux unplugged from OSCON

37
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,540
2015 can't wait to play those for you and then later in the show

38
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,420
radio is about to be over overtaken by an open source gunk works project right here in our community and

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,060
The very creator of that project joins us in the mumble room today to give us a little insights on his plans to overthrow

40
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,580
The proprietary hold on radio broadcasts. It's a big deal

41
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,060
We're gonna talk to him today and maybe maybe just maybe you might see it worked into a future Jupiter broadcasting initiative

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,460
And then if we have enough time at the end of the show

43
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,460
I got a few things I want to reminisce about

44
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,700
Where we were just doing the back of the napkin math in the pre-show and we were like wow

45
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,820
we are in the 10th year of the Linux action show unbelievable and

46
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,740
Anytime you've been doing something for 10 years you get a little bit of an itch. Sorry, honey

47
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,180
I'm not talking about you. No, no, no, baby, baby. I love you. I'm not talking about you, baby

48
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,540
But I'm talking about the show sweetie. God what you see that look I'm getting West. That's I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,380
Anyways, we're thinking about making some changes to the show and if we have time later, I'll talk about that

50
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,500
If not, maybe we'll just cover it in a future episode, but why don't we start our buddy?

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,280
Wimpy who sometimes joins us from time to time is the guy behind the Ubuntu Mate

52
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,580
Matai mate

53
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,580
like the drink and

54
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,740
He made a lot of news this week and I'm just curious. I wanted to kick it around with you guys

55
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,540
Do you guys think this is a really huge deal or not?

56
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:19,820
I was and why did this get so much traction when when wimpy announces that the Ubuntu Mate version of 1510 will not ship

57
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,820
With the Ubuntu software center. It has been

58
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,300
Removed is it just me or

59
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,180
Were you surprised? I mean West I'll throw it to you first and we'll throw it to the mumble room

60
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,760
We haven't brought them in yet. I should do that time appropriate greetings mumble room

61
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,420
So I'm gonna ask you in a second

62
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,260
But I'll throw it to West first West does it make sense to you to pull out the software center and why do you think?

63
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,520
This made so much news when wimpy announced I I've seen it covered on pretty much every Linux news outlet

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,000
It was the top of the our Linux subreddit. I was in the Ubuntu subreddit

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,100
It was the number one voted story in our subreddit this weekend. What do you think why?

66
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,940
I mean, I do think that you know being a being a spin of Ubuntu itself, you know the Mate edition people do

67
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,860
You know, they kind of assume there'll be a certain underlying familiarity in the architecture the infrastructure

68
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,580
Yeah, the underpinnings of what you've come to know and love about Ubuntu. Yes, exactly

69
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,180
Well, many of us may not use the software center

70
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,120
I could see how people who are more into the Ubuntu community in general. Yeah, here's my question to you

71
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,260
It seems like if I if if I'm a new user

72
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,000
So when we when we had chase switch to Linux

73
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,660
The first thing he did is anytime you wanted anything from Steam to Chrome. He went to the software center

74
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,740
That's just kind of like their expectation now. And so if there's nothing there, let me ask you this if there's nothing there

75
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,300
Is that better than having something that's not very good in fact rotten? Do you want to start all I can toss this to you

76
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,500
Rotten corpse. Do you think having nothing there is better than having something? That's awful. Yes

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,140
But that's not what a bunch of money is doing

78
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,120
so that's not even that's not even at all on the

79
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,760
Like in the page right now because they're replacing it. They're not removing it. Yeah. Well, don't go there

80
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,340
Yeah, cuz I want to get there but just yeah, we'll talk about that in a second

81
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:10,580
But I mean, but yeah, if because the Ubuntu software center is atrocious. Yeah, it should be removed by Ubuntu

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,900
Then yeah, it is a bad thing because when someone's using something and it takes, you know

83
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,020
It take the the software center to get new software takes longer to open than to install the software

84
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,700
That's a bit problem. So you think they'll run honestly, I mean, I mean bashing the software center aside, honestly

85
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Is it better to have nothing at all?

86
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,460
than to have so the reason I'm asking is

87
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,260
This aside from what the Ubuntu Mate project is doing is it maybe just better to just remove it than have nothing at all

88
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,220
So Chase's experience when he went to install steam he got two different entries for steam

89
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,220
He was then prompted to create a canonical account and then he had to try to give it his address and his payment information

90
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,820
To canonical to download the free steam installer and he was completely lost and and it just stopped him dead in his tracks

91
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,680
And he had to come to me and say what should I do? So rotten? Do you think is it better before there's a replacement to pull it?

92
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,040
Yeah, I'm for that particular

93
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,400
software center, yeah, it is by far the worst and

94
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,360
It there are so many bugs with it that it's that that they have I mean

95
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,400
They've they've made one update in two years and they're fully and canonicals fully aware that it's awful

96
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:25,000
So yeah, they should remove it because people who are coming to Linux without having any connection to it. What's before whatsoever?

97
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
They're gonna be googling stuff anyway

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,080
So all they're going to do is see the first example of a software center. That is awful. Mm-hmm

99
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,440
Especially if it we've been conditioned with you know, nicer Mac stores

100
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,880
Even the Windows Store and now mobile and now mobile everyone thinks about it

101
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,400
It might be easier to teach people we don't do that this way in Linux then to give them the half-assed

102
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,360
Version that we might have so wimpy. I'm glad you could make it

103
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,240
So tell us about this update and where now the Ubuntu Mate project is gonna take this

104
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,840
What's the Ubuntu Mate's answer to this problem that we've kicked on for I mean, it feels like since the inception of the show

105
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,760
Yeah, I've just literally just joined the chatroom so I

106
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,320
I love you wimpy. No excuses. I want to know if I want to give you a big hug and a kiss right now

107
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,800
But I was just I just a recap really quickly

108
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,040
I was just mentioning like first of all, holy shit. Did you get a ton of coverage about this change?

109
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Congrats to you and number two

110
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,040
And number two you didn't are you joking? You didn't notice maybe now I now I saw some of it

111
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,480
I saw I because I because I follow all of the feeds for all of our shows to me

112
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,800
When a story shows up more than a dozen times, that's a lot of coverage and your story got a ton of coverage

113
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,600
You've got the top of our Linux you were the top voted story on the Linux action show subreddit

114
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,720
Which is actually a fairly large generates quite a bit of traffic you got you were on softpedia

115
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,040
You got you got coverage all over the place. Plus not only that you got six reshares on Google Plus

116
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,440
so I saw it in my Google Plus feed constantly and you generated a ton of discussion the Ubuntu subreddit and the our Linux subreddit and

117
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,680
And the thing that got me the most about your post wimpy is you say we have something lined up by way of replacement

118
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,400
And it's not synaptic and that I was like, oh, what is it? So wimpy why this change and where are you going?

119
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,040
You got to tell me. Okay. All right. Okay, so

120
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,440
There's a new

121
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:19,520
So I've only seen a couple of articles on this and I've had some feedback through the Ubuntu Marte community. So, okay

122
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,920
I've written a new utility for Ubuntu Marte called Ubuntu Marte welcome. Oh

123
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,600
and

124
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,760
One of the features that that has is a simple one-click install for applications

125
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,760
that are

126
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
popular and or

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:47,240
Difficult to install and or proprietary and difficult to install. Hmm. So in there, it's a highly curated

128
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,200
selection of applications and the list of applications that are in there are built around

129
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,000
tasks that

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,680
Myself and my immediate family and friends that using Ubuntu Marte

131
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,680
Need to accomplish and the software that they need to install to do it

132
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,120
so my father-in-law said to me Ubuntu Marte is great and

133
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,840
Once you've set it up for me, I can do all of these things I need to do

134
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,720
But if you're not here, I can't you know install the things I need

135
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,200
Yeah

136
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,040
So I've just put those things in there that people need to get stuff done and that's really what it's about

137
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,920
It's one-click install get stuff done

138
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,920
So I've developed the means of installing software and it doesn't necessarily have to be stuff that's in the official repositories

139
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,600
So for example, there's a one-click installer for Steam. There's a one-click installer for Google Chrome

140
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,680
There's a one-click installer for the Hangouts plugins and so on and so on and behind the scenes it enables the necessary

141
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,800
PPAs only if that PPA is from the developer. So rotten knows about this

142
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,820
They're not human said said go and get your developer for you get to put a build

143
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,860
for widely into the PPA and then I can turn this on and you can have you get installed from the PPA and

144
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,740
You then get a conservative stable

145
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,900
distribution with rolling applications

146
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,980
so Wow now I have I

147
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Love it. That's that's brilliant

148
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,660
And I love that you're you're basically getting the low-hanging fruit first there with Steam and Chrome and things like that

149
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,420
Which is like going to be like the checklist of the first apps that pretty much everybody I've switched to Linux asked me about

150
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,280
Yeah, I mean, okay. So, you know those yeah, you know those articles that say, you know

151
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,020
The 27 things you need to do after you install. Yeah, that's right

152
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,580
This is the antedote because those 27 things are all a button, you know

153
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,780
lip DVD

154
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,580
CSS well

155
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,300
I'm kind of what you're doing too in a lot of ways is you're taking a

156
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,580
lot of the distro tweak tools where you go out there and you you copy a

157
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,740
W get command with it runs as root from the from their website and you paste it in your terminal and then it downloads and

158
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,900
Installs and add stuff to your repo and then all of a sudden next thing, you know

159
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,860
Uh, like a Lua interface app comes up or some GTK app comes up. You know, what is this?

160
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,060
Okay

161
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,700
I'll check these boxes and you don't really quite know how legit it is and what you're doing is you're sort of legitimizing that process and

162
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,000
Saying well, here's a sanctioned way to get this low-hanging fruit and it's brilliant. Yeah

163
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,660
It's also more than just the most common things people are expecting. So that's wimpy said there

164
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,420
Hey, he asked

165
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,180
We he's he mentioned to me about getting you get into the welcome as well. And we didn't have a 1510 branch

166
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,860
So when he asked for it

167
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,380
We immediately just launched one so we can get it in there. So like

168
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,780
This it's a lot more important than just you know, the the stupid 20 things after you install. Yeah

169
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,380
But like it's actually getting people to in some ways

170
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,500
It's sort of greasing the the wheels for 1510 when it lands because people are gonna have to move forward on that

171
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,700
That's cool, too. Exactly. Yeah, and the other thing is if there's an application

172
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,140
Let's say for example Dropbox Dropbox is a one-click installer in there Dropbox apps Android and iOS

173
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,460
Application so where there's an Android and or an iOS application

174
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,620
There are buttons to take you to the app stores for those companion applications on the mobile platforms

175
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:16,340
So it tells you what they are equivalent to so for Kim, for example, it explains. This is a little additive to

176
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:24,380
Photoshop you like that? That's very nice. One of the things we've done is added the CMYK plugins for GIMP

177
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,380
You know, oh wow

178
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,380
It adds all the extra bits and pieces

179
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:35,080
This is incredible. Wimpy, I love this and so Wimpy are you I mean, you know, this is not obviously not the replacement

180
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,480
Yeah, I mean this is like this is like this is like a stopgap, isn't it?

181
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,080
I mean this is you know, honestly Wimpy though

182
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,100
I could see companies that would be wanting to partner with your distribution to maybe get a button in there, too

183
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,240
Yeah, we'll be the process for changing the software that's added for this. Well, it's it's all at the moment

184
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,140
It's the simplest thing possible. So it's just so effectively welcome is a very simple

185
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,200
Webkit browser with my own protocol handlers to hand handle things like

186
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,720
handling installations handling software removals

187
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,900
Launching executables and doing things so instead of having just hyperlinks that navigate you have actions that trigger things off

188
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,300
now behind the scenes it's it's using apt daemon, which is all the same technology that the

189
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:27,900
Ubuntu software center uses for actually handling the business end of installing the software, you know and resolving all of the dependencies and all of that

190
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,260
Yeah

191
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,660
But because I've now got this mechanism of saying here is an application click this button to install it

192
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,700
Yeah, and the undercurrent of feedback that I've had

193
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,620
From the Ubuntu Marte community up to this point. We'll get to that in a moment

194
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,500
But up to this point has been why is the Ubuntu software included? You know, it's it's slow

195
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,920
It's bulky people always explain what the alternative is that they install. It's all synaptic

196
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,820
Yeah

197
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,780
So I thought right well now I've got this option to install things after the fact

198
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,760
I'll remove the Ubuntu software center from the default install

199
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,400
To satisfy all of those people that say they didn't think it should be there in the first place

200
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,780
And I'll add a link in the welcome to install it

201
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,320
So you can still choose to install it?

202
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,700
But given that people have said they weren't keen on it

203
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,000
I've been out and I've looked at all of the alternatives that are out there. So I've looked at the

204
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,840
The deep in software center and considered forking that but that's a bit

205
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,760
A bit too much like hard work mostly because a lot of the comments in the source code are in Chinese and my Chinese is

206
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Well, I don't speak Chinese

207
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Just a small area

208
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes, it's a small problem. I've looked at the Ubuntu software center, which is nice and lightweight

209
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,040
but the problem there is that that doesn't have the facility to

210
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,800
Log in with your Ubuntu one account and access prior purchases

211
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,780
So that's why the Ubuntu software center is relevant. Anyway, right cut long story short

212
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,160
I've contacted the author of app grid and

213
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,160
He has agreed to me adding an install option for app grid

214
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,560
You know the Ubuntu Marte welcome

215
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:09,880
No

216
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:18,260
So now you'll be able to choose whether you want to install the Ubuntu software center or a grid and use that as your

217
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,880
That's your interface perfect. That is perfect

218
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,480
Wow, you know wimpy and I I think what I love about this is

219
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,520
I mean, I what the hell do I know but it seems like to me you could develop out that welcome screen

220
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,040
if I was

221
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm trying to think of a good fit

222
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,760
But if let's just take the mirror media player or whatever if I was an open source project

223
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,560
I would or there is a you know

224
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,380
There's some really cool apps being built for the elementary OS like some of you may have seen this weekend a news reader for gnome

225
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,480
Going around that's sort of built for elementary OS first, but it works on any platform

226
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,240
There's some really neat apps that are being developed these days and they could reach out and say, you know

227
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,680
We'd love a little time a little a little welcome

228
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,360
You know a little welcome space here because and and of course your taste and preference would pick which ones get featured there

229
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,200
But it could be a really neat way to expose users to some some I guess like curated well picked and well placed apps

230
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,760
Are you thinking about that or are you resistant to that?

231
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,080
No, I am thinking about that

232
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:23,400
So I've got a long list of applications that I haven't added yet some I definitely will and some I'm considering but basically the selection

233
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,040
criteria is

234
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,560
Does this integrate well with the Ubuntu Marte desktop?

235
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,680
So so long as it it installs and it works and it integrates and for example

236
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,360
Some applications say some of the KDE applications which are very nice pulling so much of KDE

237
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:49,200
Underneath that it fills the menus and what have you with a load of KDE applications, which makes it look a bit messy and confusing

238
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,720
Yeah, I have to touch those. Yeah, which is unfortunate because some of them are really good. Mm-hmm

239
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,480
So yes, so long as it integrates well, so yes, you know things like, you know

240
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,400
Do we remove Thunderbird from the default installation and put that in welcome alongside Geary for example? Yeah

241
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:16,360
Yeah, you know so I've but this is a way because you know, sometimes you get these derivatives of a distribution which are

242
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,360
in name of distribution

243
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,920
Ultimate version. Yes gaming edition or whatever. Yeah, they've got everything imaginable install and it's great

244
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,960
Cuz you install this one thing and you've got everything. Yeah

245
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,600
Well, this is a way for me to make Ubuntu Marte do everything, you know easily access everything

246
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,440
But you don't actually have to ship right, you know a five gigabyte, you know distro

247
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,880
Yeah, I get to pick and you can choose what you want and welcomes asynchronous as well

248
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
And so just to clarify like API 984 in the chair

249
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,800
I'm saying what are the sources you're working when a lot of case with these developers to say hey

250
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,080
Give me a PPA that I can you're going to develop and for the 1504 directly, right?

251
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,480
Or I mean 1510 directly so a lot of cases like it's best case scenario for the source, right?

252
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:07,440
Yeah, so I'd say half of the applications that are in there are just coming out of the official archive at the moment

253
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,080
So it's just an apt and an under the hood. It's doing an apt install. Yeah, I'd say

254
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,200
25% are using a PPA, but it's the PPA from the developer

255
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,880
So I'm not just finding an app that happens to be in some random PPA and enabling a random PPA

256
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,160
I'm actually going to the developers and

257
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:36,240
Finding their stable PPA or if it doesn't exist asking them to make one and using that and then in other cases for the likes of

258
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Virtual box 5 for example and Dropbox and steam it's actually enabling the steam and Dropbox and

259
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Virtual box sure third-party repositories and doing all of the so you get the updates right from them stuff

260
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,960
Yeah, so you are getting the official, you know latest versions from their archives. That is cool

261
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,080
Nice wimpy. Well, I'm glad you're able to stop by and give us an update on that because that's I will like somebody

262
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,240
Mentioned isn't is an app grid proprietary and the answer to that question is yes app grid is under a proprietary license

263
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,160
Which is why I contacted the author to ask if I could

264
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
include an installer for it

265
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,640
Yeah, and upgrades written in Python so actually you can go and look at the source code

266
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Oh

267
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,760
As long as if I get a little suspicious I can take a look is that what you're saying right? Yeah

268
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,600
If something's installing something in my system, I want to know what it's doing underneath

269
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,720
But as far as it's licensing, I don't care. Mm-hmm

270
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,040
Yeah

271
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,840
But that's why I'm going to continue to include a link to install the Ubuntu software center and clearly label that as an open source

272
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,280
You know tool and then upgrade as an alternative to that

273
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,840
But yes under I mean for example, there's in sync is in

274
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,800
Ubuntu Marte welcome, which is a third-party proprietary application. That is a

275
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,040
Google Drive sync. Yeah utility

276
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,760
In my opinion is the best to the job, but it is a commercial application

277
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,000
But it says so in there

278
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,040
This is a commercial application after the evaluation period if you still want to use it. You will have to pay for it

279
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,240
With a link to yeah, you know, yeah much it costs. Yeah

280
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,040
Because well, you know, there are open source alternatives, but my choice is

281
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,160
The best-in-class application like integrates well with the Ubuntu Marte desktop

282
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,120
Yeah, and I could go for gripe, but gripe is not the best-in-class application. Yeah, and I

283
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,200
Found out it's some unpopular, but I don't think Ubuntu software center is the best-in-class software center for Ubuntu

284
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,160
I think app grid is there you go

285
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,960
Well put and I support you a hundred percent on it

286
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,080
And I like to see a little taste involved in some of these desktop app pick selections

287
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,040
And you know truth be told people that think there's maybe like for example in sync

288
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,880
If you think there's a better solution, then you're probably the person that knows how to go get it and install it. Yeah, definitely

289
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,880
yeah, including including the

290
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,520
Plugins for the cars your file manager, for example, so it does all of that, you know

291
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,440
Yeah, stop integration now this business about Ubuntu software center considering how much you know, I've heard

292
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,640
Oh, we don't like it. We'd rather you choose something else now

293
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,440
I've suggested that I'm gonna remove it man. Am I unpopular? This is the biggest misstep. I've made in

294
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I've started the project

295
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,840
Silent the silent majority of risen up and they're not so silent anymore, huh?

296
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:44,840
No, no, they've all found their voice and they're making it plainly clear that all I can imagine that's where cheerleaders popping up and screaming

297
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,960
No, I imagine it goes something like this

298
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,240
The only reason I move people to Ubuntu is because they expect a software center and it's the only one that at least has a software

299
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,400
Some of them for the use regardless of how good it is. Is that essentially what you get?

300
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's your choice

301
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,000
You choose the Ubuntu software center or you can choose upgrade and a friend of mine has just popped in and chapter chat room

302
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,520
Joe Ressington and we've been exchanging some message earlier on

303
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,460
On hangouts. So so Joe now I won't be compiling at the grid

304
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:23,040
Grid is written in Python and it's an interpreted language. It will be installed from the app grid developers PPA

305
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,040
Wimpy you should give Joe the pro tip and have him join us in the mumble room

306
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,440
I mean, come on, he could he could give you Joe in the UK. Yeah, he's

307
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:37,920
Known as the Linux podcast, right? I mean, I know he has a microphone. So I know he probably knows how to make mumble work

308
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,440
I'm just saying he does know how to make mumble work. I'd love for Joe

309
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,200
Conversation because I know he's got some strong feelings about proprietary software being listed in there and this is the place

310
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm just saying I'm just yeah, okay

311
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,880
Wimpy is there anything else you want to mention on the exists? No, no, no, I guess I'm going to be

312
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:03,680
Just as his wife is asleep. So yeah, that's always a good excuse. Yeah, I think I think he I think you'd have been up for it

313
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,140
Yeah, well keep us posted on how it goes. I'm sure we'll check back in

314
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,640
He may have another chance to give it to rib you because I have a feeling this is gonna be something follows interest

315
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,560
Joe's like Joe's on at least four other podcasts. So he's got plenty of opportunity to call me

316
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,520
I know it's happy just happens to be during this one. The wife is sleeping. I will I'll try not to take it personally

317
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:29,160
I'll die honestly, I know I know his wife has very good sleep practice and she likes an early night

318
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:35,800
I'll get poppies joined in as well. Oh goodness, but let's let's change the topic. All right. Well wimpy. Thank you very much

319
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,840
I appreciate your welcome as always

320
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,720
You know, there was one story I wanted to get to that maybe I'd like to poke poppy about but before we get to that

321
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm not gonna say it's about plasma mobile

322
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,400
But before we get to that I want to talk about ting our first sponsor here on the Linux unplugged program

323
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,440
Go to linux.ting.com to support the Linux unplugged program and check them out because what I love about ting is there's no contract for your

324
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,520
Service and you only pay for what you use

325
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,160
So just put that in your brain organ for a second and think about that

326
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:11,240
It's a flat six dollars a month for the line and then it's just your usage on top of that and that is select

327
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,040
So when we went to OSCON Noah had a ting phone Noah's wife had a ting phone

328
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,320
I had a ting phone my wife had a ting phone and we were rocking the communication down there and what's super slick

329
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,560
Was Noah had a rental and so we were driving from where we had the family staying to OSCON and I turned on the Wi-Fi

330
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:37,480
Hotspot mode and connected Noah's car his rental car to the Wi-Fi hotspot on my s6 as we're driving down

331
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,500
I-5 and like the media system on his car is like pulling down track information from the internet and

332
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,300
All it's totally cool, and I don't care. I'm honey badger about it because I'm just paying for my usage

333
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,940
I don't have to be like in some sort of special

334
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,260
Shared data plan to have wife Wi-Fi tethering or anything like that and you can try it out to go to linux.ting.com

335
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,980
And try out the savings calculator and see how much you'd save by switching to ting

336
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,780
I'm saving over two thousand dollars every two years no contract right so there's no early termination fee

337
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,460
And if you're in one of those duopoly contracts ting has an early termination relief program. Yeah, dude. They're crazy

338
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,960
They got early termination relief program

339
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,660
They're gonna help you get out of that contract and here's something else that's different about ting when you call them you get to

340
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:20,100
Speak to a human being you call them a 1-8-5-5 ting FTW is anytime between 8 a.m.. And 8 p.m.. On the East Coast

341
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,740
In fact check their site because they do they do move that window depending on demand

342
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,700
And you get to speak to that human being a human being and they also have one of the best control

343
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Well they have the best not one of they have the best control panel in the business that way you can manage your account turn

344
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,980
Devices on and off name them check your usage set alerts that set thresholds transfer devices deactivate devices

345
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,340
When no is heading out of here at the end of our oscon trip. I went into my ting dashboard

346
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,940
I removed my Nexus 5 from my dashboard within an hour to he was able to add to his dashboard, and he had a Nexus 5

347
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,620
Never had to call anybody all through their super slick website no termination fees no contract hoop

348
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,060
That's like hey man. You want to try out the Nexus 5 for a little bit here you go

349
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,160
And I just move up click a thing click a thing boom. We're done. It's so nice

350
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,100
I just did it right from the ting dashboard in seconds and everything's like that with ting and just for six dollars a month

351
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,720
For the line if you got a few people in your family, or you got a small business

352
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,980
There's no cheaper way than going with ting, but it's not the kind of cheap you're familiar with it's cheap in the way

353
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,300
That's inexpensive, but still the service is awesome, and they have something most carriers. Don't have

354
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,780
Two networks to choose from they have a CDMA and GSM network

355
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,980
So you can figure out which one has the best coverage or data speeds in your area and pick that one like in my Nexus

356
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,060
5 I get to bounce between CDMA or GSM and because they have GSM and CDMA network

357
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,060
There's a ton of devices you can bring and if you're gonna bring a device you go to linux.ting.com

358
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:46,600
They'll take $25 off your first month of service that more than paid for my first month. That's how that's how I really $25

359
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,620
That's a little I mean I when I think about a smartphone 25 now now that I got now

360
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,340
I got a couple of phones

361
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:52,660
I'm down

362
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,860
I'm only down to a couple of phones now because I've been given a couple away now now I'm like around 35 37 40 bucks a

363
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,180
Month that's still not that bad though for three smartphones that with unlimited data just pay for what I use right

364
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,240
I don't have to worry about going over some origin getting some crazy charge when I turn on my my hotspot or tethering and if I

365
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,140
Pay a little more one month that all washes out because most months

366
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,180
I'm saving a ton of money cuz I'm pretty Wi-Fi savvy so I just when I wrap my head around this

367
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,180
I think how else would I have been able to do this?

368
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,620
Especially for Jupiter broadcasting where we don't have the budget to spend hundreds of dollars a month on cell phone lines

369
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,940
I don't know how I would have done this without ting go to linux.ting.com try their savings calculator

370
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,480
See how much you would save remember they have an early termination relief program on top of that and give them a try

371
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,960
tons of great devices do if you just want to buy a device starting around $60 for a feature phone all the way up to

372
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:44,980
The best devices in the market linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged

373
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:53,820
So this week one of the big stories that we saw hit the interwebs was plasma mobile a free mobile platform created completely from scratch

374
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,700
Totally from scratch no no other

375
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:05,780
Distributions or projects that they are sitting on top of and it has hit the web and images are ready for the Nexus 5 and it

376
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:13,020
Is based on freedom user friendliness and privacy and of course the plasma desktop now in reality I Josh

377
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,940
Just like so many other great open source projects. They're standing on the shoulder of Giants

378
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,620
I'm sure there is tons and tons of Ubuntu mobile work in here. We do know that they are using live hybrids to get

379
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,500
Android video drivers working under Linux and of course all of the work under Qt

380
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,620
But rotten corpse you've had a little bit of heads up about there's a little bit of time to look at this

381
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,940
What were your first impressions when you started to learn about this new project?

382
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,780
I was really excited. They actually told me I talked to a developer for

383
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,540
Plasma mobile and they said that

384
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
It's it is based on

385
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,220
It has a lot of Ubuntu stack, but it also has like one of the graphics drivers for Android

386
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:54,860
But everything else is all Linux based. So it's it is sharing some stuff that it that I could bunch who has

387
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,980
They've also built a lot of their own stuff too for the shell. Mm-hmm

388
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:05,840
And and there are their app system and the widget system is completely unique and there's the demo of it is it's pretty cool

389
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,340
So I'm actually looking forward to it

390
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,860
And it's the best part is that the plasmoids that are based on the desktop are actually to work in the phone, too

391
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,500
Yeah, that's pretty nice. So those are ready to go

392
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
I

393
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,980
Guess I mean, I don't I I probably I'm sure you have nothing but nice things to say

394
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,580
But what are your first impressions when you see a project that in a lot of ways?

395
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:32,500
Is somewhat competition for Ubuntu touch. Do you think this is good? I'm sure you do right? I think it's great

396
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,340
Yeah, of course you do the whole idea of having lots of different

397
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,900
Lots of diversity in the Linux mobile market. It's great. Okay. Why would I say anything?

398
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Well, so here's the yeah, of course, why else could you say anything else?

399
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:52,340
You know what? I've noticed is the particular group that is putting this out has been particularly vocal about their feelings about canonicals efforts in

400
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,100
This area I would say perhaps they've been discouraging about those efforts a lot of claims about duplicated effort a lot of claims about

401
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,420
Reinventing code that already exists, but in reality

402
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,940
I'm not so sure. I think there's a few

403
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,500
I mean you can you can always hunt down individuals who can be vocal and negative about any particular project

404
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
I could probably find someone negative about anything

405
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,260
Of course, of course, you know, I don't think I don't think it's fair to paint the entire

406
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,580
You know KDE or plasma community as negative towards one thing because there are a bunch of individuals who each have their own idea

407
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,500
I think it was interesting that one of the things they showcased in this video is out of the box

408
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,740
They're planning for support for Ubuntu touch apps

409
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Yeah, that's cool. I mean

410
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,560
You know what you got to remember is what we're using on a bunch of touches

411
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:43,920
You know QML and I know there have been comments in the past like oh look

412
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,440
I want to have finally come around to Qt being like the right way to do things and and

413
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,840
You know this so it's no surprise that they support that kind of stuff as well on on the plasma mobile because you know

414
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,280
That's that's that's their bread and butter. Yeah

415
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,040
I'm I'm I find it a great that they put an image out for the Nexus 5

416
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,120
It makes me want to try although I don't have my Nexus 5 right now

417
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,520
But that that's kind of neat is anybody in the mumbroom actually flashed a Nexus 5 with it and tried it

418
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Yeah, I should know what I'm doing tonight

419
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,840
That's neat, I guess I'm excited

420
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,640
Anything that puts more development momentum behind mobile Qt apps

421
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,880
I'm actually all for because I really think that'd be good for everybody in general

422
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,560
I think Qt's a great great great toolkit for this and I would love to see more Qt development

423
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:35,700
Especially around mobile because not only would it make great apps for plasma desktop

424
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,460
But it would make great apps for Ubuntu touch and make great apps for the unity 8 desktop

425
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,300
I would imagine I mean, I think it's a it's an amazing toolkit with a lot of runway

426
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:49,340
And so I'd love that about this. I also the other thing I love about this is actually getting more people to dogfood Whalen

427
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,020
That's a really good thing and that's something that Ubuntu touch doesn't give us right now. And so that's awesome, too

428
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,140
That all said I don't know how far this is gonna go

429
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,580
But I'm totally willing to sit back and willing to wait and watch and I'm really curious to know what they have in the works

430
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,540
Like app store wise and integration wise and partnership wise. I really want to talk to them soon and rotten

431
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,540
We're kind of in the background setting up something to talk to them in the future, but we just don't have a nail down, right?

432
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:26,100
Stay tuned and find out. Yeah, so that's neat. That's neat. So

433
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,860
The what's the web browser says peacemaker? I don't know. Does anybody know what the web browser is on plasma mobile rotten?

434
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,980
Are you up to I think it's the Ubuntu browser, but the one for their mobile version, but I'm they haven't

435
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,620
Specifically said yet. Okay, so that that's yeah

436
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,100
The the image I tore apart the image to have a look at it when when it came out and

437
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,740
There's some yeah, there's some Ubuntu components in there

438
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,820
I I wouldn't necessarily expect those to be in there forever. I would I would expect there

439
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,580
You know things like our in the image and in the demo

440
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,820
There's our weather app and the music app and the calculator and the web browser

441
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,940
I wouldn't be surprised if those get replaced with more natural, you know

442
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,620
K KDE bedfellows than than the ones we have but I'm you know

443
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,860
I'd love to share work with those guys and for you know

444
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:21,660
If they've got patches for our apps that are appropriate for them or if we've got things that we need to do to make it

445
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,540
Work on on their platform. That'll be awesome. Does it feel validating a

446
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:32,500
Little bit to some degree. Yeah, there's there's you know, the fact that someone can take that image and

447
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,260
You know if you if you rip the image apart inside it

448
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,120
there's a shell script and that shell script basically takes an Ubuntu touch image rips out the

449
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:46,140
Yeah, mear and unity and here the bits that they don't want adds a PPA and puts in you know

450
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,840
The KDE stuff which is exactly what you know

451
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:55,140
Many derivative Linux distributions are is they rip apart that's the initial that's what you do with your preview version is you rip apart somebody else's

452
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,200
Distro and then you put back in the value that you want to put in and then you distribute that for people to play with

453
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,280
People play with it and then you maybe you'll make a more robust solution

454
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,280
So I don't doubt they'll have image creation servers and all the kind of infrastructure that we have for hours

455
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,160
But they'll be generating their own images and it may well be that they don't they don't use Ubuntu touch underneath forever

456
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,040
That's yeah, you know, they may well choose mere or someone or something else gentoo who knows that was the meta story

457
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,760
I took away from this is that

458
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,780
The Ubuntu project has created something that a bunch of really smart people felt it was worth basing their project off of

459
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,260
because I think in a lot of ways that's sort of

460
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,440
One of the better validations of an open source project is that another group of really talented people can look at it and go there's some

461
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,160
serious merit here and we want to incorporate this and start from here and

462
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,960
Regardless of how long they use that as the base

463
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,080
I think in some ways it adds legitimacy to the efforts that canonical is working on here

464
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,040
Is that another group of really smart people think it's worth their time and maybe inspires other people to do the same thing and create

465
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,160
interesting other spins

466
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,640
Yeah

467
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
and now we have

468
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,220
prerequisite to maybe KDE taking a page out of Microsoft's book and making KDE hearts canonical

469
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
I'm just waiting for my next

470
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,960
Yeah, I think you're pushing in

471
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,120
No kid, but maybe just a little softer touch. All right. Well, that's fascinating. Thanks for the updates guys

472
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,720
I want to transition to OSCON. This is the meat of today's episode is I got some really great stuff down at OSCON

473
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,040
I I'm really happy with the way everything turned out and I want to cover that

474
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,080
So before we jump into our exclusive OSCON coverage in Linux unplugged

475
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,060
I'd like to mention DigitalOcean next sponsor of the unplugged program and boy to DigitalOcean come through all of the clips

476
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:40,120
You're about to see all of the interviews you saw on Linux action show all of it transferred archives stored moved between

477
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,680
Destinations using DigitalOcean and why not?

478
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,100
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to get your own rig up in

479
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,480
The cloud I'm talking a Linux big bay Linux rig based on KVM

480
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,720
SSD for the IO

481
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:00,560
Top-tier internet connections and HTML 5 UI to manage all of it and you get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start

482
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:08,240
Only five dollars a month for 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a freaking terabyte of transfer a freaking terabyte

483
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,540
They have data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam

484
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,320
London and a brand new one in Germany

485
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,000
But what I love about DigitalOcean with keeps me coming back is that sugar of their interface that UI is done

486
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,880
So well, first of all, it works in all your devices. So that way you don't have to worry about that even even the console

487
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,720
They've written a web console in go that watches the machine from post all the way up to boot

488
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,800
You don't have to worry about needing Java or ActiveX or anything like that

489
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,840
And then you can do a pretty much all the functionality you'd want, you know

490
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,880
You can manage your snapshots. You can do DNS management. You can deploy applications. You can back up replicate archive

491
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,480
Expand the storage all the stuff you'd expect

492
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,200
But if you just decide you want to automate that s you know

493
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,680
You want to take it to the next level you want to do it at scale or you want to integrate it in with your update

494
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,400
Systems or your puppet management infrastructure DigitalOcean has a very slick API that allows you to do all this stuff very straightforward

495
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,980
In fact, there's a ton of really good community applications already built around this slick API that you can take advantage of right now

496
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:13,040
Absolutely as just part of your DigitalOcean service and remember all of this starts at just five dollars a month

497
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,040
And if you use our promo code do unplugged one word lowercase do unplugged

498
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,680
You'll get a ten dollar credit. You can try that five dollar rig two months for free

499
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,680
This is a Linux powered rig that is unbelievably fast up in this up in the cloud up in the sky up on somebody else's computer

500
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,320
Whatever you want to call it it rocks and has only five

501
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,400
Dollars a month and you can choose from fedora 22 Ubuntu LTS current versions. They got free BSD

502
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,600
They've got Debian they have really nice one-click deployments

503
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,680
If you want to get a ghost powered

504
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,760
You know ghost is a great blogging platform markdown powered if you don't need WordPress if you don't need something as advanced as WordPress

505
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,600
You just want to post and go check out ghost

506
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,880
Why not host on a digital ocean drop you want own cloud you want to do google file your life check out digital ocean

507
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,760
Do you want to have a minecraft server a mumble server check out digital ocean you want to have a gitlab server check out

508
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Do you get the point it can do all of these things at five dollars a month and of course you're relying on Linux is

509
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,760
A fantastic memory infrastructure to just keep going and going and going and you could up it as you need it grows with you and

510
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,160
If you use the promo code do unplugged you get the ten dollar credit you try it two months for free

511
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:18,200
We also have incredible tutorials to take it to the next level as well go to digital ocean.com use our promo code do

512
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:25,000
Unplugged one word and a huge. Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program. It's a really great setup

513
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,760
I've got tons of droplets Noah's got tons of droplets West you got to go over there and create a droplet

514
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,020
I have done. Oh, that's right. You do. What do you use digital ocean for?

515
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,040
Well a number of things it's a they have great pipes over digital ocean

516
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,040
So I have a few servers over in Europe. This is my proxy server downloads things stores them in a cache

517
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,640
Good cause great good call has to run sync thing on pretty much all of them, which that's also

518
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,480
My data with me all the time. Yeah sync thing bit torrent sync and own cloud are great uses. I love the proxy idea

519
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,920
That's really slick digital ocean.com use the promo code do unplugged and go build yourself something on a droplet

520
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,560
You'd be surprised how far you can get at just five dollars a month. Okay, so our next segment

521
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm really excited. We've got some great stuff

522
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:08,880
but first I I want to touch on a big conversation we had in Linux action show this Sunday around RFID tracking at

523
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,480
OSCON there was RFID printed in the badges and then some of the major rooms you went through they would track attendees to see

524
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,320
Which rooms are in how long you're in them kind of get heat maps of popular sessions and things like that now

525
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,240
I have to clarify

526
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,120
Josh R. Simmons from O'Reilly tweeted us and said your OSCON show had some inaccuracy

527
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Inaccuracies around RFID people could opt out and employers don't get the data. There's no reports that are sent to employers

528
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,280
So I want to make that clarification for some of you were uncomfortable about the OSCON tracking

529
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,440
They don't send reports to employers, and there was an option to opt out. I thought it was kind of a fascinating thing

530
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,280
They were doing in the first place, but I just thought for those of you who are concerned about that

531
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,760
We should make that clarification now

532
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,240
That's really the only mistake you're gonna run into because you see when Noah and I go down to events like this

533
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,160
We've been doing this for a while now

534
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,480
Professional we are a well oiled machine West like we get down there. We're strutting our stuff

535
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,080
What's up, Linux action show biggest podcast in the Linux world. We're here

536
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,320
We're gonna record some interviews get out of the way

537
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,640
And I tell you it all goes really well until you realize we've showed up an hour early and the Expo Hall hasn't even opened

538
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,520
Yet when you told me you didn't have anything till 1.30. I thought I thought okay. Well, then we'll just go do interviews until 1.30

539
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,920
No, it wasn't what I was thinking it's actually not what I communicated to

540
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,760
You see what he communicated was I don't need to be there until 1.30

541
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,200
I did, but I also I did specifically tell you the inner that the Expo Hall wasn't gonna be open till the afternoon

542
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,680
I think by that time I think here's what I'd work out here's what here's my here's my mistake

543
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,000
My mistake was expecting no it convey more than 15 seconds of information

544
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Important

545
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,000
So I have to condense it down to 15 seconds and spit that out not true

546
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,880
That's not true. That's not true. You find that I have to come up with interesting other things to say to Phil

547
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
You do have to sell me. Yeah

548
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Okay, I'll keep that in mind for future

549
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,800
We got that for we got that worked out

550
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,200
But there was a little bit of it's actually kind of nice at OSCON. They have a media room set up

551
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,720
So we were able to kill a little time in there. We got some things sorted out

552
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,280
We got some bad stuff resolved and our first interview of the day was with one of the chairs of OSCON

553
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,640
And I asked her like for people who are listening from a community standpoint

554
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,520
What's the connection between O'Reilly and OSCON and can you give us a little information about how that all connects?

555
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:28,280
Walking around here at OSCON and I ran into Rachel now Rachel is a very very interesting guest on the unplug show because she runs

556
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,480
This whole thing puts it all together. I'm really excited to talk to her. So Rachel, welcome to Linux unplug happy to be here

557
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,120
Thank you. So Rachel, I know that probably a lot of folks are somewhat familiar with OSCON

558
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
But I don't know if they really are familiar with

559
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,040
How O'Reilly is involved with OSCON because I think we all know O'Reilly

560
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,600
So could you touch on just a little bit of O'Reilly and OSCON and how that is all connected?

561
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,520
Absolutely, so O'Reilly has been around for about 38 years and

562
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,560
OSCON has been around for this is the 17th one

563
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,480
and so we've always really been a part of open source before it was even called open source and

564
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,380
I believe we were part of coining that phrase and when we did that was something that we brought to OSCON. OSCON actually started as a

565
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,560
Perl event and then as more and more people came to the open source community

566
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,880
It became more of a developer event. And so O'Reilly has many many events at this point

567
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,580
We have I think we have 18 per year, but we also we have books we have videos

568
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,640
And you know, we distribute ebooks. So yeah

569
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,640
I think you guys are very very well known for the ebooks and the books online and the animals of course are a very iconic

570
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,100
Aspect to it. So I don't know though do people do people when they hear O'Reilly

571
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:44,120
Do they think of that legacy in open source and how does OSCON help sort of familiarize people with that?

572
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,640
I think they do think of the legacy. Like I said, so OSCON

573
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,600
Has been around for a long time and you see a lot of people if not come back every year come back every couple

574
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,080
Of years to check in with the community

575
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,920
So I think that it's something that people have been looking at for a while

576
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,160
I want to what I want to make sure OSCON is is that we're bringing in constantly bringing in new people

577
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,360
So that they are a part of that legacy because even though open source has quote-unquote won

578
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,760
There's a lot of work left to do because it has to do with how do you bring that into your business?

579
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,840
How do you make that work? How do you make money from it?

580
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,720
Well still being a good open source community member and you know, that's such an interesting aspect there, too

581
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,040
Because it is exploding every year. It feels like the open source world has gotten bigger

582
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,680
There's so many more technologies and you know

583
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:32,080
We see really fascinating big huge companies like SAP are in here and how they leverage open source

584
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,760
But one of the interesting things about OSCON for people that are

585
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,880
Not here right now that is hard to capture

586
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,440
Because we're on the floor all the time and you get an idea in a sense of the activity

587
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,280
What's really hard to capture is there's some really incredible sessions going on and I know there's been some specific

588
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,760
Retooling around some of that this year. Could you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, absolutely

589
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,720
so we used to be set up by language and I think that was because

590
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,920
Developers identified with a certain language at least more so than others

591
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,840
And what we realized is that there's so many languages frameworks techniques all different open source pieces

592
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,080
That there's now the right tool for the job

593
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:13,440
So what we wanted to do instead was pick out what are the common problems that developers are having either in?

594
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:21,120
Securing their software or scaling it or how do you take it mobile and giving them solutions and having those?

595
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,760
solutions be able to be applied to different frameworks languages, so

596
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,440
Absolutely, and there's also been some pretty like intensive sessions this year that really you're like you could come here and get really familiar with something

597
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,680
What's the intent behind that? Well, we wanted to get exactly wanted to get a little bit more intense. We had

598
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,240
Four two-day training courses one was on Swift another was on go

599
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,440
Microservices is a big deal. We really wanted people to be able to come in

600
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,200
Take two days not put it off any longer

601
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:57,200
Focus focus be able to actually when they go back next week to work to actually solve a problem and give them those materials

602
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,200
To solve that problem, so we had those we had 38 tutorials

603
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,200
Which is like an amazing amount of tutorials and those were like three to six hours

604
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,200
And then like you said the sessions where you're just sort of getting a taste of what something is now if I'm watching from afar

605
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,200
Is there any kind of any kind of resources I can read up and get an idea of?

606
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,200
What's coming up next year, so I know if I want to make it out here is there like a site I can watch or a feed to follow?

607
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,200
That's a good question, so we have oscon.com

608
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,200
And you can go there, and you can check out the the keynotes will be streaming or not streaming live anyway

609
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
But they'll be there you can check them out, and then you can check out O'Reilly's radar

610
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,200
And that's some you know I talked a little bit about what we were doing

611
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,200
I'll talk about what I did see and honestly I want to talk to a bunch of people while I'm here to see what they did

612
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Like what they didn't like one of the things I'm thinking about for next year is making a track that's like the mind-blowing track

613
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Which is just like super advanced and like people can go in and be like I don't know what just happened

614
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Get known for being really hardcore in there. Yeah, that's great. I love to see what you guys gonna come up with Rachel

615
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,200
Thank so much for coming on Linux unplugged. No problem is pleasure

616
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:06,200
And that was interesting you know they did they decided as the conference gets bigger their solution to sort of

617
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Becoming less relevant is to get more hardcore and focus more on content. We'll see how that works as they move to Texas now this next clip

618
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,200
I got here is called matrix

619
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:20,200
And I don't know if your mess are you familiar with like stack which is like a collaboration tool for teams and stuff like that?

620
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's really popular these days

621
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,200
It's really tape taking off and there is an open source competitor that you can either use as a hosted service or host yourself called matrix

622
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:36,200
It's an open source stack killer and it involves IRC chat web RTC

623
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,200
Persistent rooms and project planning calendaring and integration with third-party services

624
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,200
And they're saying stop using stack and try and try out matrix it might just solve your needs

625
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:54,200
So we spent 12 years building set infrastructure and got quite depressed in the end because set was meant to be like this email

626
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:02,200
But for open video except in practice nobody has sit your eyes on their business cards and the open Federation the open

627
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,200
Interoperability thing just hasn't really quite taken off so we went and

628
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,200
Wrote an alternative to set based on HTTP just a really simple HTTP API

629
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,200
Or if I want to set up a video call somebody I do one hit

630
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:20,200
With the offer of what media I want to talk and you do one hit back with the answer and that's it

631
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,200
We're in a call. So none of the complexities of set with all the you know, it's a UDP. Is it TLS?

632
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,200
Is it TCP? Is it this version? Is it that version?

633
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:35,200
So it's quite old and very fragmented just doing it as an HTTP works a lot better and that's one of the things you can use

634
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,200
With matrix except matrix isn't just about open video. You can also use it for instant messaging

635
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,200
We've got the little drone sitting down there, which we're about to launch as the Internet of Things

636
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,200
Where you can go and get the video off it via matrix, but you can also control it

637
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:58,200
We went and hooked up people's cars to matrix so the car kind of sends out telemetry as little blobs of JSON into matrix

638
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,200
And you can go and consume it anywhere else

639
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,200
So basically matrix is a big open decentralized object database with PubSub schematics

640
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,200
So that anybody can publish any random data they want and there could be a message or whatever

641
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:15,200
And over here on the screen, am I seeing like a persistent group chat environment? Kind of looks like a bit like IRC and messaging

642
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Yeah, so this is one of the classic things you can do with matrix. Use it as a persistent group chat thing

643
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,200
This is an angular environment and there are a couple of hundred chats going on there

644
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:33,200
A lot of these are bridged into FreeNode. FreeNode have been very cool and let us actually bridge matrix into FreeNode or vice versa

645
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:41,200
Here is another view of the same room, say, but a more Slack-like environment. This one is written in React

646
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:49,200
So this is kind of like a team collaboration sort of version of it sitting on top of the matrix object database?

647
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,200
And so I assume in this I could have text, image, video, audio, all those things in here?

648
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:04,200
Yeah, so any JSON you like. You can hear these are just instant messages with people trying to do weird shit with UTF-8, but if we go back to this one

649
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,200
If you double click on stuff like a message like test there, you can see it is just arbitrary JSON

650
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:18,200
So it could be a M room message or if you were doing a video call here, it could be a bit uglier

651
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,200
It is a M call invite and you have got the description of the media for that call there

652
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,200
But it could be drone control, it could be car telemetry, whatever the hell

653
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,200
And my program, my app just needs to be able to read this and know what to do with it?

654
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Yep, precisely. So we define some standard types like m.call. Anything that begins with m. is matrix and it is part of our spec

655
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:45,200
But it is like Java namespace, so if you wanted to have a com.google.whateverthehell Google might use it for, then just feel free, go nuts, put data in

656
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:51,200
So if I wanted to roll this out, what is my back-end structure look like? Is it a Linux server? What is it running on?

657
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:59,200
So we are providing one reference server at the moment which is written in Python and Twisted and it is about 30,000 lines of code

658
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,200
It is pretty beta but it works well enough to have rooms with like a thousand people in it and a couple of hundred servers participating

659
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,200
And it runs on any OS that can support Python really

660
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:20,200
Some of that is, it could be Debian, we have got some Dockerfiles, Susie images, Fedora images and even somebody made it run on Windows

661
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,200
Very cool. I like that. Do you have any questions?

662
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:34,200
So what does a customizability look like? If I wanted to specify, can I specify video parameters like the codecs I want to use or the size of resolution I want to send, that kind of thing?

663
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:40,200
So what we do for the actual video on one of these calls, if I am going to put this on the right network, I leave them going to create a demo

664
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,200
That is a great question because that is something we run into all the time

665
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,200
We want to be able to specifically say 720p because we know we have the right bandwidth, the right environments, we built it for that

666
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:55,200
But a lot of hangouts and Skype, a lot of the consumer solutions, they just automatically decide what they are going to give you and you have no say

667
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:05,200
Right, so what we do is to slightly punt on the issue and we just use WebRTC which is built into the browser already and we use whatever it gives us

668
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,200
We can, I think there is an idea of intents where you can say, or constraints where you can say how I want it 720p

669
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,200
And if you are lucky then the browser and the camera and the planets will align and you will get what you asked for

670
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,200
So the intent says if the system supports it, give me this?

671
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:28,200
Yes, precisely, so Matrix is just the signaling, we are relying on whatever else is already hanging around like WebRTC to make that work

672
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:34,200
Now if I go and try to quickly find Evil Matthew, here is my demo self and say hello there

673
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:39,200
We are going to go and give Evil Matthew a video call I think, I like that

674
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Okay, so that is, sorry, I am Evil Matthew here

675
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Oh, I see, I see

676
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,200
Oh, I like that, wait

677
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,200
Then this is going and pulling open WebRTC

678
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,200
Yeah, and it just puts it right there in line with the chat

679
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:59,200
And we should have an inbound call, in fact I got it coming in, in fact that is the previous message coming in on my Apple Watch

680
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,200
But if we go and accept it there, then hopefully

681
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:11,200
Oh, interesting, so there must be an app running on your phone that is also getting the messages from the call, so you are getting push notifications to your phone too?

682
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,200
Yeah, absolutely, so there we go, that is now just a typical WebRTC call, so it is a 640x480 and it is just a default that you get

683
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,200
But as I say you can put constraints on it to try to get 720p and you can see that I am getting push notifications coming in here

684
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:30,200
Also on the app from various different channels because we have got iOS and Android apps and about ten different clients

685
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,200
Five of them are from the core team and the rest are from the community, so people have done command line clients using WeChat

686
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,200
There is a Java desktop app, there is a Chrome app, all sorts

687
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:46,200
If I am a company that was looking at something like Slack, could this be a replacement for that? Could I use this maybe in place of Slack?

688
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Potentially, so the big advantage is that you can run your own server

689
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,200
All of the conversation history here gets replicated over the participating servers

690
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:04,200
So I can run my own one, you can run your own one and if we are in the same room then no single server or entity or vendor like Slack for instance owns that conversation

691
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,200
It is aggressively decentralized, a bit like Git or Blockchain or something like that

692
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
So that is quite a compelling thing

693
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,200
We have also got end-to-end encryption in it using an OTR like thing which is actually better than OTR

694
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,200
And that again makes it kind of interesting because with Slack you have no choice but to just hand all your data over today

695
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,200
Whereas here if you wanted to flip the bit and turn on end-to-end encryption you can

696
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,200
And for the encryption implementation, how much of that is done out in the open? How much of that is open source or documented?

697
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,200
It is all open source under the Apache license

698
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:40,200
What we did was to take the Axolotl ratchet implementation or specification that Open Whisper Systems have written and released

699
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:46,200
And it is what WhatsApp uses in TechSecure and we wrote our own clean room implementation of that spec

700
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:52,200
And it is called OM, O-L-M, you can get it from GitHub, Apache licensed along with the rest of the Matrix code base

701
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Awesome, thank you very much for the information, I am definitely going to check that out because we have been looking at something kind of like that

702
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Appreciate it

703
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:05,200
I like this more than the standard alternative to going with something proprietary like Slack and it is a neat kind of package all put together

704
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,200
SkookieSprite, you seem kind of impressed by it during the playback, what do you think?

705
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,200
Oh, I mean it sounds like a totally integrated free and open source

706
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:22,200
I am big about that aspect of it, that means it is accessible, you can audit it, you know that like you said it is your own data

707
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:28,200
Yeah and for the most part you know Slack is a pretty compelling product but when it is my company and it is like

708
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:36,200
You know one of the things I think about with something like Slack is it seems like it could be a really good solution for 2015, 2016 and maybe even 2017

709
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:43,200
Now what happens if Jupiter Broadcasting makes it 30 years, 35 years and I want to look back at sort of like the formative years of the company

710
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:52,200
I would really, really, really regret having that data either A not available because that company is not around or in some sort of proprietary format that I can't get access to

711
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:00,200
So having something like that, the collaborative details, where our company was at, owning that to me seems like a part of the company's history

712
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:07,200
Definitely, you know in my office we used to have a custom back end chat client XMPP based

713
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:15,200
We have been looking at, you know we are using Slack now but I know there are still some shareholders in the company who are concerned about data flowing outside of our company to someone else

714
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:25,200
Before that we have been stuck using Pidgin and other XMPP clients so if there is something like this that has a new interface, has more abilities that might be big for a lot of enterprises

715
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,200
It is called Matrix and of course that is a, boy as far as SEO goes that is pretty rough, I have even tried to get links for the show and I had a rough time

716
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,200
I can't believe they got the dot org, that is kind of impressive

717
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,200
Yeah exactly, so you can get it right now, matrix.org and go check it out

718
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:48,200
So this next thing is, this is the last sort of like businessy sysadmy thing and then we are going to get into some really crazy great stuff

719
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:59,200
This one though I want to talk about because there is this category that gets kicked around and I think a lot of people associate it with being a hipster, maybe the DevOps category

720
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:07,200
And it is this one guy or gal and they have got to do one thing, they have got to build code and integrate it with servers and they have got to be able to scale

721
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:18,200
And they have got to get to thousands of servers and the thing is, it sounds like I am making fun of people but this is an actual job that to me sounds like it would keep me up all night long

722
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:27,200
Being responsible for thousands of servers when I really just want to create software, I don't really want to be a sysadmin, this sounds like the recipe for an ulcer

723
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:38,200
And so there is an open source project out there called Mesosphere and Mesosphere, have you heard of this at all, Mesosphere is like a cluster management orchestration suite at a high level

724
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,200
I was just looking at a tutorial the other day, it looks very interesting

725
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,200
Really, so this is one of the people working on it, now I have got to warn you, he is not a public relations person

726
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:54,200
This was a bit of rental space essentially or free space that GitHub gave out to some open source projects

727
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:01,200
And so Wes I would be really curious to hear your insights after we play this, I get an idea of Mesosphere Apache cluster management

728
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:07,200
With my chat in the little area where GitHub has given out space to certain open source projects that they like

729
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,200
So my name is Michael Hausenblatt, I am leading DevOps relations at Mesosphere

730
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:20,200
And what we have here is Apache Mesosphere, just a resource manager, a top level Apache project

731
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:29,200
Takes a bunch of nodes in your cluster and abstracts that away making you as a developer who wants to develop

732
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:36,200
So if I am a developer who is in that DevOps role and I have thousands of servers or hundreds of servers or tens of thousands of servers

733
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,200
That is a massive task for one person to manage and this is trying to make it possible for one person to manage all of that

734
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,200
That is right, and for a person like a developer who wants to write distributed applications

735
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,200
It is really the kernel of a kind of distributed operating system and that is what we do

736
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:55,200
Now I see here you have one of the key bullet points is that it is fault tolerant in battle test

737
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,200
How does something like this not become a single point of failure that just takes somebody down for the day if it has issues

738
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:06,200
Very good question, number of components like all of them, like the master and everything is fault tolerant

739
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:11,200
So you always, whatever fails, everything will fail over to something that is on standby here

740
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
So there is really no single point of failure

741
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,200
And in the backend server is it Linux based?

742
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,200
It is Linux based, yes

743
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:24,200
And then what does that look like from a deployment standpoint, is it an appliance, is it a container, is it a software package I install?

744
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,200
Essentially we have two versions, the community edition which is cloud only, so you can only deploy it in one of the public clouds

745
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,200
The enterprise edition which you can also deploy on-prem

746
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,200
And what is the on-premises one look like, is that more of a

747
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,200
The enterprise edition that also comes with support and a bit of secret sauce

748
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:47,200
So essentially the guys who used to do Mesos at Twitter and Airbnb taking that experience and productize that

749
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,200
Taking infrastructures like that and fascinating, well thanks for the information

750
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,200
Thank you

751
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,200
So what was your impression when you were researching the product, or I guess the project I should say

752
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,200
You know it seems like the Apache Mesos on steroids

753
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,200
Something that even further adds abstractions because the whole big idea here is being able to easily scale

754
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
And maybe not even have to think about it

755
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,200
It's like you just drag resources around kind of a thing

756
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,200
Yeah and you can kind of write as if it was all one big resource

757
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:19,200
Yeah, oh so it gives you tools at a development level

758
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
Right, or you can do that

759
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,200
Interesting, well very cool and so where do people, do you have any good recommendations people want to find out more about it

760
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,200
Anything you found very useful

761
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,200
You know it looks like there's even a digital ocean tutorial right here, an introduction to Mesosphere

762
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Look at that, there it is, well there you go, that's actually probably

763
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,200
That's probably the best bet just as a starting point

764
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,200
They have technical writers that go through those

765
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,200
And nice diagrams too

766
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,200
So have you heard, yeah, cool look at that

767
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,200
I don't think I have a shot of your machine there, that's me

768
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,200
No I don't have a shot of your machine but you know what I will for next week

769
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,200
So have you heard of the company Fastmail before

770
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
Yeah I was just looking at their services the other day

771
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
Are you joking

772
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,200
I think I saw an advertiser for it and it was kind of interesting

773
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,200
Yeah are you kidding me right now

774
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,200
No I'm not, 100%

775
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Yeah I actually, you know I kick around, you know, Jupiter Broadcasting's backend mail is powered by Google Apps

776
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,200
The usual hand wavy, yeah

777
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,200
So there's two ways I look at this, lazy practical Chris goes oh man this is great

778
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,200
I get like all of the stuff I'd want from like a collaboration software without having to run a collaboration software

779
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,200
And it's really great I just click a button, I can create new accounts for people

780
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
And the web mail is pretty good right

781
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,200
And the calendaring is great

782
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,200
And so that's practical Chris right

783
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,200
And then tinfoil hat Edward Snowden following Chris goes

784
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:35,200
Hey man, you know you're getting emails from people in Iran, from China, in Russia

785
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,200
And they're all landing in this Google inbox that anybody could just go we'd like to have access to Mr.

786
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,200
And so like sometimes that's when it's like I have these two competing voices in my head

787
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,200
And they all, you know what they both agree on, they both argue with each other constantly

788
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,200
Except for every now and then they go you know you could check out Fastmail

789
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
And then I go oh really

790
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,200
And then I start, so then like Fastmail has been building up momentum

791
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,200
And so I was walking around OSCON and I bumped into the Fastmail folks

792
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,200
And I thought gosh I've really been thinking about this

793
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
And I wonder how much of their infrastructure is Linux based

794
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,200
What is their participation in open source because

795
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,200
I was wondering exactly those same things when I was looking at their site

796
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,200
Right exactly and I'm thinking if I maybe make the switch I want to you know I want to vote with my wallet again

797
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,200
I mean I want to make the right choice and so I sat down sort of to vet Fastmail for myself

798
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,200
And vet Fastmail for Jupiter Broadcasting

799
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:28,200
Fastmail is email done right, really email, calendars and contacts done right these days

800
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:34,200
We do hosting for all of those for individuals or businesses

801
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:39,200
And we just do it really well, we have our own interface

802
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,200
Which is much faster and more powerful and more elegant than our competitors

803
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:50,200
And we also do a lot with open source software which is why we're here at OSCON this week

804
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Very interesting, so somebody like me who's on Google Apps might want to find something maybe a little different

805
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,200
Maybe I'm not as comfortable with Google Apps as I used to be

806
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:04,200
And I love that you use open source, that would definitely play into my decision just as an open source advocate myself

807
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,200
How does open source play into Fastmail?

808
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:12,200
So the core IMAP server that we use to host everyone's email is Cyrus

809
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Which is one of the two biggest open source IMAP servers

810
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,200
It was started by Carnegie Mellon University about 20 years ago now I think

811
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:26,200
And for at least the last 5 years, probably 10 years, Fastmail has been the biggest contributor to that project

812
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:32,200
My colleague Bron is probably the main developer and leads the project these days

813
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,200
We also have a couple of others now working full time on it

814
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,200
So we make huge contributions to that

815
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,200
We also have a huge number of open source Perl libraries that we've made available

816
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:46,200
That we built as part of our middleware which is built in Perl

817
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:52,200
And also more recently we have open sourced a couple of JavaScript libraries that we use to power our web interface

818
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:57,200
The most popular of which being the Squire rich text editor

819
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:03,200
Which is now getting quite a lot of attention, 3000 GitHub stars or so

820
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:09,200
So indulge me if you will on the backend, are we seeing Fastmail run on Linux servers? Is it on Windows boxes?

821
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,200
What's sort of the backend infrastructure look like? Is that open source too?

822
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,200
So yeah most of the backend stuff is open source

823
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:21,200
We run on Linux, we certainly don't run on Windows

824
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,200
I think there's one or two Windows machines in the office somewhere

825
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,200
Any Linux desktops in the office?

826
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,200
There are quite a few Linux desktops in the office

827
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:37,200
It's pretty much a split between Mac and Linux or Linux run on a Mac in some cases

828
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,200
And I think there's one guy using Windows because someone has to just to make sure it still works

829
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,200
You've got to blame somebody for the network spam

830
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:49,200
Well exactly, so the backend is mainly run on Linux

831
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:57,200
And I believe we publish most of the things we do, certainly anything that's interesting to our GitHub account

832
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,200
That includes our custom patches on Cyrus and various things like that

833
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
So check out the GitHub page for that stuff

834
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Great well thank you very much for the information

835
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,200
Thank you

836
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
I love that, that was a great chat

837
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,200
It was cool to find out how much of their infrastructure actually uses Linux

838
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,200
Were you impressed now that somebody was looking up their services?

839
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Yeah you know that definitely speaks to the organization where they're going, what they're based on

840
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,200
Also there's other great services out there like Colab and other things to check out as well

841
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,200
So it's a good time out there

842
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,200
And then we have our last interview

843
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,200
This one was a fun one because not only is he a listener of Linux Unplugged and the Linux Action Show

844
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Which I've got to say, the Samsung booth was not going to get any attention by us this year

845
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Except for this guy was here because last year they had a really nice passionate guy from Korea who didn't speak English

846
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,200
And the thing is, it's pretty hard to interview somebody who doesn't speak English

847
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,200
And so what they did this year is they doubled down on the amount of engineers

848
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,200
So they brought in a lot more engineers who are all from Korea

849
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,200
But they also brought in people who were familiar with the products and spoke English

850
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,200
And so what you got to see is people who were insanely passionate about the products

851
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,200
And one of the things that doesn't come across because this is an audio interview

852
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,200
Is we were, once he started talking, all of the engineers huddled around to listen to what he had to say

853
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,200
They all wanted to know, it was really intense

854
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,200
But what was great is because we were doing the audio interview, it was just a very natural

855
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
Hey let's walk up and take a look

856
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,200
And it just sort of, the conversation unfolded

857
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:29,200
And this is one of my favorite kind of, it just happened because I was recording exclusively for Linux Unplugged

858
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Now I'm here at the Samsung booth and I saw a Tizen sign, a big Tizen sign here

859
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
And I was like, wow, look at this thing, I've got to take a look

860
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,200
And while I was noticing that, Noah noticed a very slick looking phone

861
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,200
What grabbed your attention about this phone, Noah?

862
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,200
Honestly, it looks like an iPhone but it's made by Samsung

863
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,200
That's the first thing that's coming to my mind

864
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,200
It looks like it's smaller, it's maybe an older one, right?

865
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,200
Right, yeah, yeah, older iPhone maybe

866
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:54,200
But it has the traditional Samsung things you'd expect

867
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,200
Like a home button on here and all the things

868
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,200
But it doesn't run Android

869
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,200
No, so when I turned it on, it actually, look at this Chris

870
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,200
When you turn this phone on, it actually, it looks almost like the Android unlocker

871
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:08,200
When I unlock it, it kind of, it resembles Android

872
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,200
A little cleaner UI maybe

873
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,200
Right, and the first thing that caught me were these applications down here

874
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
And then obviously the home screen

875
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
Oh I like that, I like the way it displays that

876
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,200
So I thought to help put all this together, maybe we could talk to an expert here

877
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,200
So Ben's here at the Samsung booth, hey Ben, welcome to Linux Unplugged

878
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
Hi there, it's nice to meet you guys

879
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,200
Hello, so can you tell us, what the heck is Noah holding here and what's different about this phone?

880
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,200
So that phone is the first phone that runs Tizen

881
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:34,200
Which Tizen is our own open source operating system that

882
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,200
It's basically just a Linux distribution that we've added a few APIs

883
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:44,200
To give you access to device functionality like sensors and your cell networks and things like that

884
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:49,200
It's really great because it lets you write applications in just straight C++

885
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,200
Just like a standard Linux application

886
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:56,200
You can also write apps using web native languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript

887
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,200
So it kind of gets the best of both worlds

888
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:03,200
You've got the systems side of things that let you get really efficient C++ apps

889
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,200
But then you've also got the simplicity of your web native languages

890
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:12,200
So I've wondered, I notice Samsung obviously pretty well known for their Android devices

891
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,200
You might have noticed this too

892
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,200
And when I look at this device, not only does it feel like a pretty well built phone

893
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,200
Because it's a Samsung and they've got some experience with that

894
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,200
But the UI, especially in the notifications tray here

895
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Reminds me a little bit of TouchWiz on my S6

896
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:32,200
And so where does Samsung see Tizen fitting in with something like the S6 and TouchWiz?

897
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,200
You could almost tell me this was a TouchWiz device

898
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,200
But then I noticed a few differences

899
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,200
Could I maybe see this on a US phone in the future?

900
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
Where does Samsung see it all fitting in?

901
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,200
Honestly I can't really answer questions about products like that

902
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,200
Because I'm not really privy to that information

903
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:53,200
I do know that we're trying to get Tizen on as many different types of devices as possible

904
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,200
I notice it's not just phones

905
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,200
Is this a DSLR here?

906
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,200
And then we've got a watch here too

907
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,200
Tell me about the DSLR widget

908
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:06,200
It's a pretty full featured camera that runs Tizen

909
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,200
Why Tizen on a camera?

910
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,200
Honestly I can't

911
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,200
You need an OS, a camera needs an OS right?

912
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,200
I mean they're pretty sophisticated I guess

913
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,200
I'll tell you, one of the great benefits of Tizen is it's better for

914
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,200
Since everything runs in C++

915
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,200
It's better for devices that have lower memory, lower CPU power

916
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,200
Which is why we also put it on our TVs

917
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Because if you're trying to put something like Android

918
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,200
It's going to bog it down with all the overhead from Java

919
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,200
Yeah, Tizen's going to get a lot better performance

920
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
And so that's probably also why it's on the watches right?

921
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Yeah, that's correct

922
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,200
And so tell me about the process of that

923
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,200
When Samsung goes out there

924
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,200
Didn't they first try these with Android?

925
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,200
And then they decided to switch it to Tizen?

926
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
Was it performance?

927
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Can you tell me a little bit why Tizen was there?

928
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,200
Because so many devices these days have Android Wear

929
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,200
As a consumer I almost expect Android Wear

930
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,200
So I would kind of wonder why Tizen

931
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,200
And there must be some advantages

932
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,200
Yeah, well if I'm not mistaken

933
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,200
I think we actually released Tizen watches

934
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:05,200
Pretty long before Android Wear even came out

935
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,200
But that was actually really where it started for us

936
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,200
And once again it's because on a watch

937
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,200
You're not going to have very much CPU power

938
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,200
You're not going to have a whole lot of memory

939
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:17,200
So you have to have an operating system that's pretty efficient to run on

940
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,200
And as a community member

941
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,200
Can I contribute to Tizen?

942
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
And could those changes eventually show up on a Samsung device?

943
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:27,200
Yeah, so Tizen 3.0 is a completely collaborative open source project

944
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,200
Anyone can pull it off of

945
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,200
I think we have it on GitHub

946
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,200
Actually no, I think it's a separate Git repo

947
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,200
But anyone can pull it down

948
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,200
And make contributions to it

949
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,200
And send it back upstream

950
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,200
All of these devices are actually based on Tizen 2.3

951
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
Which was developed internally by Samsung

952
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,200
And released as open source

953
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,200
So the changes wouldn't show up on these devices

954
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:53,200
But in the future we're hoping to get some more devices that run Tizen 3.0

955
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,200
Very, very neat

956
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,200
And so if I wanted to take a little look at some of this stuff

957
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,200
Maybe learn more about Tizen

958
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,200
Or learn about creating apps for it

959
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:00,200
Where do I go?

960
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,200
You can check out developer.tizen.org

961
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,200
And that's got all the information for

962
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,200
It's got an API for learning about

963
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,200
Or API documentation for learning about

964
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,200
All of the functionality that we've provided

965
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,200
Yeah, so that's good

966
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,200
Very good

967
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,200
Well, Ben, thank you very much

968
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,200
I've got to check out this Camera Resin Tizen

969
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,200
Are you playing with that right now?

970
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Yeah, I am

971
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,200
So one of the things I noticed is

972
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,200
I'm not sure if this technically qualifies as a DSLR

973
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,200
Because it looks like there's just an LCD inside of here

974
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,200
But look at that

975
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,200
Yeah, exactly

976
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
If I can figure out how to get back to the plate

977
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
The picture is super sharp

978
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
So I turn the aperture down

979
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
Look at how much blur we have

980
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:42,200
Oh, it's touchscreen

981
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,200
We get all this blur in the background

982
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,200
And look at this right here

983
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,200
You've got a little pull-down menu right there

984
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,200
How slick is that?

985
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,200
Well, the thing I can see that would be advantageous about this is

986
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
Chris, is we can take these pictures

987
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,200
And then we can go and just upload them straight to Twitter

988
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,200
So you get all the benefits that you would expect

989
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,200
From a professional camera

990
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,200
So that's Wi-Fi now?

991
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,200
With the advantage of a smartphone

992
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,200
Oh, I would assume so, yeah

993
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,200
Wow, check that out

994
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,200
Boy, welcome to the future

995
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,200
Share with Wi-Fi

996
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,200
That might be my next camera

997
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,200
A Linux running camera?

998
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
I've got to have that

999
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,200
It was pretty neat

1000
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,200
And you know what?

1001
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,200
It was really responsive

1002
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,200
You would have thought it was a custom-built operating system

1003
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,200
Just for that camera

1004
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,200
It was super snappy

1005
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,200
So to have all this kind of nice, slick UI and features

1006
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,200
On a little camera like that was pretty cool

1007
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,200
Has anyone else really embraced Tizen?

1008
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,200
Because that seems like where it might be really interesting

1009
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,200
Is to have a non-Android platform that other people could take

1010
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,200
Yeah, I mean, it made sense on the watches, too

1011
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,200
It was interesting

1012
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,200
We'll see where it goes

1013
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,200
I asked them, of course

1014
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,200
They couldn't give me an answer on when we're going to get that stuff in the US

1015
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,200
Of course

1016
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,200
That would be too fun

1017
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,200
That would be the key thing

1018
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:42,200
That would really be the key thing

1019
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,200
So that's Scratching the Surface

1020
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,200
Of course, we have another two hours of OSCON coverage

1021
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,200
In this week's episode of the Linux Action Show

1022
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,200
Well, not really two hours

1023
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:51,200
About 45 minutes, 50 minutes

1024
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,200
In episode 375 of the Linux Action Show

1025
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,200
OSCON 2015

1026
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:58,200
And you can go check that out if you want even more

1027
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,200
Also, in the show notes

1028
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,200
Because I'm a good guy

1029
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:07,200
I also posted a playlist of just the OSCON interviews from the Linux Action Show

1030
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,200
If you don't want to watch the whole episode, you can watch

1031
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,200
Tired of Chris

1032
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,200
You just want the OSCON business

1033
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,200
You got it

1034
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,200
There you go

1035
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Yeah, because it's all Noah in the interviews

1036
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,200
All right, so we've got to talk about this Skunkworks project

1037
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,200
In development deep inside the community from Las Vegas

1038
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,200
But first, I want to talk about Linux Academy

1039
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:28,200
The third sponsor and final sponsor right here on the Linux Unplugged program

1040
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,200
I've been a Linux Academy customer for about a month before they became a sponsor

1041
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,200
And when I decided to work with them and have them become sponsors

1042
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:42,200
We said, my conversation started literally like this

1043
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:47,200
I almost don't want you to be sponsors because this was my idea

1044
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,200
I wanted to do this

1045
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,200
Like if I knew everything I knew now

1046
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,200
Almost 10 years into the Linux Action Show looking back

1047
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,200
This is so brilliant

1048
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:00,200
Because you have to have the passion for Linux and open source to build a platform like this

1049
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,200
And that I've got

1050
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,200
But I don't have the connections to the education community and the development community

1051
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,200
And that's what Linux Academy had

1052
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,200
But it's so genius because it's exactly what we need as a community

1053
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:14,200
It's like all of those big name online education sites you've heard

1054
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,200
But specifically around Linux and open source

1055
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,200
So instead of just like Linux and open source being a check box

1056
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,200
And they're multi-category of things they cover

1057
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:24,200
From everything from Adobe After Effects to replacing the oil in your truck

1058
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Like that's just for them it's a feature, right?

1059
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
But for Linux Academy it's their life

1060
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,200
It's their passion

1061
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,200
So they came together as Linux enthusiasts and educators and developers

1062
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,200
And they built the Linux Academy platform

1063
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,200
And that was the missing piece

1064
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,200
Is what we really really needed

1065
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,200
Is somebody who's truly enthusiastic and creating incredible content

1066
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,200
I remember when I was starting in Linux

1067
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,200
There was like the Linux documentation project

1068
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,200
And there was the Gen 2 Wiki

1069
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,200
And all of these things were really good resources

1070
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,200
But they were not legitimate resources that I could tell my employer about

1071
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,200
That they could go towards my employment

1072
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,200
Educational reimbursement

1073
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,200
It could show up on my review

1074
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,200
There was team account support

1075
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,200
Like it didn't meet any of those criterias

1076
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,200
The best I had were books

1077
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,200
It was horrible

1078
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200

01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:18,200
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug

1085
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
You have step-by-step video courses

1086
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,200
Downloadable comprehensive study guides

1087
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:25,200
They have a great system where you can choose from 7 plus Linux distributions

1088
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,200
They'll automatically adjust the courseware and the virtual machines

1089
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,200
They spin up for you on demand

1090
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
You want to know about AWS

1091
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,200
You want to know about Red Hat certification

1092
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,200
Docker, virtualization

1093
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,200
Just doing backups on a Linux rig

1094
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,200
Building out an entire LAMP stack

1095
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,200
Or maybe Android development on the Linux desktop

1096
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,200
Linux Academy has courseware on it

1097
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,200
You want to learn Ruby, Python, things like that

1098
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,200
Anything that's an ecosystem around Linux and open source

1099
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,200
Linux Academy has courseware on it because they love it

1100
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,200
And they also have just introduced a new feature called Nuggets

1101
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,200
Between 2 and 60 minute courses we just deep dive on a topic

1102
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,200
Nice things too like IP tables

1103
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,200
Or rsync backup or virtualization in VirtualBox

1104
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,200
Headless virtualization under VirtualBox

1105
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,200
And if you're ready to go get those Red Hat certified engineer certifications

1106
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,200
The ones that are basically

1107
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:09,200
What I remember when I was doing interviews

1108
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,200
I would look at somebody's resume

1109
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,200
And there's a few that would really stand out

1110
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,200
The ones that I really respected

1111
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,200
And definitely I would count the Red Hat certifications among them

1112
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,200
Because you really have to actually earn that certification

1113
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,200
It's no joke

1114
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,200
It's a hands on kind of testing

1115
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,200
Where you really have to work with the technology

1116
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,200
And prove you can do it over and over again

1117
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
And as an interviewer you know that

1118
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:36,200
And it's a big deal that Linux Academy has some of the best courseware on the web on this

1119
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,200
And you can go get it right now at a 33% discount

1120
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,200
When you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

1121
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,200
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

1122
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,200
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

1123
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,200
For sponsoring the unplugged program

1124
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,200
Oh man I love the Red Hat certified stuff

1125
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,200
They are really working overtime on that

1126
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,200
Now I am excited to talk to Mr. Skookiesprite

1127
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,200
It's been a while since he's been on the show

1128
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,200
And I guess it is downtime he's been working on

1129
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:02,200
I believe it's called the Radio Controller Project

1130
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,200
Or something along those lines

1131
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,200
Skookiesprite what is it and what's the name?

1132
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,200
Radio Control Room Project

1133
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,200
Control Room

1134
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,200
Yeah RCRproject.com

1135
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,200
Yeah okay so what is it?

1136
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,200
It enables users to create

1137
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,200
From their own local files

1138
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,200
Autonomously self generating programmatic streaming radio

1139
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,200
So like if I want to be a DJ

1140
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,200
Like if I had a whole library of music

1141
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,200
And I wanted to be a DJ for a weekend

1142
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,200
Can I use this?

1143
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Yeah but what's even cooler

1144
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:36,200
Okay so I got the idea because I have 56,000 MP3 files

1145
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:40,200
All of them legitimately ripped from my own CD collection

1146
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,200
Which I donated to the VA library

1147
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,200
And a bunch of vinyl

1148
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:48,200
So I'm thinking 56,000 MP3 files

1149
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,200
How am I ever going to listen to them?

1150
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,200
How am I ever going to even create playlists

1151
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,200
For what I want to hear at any given time right?

1152
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,200
Like are you following me there?

1153
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:58,200
Yeah absolutely

1154
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:03,200
Yeah okay so I thought well what if I had a way for

1155
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,200
I like radio a lot

1156
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,200
And what makes radio good

1157
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,200
The thing that makes radio good is their programs

1158
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,200
You just turn it on

1159
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,200
You turn it on and you don't have to think about it

1160
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,200
It's just the music you love is playing

1161
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,200
Exactly or at certain times

1162
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:20,200
There are programs that are playing certain different types of music

1163
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,200
So what if I could make a program that would just

1164
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,200
Make all of these programs

1165
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,200
Like radio programs

1166
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,200
And stream them all as like one streaming radio thing

1167
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,200
But it sounds like real radio

1168
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,200
And this could be like running on my own server in my house

1169
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,200
That I could hook up to internet

1170
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,200
And it does like an ice cast stream in my phone

1171
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,200
Yeah okay so where the rubber meets the road

1172
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,200
Is ice cast and liquid soap

1173
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,200
But what RCR adds to it

1174
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:50,200
Is like basically the controller that sits on top of it

1175
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,200
I've run it off of

1176
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,200
Right now it runs off of one of my laptops

1177
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:59,200
Which I use as my daily driver pretty much

1178
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:03,200
And it spits it out to a digital ocean droplet

1179
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,200
And anyone can listen to it

1180
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,200
And the really exciting thing is tune in radio now

1181
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:13,200
You can sign up with tune in radio for free

1182
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,200
That's the other thing

1183
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,200
I don't like Pandora and stuff

1184
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,200
Where it's like oh well fine

1185
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,200
We want to access your preferences

1186
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Plus you want to use your own library

1187
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Not Pandora's library

1188
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,200
Absolutely and the other cool thing is

1189
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,200
You can set up every aspect of the shows

1190
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,200
You can decide when a show starts

1191
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,200
The type of bumpers it has

1192
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,200
The intros outros

1193
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,200
It has back and outs

1194
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,200
Now you're going to put me out of work

1195
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,200
You're just automating my job now?

1196
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,200
Pretty much that's what I kind of wanted to do

1197
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,200
Okay cool

1198
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,200
I was cutting straight for you Chris

1199
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,200
So I'm gathering this is a closed source project

1200
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,200
Released under a Microsoft license?

1201
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Absolutely no

1202
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,200
No it's totally built on a free and open source stack

1203
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,200
Like I said like you said liquid soap

1204
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,200
And ice cast

1205
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,200
And then this is built on top of it

1206
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,200
And we're adding an HTML interface for it

1207
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,200
Right now you configure your shows

1208
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,200
By actual text files and stuff

1209
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
Which is not that bad

1210
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,200
Because there's a lot of stuff to configure

1211
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,200
So could a person say like

1212
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,200
In somebody in our chat room for example

1213
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
Could they string together a few chapters

1214
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:26,200
Of an old time radio series or an audio book

1215
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,200
And kind of have like a weekly serial that broadcasts?

1216
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Yes absolutely

1217
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,200
That's cool

1218
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,200
The latest Unstable bill

1219
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,200
Because like basically

1220
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,200
The coolest thing about RCR

1221
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,200
Is that it makes sure

1222
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,200
It has several checks in terms of like what gets added

1223
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,200
Okay here

1224
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,200
So like when you create a show

1225
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,200
You select from all of these different directories

1226
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,200
Or all of these individual files

1227
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,200
That you want to have played

1228
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,200
And it actually has checks

1229
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,200
That you can turn on or off

1230
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,200
Like global freshness factor for instance

1231
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,200
So only every six hours

1232
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,200
Before any song repeats

1233
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,200
Across any show

1234
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,200
Et cetera et cetera et cetera

1235
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,200
So it's designed to randomize

1236
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,200
So that you hear stuff that you wouldn't normally

1237
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,200
Hear if you were

1238
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,200
That's pretty cool

1239
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,200
And so the link to the project

1240
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,200
Which you can also just find at rcrproject.com

1241
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,200
We'll have a link in the show notes

1242
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,200
And eventually

1243
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,200
I'll just have this doing Linux Unplugged in the future

1244
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,200
You won't even know

1245
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,200
It'll just be powered by this thing

1246
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,200
Linux Unplugged from a distance from Las Vegas

1247
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,200
No that's the coolest thing is you get to be

1248
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,200
The puppet master you get to create

1249
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,200
Okay so the hardest thing about creating your own

1250
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,200
Streaming radio station that doesn't suck

1251
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,200
Is actually being there to create your own

1252
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Program to DJ in

1253
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,200
I mean like hell who has the time

1254
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,200
To DJ you know 24 hours of programming

1255
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,200
A day well now you can without having

1256
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,200
To be there boom boom

1257
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,200
There you go now we're going to need a jobs

1258
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,200
Program for all those DJs that are getting put out of work by

1259
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,200
Scooby Sprite but it's cool in the name of

1260
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:59,200
The source it's cool so check out

1261
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,200
We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys

1262
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,200
Want to check it out and that'll bring us towards the end

1263
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,200
Of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged

1264
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,200
Wes I'm glad you could make it out even after the big move

1265
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,200
Congrats to the new place

1266
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Well thank you sir pleasure to be here

1267
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,200
The new digs in Seattle and big thanks to

1268
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,200
The folks at OSCON who

1269
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
Interviewed us and thanks to

1270
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,200
Noah of course for making it out there with me

1271
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,200
And you know I gotta say I really really

1272
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,200
Enjoyed taking this

1273
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,200
You know all of the interviews we did for Linux Unplugged

1274
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,200
Were just on this little portable recorder

1275
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,200
And I think it got some really great chats

1276
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Because it's more disarming

1277
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,200
Than having a big video camera in your face

1278
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,200
And I loved it was a good

1279
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,200
It was a good fun opportunity for me to just

1280
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,200
Focus on doing interviews for an audio only show

1281
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,200
And I think it made for a much more enjoyable

1282
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,200
OSCON for me so there's a

1283
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,200
Lesson in that for all of us but I want to invite

Go pick now it probably should be

1310
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,200
Something with the OSCON in there since that was the

1311
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200

Jupiterbroadcasting.com

1318
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
Oh heck I did a

1319
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
Search now you see what I'm talking

1320
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,200
About there you go

1321
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,200
Yeah Wimpy you got a lot of coverage didn't you

1322
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,200
Oh boy I didn't

1323
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,200
Realize honestly I thought

1324
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,200
Like 20 comments

1325
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,200
On my G Plus stream were

1326
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,200
The size of it I had no idea yeah I was

1327
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,200
Surprised when I saw the amount of coverage I got I was like

1328
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,200
Wow this is an issue that resonates

1329
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,200
With people OSCON

1330
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,200
Secret sauce is in what's interesting is that

1331
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,200
There's more

1332
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:55,200
People saying

1333
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,200
Don't remove it than there are people

1334
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,200
Agreeing with removing it so

1335
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:01,200
That's cause crazy people outnumber us

1336
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,200
Yeah you know you know Wimpy

1337
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,200
My only experience with

1338
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,200
That is at a certain point

1339
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,200
You gotta go with your gut

1340
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,200
And despite oh yeah

1341
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,200
I mean you know I'm getting feedback

1342
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,200
Right now that would literally

1343
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,200
Would literally be suicide for the show

1344
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,200
If I followed it and I get it over and over again

1345
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,200
And I've got a fresh batch of it today

1346
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,200
There's an active thread in our subreddit

1347
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,200
And it just

1348
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,200
It really shows you how sometimes

1349
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,200
The reason why you're the person making

1350
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,200
The content is because you are willing

1351
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,200
To take these risks

1352
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,200
And so you know you can't

1353
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,200
You gotta move forward

1354
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,200
I think it's a beautiful thing to do because worst case

1355
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,200
Is you can always put it back in the next release

1356
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,200
So what if

1357
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,200
It's already there yeah

1358
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,200
If you could wave a magic wand and

1359
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,200
Fix software center what would you do

1360
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,200
Like you know

1361
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,200
Other than removing it what's the

1362
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,200
Magic wand fix for software center?

1363
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,200
I wouldn't bring it to the ground

1364
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,200
Are you asking me or is that a general question?

1365
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,200
It's a general question

1366
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,200
Yeah

1367
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,200
Okay so one the

1368
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,200
Developers having access to the

1369
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
Paid section of the Ubuntu software center

1370
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,200
And not having access to do

1371
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,200
Anything at all on the

1372
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,200
Open source thing that sucks

1373
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,200
I don't understand what you're saying

1374
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,200
If I create

1375
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,200
If I put an app in the Ubuntu software center that is

1376
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,200
Completely free

1377
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,200
But it's on the paid section

1378
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,200
I can control the source of the app and I can

1379
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,200
Actually update it myself and I can do

1380
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,200
Whatever I want I can change descriptions I can change

1381
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,200
The photos and all that good stuff

1382
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,200
If I have my app in the open source side of it

1383
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,200
And I have absolutely zero

1384
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,200
Control and I have to just

1385
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,200
Beg and beg and beg for them to do anything

1386
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,200
Rod and wasn't that the

1387
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,200
Thing like they wouldn't update you went through

1388
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,200
Several updates of your own project

1389
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,200
And they wouldn't update it?

1390
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,200
Yeah it took me a year to get my stuff updated

1391
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,200
That's less of a Ubuntu software

1392
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,200
I accept that's an issue

1393
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,200
That's less of an Ubuntu software center issue

1394
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,200
Having that split

1395
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,200
Is irritating the fact that I

1396
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,200
Can't control that is incredibly

1397
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,200
Irritating but also

1398
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,200
As an end user

1399
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,200
The recommendation

1400
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,200
System is pretty much

1401
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,200
Useless because it's based on your

1402
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,200
Account that you don't have yet

1403
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,200
So then you'd have to create the account which the Ubuntu

1404
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,200
One thing which then they announced that Ubuntu

1405
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:21,200
One was going away but they really weren't taking

1406
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,200
It away it was just the music

1407
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,200
I know I just explained

1408
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,200
What I meant anyway it created

1409
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,200
Confusion it created confusion

1410
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,200
Because Ubuntu

1411
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,200
One music is called Ubuntu One

1412
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,200
And no one called it Ubuntu One music

1413
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
It confused people so then now

1414
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
There's actually people who do say that

1415
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,200
It's gone and I've had to explain

1416
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,200
To them no it's not it's still there

1417
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,200
It's just confusing

1418
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,200
We just wish that it was gone

1419
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,200
No I actually

1420
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,200
Explained anyway it doesn't matter

1421
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,200
The point is though there is

1422
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,200
A situation with

1423
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,200
The listings

1424
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,200
Of what you have installed

1425
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,200
Is

1426
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,200
Only available when you're logged into your account

1427
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,200
So you can't look to see

1428
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,200
What you actually have installed on your

1429
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:09,200
Computer in the software center unless

1430
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,200
You have it logged in

1431
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,200
That's people that have actually used it

1432
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,200
Your complaints Rodden are all from complaints people

1433
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,200
That have ever used it I think the first impression

1434
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,200
It's also incredibly slow

1435
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,200
That's what I'm aiming at

1436
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
The search is incredibly awful

1437
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
The search is absolutely terrible

1438
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,200
The search is bad but hold on hold on

1439
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,200
I'm asking this from the perspective of

1440
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,200
Someone who's installing Ubuntu Mate

1441
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,200
So someone who's installing Ubuntu Mate

1442
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,200
They're going to be affected by the fact that this is missing

1443
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,200
So those are people who are doing a clean install

1444
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,200
Those are new users these are not people who've already

1445
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,200
Got like hundreds of pounds spent

1446
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,200
In the Ubuntu store so I'm saying from the perspective

1447
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,200
Of someone who's experiencing

1448
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,200
Ubuntu software center in

1449
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,200
Something like Mate or any other desktop

1450
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,200
For that matter what

1451
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,200
Other than it being slow I appreciate it is slow

1452
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,200
And I hear that quite a lot what

1453
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,200
What else is wrong with the software

1454
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,200
Center itself I'll tell you what

1455
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,200
No I'll tell you the search actually

1456
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,200
Moves itself based on different parts of

1457
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,200
Where you are in the software center so if you actually

1458
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,200
Do a search you go to a

1459
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,200
You go to any of the

1460
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
Items for the results you no longer

1461
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
Have your search box you have to revert

1462
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
Back to two previous pages

1463
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,200
Before you find your search box again

1464
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,200
Yeah that is awful

1465
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,200
Here's what it is

1466
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,200
And I think why I care is because

1467
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,200
It's at a big picture

1468
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,200
What the Linux desktop screws up

1469
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:29,200
All the time it's like if we can't

1470
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
Do it right let's not do it

1471
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,200
At all because then it's just

1472
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,200
Compared to what Mac and Windows

1473
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
Is doing and so if we have

1474
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,200
A software store it has

1475
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,200
To be comparable to what

1476
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
I understand it existed before the

1477
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,200
Mac app store did and before the Windows 10

1478
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,200
Software store did but now it also

1479
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,200
Exists in a world where those things do exist

1480
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,200
And where a lot of people are coming from

1481
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,200
Yeah and so I feel like

1482
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,200
It sort of personifies that

1483
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,200
Poor knockoff

1484
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,200
Sort of

1485
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:01,200
Reputation that the commenters on Engadget

1486
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,200
Give Ubuntu all the time

1487
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,200
Chris let me put you this way

1488
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,200
I tried to get my now

1489
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,200
Ex-girlfriend and no it was not because

1490
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,200
The Ubuntu software store

1491
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,200
But it was close

1492
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:15,200
I tried to get her to

1493
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,200
Jump onto Ubuntu and

1494
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,200
I'm like oh well just look on

1495
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,200
Whatever they have because I'm used to all these other

1496
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,200
Distributions and she's like no but this doesn't work

1497
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,200
She's looking for something that

1498
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,200
Could manage her photos better

1499
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,200
And there's no

1500
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,200
Alternatives to is so much

1501
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,200
Better that's where I think

1502
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,200
Yeah you do exist in this world where

1503
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,200
The software other competing

1504
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,200
Things exist and yeah

1505
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,200
It should have been fixed two years ago but

1506
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:43,200
I think the web version is better what were you going to say?

1507
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,200
They actually have their own

1508
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,200
They have a better version that's their website

1509
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,200
Appstabuntu.com

1510
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,200
I know but that's how much ships with

1511
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,200
The OS

1512
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,200
Well it doesn't matter you go to it

1513
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,200
Regardless and they can put a link in the

1514
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,200
Launcher that just opens that website

1515
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,200
In a frame kind of thing

1516
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,200
How about in a scope?

1517
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,200
Yeah put it

1518
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,200
Right up there in the dash

1519
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,200
I made a video about ten months ago

1520
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,200
Explaining why the USC versus

1521
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,200
That website

1522
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,200
Appstabuntu.com that is

1523
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,200
Such a better solution

1524
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,200
It was myself and Poppy and you

1525
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,200
Rotten that were having a discussion a lot

1526
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,200
Like this ten months ago that prompted

1527
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,200
You to make that video

1528
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,200
Because I had not heard of Appstabuntu.com

1529
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,200
When we were

1530
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,200
Oh yeah that's true

1531
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,200
I like Appstabuntu.com

1532
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,200
The problem is that that's not

1533
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,200
Maintained either because you'll find that

1534
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,200
It's not perfect

1535
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
I haven't got entries for the current versions

1536
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,200
Right it's not perfect but the search

1537
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,200
Results work

1538
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,200
If it was faster

1539
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,200
If it was faster

1540
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,200
Had better search results and didn't

1541
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:53,200
Bother doing recommendations based on

1542
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,200
Stuff it doesn't know about

1543
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,200
You

1544
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,200
It's just

1545
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,200
I would rather it be able to scan what I

1546
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,200
Already have rather than

1547
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,200
Require me to create an account

1548
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,200
Log into the account

1549
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,200
Give them permission to see my install

1550
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,200
So if it just looks at your existing

1551
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,200
Packages on your machine

1552
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,200
Without going off to the cloud or anything like that

1553
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,200
Right it just streamlined it and made it simpler

1554
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,200
And some people might

1555
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,200
Go oh well I don't want them to see

1556
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,200
What I have installed it's like well it's local

1557
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,200
Anyway it doesn't matter it's only telling

1558
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
You what it sees

1559
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:29,200
Here's a couple things right here's the really

1560
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,200
Depressing thing is this is the same

1561
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,200
Commentary that Matt and I have made

1562
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:35,200
On the Linux action show for the last couple of years

1563
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,200
You guys had this conversation as recent as 10

1564
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,200
Months ago and I think the reason why

1565
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,200
Wimpy's story got so much traction is

1566
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:43,200
Because it's now just gotten into the general

1567
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,200
Ubuntu community's mind that the software center

1568
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,200
Is a total train wreck and that's

1569
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,200
Why that story picked up momentum is because

1570
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,200
It's just a general shared consensus

1571
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:53,200
Now and Poppy I love you but

1572
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,200
Like I gotta say like

1573
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,200
Chris is totally right I remember when this show was

1574
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,200
Started that was when I started listening to it

1575
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:01,200
We were still talking about it in my opinion

1576
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,200
Just so you know whether you love me or hate me

1577
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,200
Doesn't take away from the fact that

1578
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:07,200
Software center sucks I can handle

1579
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,200
Wimpy you are getting

1580
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,200
Such a tiny

1581
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,200
Percentage of the people that are following

1582
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,200
This story commenting saying you shouldn't get rid

1583
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,200
Of it because the amount of momentum

1584
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:19,200
And distribution this story has got

1585
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:21,200
Is so proportionally outweighing

1586
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,200
The amount of comments you're getting about why it should

1587
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,200
Be removed it's just really hard to see that

1588
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,200
Until you've been through this cycle a few

1589
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,200
Dozen times it's obvious just by the

1590
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,200
By the sheer amount of momentum the story

1591
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,200
Got that it is a shared consensus

1592
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,200
By a lot of people it doesn't mean by everybody

1593
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,200
But I'd say it's a majority

1594
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,200
So

1595
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,200
Poppy asked the question how

1596
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,200
Would we I

1597
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,200
Fix the Ubuntu software center

1598
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,200
My answer to that is

1599
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,200
Primarily I look to my immediate

1600
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,200
Family and the close friends

1601
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:53,200
Of mine that run Ubuntu Marte

1602
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:55,200
That are not

1603
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,200
Super technical computer users

1604
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,200
They use it because it's familiar and they

1605
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,200
Know how to get stuff done using it

1606
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,200
They can use the Ubuntu

1607
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,200
Software center just fine they're

1608
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,200
They've been using some of them

1609
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,200
Have been using Ubuntu for six

1610
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,200
Years or more some have been using it

1611
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,200
For a year 18 months

1612
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,200
They see that as a perfectly

1613
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,200
Usable tool so for them I

1614
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,200
Don't need to change it but what you

1615
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,200
Said Chris is absolutely right

1616
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,200
The undercurrent of

1617
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,200
Feeling about the Ubuntu software

1618
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,200
Center is that it's not very

1619
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,200
Good anymore and

1620
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,200
You hear that enough times

1621
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,200
And I'm in a position where

1622
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,200
I can make a change hopefully for the better

1623
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,200
So this change

1624
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:39,200
I'm ushering in by removing Ubuntu

1625
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,200
Software center as the default installed

1626
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,200
App store is

1627
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,200
Because people that

1628
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,200
Are familiar with the Ubuntu community

1629
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,200
And have been a part of it for a long time

1630
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,200
Generally seem to have

1631
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,200
This collective feeling that the Ubuntu software

1632
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,200
Is not that great and it should

1633
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,200
Be replaced with something better and what I'm

1634
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,200
Providing is the choice

1635
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,200
For those people to make

1636
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,200
That decision so they can choose to stay

1637
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:05,200
With the Ubuntu software center or

1638
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,200
They can use app grid and potentially

1639
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,200
A third way as well and we'll see if

1640
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,200
That pans out in the future

1641
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,200
It's giving the users the choice

1642
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,200
And for those of you that aren't familiar with

1643
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,200
Ubuntu mate welcome it

1644
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,200
Pops up on

1645
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,200
First login you've probably seen these

1646
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,200
Welcome screens from other distributions

1647
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,200
So the ability

1648
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,200
To click the software button and

1649
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:29,200
See this option to install an app

1650
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:31,200
Store is right there in front of

1651
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,200
Every new install every

1652
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,200
New user on the system

1653
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,200
So it's not tucked away or

1654
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,200
Hidden it's front and center

1655
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,200
I think that's a good compromise

1656
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:43,200
I like it

1657
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,200
And it is a compromise

1658
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,200
But we'll see whether

1659
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,200
It's a good decision or not and maybe

1660
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,200
Maybe for beta 1 or beta 2 we have

1661
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,200
A change of policy but you know

1662
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,200
Ubuntu software centers future

1663
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:57,200
Is maybe you should just keep

1664
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,200
Alternating it like each

1665
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,200
Release just like rip it out put it back

1666
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,200
Hey what could go wrong

1667
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,200
I know that Ubuntu mate

1668
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,200
Is sort of a throwback to how Ubuntu

1669
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,200
Used to be but I'm not going to swap out

1670
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,200
Major applications every cycle

1671
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,200
Remember you know rhythm box

1672
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,200
In f-spot out you remember

1673
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,200
How it was I'm not doing that

1674
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:35,200
Oh lord
