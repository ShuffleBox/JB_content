This is Linux Unplugged episode 46 for June 24th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's reporting in from Charlotte,

00:40.920 --> 00:49.040
North Carolina. My name is Chris. Hello, Matt. Hello, Matt. Hello. Hello. Hi there. So, we've

00:49.040 --> 00:54.680
got a big show today because we've got more stuff from Southeast Linux Fest 2014. Matt's

00:54.680 --> 00:59.080
joining us on Mumble this week. We're going mumble mumble for all of the audio, which

00:59.080 --> 01:04.120
we'll see how that works. It's an experience. So far, it's been a little troublesome. But

01:04.120 --> 01:08.440
I think we worked out the kinks enough to do a show. And we also have Q5Sis. He's joined

01:08.440 --> 01:12.640
us today. He was down at Southeast Linux Fest. Noah couldn't make it because I guess he's

01:12.640 --> 01:19.040
going to Australia, I guess. I don't know. That guy's crazy. Wow. Yeah. I know. And he

01:19.040 --> 01:23.920
just sent me an awesome little goody bag of stuff. He's got these Blackberry chargers

01:23.920 --> 01:28.200
he loves, so he sent me a couple of those and a microphone. And then the coolest thing

01:28.200 --> 01:33.760
ever, it lets you run HDMI over Ethernet. So, we could have like machines up in the

01:33.760 --> 01:38.220
editing office that we could run down to the studio over our Ethernet and capture their

01:38.220 --> 01:43.880
full screens, 1080p capture, over the network. It's kind of cool. That's awesome. No, it's

01:43.880 --> 01:47.320
so cool. So, he just sent all that kind of stuff in and got a bunch of great interviews

01:47.320 --> 01:51.920
we'll be playing today. But I thought, Matt, we would start with a little bit of follow-up

01:51.920 --> 01:57.320
and feedback. Mr. Rotten Corpse, are you in here today? Paging Mr. Rotten Corpse. Did

01:57.320 --> 02:04.160
you have anything to mention about the XBMC app art that you've been working on? Paging

02:04.160 --> 02:08.480
Mr. Corpse. Oh, yeah, sure. Is my audio fine? Because it's kind of... It's all right. It's

02:08.480 --> 02:17.000
enough to tell us about the XBMC app. Yeah. Yeah. Me and Rob Lowe are working on an update

02:17.000 --> 02:24.280
to the XBMC app. There's been a lot of improvements to the artwork and language. So, there should

02:24.280 --> 02:31.000
be a new update to it in about a day or two. Very cool. Very cool. So, it's a better time

02:31.000 --> 02:34.640
than ever to have the Jupyter Broadcasting XBMC app. And I saw that you guys were working

02:34.640 --> 02:38.920
on that last night, and that's really cool. So, I wanted to give a mention for that. So,

02:38.920 --> 02:44.760
let's jump into our feedback. Corky98 submitted an article to the Linux Action Show subreddit

02:44.760 --> 02:48.680
kind of following up on our conversation regarding Mantle on the Linux Action Show this Sunday.

02:48.680 --> 02:52.800
He says, hello, Chris. On this week's Linux Action Show, you showed a clip of an AMD representative

02:52.800 --> 02:57.080
announcing the possibility of Mantle support for Linux in the future. While this is all

02:57.080 --> 03:02.120
very good, Mantle is another proprietary solution to the problem of graphic APIs and is bound

03:02.120 --> 03:05.840
to eventually fail. I respect that the first few years Mantle will probably outperform

03:05.840 --> 03:10.520
OpenGL and maybe even DirectX, but proprietary solutions will always run out of steam due

03:10.520 --> 03:14.560
to the amount of effort needed to maintain them. Money runs proprietary solutions and

03:14.560 --> 03:19.400
AMD will not assign a large budget year after year to maintain the code. I did my research

03:19.400 --> 03:24.560
and before I was old enough to remember OpenGL and DirectX eye to eye, here's John Carmack

03:24.560 --> 03:29.600
complaining about DirectX and a 2002 article summing up DirectX. In early 2000s, DirectX

03:29.600 --> 03:35.360
was considered shambles and OpenGL was clearly an outperformer by then, by far. Then Microsoft

03:35.360 --> 03:39.600
stepped up their game and caught up. DirectX is still ahead because of that boost in support

03:39.600 --> 03:44.500
in the early 2000s. So, what does this mean? It means that maybe Matt's assumption that

03:44.500 --> 03:50.500
OpenGL couldn't be fixed could be considered incorrect. OpenGL is heavily restructured

03:50.500 --> 03:53.600
because the industry support for multiple versions of OpenGL and the newest version

03:53.600 --> 03:59.240
is not pushed, unlike DirectX. Yes, OpenGL is very differently structured to DirectX,

03:59.240 --> 04:01.760
but it doesn't mean it cannot be saved. And there's also, something he doesn't go into,

04:01.760 --> 04:06.160
but there's also an extension system to OpenGL that is also a good thing and a bad thing.

04:06.160 --> 04:11.040
But he thinks the important part is that the same AMD representative said that before Mantle

04:11.040 --> 04:16.400
support that a high-quality OpenGL driver was going to be provided for Linux. This is

04:16.400 --> 04:20.720
the news, Corky thinks, not Mantle support for Linux. Of course, they're lying and they'll

04:20.720 --> 04:25.760
put a bit more work, release an entirely new version number and it will still be pretty.

04:25.760 --> 04:31.100
But he said, also with things like Wayland coming down, this completely coincides with

04:31.100 --> 04:35.000
Wayland becoming usable. So, if they leave it for a year or two, wait for Wayland to

04:35.000 --> 04:40.400
get sort of figured out, wait to see where Valve pushes things, and then maybe AMD will

04:40.400 --> 04:44.520
come along with either their new OpenGL or Mantle release.

04:44.520 --> 04:49.760
That's an interesting idea, Corky. And Corky wanted to kind of write in, essentially, and

04:49.760 --> 04:54.960
chime in support for OpenGL because both Matt and I were kind of like, well, OpenGL seems

04:54.960 --> 04:58.400
to be fine, but developers seem to have written the book on it and decided they're not happy

04:58.400 --> 05:02.040
with it anymore. And I think that was sort of the key piece that Matt and I were talking

05:02.040 --> 05:07.560
about. And I think that's still the case. I think part of the problem is that developers

05:07.560 --> 05:10.000
have just kind of checked out. I mean, Matt, am I missing anything? Is that kind of...

05:10.000 --> 05:14.360
Well, no, I think that's it. I also think it's important to remember that my point was

05:14.360 --> 05:19.040
that the very first thing out of my mouth is I know squat about OpenGL. That was the

05:19.040 --> 05:22.520
very first thing out of my mouth, so I can't speculate on something I don't understand.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
Yeah, totally.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
Let's get that out of the way.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.520
Let's just make that a disclaimer.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.360
Yeah, let's be clear on this. But that being said, I do think that at the end of the day,

05:30.360 --> 05:35.040
whether it's tinfoil or OpenGL or pies out of the sky, if the developers aren't into

05:35.040 --> 05:40.240
it, that's a thing. So we can try and tree hug our way through this, like we usually

05:40.240 --> 05:41.240
do.

05:41.240 --> 05:47.120
Okay, Matt, so let's take Heaven's Revenge as a take here. Heaven's Revenge, you think

05:47.120 --> 05:49.000
it's something to do with the kids?

05:49.000 --> 05:56.120
I think so, because didn't all this graphics API hoopla happen in the late 80s, early 90s,

05:56.120 --> 06:00.160
where there was a whole bunch of different APIs, and then they all converged into one,

06:00.160 --> 06:05.800
well, two standards, DirectX and OpenGL, so they're just going back and making a whole

06:05.800 --> 06:07.400
bunch of problems all over again.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.880
Oh, I see what you're saying. The new developers didn't learn the lessons of the past generation.

06:11.880 --> 06:17.000
Yeah, they don't know what our older elders went through to get us to this point.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.080
Yeah, some of those gray hairs were well-earned fighting those battles that they're sort of

06:22.080 --> 06:30.120
retredging up. I will see. I think, just to kind of cap off the whole mantle thing, it'll

06:30.120 --> 06:34.600
happen if gaming on Linux really becomes enough of a market force that people want to make

06:34.600 --> 06:38.040
money on it, and then that's when AMD will pull their head out of their ass, but by then

06:38.040 --> 06:42.160
it will be too late to become fully relevant and lock it in.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.240
So Sebastian writes in, we got really up in a huff a couple of weeks ago about Alienware

06:47.240 --> 06:53.160
switching over to Windows for their quote-unquote Steam machine. Sebastian says, hey guys, there's

06:53.160 --> 06:59.320
a video from E3 with the Alienware console that you talked about. In the video, they

06:59.320 --> 07:05.120
talk about being flexible and giving you the opportunity to upgrade to SteamOS or install

07:05.120 --> 07:12.200
the beta of SteamOS without voiding your warranty. So I thought this was extremely interesting

07:12.200 --> 07:17.440
because this was a huge, they're basically torpedoing their future SteamOS effort. So

07:17.440 --> 07:20.840
here is the clip of the Alienware rep.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.960
Now if someone is interested in SteamOS, if they pick this up now, it's going to come

07:23.960 --> 07:26.600
with Windows and they'll be able to upgrade this later, correct?

07:26.600 --> 07:30.720
Absolutely. So once SteamOS is finally out, or if you want to load the beta, you absolutely

07:30.720 --> 07:34.320
can load it on this system. We'll not void your warranty by any means. We'll support

07:34.320 --> 07:37.980
it. We'll even help you do it if you need instructions on how to do it. SteamOS also

07:37.980 --> 07:42.840
works with the Xbox 360 gamepad. It also works with the Logitech gamepad and a few others.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.640
So this is SteamOS ready.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.120
Exactly. I know a lot of guys out there were a little bit hesitant when they first started

07:48.120 --> 07:52.200
hearing about these pre-built SteamOS boxes coming out, or in this case a WindowsOS box

07:52.200 --> 07:55.280
because they're like, oh, why don't I build my own? This has a compelling value due to

07:55.280 --> 07:58.520
stuff like form factor and price, which is actually very impressive.

07:58.520 --> 08:04.040
There you go. And that was on the Linus Tech Tips YouTube page and they talk about the

08:04.040 --> 08:10.840
fact that, you know what, they're going to actually support users that want to install

08:10.840 --> 08:12.720
SteamOS. Does this make you feel better, Matt?

08:12.720 --> 08:17.040
It makes me feel a little better because I feel like rather than living with their head

08:17.040 --> 08:20.240
in their clouds or off their butts, depending on how you want to feel like they're actually

08:20.240 --> 08:27.500
trying to embrace it, but basically placing responsibility onto the end user. I'm fine

08:27.500 --> 08:30.060
with that, as long as they're not being debased about it.

08:30.060 --> 08:34.560
So Riley, you think it's a terrible idea. Terrible idea.

08:34.560 --> 08:39.960
Yes, because they still have to support their software, which is Windows essentially, they

08:39.960 --> 08:45.600
still have to do their license fees for it, and you have to support it after SteamOS does

08:45.600 --> 08:52.600
come out. They should have just waited for a stable build on SteamOS, but they did, and

08:52.600 --> 08:56.360
they were just lazy, and I don't know what they did with it. But they should have waited.

08:56.360 --> 09:00.960
I think that's still it. I think the fact that they had a Windows UI ready to roll right

09:00.960 --> 09:04.160
out of the gate shows that they were kind of planning for things not to work out, they

09:04.160 --> 09:07.920
weren't fully into it, and I think that's the real nail in the coffin.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.240
All right, Rod and Corpse, if you want to play devil's advocate, go ahead, I'll let

09:11.240 --> 09:12.240
you.

09:12.240 --> 09:22.800
Okay, so I was thinking maybe it's helpful in a way. It's negative to the SteamOS, sure,

09:22.800 --> 09:27.000
but it could potentially be good, because if they're calling the SteamBox or Steam Machine

09:27.000 --> 09:33.440
and people start seeing that more often than just regular Valve Steam users, and they see

09:33.440 --> 09:38.880
that the machine is able to be bought as a SteamBox, and then the next version is Linux,

09:38.880 --> 09:44.960
they will still see it as a SteamBox, and maybe have more likelihood to buy it.

09:44.960 --> 09:50.880
Hmm. All right, okay. I guess I could see that, particularly if the user is just totally

09:50.880 --> 09:54.160
unaware, but it seems at least for the first year...

09:54.160 --> 09:55.960
I don't believe that, I'm just thinking it's a possibility.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.000
Okay, okay, I was going to say, because it seems like for the first year or two of this

09:59.000 --> 10:02.080
console's life, the consumer is going to be pretty aware of what it is, because it's going

10:02.080 --> 10:08.240
to be the savvier of the groups buying initially. I don't think the most average consumer has

10:08.240 --> 10:13.200
any idea that the Xbox 360 runs a version of the anti-kernel. I think it's totally irrelevant

10:13.200 --> 10:16.760
to them. They don't need to know it runs Windows, they don't give a crap that it runs Windows,

10:16.760 --> 10:20.600
and I think SteamOS machines would eventually be like that, but I think for the first couple

10:20.600 --> 10:25.400
years it's probably... probably people who know what an operating system is probably

10:25.400 --> 10:31.360
know what the advantages of Windows over Linux are, maybe, I think? I don't know.

10:31.360 --> 10:32.360
I think initially...

10:32.360 --> 10:33.360
Oh, go ahead, Matt.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.720
Well, I just wanted to draw one thing on here, is that at the end of the day, even if you

10:37.720 --> 10:41.520
know what the OS is, if they're trying to target gamers, there's a little thing called

10:41.520 --> 10:42.520
titles.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.240
Yeah, very true.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.560
And they're trying to launch with as many titles as possible. Now, while I think Alienware

10:47.560 --> 10:51.640
is definitely kind of selling us all down the road, and certainly that's true to the

10:51.640 --> 10:55.700
day, it's a money grab. I'm not expecting them to be all touchy-feely about it, just

10:55.700 --> 10:58.880
they're looking at making money, period. They don't care.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.320
Yeah. And, Poby, what's your point of view on this topic?

11:02.320 --> 11:08.480
They're a hardware manufacturer, they need to sell hardware, and I think, given SteamOS

11:08.480 --> 11:14.920
isn't out, I think it's perfectly reasonable for them to make a machine that runs whatever

11:14.920 --> 11:18.880
operating system is out at the time. Like, right now, I would really love to have a box

11:18.880 --> 11:24.160
underneath my TV. I cannot be bothered to build something. I would rather buy off the

11:24.160 --> 11:28.120
shelf, and maybe I'm paying a premium for that, maybe I'm not getting the same components.

11:28.120 --> 11:33.000
But I'm pretty sure there's plenty of people out there who, like me, would buy something

11:33.000 --> 11:38.200
like over the internet or from a store, and if it happens to have Windows on it, so be

11:38.200 --> 11:41.820
it, in the same way that anyone else would buy a laptop that happens to have Windows

11:41.820 --> 11:46.880
on it. I'll stick it under my TV, maybe I'll install Linux on it later when the Windows

11:46.880 --> 11:53.320
install becomes cruft-laden and horrible, because that's what Windows installs do. So

11:53.320 --> 11:57.840
what do you do? You wipe it and you put Linux on it, and that's what people will do.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.360
And so they'll see it as a performance upgrade, a boost.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.520
Right. And I don't think it's a lazy thing. I think someone suggested that it was lazy

12:04.520 --> 12:09.040
of Alienware. I don't think it's lazy. They need to sell hardware. They've already put

12:09.040 --> 12:14.100
the R&D into making this thing. So it makes sense for them to ship the thing rather than

12:14.100 --> 12:17.200
leave it on shelves or mothball the thing. It makes sense.

12:17.200 --> 12:22.600
Do you think maybe it underscores the fact that they believe in a home theater PC-type

12:22.600 --> 12:26.880
setup for console gaming, and they think that's the real revolution, is getting a PC that

12:26.880 --> 12:31.760
powerful in that form factor in the living room with a controller-capable UI. That's

12:31.760 --> 12:35.440
the thing that they believe in, not necessarily what operating system powers it.

12:35.440 --> 12:39.040
Exactly. And the fact that they're willing to support people trying to get SteamOS on

12:39.040 --> 12:44.600
it, the beta of SteamOS, all power to them. If anyone else had come out with a piece of

12:44.600 --> 12:49.120
hardware and said, look, we're running a proprietary OS, but we will actively help you install

12:49.120 --> 12:52.520
an alternative OS, surely that should be applauded.

12:52.520 --> 12:57.040
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You said commercial software.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.400
Yeah, thanks, Richard.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
He wanted to clear that up.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.280
Yeah, right. All right, well, we're going to get into Southeast Linux Fest. We'll have

13:05.280 --> 13:09.560
more links, including some additional info that didn't quite fit in the show notes if

13:09.560 --> 13:10.560
you guys want to check that.

13:10.560 --> 13:15.000
Before we go on, I want to thank DigitalOcean, one of the sponsors of the Linux Unplugged

13:15.000 --> 13:18.120
podcast. Now, you know about DigitalOcean, right? Because it's kind of like one of the

13:18.120 --> 13:22.320
coolest companies to come around in a while. It's simple cloud hosting, and DigitalOcean

13:22.320 --> 13:27.280
is dedicated to offering really the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.480
And you know, I mean, sure, you can make a cloud server in under a minute, no bigs, right?

13:31.480 --> 13:36.100
Wrong! It's a huge deal! Users can create a cloud server in under 55 seconds, and pricing

13:36.100 --> 13:43.960
plans start at only $5 a month for 512MB of RAM, a 20GB SSD, a blazing fast CPU, and 1TB

13:43.960 --> 13:48.160
of tier 1 bandwidth. Plus, DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco,

13:48.160 --> 13:54.400
Singapore, and Amsterdam. But man, that interface? That interface is simple! Man, that interface

13:54.400 --> 13:59.320
is intuitive with a control panel that won't stop, and power users can replicate it on

13:59.320 --> 14:05.240
a large scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API. And that stands for Application Programming

14:05.240 --> 14:09.240
Interface. Think about the possibilities! In fact, people have! Because DigitalOcean

14:09.240 --> 14:13.520
has a badass community with a ton of people growing all around it every single day, and

14:13.520 --> 14:18.280
they're making applet controllers for Ubuntu, and that Mac operating system, and all those

14:18.280 --> 14:21.720
other operating systems where you can control your DigitalOcean Droplet right from your

14:21.720 --> 14:25.440
desktop. And of course, because you can get a Droplet imaged, deployed, spun up super

14:25.440 --> 14:29.980
fast, it saves you time, makes it really easy to back up, makes it crazy simple to revert

14:29.980 --> 14:36.700
if you make a mistake. In fact, that makes it ideal for training, too. So many possibilities.

14:36.700 --> 14:42.640
Run your backend infrastructure, train yourself, replace a cloud service for $5 a month. Why

14:42.640 --> 14:46.120
not? Well, I'll tell you why. Maybe you're going to be cheap. I understand. I mean, $5

14:46.120 --> 14:49.480
is not very much money, but you want a better deal. You want something even better? Well,

14:49.480 --> 14:53.760
guess what? Chris is going to hook you up. Going to hook you up. You want to know what

14:53.760 --> 14:57.920
you can do? Use the promo code UNPLUGJUNE. Use the promo code UNPLUGJUNE. When you check

14:57.920 --> 15:01.640
out, you're going to get a $10 credit over DigitalOcean. If you use the $5 rig that I've

15:01.640 --> 15:05.160
been using for a while, you're going to get a ton of machine. And let's be honest, we're

15:05.160 --> 15:09.280
talking about Linux here. We're talking about something that excels as a server operating

15:09.280 --> 15:14.520
system in really, really different, varying different environments. I mean, that's what's

15:14.520 --> 15:18.440
so great about it. And it's amazing what you can get for $5 a month. And if you use our

15:18.440 --> 15:22.760
promo code UNPLUGJUNE, UNPLUGJUNE will get you a $10 credit. Bob's your uncle. You're

15:22.760 --> 15:28.680
going to get to try that droplet for two months. They also have hourly pricing. So if you want

15:28.680 --> 15:33.120
to just try something out for testing, you can. There's lots of reasons to try out DigitalOcean's

15:33.120 --> 15:39.760
super fast provisioning, SSD hard drives, tier one bandwidth, amazing hardware sitting

15:39.760 --> 15:46.440
on top of KVM virtualization, private networking, an active developer community, just a rockin'

15:46.440 --> 15:51.720
community in general. Go check them out. DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UNPLUGJUNE. Don't be

15:51.720 --> 15:56.320
a fool. Go get yourself your own cloud server with root access up in the cloud connected

15:56.320 --> 16:01.040
to tier one bandwidth for only $5 a month. UNPLUGJUNE when you check out. That lets them

16:01.040 --> 16:06.840
know you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged show. And by the way, keeps

16:06.840 --> 16:11.080
us going. And that's also a really good thing. Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

16:11.080 --> 16:12.080
Linux Unplugged.

16:12.080 --> 16:18.440
Okay guys. So Mr. Q5, is there anything you want to set us up with Southeast Linux Fest

16:18.440 --> 16:24.880
before we move on and get into some interviews? I've got six clips I want to play here on

16:24.880 --> 16:30.400
the show. All really good stuff. Our first one is Zach Underwood. Now I don't know, Mr.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.600
Q5, is there anything you want to set us up with before we jump right in or should we

16:33.600 --> 16:34.600
just start?

16:34.600 --> 16:40.200
Well I do want to end up with something. But before we jump in with Zach's video, I do

16:40.200 --> 16:45.200
have to say that for those of us that were there at Linux Fest Northwest, we realize

16:45.200 --> 16:51.800
and we remember that the wireless network situation was kind of bad. The wireless network

16:51.800 --> 16:58.560
itself was phenomenal. Absolutely fantastic connection. The way they had it set up, the

16:58.560 --> 17:03.000
way they did everything was the way it should have been done. This guy, Zach, he knows what

17:03.000 --> 17:04.240
he is doing.

17:04.240 --> 17:10.520
Now how many people in attendance do you know? Do you have a rough number versus Northwest

17:10.520 --> 17:12.800
versus Southeast?

17:12.800 --> 17:15.600
I don't have an exact number.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.040
Was it more or less people? Because that might explain the Wi-Fi.

17:18.040 --> 17:25.680
It was a little bit less. But just the way that the conference was set up, I would say

17:25.680 --> 17:33.280
about the same in the area at the same time. Linux Fest Northwest had a higher volume,

17:33.280 --> 17:36.960
but I would say it was Southeast. I think more people stayed around for the whole day.

17:36.960 --> 17:41.360
Interesting. Interesting. So hey, that's always a big plus when the wireless works. All right.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.800
Well we'll kick it off with Zach's interview and then you can chime in with anything you

17:44.800 --> 17:49.320
want to add and we'll run through some of these. So we'll send it over to Zach Underwood.

17:49.320 --> 17:53.760
Good afternoon. We are still at Southeast Linux Fest going around table to table meeting

17:53.760 --> 17:59.320
a bunch of exciting people. Zach here from Global Vision drove two hours to not only

17:59.320 --> 18:04.360
be at Southeast Linux Fest, but he is giving me internet tokens. Isn't that right, Zach?

18:04.360 --> 18:05.360
Yes, I am.

18:05.360 --> 18:13.400
So this is possibly your presentation, which is coming up in an hour or so. Yeah. It's

18:13.400 --> 18:17.920
going to be the presentation. I am looking forward to the most out of any of them here

18:17.920 --> 18:24.280
at Self. Primarily because I have a particular problem that we were kind of discussing off-camera

18:24.280 --> 18:28.120
that I've been trying to find a solution. And your expertise in this area is going to

18:28.120 --> 18:33.460
be, at least I hope, is going to be instrumental in fixing this problem. So if you could tell

18:33.460 --> 18:39.760
me a little bit about what exactly your presentation and specifically your company does and what

18:39.760 --> 18:41.920
it is, the service that you provided here at Self.

18:41.920 --> 18:47.640
All right. First I'll start off with the company. My company is Global Vision. We're a wireless

18:47.640 --> 18:53.800
ISP. So we provide wireless internet to clients that typically maybe have only DSL and they

18:53.800 --> 19:00.840
want something better than the 1.5 meg DSL. So we set up a tower with access points and

19:00.840 --> 19:08.000
then we point client radios on the client's house to the tower to show them internet.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.880
So what we're doing, my presentation here at Self is basically how to optimize indoor

19:13.880 --> 19:18.160
wireless, particularly in a multi-access point environment. So you would have in a hotel

19:18.160 --> 19:21.840
or a conference room. A lot of the stuff I'm going to be talking about is not really applicable

19:21.840 --> 19:27.680
to a single radio. Those are pretty easy. That's pretty simple. And so I'm going to

19:27.680 --> 19:33.360
talk about optimizing it as for performance, for speed, the difference between 2.4 gigahertz

19:33.360 --> 19:40.040
and 5 gigahertz radios and basically just how to make Wi-Fi not suck.

19:40.040 --> 19:46.520
So give me an idea for somebody who is maybe looking at setting up a very simplistic wireless

19:46.520 --> 19:49.660
network. Maybe they want something just a little bit better than the integrated radio

19:49.660 --> 19:56.640
that's in their router. What do you recommend for just a single autonomous access point?

19:56.640 --> 20:02.560
I'm very bullish on a vendor called Ubiquity. They are very price conscious. They make a

20:02.560 --> 20:09.560
wireless access point called the UAP. It retails for about 69 bucks and it competes with Cisco

20:09.560 --> 20:15.180
access points that go for six or seven hundred dollars. So there is a little bit of a learning

20:15.180 --> 20:19.920
curve with these systems. First off, none of the Ubiquity radios you can actually log

20:19.920 --> 20:25.080
into and see a web interface. You have to use a separate management software which they

20:25.080 --> 20:31.480
give away for free. They don't charge a license. Thank you Cisco. So the UAP is a great choice

20:31.480 --> 20:34.840
for an AP and we actually deploy them quite often to our clients.

20:34.840 --> 20:41.720
So we have set up a number of the Unifi access points. How do those work with Linux?

20:41.720 --> 20:46.560
They actually work really well. They actually run Linux and you can SSH into the radios.

20:46.560 --> 20:51.800
They're running BusyBox which is a very stripped down embedded version of Linux.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.240
How about for the management service? If I wanted to stay away strictly from a Mac or

20:56.240 --> 20:57.920
Windows environment, can I do that?

20:57.920 --> 21:04.280
Yes. They actually prefer to run the management server on a Linux platform. In this case Debian

21:04.280 --> 21:10.200
and Ubuntu. It is a Java based app that uses MongoDB for the backend.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.920
Outstanding. And if people wanted to find more about Global Vision and the concepts

21:13.920 --> 21:15.960
that you're talking about, where can we direct them to?

21:15.960 --> 21:21.880
GlobalVision.net and anyone feel free to email me. I am zunderwood at GlobalVision.net and

21:21.880 --> 21:24.200
I'll be happy to send you a copy of the presentation.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.760
Outstanding. Thank you so much Zach for taking some time to talk with us.

21:26.760 --> 21:27.760
All right. Thank you.

21:27.760 --> 21:32.600
Wait a minute Wimpy. You're connected to us right now by shortwave radio? That's some

21:32.600 --> 21:38.320
kind of special. Yeah, we can hear you. Where do you live that you have to connect by shortwave

21:38.320 --> 21:39.320
radio?

21:39.320 --> 21:46.040
Well, as I learned today, about 15 miles from Popeye, but apparently in the back of beyond,

21:46.040 --> 21:48.280
in the farming belt of North Hampshire.

21:48.280 --> 21:53.160
I love that those APs run Linux. I'm all about that. Like, oh yeah, you can just switch in

21:53.160 --> 21:57.800
and run BusyBox and then you can pretty much do everything you need. And it sounds like

21:57.800 --> 22:03.040
those guys really knew their Wi-Fi stuff based on what Q5 was saying. Okay. Well, so there's

22:03.040 --> 22:07.880
a group called Wicked and they're working on a two-factor authentication system. And

22:07.880 --> 22:11.800
I haven't watched the whole clip yet, but I'm hoping it's essentially an open solution

22:11.800 --> 22:13.800
to two-factor authentication. Let's take a listen.

22:13.800 --> 22:19.400
I'm here with Nick from Wicked and I don't know anything about Wicked right off the bat,

22:19.400 --> 22:23.720
but I got to tell you from looking around your table and looking at some of the promotional

22:23.720 --> 22:27.760
material you have, I have to tell you, I'm intrigued. Can you tell me a little bit about

22:27.760 --> 22:30.160
what Wicked is and what it is you guys do?

22:30.160 --> 22:36.880
Sure. So we provide a two-factor authentication solution. It is a software-based solution.

22:36.880 --> 22:42.560
So the two factors are possession of a private key embedded in a software token and knowledge

22:42.560 --> 22:49.080
of a PIN. And we have a server that sits behind your corporate firewall. It's Linux-based.

22:49.080 --> 22:55.120
And there's a key pair exchange basically between the software token and your server.

22:55.120 --> 22:59.160
And a PIN is created by the user and there's a registration process. And after that, when

22:59.160 --> 23:03.420
the user wants to log in, they type their PIN into the software token. It's encrypted,

23:03.420 --> 23:07.040
sent to your server. If the PIN is correct and the encryption is valid and the account

23:07.040 --> 23:10.600
is active, a one-time passcode is generated on the server, encrypted, and returned to

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
the user.

23:11.600 --> 23:17.680
Now, this is a solution that can be, you said that it's based on Linux. Can your system

23:17.680 --> 23:18.960
be used with Linux?

23:18.960 --> 23:25.320
Oh, yes. So in your infrastructure, what you want to do is establish an authentication

23:25.320 --> 23:34.200
protocol. Typically, what we see is companies use RADIUS. So your VPN, SSH, Apache, FreeNX,

23:34.200 --> 23:39.680
all these systems will talk RADIUS. And the ideal thing is to have them all talk RADIUS

23:39.680 --> 23:45.960
to your free RADIUS server or in the Windows world, the NPS, have it do authorization in

23:45.960 --> 23:51.400
your directory and then proxy the credentials to an authentication server like Wicked.

23:51.400 --> 23:59.160
Sure. Okay. Does this, to get this product rolling, does it take a lot of knowledge in

23:59.160 --> 24:01.960
the development field? Or is it something that an administrator could do?

24:01.960 --> 24:08.080
No. And it's primarily targeted to administrators. And we've got a very easy setup process. We're

24:08.080 --> 24:12.920
trying to make it as easy to set up as software as a service, but be reliable and be in your

24:12.920 --> 24:14.280
location.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.720
So this isn't a subscription-based model. It's something you buy one outright.

24:17.720 --> 24:22.200
Actually, our licensing is different. We have a subscription licensing. So instead of having

24:22.200 --> 24:27.960
a permanent license and charging you 20% per year for support, we actually charge an annual

24:27.960 --> 24:33.880
subscription, but you still control the software. We have a three-year prepayment option, so

24:33.880 --> 24:38.360
you can get a discount if you prepay. But we kind of looked at it as being like, well,

24:38.360 --> 24:41.480
do you really want to pay upfront for all of our software? And then maybe what if we

24:41.480 --> 24:44.600
got a business? So it's less risk for our buyers. We're

24:44.600 --> 24:48.360
incented to keep the software up and running and solid and secure. So it kind of aligns

24:48.360 --> 24:50.960
our incentives.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.720
And the thing is that funding model is probably a little bit more beneficial to your business

24:55.720 --> 25:01.240
to have that steady income rather than somebody, they come in and then they buy it and then

25:01.240 --> 25:02.240
they take off, right?

25:02.240 --> 25:06.400
Yeah. So it makes it harder to grow fast because if you get that big chunk of money, you can

25:06.400 --> 25:11.400
actually grow fast, but it makes it more disciplined. And we're not going to grow faster than we

25:11.400 --> 25:13.200
can grow our marketplace.

25:13.200 --> 25:17.520
Now how does your product compare to something like say Google Authenticator?

25:17.520 --> 25:23.440
So Google Authenticator is primarily their software token. They have like a PAM module

25:23.440 --> 25:30.960
that you can run for SSH. There's two key differences. One is that it is an addition

25:30.960 --> 25:36.800
to passwords. So we prefer to get rid of passwords because they suck.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.520
And it's also really just a PAM module. So what happens when you want to use it for your

25:40.520 --> 25:45.880
VPN? Where's the integration for that? Where's the Apache module? So if you're doing a one-off

25:45.880 --> 25:50.080
thing and you just want to lock down the couple of servers that you manage or have at home,

25:50.080 --> 25:53.760
that's great. If you're really looking at deploying something that can help your organization

25:53.760 --> 25:58.520
grow and manage users and have logging and have support, that's where you'd look to Wicked.

25:58.520 --> 26:02.320
Outstanding. Where can people go to find out more about Wicked and what you guys do and

26:02.320 --> 26:06.760
how to get involved or to, I guess in your case, how to purchase the product or service?

26:06.760 --> 26:13.300
So wickedsystems.com, W-I-K-I-D, systems.com. We have a source for sites. We've got an open

26:13.300 --> 26:19.120
source version. We do welcome contributions to that. And we are on Twitter at wickedsystems

26:19.120 --> 26:20.120
as well.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.920
Perfect. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us. We really appreciate

26:22.920 --> 26:23.920
it.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.360
I like, it says, Doggo Red in their, Dago Red in the chat room says that they were also

26:28.360 --> 26:35.960
giving out mix drink, mix shake, like drink shakers as swag at the fest. That's awesome.

26:35.960 --> 26:39.600
That's a great swag item. I kind of want to check that out. And again, that's wicked and

26:39.600 --> 26:44.600
it's a W-I-K-D. Q5, did you get a chance to look at that stuff? What did you think?

26:44.600 --> 26:49.040
Yeah, their stuff is actually really impressive. And just to let you know, I did happen to

26:49.040 --> 26:50.520
get one of those drink shakers for him.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
Oh, for me?

26:51.520 --> 26:52.520
So I will drop that in the mail.

26:52.520 --> 26:53.520
No way!

26:53.520 --> 26:54.520
Yes, I did.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.520
Oh, awesome.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.880
I saw it and I was like, this is something Chris would love.

26:56.880 --> 26:57.880
I do.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.200
I looked at the guy and said, I'm going to take two. And he's like, well, I really don't

27:00.200 --> 27:04.000
have that many. And I said, well, we're doing an interview. He goes, yeah, okay, I can

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
afford two.

27:05.000 --> 27:11.720
Good man. Good man. Well, I love that. And I'm so glad Noah got the Google Authenticator

27:11.720 --> 27:15.080
question in there because that was totally what I was thinking too. So Q5, were you on

27:15.080 --> 27:17.640
camera for these interviews?

27:17.640 --> 27:18.640
Was that you?

27:18.640 --> 27:21.280
I was actually the man behind the camera for all of these.

27:21.280 --> 27:27.360
Okay. Wow, very awesome. Okay, our next group is the Internet System Consortium. And Noah

27:27.360 --> 27:31.280
stopped by and had a quick chat with them. I believe they just celebrated their 20th

27:31.280 --> 27:32.280
birthday too.

27:32.280 --> 27:38.560
So we have Chuck from ISC, the Internet Systems Consortium. How are you doing today, Chuck?

27:38.560 --> 27:39.600
Real good. How are you?

27:39.600 --> 27:44.800
I'm doing excellent. Now, to start out, if you can tell me a little bit about what ISC

27:44.800 --> 27:46.760
is and what it is you guys do.

27:46.760 --> 27:54.200
Well, ISC has been around in the internet for a long time. We just had our 20th birthday

27:54.200 --> 28:02.640
this spring. ISC is the author and publisher of the BIND 9 DNS software that most of the

28:02.640 --> 28:12.320
internet uses now. We also have ISC DHCP product, which again is the standard implementation

28:12.320 --> 28:25.360
of DSC across most of the internet. In addition to the software services, we provide support

28:25.360 --> 28:30.360
for free software. In fact, that's a good deal of what funds the company. And that's

28:30.360 --> 28:40.480
my job. I'm a support engineer. And in addition, we do have a hosting service, which we have

28:40.480 --> 28:49.280
a commercial side and a public benefit side. And we have, we do DNS hosting, SNS secondary

28:49.280 --> 28:55.920
name service, which again is split into a public benefit and a commercial side. We also

28:55.920 --> 29:07.760
maintain the F root name server, which is an Anycast server all across the world. I

29:07.760 --> 29:14.800
don't know exactly how many nodes it has, but F root is everywhere. And we do a lot

29:14.800 --> 29:17.360
of cool stuff to benefit the internet.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.840
Well, awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking time to meet with us. We really appreciate

29:20.840 --> 29:21.840
it.

29:21.840 --> 29:25.720
Thank you. And I also, I didn't get a chance to finish because we put one in the last week's

29:25.720 --> 29:30.400
episode, but another Slackware advocate too, right Q5? It seems like Slackware was big

29:30.400 --> 29:33.840
down there. Is that just the impression I got from these clips?

29:33.840 --> 29:39.680
Oh yeah. Slackware users came out in force and actually talking with Chuck, his whole

29:39.680 --> 29:45.240
family uses Slackware. His wife uses it. His 17 year old son uses it. His 15 year old daughter

29:45.240 --> 29:48.720
uses it. His entire family runs Linux.

29:48.720 --> 29:53.000
That's awesome. And yeah, he made the comment like if Slackware is meant for you, it'll

29:53.000 --> 30:00.000
eventually find you. You don't have to find Slackware. I love it. You know, that's so

30:00.000 --> 30:03.440
cool. And it's good to see like you go to these kinds of events, you get everybody together

30:03.440 --> 30:06.760
and one of the old dog distros is still getting a lot of love.

30:06.760 --> 30:11.240
Before we go to our next group of clips, I want to thank our second sponsor this week

30:11.240 --> 30:16.480
and that is the great folks over at Ting. Go to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off

30:16.480 --> 30:20.160
your first device. Or if you've got a device that's compatible, well then let's give you

30:20.160 --> 30:24.680
a $25 Ting credit. And if you're like me, that might pay for more than your first month

30:24.680 --> 30:30.920
of service. In fact, go to linux.ting.com. Click that how much would you save button

30:30.920 --> 30:34.600
right there and plug in how much you actually use.

30:34.600 --> 30:39.420
So I decided I'm taking like a husband, wife, you know, a spousal or you know, whatever

30:39.420 --> 30:43.360
your situation is, two people, plug in your actual minutes. And I kind of high balled

30:43.360 --> 30:49.040
here. I went 800 minutes, 500 text messages and 2 gigabytes of data. Now this isn't what

30:49.040 --> 30:51.980
you're paying for. It's what you actually use. And I was generous. I said you're going

30:51.980 --> 30:56.520
to get that for $150 a month. That's probably, I mean you're probably going to pay more than

30:56.520 --> 30:58.420
that. But we're going to low ball a little bit here.

30:58.420 --> 31:02.400
When I calculate the savings, I could see that by switching to Ting over a two year

31:02.400 --> 31:10.760
period, I would save $2,064. $2,064 by switching to Ting. Linux.ting.com. That's where you

31:10.760 --> 31:13.560
want to go. And once you become a Ting customer, I'll tell you there's a few things about the

31:13.560 --> 31:17.920
Ting service you're going to absolutely love. First of all, it's a flat $6 per month and

31:17.920 --> 31:21.400
then it's just your usage on top of that. Plus whatever cut the man's going to take.

31:21.400 --> 31:26.140
But really, it's a flat $6 and then your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, Ting adds

31:26.140 --> 31:29.680
them all up at the end of the month. Whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you pay.

31:29.680 --> 31:32.480
The great part is their dashboard makes it crazy easy to see where you're at. You can

31:32.480 --> 31:36.400
track individual devices, set limits, set alerts. Go in there and set up call 40 when you miss

31:36.400 --> 31:40.020
a call. All that kind of stuff that you're always wondering, hey, what's that code I'm

31:40.020 --> 31:43.720
supposed to enter in my phone to activate this feature? Ting exposes all of that through

31:43.720 --> 31:49.360
their dashboard and through their companion apps on Android and iOS. Lots of nice things

31:49.360 --> 31:54.640
about Ting. And I also want to point out that when you're over at Ting, go to Linux.ting.com

31:54.640 --> 31:57.720
to get started. Try out that savings calculator. And then after you've played around for a

31:57.720 --> 32:05.880
little bit, head over to the blog. Ting really, really puts a lot of effort into this blog

32:05.880 --> 32:09.860
and there's a ton of good content, even for non-Ting customers. But what I want to point

32:09.860 --> 32:13.240
your attention to is if you're in a contract and you know you want to switch to Ting but

32:13.240 --> 32:18.280
you're not ready to go whole hog and cancel your contract, I want to remind you that Ting

32:18.280 --> 32:22.120
does have an early termination relief program, ting.com slash ETF. You can find out more

32:22.120 --> 32:27.040
about that. There's also another system they've set up, Ting Reminders. Ting will just send

32:27.040 --> 32:31.160
you a nice little gentle nudge when your contract expires and says, hey, bro, why don't you

32:31.160 --> 32:34.980
move over to Ting now? We'll get you taken care of. They've also got a new swap program

32:34.980 --> 32:39.640
to help you swap up to a Galaxy device and move over to Ting. Linux.ting.com. Check them

32:39.640 --> 32:45.560
out. No hold customer service. Voicemail, caller ID, tethering, hotspot, three-way calling,

32:45.560 --> 32:48.880
call forwarding, all other features you'd expect, all part of your service, no hidden

32:48.880 --> 32:55.640
charges, no BS. It's really quite awesome. Linux.ting.com. And a really big thanks to

32:55.640 --> 33:00.440
Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. I've been using them for well over a year now.

33:00.440 --> 33:06.120
And it totes rocks. I got my recently-bricked Ubuntu Touch Nexus 5 on the Ting network.

33:06.120 --> 33:10.820
And until I tried to do today's update, I was quite enjoying using it on the Ting network.

33:10.820 --> 33:21.600
But now, I'll just use Android. Okay. Now, we're going to move over to the BSD folks.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.600
If you haven't gone to one of these fests, you got to understand how these BSD guys work.

33:25.600 --> 33:33.700
They are sneaky. They get in there, they talk nice to people, they play nice, they listen

33:33.700 --> 33:38.360
to the Linux users and they politely nod their head. And they say, here, Linux user, take

33:38.360 --> 33:43.800
these horns, put these horns on, and then walk around with these flashing. It is subversive,

33:43.800 --> 33:49.680
it's devious, and it works every time. And Noah had a chance to stop by and chat with

33:49.680 --> 33:55.360
Chris, Chris's brother, Chris Moore, who you probably know from BSD now. Well, he got a

33:55.360 --> 33:58.360
chance to talk with Ken Moore about PCBSD.

33:58.360 --> 34:03.280
We're here with Ken Moore from the PCBSD project. How are you doing today, Ken?

34:03.280 --> 34:05.720
I'm doing very well, thank you.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.200
Thanks a lot for taking the time to talk to us. Now, I know that every time I see Alan

34:09.200 --> 34:17.200
June, he makes it a point to tell me. We gave Alan a ride back from LinuxFest Northwest

34:17.200 --> 34:21.440
back to his hotel. And the entire way back, the conversation was dominated with the idea

34:21.440 --> 34:24.640
that everyone in the world should switch to BSD.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.520
Oh, of course.

34:26.520 --> 34:33.600
So tell me a little bit about what your connection to the BSD project is and what it is that

34:33.600 --> 34:34.600
you do.

34:34.600 --> 34:40.000
I am one of the developers on the PCBSD project. I generally focus on designing the graphical

34:40.000 --> 34:44.720
utilities to make system management, system administration, installing and running applications,

34:44.720 --> 34:49.560
doing all of that to make it simple for the user to basically use any system, any free

34:49.560 --> 34:51.080
BSD system.

34:51.080 --> 34:58.040
Now, PCBSD is primarily geared towards people that want to install it and run it on like

34:58.040 --> 35:00.760
a laptop or a desktop. Is that correct?

35:00.760 --> 35:05.800
Yes, PCBSD is more desktop focused. So any of the different desktop environments, we

35:05.800 --> 35:11.160
have them all available. And we just try to provide PCBSD utilities on the side for managing

35:11.160 --> 35:15.400
the free BSD specific functions in the background like wireless and stuff because they are very

35:15.400 --> 35:17.640
different from the way Linux is run.

35:17.640 --> 35:24.720
So since the project is very different from the majority of Linux distributions, what

35:24.720 --> 35:30.020
would be a reason that I would want to switch to PCBSD or maybe just give it a try and see

35:30.020 --> 35:31.160
what I think of it?

35:31.160 --> 35:35.320
Well, a couple of the things that come to me off the top of my head is the stability

35:35.320 --> 35:39.760
of free BSD since the operating system is completely separate from all the third party

35:39.760 --> 35:44.280
packages. You can add and remove things like desktop environments and utilities and really

35:44.280 --> 35:48.320
configure your entire system however you want without having to worry about breaking your

35:48.320 --> 35:49.320
system.

35:49.320 --> 35:55.640
Another one is ZFS. We have ZFS natively on free BSD and it is fabulous. That is actually

35:55.640 --> 36:02.200
the required file system for PCBSD. Whenever you install a PCBSD system, you are installing

36:02.200 --> 36:04.120
onto ZFS.

36:04.120 --> 36:09.140
And then with that, we have a number of ZFS functions that we use and tie in to create

36:09.140 --> 36:13.120
boot environments. So whenever you are going to perform an upgrade of your system, it will

36:13.120 --> 36:16.360
automatically create a boot environment in the background. And if you don't like the

36:16.360 --> 36:20.400
upgrade, if something got changed like it went to a new version of an application that

36:20.400 --> 36:23.800
doesn't work right, all you have to do is restart your system and say, oh, I want to

36:23.800 --> 36:27.520
go back to this older boot environment and you are back to your system in less than a

36:27.520 --> 36:28.520
minute.

36:28.520 --> 36:32.680
Okay, well thanks. If somebody was interested in getting involved in the PCBSD project or

36:32.680 --> 36:35.600
learning more about PCBSD, where could that person go?

36:35.600 --> 36:41.840
You can go to PCBSD.org or we also have forums and a wiki and a blog, all of them just with

36:41.840 --> 36:49.440
the prefix. So wiki.pcbsd.org, forums.pcbsd.org, blog.pcbsd.org. Any of those sites will get

36:49.440 --> 36:51.200
you going and connect you to the project.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.880
Outstanding. Well, thanks a lot for taking time to meet with us. We really appreciate

36:53.880 --> 36:54.880
it.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.560
Thank you very much. I thought that was a great chat. And unfortunately, maybe we'll

36:57.560 --> 37:00.900
get a chance to talk to Ken about this more. Then you can get a chance to talk about that

37:00.900 --> 37:08.640
new desktop environment that PCBSD is working on. But they make good case for running PCBSD.

37:08.640 --> 37:14.440
I'm digging that update snapshot system, Matt, where it's just sort of like, hey, you updated?

37:14.440 --> 37:18.640
Well, let me just create a little backup environment you could boot into. That's pretty nice. I

37:18.640 --> 37:19.640
kind of want that.

37:19.640 --> 37:23.040
I love that idea. I want that on everything I run.

37:23.040 --> 37:28.600
I wonder if once ButterFS is a little more widely adopted, a little more mature, if you

37:28.600 --> 37:35.400
might see distros integrating that. This is the nice thing that PCBSD has going for them

37:35.400 --> 37:41.240
is they really just focus on BSD and can focus on just what BSD supports so they can unilaterally

37:41.240 --> 37:42.240
do something like that.

37:42.240 --> 37:47.440
Now, we've got one more BSD clip to get to. And I'm really glad that Noah got a chance

37:47.440 --> 37:52.960
to chat with Drew. She's sort of world famous for her involvement with the FreeBSD Project

37:52.960 --> 37:58.520
and other things. I believe she's also been a guest on the BSD Now podcast. So I was really

37:58.520 --> 38:02.120
glad they got a chance to chat with her. So here, we'll play that clip now.

38:02.120 --> 38:06.060
As if one interview with the people from the BSD Project wasn't enough, we actually have

38:06.060 --> 38:10.840
two people here that we can talk to. And the second is Drew. Now, Drew, we were specifically

38:10.840 --> 38:15.180
asked to go seek out and talk to her. We were told that she has phenomenally interesting

38:15.180 --> 38:21.880
things to say by Alan. How's that for a set up? And so we're here with Drew today. How

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
are you doing today, Drew?

38:22.880 --> 38:25.160
I'm doing fine. Thank you.

38:25.160 --> 38:33.520
Tell me a little bit about what it is that you do with the BSD Project and how your role

38:33.520 --> 38:39.120
differs a little bit from the guys at the PCBSD Project.

38:39.120 --> 38:46.000
Yeah, so I'm involved in a lot of little pots. So my main focus is on documentation and my

38:46.000 --> 38:53.280
background is in system administration. So I write the documentation for both the PCBSD

38:53.280 --> 39:00.240
and the FreeNAS Projects. And what we do is we aim to have a comprehensive user guide

39:00.240 --> 39:05.240
for every release of the operating system. So it sort of keeps me busy. I'm also involved

39:05.240 --> 39:10.400
with the FreeBSD Project. So I'm one of the directors at the FreeBSD Foundation. And I

39:10.400 --> 39:17.120
also, as I can, I try to assist in the FreeBSD Handbook. Because FreeBSD has always been

39:17.120 --> 39:24.040
known for having very comprehensive documentation. So I try to assist with that as well. From

39:24.040 --> 39:30.840
my system administration background, I also care about, in addition to documentation,

39:30.840 --> 39:40.720
and ways to get future system administrators to have a good solid base and open source.

39:40.720 --> 39:47.940
So one of the things that we founded ten years ago is the BSD Certification Group. So we

39:47.940 --> 39:55.960
concentrate on making sure that system administrators know what skills employers are looking for

39:55.960 --> 40:01.780
when it comes to system administration. And we focus on the BSD operating systems.

40:01.780 --> 40:08.880
Now I asked the gentleman from the PCBSD Project what he thought the compelling argument was

40:08.880 --> 40:16.440
to give PCBSD a try. Can you give me what comes to mind as a compelling argument to

40:16.440 --> 40:19.200
give BSD a try on the backend, on the server?

40:19.200 --> 40:26.000
Yeah, so if we look at it from the FreeBSD point of view, which is basically the base

40:26.000 --> 40:32.920
for the projects, PCBSD for Freenas, for PF Sense, I would agree with Ken's assessment

40:32.920 --> 40:38.800
that ZFS is definitely a big one. We've had ZFS for some time. It's very mature. It's

40:38.800 --> 40:46.720
very stable. And both the PCBSD and the Freenas projects are building on top of that ZFS base

40:46.720 --> 40:53.800
to make utilities, to make it easier to take advantage of the features built into ZFS.

40:53.800 --> 40:59.840
Some of the up and coming stuff that's coming out of FreeBSD from a programming point of

40:59.840 --> 41:08.760
view, Capsicum is a really big deal. So Capsicum is a set of APIs that make it possible to

41:08.760 --> 41:19.120
take existing applications that were originally not designed to be secure, and you can hook,

41:19.120 --> 41:25.480
redevelop those applications with a very small footprint to actually secure them. So Capsicum

41:25.480 --> 41:32.440
actually came out of a project, FreeBSD was a reference based system, it's the University

41:32.440 --> 41:37.700
of Cambridge and Google, and they took the Chromium web browser, and nobody could accuse

41:37.700 --> 41:44.240
a web browser of being securely designed from the beginning, and they were able to prove

41:44.240 --> 41:49.440
that they could secure that application in less than 100 lines of code.

41:49.440 --> 41:55.680
Wow, that is impressive, especially in a web browser. If somebody was interested in finding

41:55.680 --> 42:00.320
more about the server side of BSD, or getting in contact, maybe even contributing to the

42:00.320 --> 42:02.720
project, how would somebody get in contact or do that?

42:02.720 --> 42:08.920
So FreeBSD has been around a very long time, it's a very large project, there are several

42:08.920 --> 42:15.160
hundred committers, dozens of people that work on documentation, hundreds of thousands

42:15.160 --> 42:22.400
of end users, so huge project. Because of that, and because it is an operating system,

42:22.400 --> 42:27.960
it really depends on which parts you're interested in. So for example, we have several dozen

42:27.960 --> 42:34.880
mailing lists. So somebody, if they're coming in on the development side, and they're interested

42:34.880 --> 42:39.240
say in writing network device drivers, there would be mailing lists that would hook you

42:39.240 --> 42:44.880
into the right people to discuss that sort of thing. If you're interested in file systems,

42:44.880 --> 42:49.920
or if you're a system administrator, you're interested in administration. So I would recommend

42:49.920 --> 42:54.560
go to the FreeBSD website, check out the mailing lists, because one of the things you want

42:54.560 --> 42:59.720
to do is you want to become familiar with who's who in the community, and you also want

42:59.720 --> 43:04.840
the community to become familiar with you, what it is that you can bring to the table.

43:04.840 --> 43:12.400
And FreeBSD has always been known as being a helpful community, but you know, you have

43:12.400 --> 43:19.920
to really engage with the community. So we have the mailing lists, we have IRC channels,

43:19.920 --> 43:25.640
so we really recommend don't be shy, come in, you know, and engage with the community.

43:25.640 --> 43:29.600
Well, thank you so much for taking time to talk with us. We really appreciate it.

43:29.600 --> 43:34.800
I notice she's not wearing horns. Now, okay, Q5, be honest, did their insidious niceness

43:34.800 --> 43:39.600
get to you a little bit? Because now not only are they going to these Linux conventions,

43:39.600 --> 43:43.680
but they're enlisting the help of Canadians who are famously nice. Are you feeling the

43:43.680 --> 43:45.800
pressure to run a little BSD now?

43:45.800 --> 43:51.160
Oh, yeah, they're definitely nice. And actually, let me pause you right here, because Alan

43:51.160 --> 43:55.320
has been quietly listening to me talk in our community about my preferences with desktop

43:55.320 --> 43:58.960
environments and how I like to manage my system and how I like to run it. So he casually one

43:58.960 --> 44:03.600
day is like, Oh, you should ask Ken about the one he's designing. Okay, sure, no big

44:03.600 --> 44:07.960
deal. I'll talk to him about it. So I talked to Ken about it. And I'm like, Okay, you know,

44:07.960 --> 44:11.720
give me kind of rundown. He's like, Well, better yet, let me just show it to you. I'm

44:11.720 --> 44:18.400
not going to say much. Let me say that Lumina is unbelievable. Now, now keep in mind, you

44:18.400 --> 44:22.960
know, I'm puppy Linux dev. But after checking out Lumina and where it is in its current

44:22.960 --> 44:27.240
alpha state, it's actually tempting me to install PCB SD on one of my laptop, but it

44:27.240 --> 44:32.280
seems so crazy to have another desktop. It really was now was it sort of like, can you

44:32.280 --> 44:36.680
give me his sounds like it maybe is a little bit like a tiling window manager a bit? No,

44:36.680 --> 44:42.000
it's not. It's a you know, it's a regular. It's not a tiling window manager. But it's

44:42.000 --> 44:48.280
all the little things that make workflow so much quicker. The seamless nature of how he's

44:48.280 --> 44:54.880
worked in life preserver with ZFS is just unbelievable. Yeah, that is pretty sweet.

44:54.880 --> 45:00.880
Yeah. Yeah, Ken's got some Ken's got some skills, huh? Yeah, I'll be I'll be curious

45:00.880 --> 45:04.400
to follow the way that goes. So it's called Lumina. We've talked a little bit about it

45:04.400 --> 45:10.640
before. There's not a lot of details yet. L-U-M-I-N-A. And he did say that it has there's

45:10.640 --> 45:15.480
some distribution. It might be arch that has actually already ported it over and has it

45:15.480 --> 45:19.760
as an option. But I don't know exactly what distro that is. Very nice. Somebody runs Linux

45:19.760 --> 45:24.160
and they want to test it out. I mean, obviously, they won't get any of the ZFS features, but

45:24.160 --> 45:27.560
they can at least poke around and see what it's what's how it works and what I can't

45:27.560 --> 45:32.940
wait to try it. Hey, I could look PCB SD. Hey, hey. I mean, if it comes with a pair

45:32.940 --> 45:38.100
of horns, well, very good. So worth a trip, you think? Is it is it something you'd recommend

45:38.100 --> 45:44.840
folks go to next year? Absolutely. You know, thinking back, you know, kind of comparing

45:44.840 --> 45:49.500
it to Linux Northwest, because we had a bunch of our community members there. I've never

45:49.500 --> 45:53.280
been to either conference before. This was my first year at Northwest. This is my first

45:53.280 --> 45:57.920
year at Southeast. And I know this may sound kind of cliche, but I really do mean this

45:57.920 --> 46:03.640
self felt like more of an extended family. Even though I knew none of these people before

46:03.640 --> 46:07.920
after that one day on Friday, I felt like I was one of them. That Southern charm is

46:07.920 --> 46:11.160
what you're saying? Exactly. You know, I had a great time at Linux Northwest. And if you

46:11.160 --> 46:15.520
take all the goodness that was in that conference and you add in, you know, that legendary Southern

46:15.520 --> 46:19.580
hospitality, yeah, you just you have a recipe for an amazing event. What about being at

46:19.580 --> 46:24.400
a hotel? Did that give it a weird feeling at all? Or was that work really well? Actually,

46:24.400 --> 46:27.920
it worked really well. The layout and the way that they had the floor track and the

46:27.920 --> 46:32.620
individual, you know, speaking rooms, everything was right there and easily accessible. So

46:32.620 --> 46:36.320
you could easily go from, you know, when you're going around talking to different vendors,

46:36.320 --> 46:39.720
seeing what they have to offer to, oh, there's a there's a talk in that room right there

46:39.720 --> 46:43.640
that I want to go to. Yeah, it wasn't like I need to go walk off and go up a hall and

46:43.640 --> 46:49.260
up a staircase and find what room everything was there. Everything was easy to get to.

46:49.260 --> 46:54.300
It was just it was a great event. Very cool. Well, maybe maybe we'll have to do a live

46:54.300 --> 46:58.800
stream from there next year. You never know what's possible. It's interesting to see these

46:58.800 --> 47:02.500
events because, you know, they don't get a lot of coverage. There's not a lot of people

47:02.500 --> 47:08.640
talking about them yet. They're a major event that happens in the community. And I think

47:08.640 --> 47:14.160
they're you'd almost expect them to be, I don't know, dwindling, maybe becoming less

47:14.160 --> 47:18.760
relevant with things like hangouts that are available and mumble and and everything else.

47:18.760 --> 47:23.080
But in some ways, there seems to be more of them than ever. And they seem to be larger

47:23.080 --> 47:28.680
than ever. I don't know. I think maybe people somehow have managed to realize that there

47:28.680 --> 47:32.960
is actually some value in meeting in meet space somehow. I expected we would all just

47:32.960 --> 47:38.040
like be staring into the monitors for the rest of for the rest of humanity. But we still

47:38.040 --> 47:42.000
manage to get together from time to time. So if you go to a fest that we can't attend

47:42.000 --> 47:45.440
to, we'd love to hear your report. And one of the ways you could share your experience

47:45.440 --> 47:49.200
is by going to LinuxActionShow.reddit.com. Start a thread there. Why not start a thread

47:49.200 --> 47:53.040
about doing a meet up? That's what Q5 did. And you can also send us an email. Go to Jupiter

47:53.040 --> 47:58.320
Broadcasting dot com. Click the contact link and choose, well, send it to Linux Unplugged.

47:58.320 --> 48:02.520
Choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown. Or Linux Action Show, depending on the timing.

48:02.520 --> 48:07.200
I'll leave that to your savviness. That's up to you. If you're an email ninja and think

48:07.200 --> 48:11.120
you can time it just right, you could also choose Linux Action Show.

48:11.120 --> 48:14.560
All right, guys. Well, anybody have anything to contribute before we run? I think that

48:14.560 --> 48:19.440
was a pretty good coverage. I know Riley was thinking they were too nice. There's some

48:19.440 --> 48:24.520
little off about that. Riley, are you OK? No, I'm not OK with it. There's something

48:24.520 --> 48:29.040
off about it, too. I just see them in a dark room going it with their hands up.

48:29.040 --> 48:32.080
Those lights flashing, those horns flashing in a dark room.

48:32.080 --> 48:36.160
What you're saying is you don't trust people who are nice.

48:36.160 --> 48:43.280
No, you know what? In some ways, they are there solving a same problem, and they just

48:43.280 --> 48:47.760
think they have a better way to do it. And I think it's a bit of confidence, in a way.

48:47.760 --> 48:52.240
I think it demonstrates the fact that they can show up. It's not a hostile thing. They

48:52.240 --> 48:56.800
can share the room. It's something that's taken Microsoft a decade to figure out.

48:56.800 --> 49:01.440
We just now saw Microsoft really start to get it at Linux Fest Northwest. But the BSD

49:01.440 --> 49:07.800
guys, they're cut from the same cloth. Just maybe one that has more stitching. I don't

49:07.800 --> 49:08.800
know.

49:08.800 --> 49:12.760
All right. Well, we'll leave it at that. I also had a link that I wanted to chat about,

49:12.760 --> 49:15.880
but I think we'll save it for the big show. But if you guys want to do a little additional

49:15.880 --> 49:20.160
reading, I'll leave it to you. You can find it in the show notes. Go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com.

49:20.160 --> 49:23.000
Look for Linux Unplugged, episode 46.

49:23.000 --> 49:28.400
And also, we're putting a call out to have folks help fund our Patreon page that goes

49:28.400 --> 49:33.080
in to contribute to investments in the network. Patreon.com slash today. We're trying to do

49:33.080 --> 49:36.440
some crowdfunding to bring revenue up for the network, so that way we can do things

49:36.440 --> 49:42.040
like hire contractors to resolve problems that we have, or buy some on-location equipment

49:42.040 --> 49:46.200
to do some more on-location streaming like these types of events. And all of that is

49:46.200 --> 49:49.800
dependent on increasing our financing. And really, there's two ways that a network like

49:49.800 --> 49:54.280
ours can increase financing. We can add additional ads, and that's certainly something we could

49:54.280 --> 49:59.200
consider doing. And we can also go to crowdfunding. And I believe the real answer lies somewhere

49:59.200 --> 50:02.920
there in between. I think it's more about a balance and finding a mix and diversifying

50:02.920 --> 50:06.360
income sources for the networks. That way, we're here for the long haul. And that's what

50:06.360 --> 50:10.480
we're trying to do. So if you go over to Patreon.com slash today, you can find out more information.

50:10.480 --> 50:14.520
You can pledge whatever you can afford. That money is distributed to all of the shows,

50:14.520 --> 50:18.960
all of the profits generated there go into the network, and it's celebrated via our Tech

50:18.960 --> 50:22.920
Talk Today podcast. As we reach different milestones, we have a little party in the

50:22.920 --> 50:26.040
show. Like the barbecue challenge is kind of like a fun way to just celebrate in the

50:26.040 --> 50:30.400
show. But it also means, oh, the network has achieved another level of funding, which means

50:30.400 --> 50:37.020
we can accomplish XYZ. My big, big a-boo right now is, as the network has grown, we've greatly

50:37.020 --> 50:40.140
increased the complexity of our technical infrastructure to the point now where there's

50:40.140 --> 50:44.640
enough equipment that it really could take at least a part-time person coming in a couple

50:44.640 --> 50:49.320
of times a week, keeping it all running. And that's why I'm constantly struggling these

50:49.320 --> 50:52.960
days with hardware failures, because it's just, when you have this much equipment running

50:52.960 --> 51:00.340
24-7, things happen. And you need somebody who has really solid IT experience in networking

51:00.340 --> 51:05.140
and storage and network-attached storage and really high-performance networking. But you

51:05.140 --> 51:09.640
also need someone who has broadcast equipment experience, that understands about encoding,

51:09.640 --> 51:13.560
about the specialized needs that a certain rig might have. And that's sort of a nexus

51:13.560 --> 51:18.680
of talent that's extremely difficult to find and not free. But it's an example of something

51:18.680 --> 51:23.480
that we have to be able to do in order to keep moving the network forward, because it

51:23.480 --> 51:28.240
just is getting to that point. And the way we can do that is by knowing we have a good,

51:28.240 --> 51:32.160
stable platform of funding by our audience. The folks who consume our shows can be the

51:32.160 --> 51:37.240
folks who fund our shows. So go to patreon.com slash today. We greatly, greatly appreciate

51:37.240 --> 51:41.980
your support. And check out Tech Talk today. In fact, join me live tomorrow. If you're

51:41.980 --> 51:46.160
listening to this on Tuesday night, we'll be covering the Google I.O. keynote live in

51:46.160 --> 51:52.040
Tech Talk today at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern. When that launches, you can join us in the

51:52.040 --> 51:56.560
Mumble Room, our virtual lug, and comment away on the Google keynote as it happens,

51:56.560 --> 52:00.120
and we'll release that as a download so you guys can go catch all of the goodies that

52:00.120 --> 52:06.520
came out of Google I.O. So that'll be tomorrow's Tech Talk today, episode 15, I believe, which

52:06.520 --> 52:12.080
will be on June 25th as we are recording this episode. That right there, though, will wrap

52:12.080 --> 52:17.840
us up. So go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com, help contribute and comment, and give us your

52:17.840 --> 52:20.960
thoughts, your feedback for this week's episode. We'd love to hear it. Don't forget to send

52:20.960 --> 52:26.400
us an email and all those kinds of goodies. We really appreciate it. Okay, Matt, well,

52:26.400 --> 52:30.420
guess what? We're all done. We can get out of here. We wrapped up our Southeast Linux

52:30.420 --> 52:35.160
Fest coverage, and I think we're going to do some how-to stuff on Sunday. I'm going

52:35.160 --> 52:38.200
to double check the calendar, but I think we're going to have a great episode on Sunday's

52:38.200 --> 52:42.480
Linux Action Show, so I'll see you then, okay? All right, I'll see you then. Sounds good.

52:42.480 --> 52:45.960
All right. Thank you, everybody, for tuning in to this week's episode of the Linux Unplugged

52:45.960 --> 52:49.280
Show. We'll see you back on Sunday for Linux Action Show, and if you can't make it for

52:49.280 --> 52:52.920
some reason, I won't judge, but I'd love to see you back here on Tuesday for the next episode

52:52.920 --> 53:21.480
of Linux Unplugged. All right, everyone, see you right back here next week.
