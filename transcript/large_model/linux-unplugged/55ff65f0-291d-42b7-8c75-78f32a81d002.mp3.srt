1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
What I want to start with is this article opensource.com that's talking about smart

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,640
GIMP tricks. I'm wondering if anyone in the mumble room or otherwise does a lot with GIMP.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,040
I know rottencorpse you do a lot of graphic design but I'm not sure if you use GIMP or not.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,760
Maybe rottencorpse isn't here. Anyone use GIMP? I use it to crop pictures

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,840
and I actually there's a there's a processing service that we print all of our promotional

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
material from Ultispeed so we have you know our cards and we have flyers and table tents

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,280
and stuff like that and a lot of that stuff gets sent out over GIMP but because Inkscape will

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,320
export to to a PNG and then they want silly little compressed formats that you know that

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,720
are far so I use it to essentially to reprocess image files and occasionally I'll crop a picture

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,640
or you know or change something like that but anyone use GIMP extensively?

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,960
I don't use it extensively but I do see a great use for it as that kind of go-to utility you know

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
pretty much any Linux install that you have you have GIMP you know that you can use it for those

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,720
base needs yeah also sometimes it does the job very well I've used it a lot to render pdfs

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,960
before sending it to a printer kind of sure kind of like what you do yeah yeah yeah for you know

15
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,360
and I did see actually it was it was interesting of all places I was watching True TV unless you

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,760
watch True TV do you ever watch like forensic files and the new detectives and stuff like that?

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,000
I have not but it sounds interesting. I tell you what it's a double-edged sword because on one hand

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,840
I start to think I can get away with anything because I'm like oh you moron how did you not

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,040
know about DNA and then on the other hand I realized that that's from like 10 years ago

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,000
and so you know 10 years ago that whatever the technology is that we have today to catch people

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,960
probably won't become very prevalent for another 10 years and so you know I'm judging people based

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,120
on their information 10 years ago but I was watching the other night and GIMP actually

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,480
made an appearance and they were talking about how they were changing the contrast of this photo to

24
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,160
bring out certain elements in it and you know the little announcer guy he's got this you know deep

25
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:23,040
voice and he's like so the photo analysts use the GNU image manipulation program which is a

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,840
professional program released for free and has that has amazing power and part of me was like

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,280
okay so I actually don't know a lot of you know super photo professionals or image professionals

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,800
that use GIMP on the other hand I'm really happy that there's a public perception at least in that

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,000
particular TV show that it's this very high-powered tool and is available for free. Right those shows

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
get so much wrong it's nice that at least they're getting it wrong in our direction for once. Well

31
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,760
yeah it was kind of cool but so anyway so I saw the GIMP and then you posted this story and I'm

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,400
like maybe I'm a little out of touch maybe there are a ton of people that are using GIMP nowadays

33
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,160
and in the chat room you know I should point out in the chat room there's a ton of people that are

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,080
using GIMP obviously Odyssey Westrup he actually and Odyssey you should you should maybe join us

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,160
if you have the ability to jump and mumble but Westrup he's a graphics designer so he uses

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,720
does a lot of graphics design and he does all of it in open source and we've actually had him do a

37
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
couple of stuff from us for us as a company AltaSpeed that is and I've had him do some

38
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:31,360
personal stuff for me and I know that he uses all open source software GIMP and Inkscape and

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,640
Corita and and and that that's actually how he does the majority of his workflow.

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,800
So but anyone use any other open source graphics utilities anyone ever used Inkscape?

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:54,640
I used Inkscape. What do you use it for? I used to use it not so much anymore but when I ran my

42
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,480
business somebody needed something done like a brochure or something like that it was great for

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,480
doing page layouts. Okay. I actually preferred it over Scribus. No kidding.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,680
One of the Ubuntu phone community developers created a toolkit in Inkscape for doing user

45
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,880
interface design mock-ups so it's got all of the all of the kind of elements that you would need

46
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,120
to create you know an application whatever application you like as little elements in

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,720
a giant Inkscape document and you just drag the bits around duplicate them move around line them

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,600
all up and then you know design your application that way it's really really cool. I tell you what

49
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,760
one of the things that I have come to love about Inkscape itself is because it's a vector graph

50
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,800
program you know I can I can start out with a you know 500 by 500 800 by 800 or whatever it is

51
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,360
a canvas and and design a graphic you know you know asset and then I can take that graphic asset

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,280
and I can say all right well I need to blow that up to the size of a banner or a poster or we're

53
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,800
going to wrap a car or a via service vehicle and how are we going to do that well we can take that

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,200
that vector graphic and it scales you know essentially and definitely and you can combine

55
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,680
one graphic art from the other so I'll give you an example we actually are launching

56
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,240
a cloud-based wi-fi for the hospitality industry so essentially they pay us pay us a monthly fee

57
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,400
and we bring in a bunch of equipment and set it up and we manage all of that remotely and one of

58
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,840
the things is that there is a tent that goes inside of the room and that tent has connection

59
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:46,960
details and contact information if if they have so if they have trouble with their wi-fi they

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,520
can call a 1-800 number and somebody will walk them through how to restart their computer and

61
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,920
turn on the lights all the stuff that I wouldn't want to do right and then if it exceeds that level

62
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:07,040
then it gets elevated to us and so we we got a a free for use essentially a wi-fi vector graphic

63
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,720
and we were able to bring that into Inkscape and take our existing car that we already had

64
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
designed and put in then we had this wi-fi logo and because it's it's a vector graphic

65
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,520
all of the transparency carried over all of the you know I could change the color to match the

66
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,080
color scheme that we had it's just incredible and and the fact that I can do all that with open

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,880
source software is incredible to me you know and it it it changes the way that you can approach

68
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,480
a project because I can essentially use the internet and people on the internet that are

69
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,280
doing creative things and combine those all for for a single purpose and it's awesome it is I've

70
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,840
used it a little bit of work myself mostly for I'll have a automated tool that will output a

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,920
graph maybe of like data structure relations and how they're you know foreign key kind of stuff

72
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,480
and Inkscape will just import the pdf and you can modify it before shipping it out or putting it on

73
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,960
the wiki for documentation that's awesome yeah and and you know we actually we I think the I

74
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,400
can't remember the program that we used for our original logo design the one that everyone

75
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:12,000
comments on but but we took but after that we took that imported it and and Inkscape actually

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,480
has the ability to look at a graphic asset and trace it out and then fill it with a blank color

77
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,440
and so we essentially stripped all of the you know fancy filters and stuff off of it and turn it back

78
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,080
into you know a vector and then we were able to recolor it and build it back up from there so that

79
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,680
was that was pretty neat yeah it was pretty cool open source yeah it was awesome this is linux

80
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:55,280
unplugged episode 128 for january 19th 2016 welcome to linux unplugged your weekly talk

81
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,600
show that's brought to you this week from the sprawling metropolis of the frozen tundra

82
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,040
my name is noah my name is wes hey wes how are you i'm doing great how about yourself well

83
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,920
once again the the uh the lovely world of the internet has connected us your ip packets isn't

84
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,240
it wonderful it is and we and we get to chat and talk about linux which is coincidentally my

85
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:24,640
favorite thing to talk about so i want to start out by talking about why it is uh wes and i are

86
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,720
pretending to be chris this week and that's because chris is on his way to scale he is in

87
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,440
jb rover 2 which if you haven't seen head over to twitter.com and check out at chris las it is it

88
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,880
is crazy cool he got a like an amazing rv wes have you seen pictures of this thing yeah it is a beast

89
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:53,120
it's incredible it is incredible it it is like a luxury home on wheels and i like anyone who sees

90
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,640
it is going to be jealous they're gonna i would live in a camper if that's what my camper looked

91
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,040
like that's how cool it is but like a roving jb party bus exactly oh that's good oh that's really

92
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,320
good that's a better name than that's a better name than rover 2 the rover party bus not to

93
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,360
pitch that to him anyway he's on the road as we speak making his way down to scale if you're not

94
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,520
familiar with what scale is it's a southern california linux expo and chris is going to

95
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,520
be attending this year and hanging out uh and and covering some of the community aspects and

96
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:31,600
this that and the other and uh because of the way that uh the time it's going to take him to travel

97
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,880
he's not available on tuesday and so he has let wes and i sit in the big chair and do the show

98
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,840
this week so we are going to talk this week starting uh with a reddit thread a follow-up

99
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:58,320
from the linux action show and basically um reg regia regia i don't exactly know how to pronounce

100
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,240
that um posted in the linux action uh in the linux action show subreddit which is of course

101
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,600
reddit.com slash r slash linux action show and he says no it hit on something about unity and he

102
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,200
says i wish i i think he's quoting me it says i wish abuntu would just use gnome and go back to

103
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:25,840
trying to contribute useful bits and then he um links to an imager image of uh of uh apparently

104
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,960
a star trek episode um now i have a few extensions oh he's showing his desktop now i have a few

105
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,760
extensions installed but the way i use gnome it isn't much different than how somebody else would

106
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,120
use unity i keep the dash on it all sides i have those pesky tray apps in the corner and so on

107
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,520
this is close to how i work with unity and osx etc i'm puzzled to why gnome gets treated like

108
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:53,920
the redheaded stepchild sometimes now uh now i know that once in a while gnome the gnome dev team

109
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,560
decides to head off the deep and make the file manager work like an old school finder by default

110
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,040
but hey let's override users pre-existing settings that's that's not very good is it

111
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,120
but overall gnome just keeps getting better and better now west you're the one that actually

112
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,880
brought this to my attention what was your immediate thought when you read this and and

113
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,800
was and you know if you when you watched the show and and thought about how all that ties together

114
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,280
well you know i i too am a gnome user uh i definitely prefer it but i can understand

115
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,640
why canonical wants to be developing their own desktop environment you know with their

116
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,440
plans for convergence with uh the big move to unity 8 i think a lot will depend on what that

117
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
looks like when it's shipped and when everyone's using it uh but at the end of the day i think

118
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,320
people do you know like yourself like many desktop users a lot of people i know at work who sit next

119
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,040
to me are using unity and it seems to work for them and i also think the that while that gnome

120
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,320
is different uh there does seem to be a significant portion of people who use gnome not dissimilar to

121
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,040
unity you know with the with the doc on the side kind of you know you hit your super key and you're

122
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:01,520
finding applications it's it's not that different so i guess my you know i'm one of the few people

123
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,520
that actually and i i responded this in the reddit too i'm one of the few people that actually like

124
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,480
unity um i actually have unity on the laptop i'm using right now and i have it on the desktop

125
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,840
that i'm using to send the stream to chris that becomes particularly evident when um

126
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,480
you have multi monitors that exceed three if you have more than three monitors

127
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,800
i just think that unity it comes off more polished than gnome does oftentimes and chris

128
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,600
would would vehemently disagree with this he he would tell you that he would point out a thousand

129
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,920
different things that that that um that point to why gnome is a more polished desktop environment

130
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,720
but i see things like you know the multi-monitor support the fact that i can choose

131
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,880
a display and only that display has my you know launcher bar and activity stay and i can put that

132
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,000
on any of the displays doesn't necessarily have to be the quote unquote primary um i can set up

133
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,960
how i want i can set up because oftentimes the quote unquote primary monitor is the one that's

134
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,120
right in the center of me and i have two auxiliary monitors off to the left and right and then three

135
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,960
auxiliary monitors up on top and that's not a that's not a usual use case but it's my use case

136
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,920
and in in that instance i i think that unity just shines a little bit and the other thing is too is

137
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,800
i feel like there are a lot of things that just feel that make unity feel more cohesive than gnome

138
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,560
and i'll give you an example so on guake for example i get weird i'm not sure it could be a

139
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,720
bug but i get a weird thing where when i bring down guake it doesn't it the transparency doesn't

140
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:48,000
necessarily go over the um this the the menu at the side do you use guake wes you know i have in

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,560
the past but uh i usually just have a terminal open kind of in the corner somewhere anyway so

142
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,080
i use it currently yeah so i so i i like to have whatever i'm doing and this is the one thing i

143
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,720
think that gnome got right is have everything in full screen and take up the whole screen

144
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,520
and the exception to that is the terminal because oftentimes the terminal is my connection to

145
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,400
another machine exactly and then my screen is whatever i'm doing to that machine and so i bring

146
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,760
the terminal down i do some work i put it back up i you know reorganize figure out what i'm going to

147
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:24,240
do next bring the terminal back down and i feel like um i i just i think that gnome uh it does not

148
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,520
feel as native to me when i install an app and have you know that like that that menu that guake

149
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,760
for example come down it just doesn't feel as native to me as it does in in something like

150
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,520
unity and i i see other little things that just feel like pieces that have been put together and

151
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,920
on one hand i really appreciate that because that is essentially the heart of linux right

152
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,960
everyone does something very very well and we bring all those pieces together

153
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,800
and it makes for a cohesive experience um and for whatever reason i just there are there are

154
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,680
there are a number of little things that just make me think that gnome is missing and so i'm

155
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,600
actually one of the people that like unity that said there are there are some there are some key

156
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,200
issues that irritate the heck out of me so i had a client that actually was using a bantu gnome

157
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,800
because that's the first thing everyone's going to say is i don't know why everyone's i don't know

158
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,360
why no is hating on gnome it's available with a bantu it's a it's a it's a blessed uh you know

159
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,040
i forget the terminology not not a flavor but a um you know a flavor uh the gnome environment and

160
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,960
he installed a bunch of gnome and what would happen was if you would full screen a flash

161
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,000
video in firefox and then uns full screen it and then go back to refull screen it it wouldn't ref

162
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,280
it wouldn't go back into full screen a second time you'd have to restart his computer or at least log

163
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,320
out to make that happen again now some people are going to blame firefox some people are going to

164
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,640
blame gnome some people are going to blame a bantu but the problem didn't occur in chrome inside of

165
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,840
a bantu gnome and the problem didn't occur in firefox in a bantu unity and the problem didn't

166
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,600
occur in any other distro i can tell you've tried this yeah well yeah we troubleshot the heck out of

167
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,160
it let me tell you because i and so basically what i came to i came to the conclusion that

168
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,440
at least in in in some esoteric use cases because canonical is focusing so much on their own desktop

169
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,960
everything works really really well in unity and so if you're going to use a bantu you're probably

170
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,200
your best choice is to go with uh is to go with unity because that's their quote-unquote default

171
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:28,080
desktop and so what i think is is interesting is we have this illusion of choice that you can pick

172
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,240
any desktop but really you you start to you start to have compromises and the further down the list

173
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,280
you go the the the less popular of a desktop you choose the more problems i find that exist and so

174
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,560
you know i i can't count the number of issues i've had with uh cinnamon when i try to install

175
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,760
it on a bunch of now on a like on mint it works just fine but you try and install the cinnamon

176
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,040
desktop on top of a bantu and i have all sorts of weird weird issues that i don't really want to

177
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
work through and so so i i and i don't know and so that that was kind of my response on reddit

178
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,440
and i'm wondering what you think of that response i think that's fair uh i would like to hear what

179
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:16,560
our mumble room has to say let's uh introduce those fine fellows hello hello hello oh there's

180
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:25,760
tons of people in here so mumble room uh you guys all use linux right yes sir what's that question

181
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:35,600
what's that question lunix gnu slash linux yeah gnu slash linux um so wimpy i'm interested

182
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,960
to some degree to get your perception because a bantu mate is is one of those uh is one of

183
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,120
those distros where i i have not to the best of my knowledge found a single thing that when as

184
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,000
when using a bunch of mate where it makes me feel like i'm on a on on an alternative desktop from

185
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,920
a from standard bantu everything just worked i mean literally everything just works in fact so

186
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,360
much so that i actually all of the production machines that i have here in grand forks um with

187
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,120
the exception the one i'm on now but all the rest of them are actually running a bunch to mate because

188
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,360
it runs lighter than it does with unity and i'm wondering you know what kind of considerations

189
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:21,120
went into that and and and how you guys feel about that and um and how that plays out well

190
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:30,480
well a bantu mate is just a bantu in fact it is a bantu um when you when when when you boil it down

191
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,280
you simply i say simply it's taken a year and a half to do you you remove

192
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,240
unity and you put the mate desktop on top but then you keep all of the bantu tools and integrations

193
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,440
that already exist underneath the hood which is what gives you all of that stability and just

194
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:01,440
works goodness of a bantu on a traditional desktop environment so and one of the reasons why

195
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:10,800
mate is lighter than um unity is that it's based on gnome 2 with all of the old compatibility stuff

196
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:17,120
from gnome 1 removed and all of the underpinnings upgraded to the latest versions of all the recent

197
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,360
technologies um and it's all written in c so it's a very lightweight implementation by you know by

198
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:34,080
comparison to what it was um when it was gnome 2 in its sort of last versions so um it's kind of

199
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,360
happenstance in some respect that respects that mate has now come out as a lightweight desktop

200
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:48,720
alternative outstanding um anyone else have have uh have thoughts or opinions on desktop environments

201
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:59,440
and good i i'm sorry my audio is terrible i'm in america for scale um uh so there's a few things

202
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,960
one whenever anyone says i'm one of the few people who like unity i want to slap them because there

203
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,240
are millions of people who use unity watch out at scale watch out at scale no one yeah and and

204
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,960
you know saying i'm one of the few people what actually is the case is there are a few really

205
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,640
negative uh people who don't like it and who are very vocal and there's a vast number of people

206
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,000
who use it and aren't vocal so you know saying you're one of the few people you should actually

207
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,560
say i'm one of the majority you like unity to be fair um so the the original question you know from

208
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,360
the guy posted on reddit was about you know why don't we just use gnome you could use that same

209
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,080
argument about every single desktop why don't you just all pack up and go home and use something

210
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,120
else is effectively what you're saying and every single desktop has their own um niche that they

211
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,080
want to fulfill or use cases that they um address that others don't like you know for example

212
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:06,720
elementary have their um uh niche with it's not so much a niche i would like to have a you know

213
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,200
well-designed pretty robust you know functional desktop uh that sounds like a reasonable thing

214
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,400
and and so you know that i think it's unreasonable to suggest that the people who are working on

215
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,160
those things should throw that away and use something else instead um you might just as well

216
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,440
say why didn't katie give up and switch to no it may it's a it's a nonsensical argument from my

217
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,920
point of view that's fair um so basically and i admit that this is a horrible horrible thing to

218
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,840
to base a generalization on but there was a i am admitting that up front but there is there it was

219
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,960
a couple months ago maybe even a year ago that we did a poll um a straw poll and to find out

220
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,800
what desktop environment people were using and i was shocked at how many people didn't vote for

221
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,280
unity and and and gnome shot way to the top and and unity was down there and i guess i've had

222
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,480
that correct or incorrect or correct um perception that uh that unity just wasn't preferred by a lot

223
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,600
of the people that the you know that that are aware of other desktop environments that are out

224
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,920
there and i fully admit that you that you know work you know working in the space that you work

225
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,640
in you're going to have a much much much more realistic perception you know what actually

226
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,360
biased biased and you should throw away my opinion completely and you should only listen to people

227
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
who are outside of this bubble um because they weren't their opinion won't be tarnished you know

228
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,640
potentially is one side of it but the flip side is any of these um polls are deeply flawed the same

229
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,200
way that they're bearing uh using distro watch is your measure exactly the same it's ridiculous and

230
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,800
people who who place any importance on something which is basically um a poll which can be shared

231
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,680
amongst a subreddit which massively skews the numbers for any one distro plus or minus when

232
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:08,000
in fact the actual people who use and like a particular desktop or user interface or application

233
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,240
or whatever are ultimately never going to see that poll my mum uses Ubuntu and has used Ubuntu

234
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,240
for years she will never see that poll and never click on anything in that poll same that's exactly

235
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,640
the point i was i was thinking is that however many millions of people in china use the Ubuntu

236
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,320
desktop they're never going to see this because the thing's written in english for one so it's

237
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,120
just ludicrous we in particular also are a community of you know linux enthusiasts and

238
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,640
people who like customization i think some of unity's strengths is that it can be widely

239
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
deployed and people it's pretty easy for people to just get it you know the icons are right there

240
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,040
on the left you hit the super key things just work so it has a lot going for it like like you

241
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,360
said you know your mom can use it my mom uses it it's it's great well and we also have unity is

242
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,000
actually the default desktop on well not the default test that was the only desktop uh on the

243
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,320
on all of our kiosk machines that we deploy and so basically if you think about the target audience

244
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,480
there it's we're taking people from all walks of tech of the technical spectrum and saying that

245
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,720
no matter who walks in if they sit down and they want to check their email print a boarding pass

246
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,200
or check the weather they're going to be able to accomplish those things quickly easily and

247
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,360
without complaining to the front desk because of course if they complain then we lose the contract

248
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,840
and what we found is that little bar on the side of unity which by the way requires no tweaking

249
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,720
and requires no extensions which means we don't have to update anything it becomes is is incredibly

250
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,800
useful in a situation like that and so i agree that the average person walking around the street

251
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,920
is going to sit down and have no trouble using unity and i think i even started out by saying

252
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,200
i phrased it you know poorly but the the gist of the message was it's my personal belief that that

253
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,880
unity is a more polished desktop than gnome is um but uh but for whatever reason and maybe it is

254
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,200
just that people are are terribly vocal i guess there is a there is there is a perception from

255
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,440
from some people that uh there's a perception from some people that that the that the unity

256
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,640
of desktop is inferior correct or incorrect well that's different it's like any any individual

257
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,720
like any reddit consumer uh is entitled to have their opinion and it's perfectly fine for someone

258
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,120
to say unity is inferior because of these xyz reasons in the same way that someone might not like

259
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,040
enlightenment or someone might not like kde because it doesn't work their workflow or the

260
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,880
apps don't look right or you know for whatever reason it's perfectly fine for people to have their

261
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:47,120
opinions you know and like buttholes everyone's got the problem is when you try and extrapolate

262
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,760
from a poll on a random website somewhere and make bold assertive statements about whether

263
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,880
something is right or wrong or whether something is good or bad based on a button clicked by a

264
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,520
bunch of random people on the internet it makes no sense whatsoever to me but that's just me

265
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,320
no i think that's completely fair um all right well i want to talk about a piece of feedback

266
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,880
that we got in and this comes to us from do cake and do cake writes in and he says greetings i

267
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,560
was hoping that maybe some of the technical savvy people might be able to help point me in the right

268
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,920
direction to resolve my crisis i may have just made a potentially costly mistake we nuked and paved

269
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,280
a friend's brand new lenovo yoga 500 with linux without booting into windows to first disable

270
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,840
secure boot explicitly he didn't want to accept the eula and so we successfully booted into the

271
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,840
usb key a bunch of mate 1510 a bunch of with unity 1504 so we thought we would just go ahead we

272
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,600
installed both a bunch of mate 1510 and then installed a bunch of with unity 1404 after

273
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,240
booting we were faced with a very plain and daunting boot prompt and he gives a screenshot

274
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,480
i get a screen with boot options of which the hard drive if i select any of these it just reprompts

275
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,720
me to the same screen i imagine that i need to go into the system that has a secure boot signature

276
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,000
that is find such a distro install it disable secure boot then reinstall our preferred system

277
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,360
i thought a bunch who would be a candidate but apparently not is this the correct way which

278
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,080
distros would work we have tried installing into a bantu unity 1504 which is supposed to have the

279
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,960
appropriate signature but after install and reboot we get the above given that windows has been

280
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,000
obliterated at this point what options do i have unfortunately he's leaving in just over a week so

281
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,120
if the conclusion ends up being install windows to do this i'll take it but i'd rather not if anyone

282
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:43,280
has any tips thanks do cake so i hate and i use that word strongly i hate windows and secure boot

283
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,280
it has become a nightmare to get linux onto machines sometimes and i had a guy that we

284
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,280
actually ended up returning his computer back to best buy and he bought a different model

285
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,320
because we simply and i fully admit i'll put this disclaimer out it's probably because i'm an idiot

286
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,960
i fully admit that there's probably some of you out there that know exactly what buttons to click

287
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,400
and exactly how to get it to install but i couldn't i couldn't get it to work and it uh it

288
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,440
it drove me nuts and so i'm curious is there anyone there is there anyone out there that knows

289
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
how to do this because the only way i'm aware of is to actually boot into windows go into the

290
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,120
troubleshooting menu reboot into the the uefi settings and then disable uh secure boot or turn

291
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,680
on um legacy boot or or whatever they call it is different in different manufacturers but

292
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:38,000
does anyone know of another way to do that i might have an idea um if it's a lonovo then

293
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,840
there might be like a little button on the side of the pc you press that button and it'll ask you

294
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,400
if you want to uh your boot options go into the bios and that's where the secure boot should be

295
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,640
located and just check turned it off from there yeah yeah we did that's what i that's what i did

296
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:04,160
in my laptop i i got a lenovo uh y510 p laptop that well the motherboard fried but anyway it

297
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,160
came with windows 8 with secure boot uefi and all the stuff so i just pressed that button went into

298
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,840
the bios shut all that off and linux installed just great yeah and we did the same thing on on

299
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:24,080
angela's yoga too uh yoga too we angela's yoga too as well we'll say it that way um but she had

300
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
that little button and yeah that was super slick to get into the boot menu but the thing that was

301
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,200
confusing to me is they're able to get into somewhat of a uefi setting or bios setting

302
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,600
because they're able to change the boot order so i would think that there'd be something inside of

303
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,080
those uefi settings to to to turn it off um it does kind of look like they were trying to

304
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,400
it does kind of look like the one thing they might want to check as well just in general if

305
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,960
they want to use it one too uh you know if they got it installed obviously secure boot is working

306
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,600
to the point where they could boot into it uh and it kind of just looks like the efi entry

307
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,440
right get set there should be like a you know linux manager the same way there's a windows

308
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,680
manager exactly so i can actually answer that for you yeah please okay so depending on what

309
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:15,280
model of computer it is like or sorry not model what make it is like hp lenovo uh etc there's a

310
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,880
different key when you're booting up and you get their splash screen that you gotta hit uh to get

311
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:27,440
into the uefi and then usually there's a setting in there to disable secure boot or in some cases

312
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,160
you can even go as far as to go into legacy bios mode and then that bypasses all the uefi nonsense

313
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:40,640
uh okay and and chat room is telling us that on lenovo f1 will get us in to make that change

314
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:51,280
yeah and on toshiba it's usually delete uh f10 on hp and uh i can't remember what it is for asus

315
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,440
all right well that's that gives him something to try anyway but uh you know i'll reiterate again i

316
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,280
think it's been a real pain i i've tried a couple different times to you know it's gotten to the

317
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,560
point where i'm almost more likely now to buy a used machine that previously had windows 7 on it

318
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:13,120
and just uh and wipe that off rather than um you know rather than go with a new machine because

319
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,960
it's just such a pain and that's sad really because it it's seriously going to decrease the

320
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,680
amount of people that are willing to give linux a shot i am nervous as heck now to recommend that

321
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:26,160
somebody try to install linux whereas before i'd be like well let's try and do a boot worst case

322
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,320
scenario we just uninstall it and redo your partition now i'm petrified to do even that

323
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,560
yeah i was just helping my brother with his new laptop and uh you know i had i walked him through

324
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,640
over the phone how to disable secure boot and even he's fairly technical but he even asked me

325
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,760
like oh is it is it okay that we have this off you know just the name scares people to even try to

326
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,920
follow that kind of instruction you know that's such a good point and they have these stupid

327
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,960
idiotic messages that pop up too that say things like you're disabling secure boot your computer

328
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,880
may be pro you may be susceptible to unsigned firmware and cause damage and no no it won't

329
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,920
because we've used computers with unsigned with with unsecured bios i hate using that word

330
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,240
for the last 20 years and we've never had a problem so in this case it does also seem like

331
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,160
the at the same time they rolled out that quick boot where it doesn't always load the keyboard

332
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,160
and other drivers right at the exact that plays right into it you know on its own secure boots

333
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,640
okay especially for enterprises and places where you do want that extra you know key security to

334
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,280
only boot your kernel but it doesn't work as well in this case you know i've worked in a decent

335
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,120
amount of enterprises i mean they're going to be somewhat limited in grand forks north dakota i've

336
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,840
never walked into an enterprise that was concerned about uh which kernel was booting i just it just

337
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,560
seems like a problem that never existed and and the the thing is like you're onto something with

338
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,200
that um it doesn't recognize keyboard input just to load into the bios of the ufi man you can't

339
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,600
even do that anymore you know because it boots so fast with that stupid uh you know fast boot

340
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,000
or whatever where it doesn't completely shut down just a pain um lucas z writes in and he says i

341
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,200
heard yesterday about friend os friend os it looks like this and he links us a youtube video

342
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,600
so it's an amiga workbench in the browser powered by linux pack and they're releasing the public

343
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,280
beta as open source this week it will be able to run on both html5 and native applications

344
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,000
and then he links us to their website i'm wondering if anyone in the chat or in the

345
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,160
mumble room has heard about this or played with it nobody nobody has played with friend os well

346
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,320
let's let's take a look um so it looks actually pretty neat anytime you start combining an

347
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,360
operating system and a uh and a browser i i get excited wes have you seen this i think you were

348
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,800
the one that linked it actually only just a little bit what do you think it was kind of

349
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,320
interesting uh honestly i wish they had a few more screenshots the video is okay but more

350
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,280
screenshots a little bit more it's kind of a little salesy at this point yeah yeah it really

351
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,960
is a lot a lot of a lot of stock uh stock photos and stuff like that well anyway um look at that

352
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,160
3d earth yeah exactly exactly well nonetheless i it still excites me and the and it would be

353
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,120
something that might be neat to get a review on a little bit later but um basically my understanding

354
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,560
is um that that uh that you like again you like this is email so do you get an amiga workbench

355
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,320
inside the browser and um have you used anything similar to this before you know i don't think i

356
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,920
have hmm anyone in the mumble room used anything similar to this or have an idea what we could

357
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:36,320
expect if if you know when they when they release their public beta and we play with it nobody

358
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:48,320
it's quiet in here this isn't popular um well um hmm that's no good so uh i guess what we'll do is

359
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,240
we'll just we'll keep our eye on it and um when they release the public beta and we get to play

360
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,560
with it we will uh we'll take a look at it and see what we think and maybe by that time i guess

361
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,320
once i guess that that is what the uh um what the catalyst of conversation is right is actually

362
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,400
getting to play with something if you can't really see what it is i suppose um yes they had the other

363
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,800
two in uh an article but it's not in english so i could not read it yeah yeah i try you know i

364
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,800
tried to use that's another thing too is google translate has been has been super crazy well i'll

365
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,800
tell you what what else is crazy is chris is on his way to uh scale now i don't know how many

366
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,240
people i haven't i haven't heard what the final numbers of people that bought the um the the the

367
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,200
shirt to support the trip from scale but at this point whether you support it or not you can come

368
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,120
visit chris hang out with him he's going to be at scale i believe he's arriving tomorrow night

369
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,760
and you can track him the entire way there jupiterbroadcasting.com slash rover dash two and

370
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,040
he has um oh he updated it oh that's cool um you can live track him to find out exactly where he

371
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,720
is and you can go beat on his door and uh and and and say hello and people did that last time

372
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,240
and he actually invited him right onto the air so i don't know if you remember that west we are

373
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,560
sitting here we're doing the show and all of a sudden we have a third person there uh that was

374
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,040
joining us um from it was awesome yeah it was it was really cool we got to talk to him and and they

375
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,400
got to be on the air and and essentially do the show and and the chat room is officially renaming

376
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,920
unofficially renaming chris's rv as the jb party bus i don't know if that's actually going to go

377
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,840
over well or not or if he's going to keep it rover 2 but i'm in favor of the jb pb that's i'm down

378
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,280
with it yes you have to say yes yeah yeah so we'll talk to him but you can follow him on uh

379
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,080
on jupiterbroadcasting.com so i think both do both the links both rover and rover to work

380
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,640
i think they do i'm going to jb rover slash rover and that seems to still work so i think that's

381
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,040
working you know i actually attend all of the major conferences and i've tried every cell phone

382
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,440
vendor out there practically i've had a verizon phone i've had an at&t phone and i can tell you

383
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,440
without a doubt the most reliable connection that you're going to get at a conference like scale

384
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:01,200
that's full of congestion is from ting now ting is a trendsetter of the of the of the mobile sphere

385
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,840
if you go into any cell phone shop uh today you'll see that they have all of these uh gimmicks for

386
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:13,440
no contract phones and and uh and at&t has done away with their two-year contract and and they

387
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,760
have all this prepaid stuff and you know who started all of that ting did uh with ting you're

388
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,160
only going to pay for what you use so we have contract employees that come in here for a week

389
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,320
at a time or two weeks for a time or a month at a time and we have them do things like wiring

390
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,840
buildings and pulling cat 5 and and and doing punch down block tests and if we're doing a if

391
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,160
we're doing an equipment swap for you know a hotel they have a bunch of new machines they don't have

392
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,320
to have any real technical skills they just have to be able to unbox computers put them in the place

393
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,880
of the old ones and then our techs will go through and actually do the imaging and configure that

394
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,720
kind of stuff so they have to do very basic things but we need to be able to get a hold of those guys

395
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,040
and the way that we do that is we outfit them with a phone from ting now because they're working on

396
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,760
site in a place that we manage the wi-fi they're on wi-fi 100 of the time we very nice we use

397
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,040
telegram for all of our texts and we use sip for all of our phone calls so west the deal is they're

398
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,400
not really using any of ting service we need that we needed to fall back to a phone service we needed

399
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,600
to hold back to internet in case they're not available or they they you know they go off site

400
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,800
for a little bit but for the most picking up supplies at the store they have a question to

401
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,680
ask you got it you know they've got service you've got it but for the most part we're only paying

402
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,120
six bucks a month for those phones now now that alone would be enough for you to get your drop

403
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,840
your current provider and come over to ting but because you're a linux unblocked audience they're

404
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,480
going to give you 25 off your first device your first month first month of service and all you

405
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,520
have to do to get that is visit and i think we can all agree here this is the coolest url on the web

406
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,760
linux.ting.com linux.ting.com and you can buy something for yourself for me i actually bought

407
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,400
a a unlocked gsm phone off of ebay and was able to use that 25 towards my first month of service

408
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,960
and if you're only using six to ten dollars you're going to get the first month or two for free it's

409
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,520
not going to cost you anything they're going to give you that so linux.ting.com and pick yourself

410
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:11,280
out something nice and thank you so much to ting for sponsoring the the linux unplugged so let's

411
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,920
see if this is more popular it better be i have had servers on my brain this week and for a number

412
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,160
of different reasons and so i i immediately gravitated towards this article um that says

413
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,880
the if it loads there we go um ocean the linux web server that fits in your pocket ocean may look

414
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,040
like a smartphone but in fact it's a fully functional linux powered web server that fits

415
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,920
in your pocket you want a web do you want a portable linux powered web server look no further

416
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,200
than ocean ocean has been designed for the ground up for profit for for portability and features

417
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,880
integrated battery that allows you to run web and bluetooth applications in place where direct power

418
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,480
is limited the device is approximately the size of an iphone 6 and can easily fit in your pocket

419
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,880
because it packs the power of the linux operating system the default is debian but you can install

420
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,440
your own ocean can be used for a variety of functions deploying web applications frameworks

421
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,040
such as node.js ruby on rails building a custom router a internet of things hub ibeacon eddystone

422
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,960
or prototyping the device can also act as a battery pack for iphones and android devices

423
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,120
and holds enough power to recharge an iphone 6 1.3 times it has the following specs a one gigahertz

424
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:34,880
arm processor cortex a7 one gigabyte of ddr3 480 megahertz ram 16 gigabytes of an internal micro sd

425
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:44,000
storage four gigabytes internal flash chip one usb 2.0 and 3.0 port 8211 bgn wi-fi and bluetooth

426
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,400
4.0 it also supports qi wireless charging and a 4200 milliamp internal battery which is good

427
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,400
of two days of continuous cpu usage and as the chat room is pointing out it is kind of like

428
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:06,640
a raspberry pi the the difference to me is i really like arm devices and i think that it's

429
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,800
it's a really competitive alternative platform to x86 but every time i talk to raspberry or people

430
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:21,520
the arm enthusiasts that are interested in um all arm devices a lot of them seem to rail against the

431
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,320
raspberry pi and they say basically it's kind of like a toy it's not really a serious device so

432
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,160
i guess the thing that makes us stand out in my mind is it seems like from the ground up it's

433
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:41,040
designed to be a production grade server just a very very limited very very low power uh

434
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,120
low power uh low power consumption low resources uh production it also has kind of the slick

435
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,800
branding in the case which i could see you know helping its marketability like you don't want to

436
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,640
buy something with an exposed circuit board and put it together exactly you just want to like drop

437
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,640
it in your studio and use it for you know recording things when you're working with your friends or

438
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,880
whatever exactly and you know as and from and again if taking that marketing perspective one

439
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,800
thing further when i go into a client i say if i tell them i want to install something called a

440
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,160
raspberry pi they're gonna look at me sideways right now if i tell them expect food exactly now

441
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,080
if i now if i tell them i want to install the ocean micro web server you know and then they go

442
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,080
to a website and it has flashy little spinning around graphics and it has little bullet points

443
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:26,720
that talk about specifications that they don't really understand that kind of stuff impresses

444
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,600
people um but the you know i was i was looking around the other day and i was thinking you know

445
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,840
we have so many little tiny things you know we have a we have a resource site that our employees

446
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:42,080
go to to and it has um links to the to these incredibly long urls like for example drivers

447
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,800
for hp you have to click like seven different links to get deep enough into their site before

448
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,720
you can actually type in the model number that you want it spits out the driver links once you

449
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,400
find that link it's not so bad so we have that hot link to a resource site and we have things

450
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,280
like the another example would be the hp lip driver um all of that stuff is linked it doesn't

451
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,040
require a lot of power i don't even necessarily need you know a you know an even you know a big

452
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,600
server would probably be too much and too much overhead all i really need is a little tiny thing

453
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:14,880
that serves up a tiny little html page and i was actually looking for inexpensive uh low-powered

454
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,920
servers and then you drop this on me and i'm like you know what this is it this is exactly what i

455
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,760
was looking for a couple nights ago and um i can think of a ton of uses i don't know what if you

456
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,160
had one of these west what would you be using it for no i'm imagining like you could take it with

457
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,160
you uh you know maybe you're if you're out car camping maybe you're out somewhere else and you

458
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,240
want to play like a game with all your friends uh and you already have kind of like stuff set up you

459
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,320
could use this as a as a little server that you know you host all the download files on you can

460
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:46,640
host shared files to drag and drop between them as you're working how about the mumble room what

461
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,080
do you guys have uh what do you guys have ideas for i know freso you can probably think of a

462
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,480
thousand things to uh to host on a tiny little web server hey we could start hosting uh i thought it

463
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,280
would be nice to use it for like a wildlife camera or something or a surveillance system

464
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,720
yeah yeah so if especially if we paired that with a like a like a gsm card unlocked gsm

465
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,880
card with a unlocked hotspot from ting you know for five bucks a month or six bucks a month you

466
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,640
could have a hotspot capability and put that thing online and have it be a cellular server

467
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,200
they both run off a battery right so that would be that would be kind of neat how about uh how

468
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,400
about uh freso are you still here yep yep you got any ideas of what you could do with the tiny

469
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,040
little pocket website i have tons of ideas actually i could probably use one today to

470
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:44,560
collect some data and but here's the thing i am very destructive with this kind of devices and

471
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,720
this is why i love the raspberry pi is because i can destroy one and getting a new one cost me

472
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,640
just five bucks right and i literally just a couple hours ago accidentally shot a raspberry

473
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:04,960
pie with a twin too i'm not even joking you say um i think it's still working it still sent the

474
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:16,880
data back to uh my tablet so um i think it's still alive um but i can do this because a replacement

475
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:29,120
cost me five bucks i'm not too worried about it that being said um if i had uh a 50 server

476
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:39,680
i would probably not be as willing to experiment with it uh which is the big downside for me um

477
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:50,480
um that being said if you play with a lot of iot uh stuff and you need a hub this is perfect yeah

478
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:58,480
yeah no it really is um i can think of it good my my first thought one i i saw that also on the

479
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,760
internet my first thought was i could use a nokia n9 for that he's doing the same thing besides i

480
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:16,160
have no usb port but the rest i have it okay well i don't it's a rather expensive tool when i say

481
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,600
when you look at the prices so you can have much cheaper thing to do the same thing i think

482
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,480
i don't think price is the only factor i mean there are plenty of people who you know look at

483
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,760
how many people buy apple max right right so the price is not the single factor uh it you know as

484
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,360
a geek on a limited budget yeah sure it may be uh how the price range or your budget for whatever

485
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,760
like uh homebrew project but if you're a professional and you want to take along a

486
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,120
server to a demo um you know to a to a company that won't let you plug your laptop into their

487
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,520
network i've had plenty of those occasions that's a great use case you know want to demo something

488
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,000
you can just slap the little server down on the middle of the table turn it on and say right

489
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,720
connect your laptops to that and uh and you can you know i'll show you my my web application demo

490
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,640
written in node or whatever running off that little box that's a great that's a great point

491
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,760
because there's so many things run on windows these days that you might not you know might

492
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,280
be way more work to try to get your demo running on a windows laptop that your business provides

493
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,120
you than it would be just to stick it on a little linux box you don't need you know load balancing

494
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,840
you just need an nginx server right and for me like right now i'm sat in a hotel away from home

495
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,360
uh it would be ideal for me to have a little server with me here as well sometimes there's

496
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,000
some things that i want to run uh on a server rather than having to use the rubbish hotel wi-fi

497
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,640
to deploy out to the cloud i could just deploy it on a little local server sat here and having

498
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,720
it as a little box that has a battery in it is just nicer you know it's it's not it's not as

499
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,160
gnarly as having a raspberry pi yeah okay i could get a raspberry pi in a nice case but i'd also

500
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,800
need a battery and bluetooth and a wireless dongle and you know adding all those things together

501
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,880
together and get it sometimes a pretty box outweighs uh yeah the hackability of putting

502
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,320
a bunch of good values together and if they support it well that might be enough you know

503
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,240
that you know that well if this thing breaks i can reasonably get it replaced or serviced or

504
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,160
you know rather than oh well it's on me to buy the new hard drive and figure out why the solder

505
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,240
joints aren't working then you know there are there are other you know out of the box solutions

506
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,840
that i use too you know one of examples is every place that we do work and we usually try to keep

507
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:25,280
at least one box that we can ssh into so that we can get into the network to do various things

508
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,080
then from there we can do you know we can you know do a skin or ping a specific ip or whatever

509
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,480
we like to have at least one box sitting on the inside now normally that's not a problem because

510
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,800
if they're paying us to come do the network infrastructure usually they have at least one

511
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,000
uh at least one at least one server i'll say that i that that's not true in every place especially

512
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,160
in the hospitality industry because a lot of that's cloud based but most of the the the enterprise

513
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,040
networks we have one server but this would be a great place to actually put you know like a

514
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:02,480
single device behind the firewall by the way i have been updated from the field that the name

515
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:14,080
of the of the new rig is not rover not rover 2 it is lady jupiter whoa yeah yeah lady jupiter

516
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:23,920
that's the name of that beautiful beautiful rv so uh there you go um so yeah so i have had servers

517
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,520
on my brain servers on my mind all week this week and all week last week and i actually just got

518
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,960
done setting up a couple of the in-house stuff here for ultispeed and one of the things i was

519
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:42,400
doing was i it was last week or the week before i was working with a client who wanted to set up

520
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,840
content hosting and basically what they were they wanted to do is they had three different uh three

521
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,360
different things that they wanted to run three different independent servers that they wanted

522
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,840
to run and so we were talking about you know we could buy a server and virtualize all three of

523
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,760
those little mini servers um and the the the price point was going to be three thousand dollars to

524
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,200
buy that server and then we started talking about it well here's you have to consider a couple of

525
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:12,560
things one is you're going to purchase that server and and you're going to you know have to front

526
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,640
that first three thousand dollars and then you're going to have to they were going to be on a two

527
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,920
year upgrade cycle so every two years they're going to spend another three thousand dollars

528
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,040
and throw the last one away so basically that means they're paying you know one and a half

529
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:29,360
thousand dollars a year to maintain this to maintain this architecture uh then there's no

530
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,480
redundancy so if they have to do upgrades if they have to do if we have to do repairs they're going

531
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,880
to have to take that server offline for a couple of hours unless of course we could buy a backup

532
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,240
server but then you're spending another three thousand dollars on the backup server so now

533
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,200
we're up to three thousand dollars a year and repairs and maintenance aren't going to be

534
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,320
covered so they're going to contract that out to us now the good news for me is we charge two

535
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,760
hundred dollars a month per server to do that so i would have been happy yeah i would have been

536
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,880
thrilled if they would have decided to to buy the server and then pay us a monthly fee to maintain

537
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,400
it um but in but anyway we broke all that cost down divided it by you know their monthly cost and

538
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,880
said this is what it's going to cost you per month to run a server and then we looked at what it costs

539
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,880
to run that same to do all the same things they wanted to do on digital ocean and actually one

540
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,520
other thing i forgot there was also pricing in there for a backup internet connection because of

541
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,280
the if the if the fiber line that fed the building ever went down then they would have a backup

542
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,880
connection that was going to be another 50 bucks a month i think and so we looked at the cost of

543
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,640
the digital ocean droplet 480 a year that's what it was going to cost them for everything all

544
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:37,360
included they were going to have practically no downtime they were no longer going to be

545
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:41,200
responsible for the upgrades there was going to be no ongoing maintenance because it's going to

546
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,480
be handled by a professional that lives and sleeps in the data center 24 hours a day seven days a

547
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,720
week and they eat and breathe this stuff that's gremlins right little data center yeah well they

548
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,480
they're minions actually you know the little yellow minions yeah so basically more sense

549
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,360
basically after they got done working for uh uh for the for the evil henchmen in despicable me 2

550
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,720
then they actually went to work for digital ocean they're the ones that actually maintain

551
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,640
the servers and the server infrastructure they they do it all day long and they do a fantastic

552
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,600
job now because of the complicated setup that we had it was going to cost us about you know roughly

553
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,480
40 a month or so to to do all that but if you're just running a basic web server kind of like some

554
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,480
of the tasks we were talking about on this uh on this ocean uh server if you're just running uh you

555
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,360
know a basic web server or a basic database server man we switched our entire ticketing system over

556
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:35,200
to a uh to a five dollar a month droplet on digital ocean and it i mean it freaking flies

557
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,320
like it is wow yeah it's it's far and away better than the system that we were using before and it

558
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,240
runs on a cheaper droplet and we're accomplishing all that for five bucks a month and here's the

559
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,920
best part wes digital ocean is going to give you 10 credit if you use the promo code d o unplugged

560
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,920
so you're getting dollars 10 bucks and so basically you get the first two months free and

561
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,600
because uh there's no requirement to keep going if you decide after the first two months you don't

562
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,280
want to use it anymore you just power the server down and close your account and that's the end of

563
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,680
it but you won't do that because it's an addiction i my name it is my name is noah and i'm an addict

564
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,840
i'm addicted to digital ocean droplets i spin them up constantly i spin them i was playing with have

565
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,000
you ever have you ever played with the um i'm probably throwing away a linux action show idea

566
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,080
but have you ever played with pong no i think i think it's i think the name is pong let me let

567
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:31,200
me look but basically it is a it is a load balancer uh for linux and uh i'm probably

568
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,960
pronouncing that wrong and everyone is probably uh everyone that knows it is probably thinking

569
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,520
of it i'm trying to look at i'm really taking over for chris last then yeah yeah oh yeah no no

570
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,400
no not not quite that but here we go here we go it is it is called i'm pulling the name up now

571
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,920
it is called like it doesn't have the name but but anyway there is a there is a program i'm gonna

572
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,680
i'll look it up and i'll throw it in the show notes and basically it is a very very simple

573
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,880
load balancer so you set it up on one digital ocean droplet and basically what happens is

574
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,560
anytime your pound that's the name of pound p-o-u-n-d pound is great yeah and so basically

575
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,720
you set it up you have three servers and you have your your server and your backup server and then

576
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:13,440
you have your load bounce bouncing server that has pound running and basically what happens is

577
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,680
anytime that server one goes down it automatically sends all of the traffic to server two but it gets

578
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,520
even better let's say you had a uh let's say you had one server that had a lot of really good

579
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,680
resources and then you had your other server from a couple of years ago that didn't have so many good

580
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:37,440
resources you can actually set set it up so that you have a a weighted key so out of every 10 users

581
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,800
that connect six of them will go to the good hardware and four of them will go to the poor

582
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,600
hardware and you can set it up like that to to distribute the load over you know obviously i'm

583
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,840
using the example i'm using two but you could have three or four or five and we actually set that up

584
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:54,240
on our ticketing system so that if our main ticketing computer ever goes down it automatically

585
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,040
fails back to a back over digital ocean droplet and god forbid anything ever happened to digital

586
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,480
ocean themselves it automatically fails back to an on-site backup on our premise and god forbid

587
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,960
anything happens to both those two at the same time it'll fail back to a to a backup of a backup

588
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:13,600
server that sits in my house nice yeah so this actually i like you said i probably just blew a

589
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,320
perfectly good linux action show episode talking about that right now but it is super super cool

590
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,600
and and here's here's my challenge if somebody goes and tries this they can put this to the test

591
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,800
you can set pound up in 30 seconds it's that fast i mean the configuration file is like

592
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,680
12 lines and and and you have it up and running and it works and it's absolutely amazing

593
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,400
uh so if you want something useful to use that ten dollars digital ocean credit for that's that's

594
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:42,800
what i would look at um i want to go over to this article that comes to us from rs technica and

595
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:52,320
this is about um having confidence in linux to do the things that we have sourced to basically

596
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,640
other devices and the article says i've noticed lately that rather than replacing a router every

597
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,640
time it literally stops working i've needed to act earlier swapping new gear because an old

598
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,720
router could no longer keep up with the increasing internet speeds available in the area um and he

599
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,360
says uh a lot of you are probably muttering to yourself pf sense sure that might be what you're

600
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,520
thinking about or smooth ball or untangled i've played with all of the firewall distros out there

601
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,720
but i decided to go with a more basic more old school approach a plain cli only install of a

602
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:27,040
buntu server that has a few ip tables rules and he talks about basically how he set his linux box up

603
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:36,000
to act as a firewall slash router and before i go on with what i think about this what do you think

604
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,240
wes i thought i thought this was a great article um it may not be applicable for everyone not

605
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,880
everyone wants to learn and write their own ip tables rule set but i mean there are things like

606
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,640
you know ufw uh and another firewall firewall d things that'll help you set your firewall rules

607
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,480
but it's a great example of how you you know if you want a good project you want something just

608
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,320
kind of deep dive on understand networking and routing a little bit better here's a really

609
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,040
helpful guide i love the graphs he has here just kind of outlaying what performance he got a big

610
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:10,640
one for me is a lot of people want to set up vpns on their router but a lot of those little crappy

611
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,440
not even smartphone quality arm chips in the routers are not going to do the kind of crypto

612
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,720
that you want but something x86 based probably has a nice instruction set for it exactly now

613
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:28,720
anyone in the mumba room use uh use any sort of uh linux firewall distro any distro at all

614
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:35,280
does firewalls or routers open wrt count sure let's talk about it um what is it that drew you to open

615
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:44,480
wrt well frankly i was just too scared to leave the stock firmware on their tp link but i mean

616
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:52,160
it's not the link or anything but still so it i i bought the router with the specific intention

617
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:59,680
of throwing an open source software on there also happened to be about the same time that bsd was

618
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:09,360
thrown on a tp link by alan there you go um the model down so what i what i have my my basic

619
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:14,480
problem with all of the different firewall distros out there and i've admitted numerous times that i

620
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,520
am incredibly happy with router os and it's a it's a it's an operating system that is sold

621
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:25,840
uh by microtech and put onto microtech devices and i am able to get an enterprise grade uh

622
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:31,760
security gateway firewall router for like 40 and they work amazing we have them in production we

623
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,040
have the most i've had that i've seen personally is 2000 users connected at one time and it didn't

624
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,400
miss a beat and the nice yeah i mean it's it's an amazing i mean to be fair that wasn't the 40

625
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,960
dollar one that was a couple hundred dollars but but the operating system is the same on all of

626
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,400
them it's just that you get a better processor and a little bit more memory and and um and it

627
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,760
becomes rack mountable and stuff like that and you get more interface ports too but my basic

628
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,600
concern with all of these things is that linux has been capable for a long long time at doing a lot of

629
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:08,240
this stuff and we for whatever reason don't have confidence in its ability to do something as simple

630
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:14,640
as ip routing and there is a company out there called cumulus networks and they basically what

631
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:22,320
they do is they believe that linux is good enough as a router so it's it's basically exactly what

632
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:28,240
these guys have done or what this guy is talking about is using linux to do your routing and and

633
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:33,840
firewall stuff the the problem that they ran into though and where their solution is that the

634
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:40,000
switching fiber inside of a lot of the a lot of the network cards that you put in to a computer

635
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,880
isn't fast enough when you handle very very large networks if you have a lot of traffic going through

636
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,520
the the integrated network card or even a pci network card isn't going to be fast enough and so

637
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:55,280
they have um you know and i this is well over my head i admit that but my understanding is that

638
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:01,680
they have um they have special switching fiber that is on the same level that you would get

639
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,680
if you went with something like a juniper networks or a cisco um or a microtech or or hp or what have

640
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:15,280
you um to do your routing and but they both the author of this article and cumulus network share

641
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,120
a belief that i have subscribed to now since it's been explained to me and that is that

642
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:24,960
linux is often more than enough to do a lot of the tasks that we want it to do we just don't trust

643
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,440
it because it doesn't have a pretty web ui and you know you know we just talked about in the

644
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,880
mumble room about how we don't trust stock firmware on a tp link which is smart by the way

645
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,880
um because they're kind of a lower end uh device but what and so basically what he did was he took

646
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,800
better open source firmware and put it on you know reasonable hardware and got a very usable experience

647
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,040
on it and my question is what if we could do that with everything but instead of using something

648
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,920
like open wrt that only runs on a specific set of devices what if we just used an actual operating

649
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,920
system which i think is kind of what this what the author is talking about what do you think

650
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,160
yeah i think it has a great you know the one one thing i like that would work with pf sense or other

651
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,880
things as well as there is the split between your core routing and firewall and your wireless ap

652
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,480
i think that's i think that's very helpful i think that makes you can probably upgrade you

653
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,000
know your wireless ap a couple times well you still have the same server set up to do your

654
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,040
routing yeah uh it also lets you host more open wrt works for this too one thing i do like about

655
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:30,240
open wrt is that it has a built-in package manager yeah yeah so i use it at home for instance and uh

656
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,960
i wanted to have two i my work still uses pptp as a vpn even though it's broken even though it's

657
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,840
terrible um but i wanted to be able to have two separate connections to work from two separate

658
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:45,440
devices uh by default a lot of routers will not be able to nap that correctly sure open dwt you

659
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,360
just install one package and bam it works perfectly so you get that same kind of power but

660
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:54,000
you can do that it's just an ip tables module and if you had you know it's like a bun too it's even

661
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,680
easier it's just like a mod probe away right so i think that's what you get is like if you want to

662
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,240
customize and you really want the power to tune things and understand what's happening then then

663
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:07,200
why not how about the mumba room anyone in support or against of using linux as a router or edge

664
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:20,800
device i think it makes the device um much more flexible and if you have um some spare resources

665
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:30,080
on it um that you could use otherwise you can uh plus um i think tools like pf science and

666
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:37,200
other uh routing specific disk shows they come with all this stuff that you could possibly need

667
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:44,160
for the most complex router you will ever build in your ride in your life right whereas if you

668
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:53,840
just use the room to server and all you need is um ip tables you have this super simple setup for

669
01:02:53,840 --> 01:03:05,440
your super simple task which makes it a lot easier to manage that's interesting i i i guess i have

670
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,920
become i guess i started in the networking world in cisco where nothing is easy to manage because

671
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,120
everything is and you know the thing is about cisco is it's great hardware it does a great job

672
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:19,280
once you learn how to configure it but the configuration syntax is not similar to anything

673
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,160
else because they have their own commands and it's its own syntax and it doesn't work on anything

674
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,600
else and so if you start configuring routers that way i guess everything seems like a step up from

675
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:34,880
that at least from a usability standpoint but um you know one of the things that we do i should

676
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:41,520
ask you first anyone else have any other thoughts about about routers well if you take if you take

677
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,800
the fritz boxes for example they are running linux or the asus routers they are running linux

678
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:52,880
and for the asus routers they are open source enhancements available really tell me more about

679
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,640
that i've seen asus routers that like best buy i didn't know that they were running anything open

680
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:04,480
source though so i can't tell you what model i have but i switched i took a an open source

681
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,600
replacement of the stock firmware which is open source too and there are some enhancements with it

682
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:15,040
that's awesome you know one of the things that i found is if we let employees stay in the same

683
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,320
environment as us routers they they do better with them in the field so for example we had a program

684
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:25,360
what i shouldn't say had we have a program called professional development and basically if there's

685
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,960
equipment in the shop that's not actively being used or isn't actively assigned to a ticket to go

686
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,160
out and to be deployed they can take that equipment home as long as it's returned in the

687
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,960
same condition it went out with and play with it and it was actually the company i worked for

688
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:43,280
before had a similar program and it really really helped me because i wasn't going to be

689
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:50,080
able to uh it has put my hands on a on a ten thousand dollar uh core router or core switch

690
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,720
but unless the company bought it for for a client and then i was able to play with it for a little

691
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:01,440
bit and so we have let employees do that and take their equipment home and basically what we're doing

692
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:07,920
is i can teach somebody how to set up ip tables on a router and i can give them written instructions

693
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,760
so they can go through and do it but the the biggest thing that they lack is communication

694
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,600
the biggest thing that they lack is confidence in the field if they walk out into the field

695
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,600
and they go to a client and the client says i need you to forward uh i need you to create this

696
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,920
firewall rule that accepts packets from this or i need you to create this nat rule that sends

697
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,680
packets to this internal ip and they can think to themselves and go i've done that a thousand

698
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,680
times at home when i was forwarding my web server playing with my ssh and even though that stuff is

699
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,360
meaningless in the grand scheme of of what we make money off of it's valuable because they're

700
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:42,400
developing skills and so i found that to be a really cost-effective way to boost their confidence

701
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,920
when they're in the field so they not only do they know what they're doing but they feel like

702
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,200
they know what they're doing and they know that they know what they're doing and that's really

703
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,760
helpful and i was talking to an employee yesterday and he was talking about how he had some lack of

704
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,000
confidence when it came to administrating servers and so what we ended up doing with him is we signed

705
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,200
him up on a website called linux academy slash unplugged and we were able to get the course

706
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:08,080
because we used linux academy.com slash unplugged we got the course for a third of the cost and what

707
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:14,320
we ended up it ended up costing us like 15 bucks and we sent him through doing the uh the red hat

708
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,960
seven so he could learn how to do a lot of the red hat administration and he came back to me

709
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:26,400
a couple days ago and said you know i uh i well he he came to me yesterday is when when he finished

710
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,240
and and said to me you know that you know we signed up for that course and i sat up last night

711
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:35,440
i was kind of goofing around with it and playing with it it was awesome and i i now you know i kind

712
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,360
of had an idea of of how to do this that or the other but now i have been told by an instructor

713
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:45,360
an instructor by somebody of authority that this is the appropriate and acceptable way to do this

714
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:49,280
and so you don't you're not embarrassed about is this the right way to do this or is this just

715
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,200
kind of the way i've always done it and so you know i can get the job done but is it technically

716
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,760
correct you know that what you're doing is correct and and and um and so for him he actually signed

717
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,440
up for his own subscription he told me today that he has his own subscription to linux academy

718
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,320
and he's going to continue on uh to learn other things because he sees it like like a subscription

719
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:10,960
to netflix it's like entertainment and i'll tell you something about knowledge knowledge is the one

720
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,240
thing that people can't take away from you it doesn't matter what doesn't matter what life

721
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,120
throws at you you can get arrested you can be uh you know everything short of being killed

722
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,680
you can lose a lot of stuff in life but nobody can ever ever ever take away things that you've

723
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,600
learned they can't take away your education they can't take away your knowledge so for 20 bucks a

724
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:35,280
month um and actually even less have used linuxacademy.com slash unplugged you can get a

725
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:40,800
course and you can learn things that nobody will ever be able to take away from you

726
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:48,000
and to me that just seems like an incredibly valuable way and it's a huge return on investment

727
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:55,600
and not only that i've learned one of my favorite things to do is i memorize useless trivia facts

728
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,480
like i memorize things that you do now i do and it's really dumb it's so stupid but it's fun

729
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,960
because it's fun to do in a crowd when you sit down in front of a bunch of people and you you

730
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:10,480
quote some esoteric uh uh fact and and and and then you act as if like everyone should know it

731
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,240
or you say it in a way that everyone should know it and then everyone looks at like man that guy's

732
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,360
really smart he's that guy's how did he know that how did he know that yeah yeah if you're ever

733
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,880
around me in person then and you see me do that you like don't say anything don't you dare ruin

734
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:28,320
it wes but you can know never okay but you can know for yourself like that is that that's noah

735
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:33,200
doing his thing that's him uh doing that trivia thing where he does that thing where he pretends

736
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,320
that everyone should know but really he knows that nobody else knows and he knows it i think

737
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:43,680
it's fun game great way to get that trivia is linux academy.com slash unplugged if you want to

738
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:50,720
support jupiter broadcasting we could really really use your support you know chris i don't

739
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:56,240
i i don't even know i can't even put into words that from the time the man wakes up in the morning

740
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:01,840
till the time he goes to bed even if he's doing other things in the back of his mind he is thinking

741
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:07,200
about shows about content about what his audience wants and how did and how did yeah you see you've

742
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:12,240
been around him so you understand and what and and how to best deliver that and the problem that

743
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:20,400
he keeps coming up against is to do more things to do things better requires capital and the problem

744
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:28,400
is we find all of these little excuses of why we don't want to of of why we can't or why we shouldn't

745
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,880
support this that or the other and and that's what i hear from people um you know for the for

746
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,120
from the people they're saying well i'm not contributing because xyz and i just i want to

747
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:42,320
ask people to look at it like you'd look at any other source of entertainment you don't maybe

748
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,080
don't agree with everything that's ever said on netflix or maybe you don't agree with everything

749
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:50,720
that's ever said on uh hulu but you still contribute to those services because they're providing

750
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,320
valuable content to you and again we're going back to that whole knowledge is power thing

751
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:03,520
if man if if i if i charged the if i if i build out the amount of time the amount of information

752
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,800
that i give that we give on on linux action show in this week on linux unplugged and if chris did

753
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,880
the same thing and and build that out as a consultation service rather than just putting

754
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,000
it on the internet for free now we'd be rolling rolling in cash so you should consider that yeah

755
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,200
i should maybe i've maybe we've attacked this whole thing the wrong way maybe that's what we

756
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,920
should do we should just start doing online yeah online consultation you pay you call in we take

757
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,880
your credit card number and then we'll walk you through all this stuff and i'll start doing how

758
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,360
tos and he and chris can chris can fix your arch box because i want nothing to do with that and

759
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:38,000
yeah we'd make tons of money but no and we give all that to you to you for free and and right now

760
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,680
we could use your help at at at patreon.com today and every person that signs up even if it's just

761
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:49,440
a couple bucks if the more people that sign up every dollar you put towards patreon.com slash

762
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,480
slash today is a dollar that says i listen to jupiter broadcasting i find the content that you

763
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:59,680
guys make valuable and i appreciate what you're doing doesn't have to be a lot of money um you

764
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,760
know you can you can divide that up with you know a lot of people if they if if a bunch of people

765
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:08,800
just contributed a dollar it would it would add up to a ton so that's my plea if there's anyone

766
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,160
out there that that especially now that we're getting into like tax return time if we can i

767
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:18,400
don't know if it's possible to do a one-time donation on on patreon.com today but you can

768
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,880
do that on the jupiter broadcasting site but we would really really appreciate your support because

769
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:29,040
honestly when things like scale come up it's the first the first wave is excitement of this is

770
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,080
going to be amazing we're going to do this and it's going to be exciting and then it's immediately

771
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,880
followed with a wave of panic of how in the world are we going to pull this off um and that would

772
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:44,560
help alleviate that so i want to talk about um gnome defining a clear set of core apps for the

773
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,520
desktop and you see this article wes yes i did so of course you did because you posted it

774
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:57,760
but um and so basically um they are talking about how cheese is now a core app and g-ed

775
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,160
is going to be coming soon as a core app and i think to some degree this goes back to what we

776
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:13,040
were talking about about um having a cohesive desktop experience right and i'm interested in

777
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,040
in in what the future holds with that because i think if we can start even if we maintain our

778
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:23,600
freedom so you know anyone can write an app anyone can install any app they want but if we can get

779
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:29,760
to a point where there are some apps that are just these are the these are the apps that are

780
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,880
going to be installed these are the apps that are going to work these are the apps that we're going

781
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,480
to understand that are going to be there and everyone else can understand that are going to

782
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:41,680
be there when people write themes when people design changes so for example take my quake

783
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,920
example that i used at the beginning of the show if if quake became a core app for gnome

784
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,440
um what we could do is say that the people that make the dock on the side would be aware of the

785
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,280
fact that this terminal is going to drop down and how do we make that look nice with the terminal

786
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,440
drop down how do we make that a cohesive experience and of course we're not talking

787
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,880
about stopping anyone else from adding apps in we're just talking about having a defined set

788
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:09,360
that these apps are going to be there these apps are going to be available and one of the

789
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:14,320
main reasons i use the vi text editor is because i can i can know without a shadow of a doubt it's

790
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:19,200
going to be available on every machine i ever use everywhere it is it's everywhere and it becomes

791
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:24,800
omnipresent like that then you end up using it what are your thoughts wes yeah i agree i mean i

792
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:30,240
think i think gnome is rapidly becoming one of those desktops you know unity as well but where

793
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,960
we can just put people in front of them they look polished they look like a 21st century desktop

794
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,040
and one thing that people come to expect from the other operating systems is a kind of consistency

795
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,600
internal consistency and uh you know between when you sit down at one computer you sit down the next

796
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,600
computer you know you'll be able to do a certain amount of things they look this way it's the same

797
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,440
kind of interaction so hopefully this goes at least some extent to making gnome that kind of

798
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:55,120
environment where you're like oh yeah well cheese is here yet it will be there are things where

799
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,120
you're just like okay it works it's all gnome and if you for the power users of course you can still

800
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,520
install whatever replacement app you want it's still linux but hopefully these will be nice and

801
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,280
polished i think like elementary is doing a similar thing with their apps right so it's

802
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:13,600
good to see no i'm doing it for sure mumble room what do you guys think you guys are killing us

803
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:20,560
today you guys i i didn't even know that g edit was not a core app i mean it's a i always had it

804
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,360
yeah yeah the article is to be believed that gg edit will be soon and it's funny because

805
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:32,480
here's how you know g edit is doing it right because it is so entrenched in my mind as a

806
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:39,040
native app to to to gnome there's it is so much a core app in my head anyway that when i was doing

807
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:43,760
the linux action show a couple weeks ago i i inadvertently said was talking about how i didn't

808
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,560
like uh i didn't like the the text editor in kde because you had to bring part of the the kde

809
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:54,160
desktop in and i almost said well and g edit it just worked and then it dawned on me the g and g

810
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:59,200
edit is obviously you know and then then my brain caught up with my mouth and and it's like but it

811
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,760
is it is so well integrated and it does so well and the the thing is about something like g edit

812
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,720
is that it's such a simple program like what really is there to be done to make it a core app

813
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:13,600
i mean do we all just have to agree that it's a core app and it it it's just not that complicated

814
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:19,440
of an app you know anyone else i am glad i am glad to see that the the color app uh color manager

815
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,120
will be there because yeah i think that like what we were talking about you know professional

816
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:27,280
graphics earlier i think professional color management is something you need if you want to

817
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:32,560
have linux as a production platform sure and no the uh the point you were making earlier in the

818
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:40,160
show uh about the polish that unity shows on an ubuntu desktop or that cinnamon might show on

819
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:47,040
a mint desktop you know i i think extending your core apps is a key part of how these

820
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:53,840
desktop desktop environments are going to show more polish yeah having a complete settings suite

821
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:00,080
uh for whether it's gnome or unity or kde and having good default apps and good baked in apps

822
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:06,160
is critical to that yeah yeah it's going to become more cohesive right yeah exactly yeah

823
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:13,520
i think so anyone else before i wrap i think the gnome apps they are awesome i very much agree

824
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:21,360
but i don't know how about the speed of development i think they're really slow in development

825
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:29,280
all right anyone else yeah actually i think this is where kde of all desktop shines because they

826
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:34,960
pretty much have a core app for anything that you want to do that is true you know you're right

827
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:41,040
about that if i'm not i i haven't personally switched to kde i've never used it for any

828
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:44,640
extensive amount of time but you are onto something uh when you say that they have a

829
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,880
core app for almost everything it does feel like they natively have thought of almost everything

830
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,600
doesn't it it's a complete whole you know experience it is it is that's true you're

831
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:59,760
right about that um and i i don't know what it is i think i think basically it comes down to a long

832
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,320
long long long time ago um when i was first getting into linux one of the guys that was

833
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:09,600
teaching me about linux was like kde is the desktop that you use if you're not a real power

834
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:14,160
user and gnome is that i know i know it's it's a it's a huge trolly thing it's hugely biased but

835
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:21,280
at the time i was like 12 or 13 years old and i'm like well i want to be the smart one so i'll use

836
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,360
gnome and i just i never really used anything after that peer pressure look what happened yeah

837
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,280
i think it made a mark on me well because i'd been using kde prior to that as it kind of played

838
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,360
with it because it looked more like windows and it made me more comfortable and um yeah and then

839
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:37,920
my desktop got you know got crapped on and i was like oh well it's not a respected desktop and i

840
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,120
want to be a good hacker so then i switched to no stuck with me ever since all right anyone else

841
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:48,880
i just want to say you sounded like a very impressionable teenager uh well i guess there

842
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:56,720
was that but not either here or there that'll put this episode of the linux linux unplugged in the

843
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,000
books before we get out of here let's thank a couple of our producers producer rotten corpse

01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:25,120
see you right back here next week guys and hopefully hair will be back

847
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:51,120
so

848
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:26,960
all right bang suggest bang suggest um so and while we're doing that i want to go as the out

849
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:34,560
uh as the um the post show i want to look at this uh phoenix os um how deeply have you looked at

850
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:41,360
this west only briefly yeah so basically this goes back to talking about exactly what i don't like

851
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:46,160
android on the yeah yeah exactly uh but kind of proves me wrong actually as i'm looking at

852
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,400
this screenshot you know what this looks like to me west it looks like an android operating system

853
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:55,440
that is properly scaled to meet the requirements of a desktop platform it doesn't look that bad

854
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,720
actually although they do call it a rom still even for x86 which is a little weird but uh it

855
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:09,280
doesn't look bad yeah uh no it's it it doesn't look bad and it you know what it really reminds

856
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:14,800
me of is it reminds me of like a little bit of a souped up better looking version of windows

857
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,760
you know you've got the two drives and they have space and then you have the you know the navigation

858
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:24,960
on the side which i guess is to some degree what some of the linux file managers look like but yeah

859
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:31,680
it's kind of like windows no mixed i don't know i gotta tell you west this of all the things i

860
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:37,360
want to install on my computer this is darn near the bottom like i agree yeah i just nothing about

861
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:43,200
this is really i don't know a mumble room if you guys are thinking that any of these are and west

862
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:48,800
said it uh what concerns me about this about os is like this is they're managed and developed

863
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:56,480
like android roms unless like a true linux is true i mean do you want to download just one big

864
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:01,360
system image of random bits from the internet even if some of it's based on it yeah this is

865
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:09,440
a zip file uh and then you run a program that will create a usb for you i know yeah i don't

866
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:16,160
mind that i i would be willing to trust the developer uh on that i think they would be

867
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:24,240
shooting themselves in the foot if they would include anything malicious in there so what i

868
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:30,880
see as a bigger issue is that those uh attempts to make android work on a desktop uh kind of

869
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:37,280
come and go and if i do install something i want uh something that i can that i will know will

870
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:43,920
stick around right uh because i don't feel like reinstalling something uh six months from now

871
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:50,880
uh because what i initially installed doesn't have support anymore i'm assuming it would just

872
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:57,520
update apps separately um when it's not a system update as well yeah yeah it looks like that looks

873
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:03,440
like well it looks like it updates to the google play store doesn't it well my thing is is what uh

874
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:11,760
frechel said about trusting the developers i mean you know we trusted lenovo not to put spyware on

875
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:19,440
computers by default that happened yeah yeah it did it's interesting to try to build up from android

876
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:26,560
to a complete desktop rather than take a desktop and try to make it mobile you know i i think that

877
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,640
that has a better chance of working to be honest with you i think you're i think it might be true

878
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:36,800
but it's not it's not neither is a good solution but i think that scaling up is is has is more

879
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:42,400
has is more viable than scaling down probably at least for the majority of uh simple users not in

880
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,000
a disrespectful way just people who don't you know like you need the web you need your main apps and

881
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:53,760
that's it yeah i i don't know i nothing nothing about this is is uh is uh there's been a ton of

882
01:22:53,760 --> 01:23:01,600
attempts to strip the linux down to like something small and lightweight there was one peppermint i

883
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:07,920
think was one right yeah it was mostly browser based um and didn't really have you know concept

884
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:13,760
of an app store is like like android has it because you still need native apps like no matter

885
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:19,120
how hard firefox the mozilla guys tried to push firefox as html5 and that's all you ever need

886
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:26,800
right now that's not the case you know i want to play some high-end 3d game then you need something

887
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:33,360
lower level than html5 you know it's just not ready for that yet right but but i i can see

888
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:40,640
some value in in people pushing the boundaries with android on the desktop um i i don't know i

889
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,320
i'm i'm referred to i don't i think it needs to be someone bigger and someone more committed to

890
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:50,320
do that though because there will always be these little projects that pop up all over the place and

891
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,480
then they disappear a few months later or a year later and you've got to wipe it reinstall something

892
01:23:54,480 --> 01:24:02,480
else i don't know i mean i'm not i'm not sure i'm following you are like so linux couldn't get

893
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,440
much more stripped down i mean you have things like dsl that are like what 50 megs i mean how

894
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,360
much smaller do we really think we want an operating system to get well i personally

895
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:16,000
don't care for that you know i'm not i'm not what i'm saying is that people have tried to make

896
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:24,320
like you know very very small lightweight um distros that the users then want to add loads

897
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:29,040
of stuff the box about right yeah right right right but it's but can we agree that it makes

898
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:34,560
more sense to start with almost nothing and add all the junk that you want back on that is that

899
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:39,360
is a that is a more viable option than starting than starting with something like you know windows

900
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:45,120
xp and saying i'm gonna find a way to fit this on a phone there's just too there's just too much

901
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:51,520
there to fit into a phone to get down to to shave off well that's exactly what we're doing you know

902
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:57,200
we're starting with nothing and adding things like mere and unity 8 specific application so

903
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:02,880
yeah i agree with you that it's better to start from nothing and and build up uh totally good

904
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:11,600
also no on that friend os um earlier i think cm2 set in um the irc chat that's enclosed beta right

905
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,920
now so that's why no one was talking about it yeah yeah i here's here i've learned i've learned

906
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:21,200
uh i've learned a couple of things today i've learned that one uh seven hours is still not

907
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:28,640
enough time to uh to properly prep a show i've learned i've learned that everyone will telegram

908
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:33,200
you at the worst possible time right when you're trying to do something and so essentially you'll

909
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,800
get nothing done for the about the hour leading up to the show because you'll be putting out

910
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:45,280
random fires you sound more and more like chris every day being chris lasovitch is that it yeah

911
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,320
no it's just it's it's funny it's like and the thing is if i wasn't there if i didn't see it

912
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:57,200
myself i would never ever believe how many like his phone will be silent almost perfectly for

913
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:01,440
like an hour and then right before he goes on here or he'll sit down to do something and the second

914
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:06,320
his his butt hits the seat boom somebody starts telegraphing boom the irc goes off boom his phone

915
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,480
starts ringing boom the alarm the smoke alarm goes up boom the oven blows up boom his truck

916
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,800
blows up like everything happens at the worst possible time and if i hadn't seen it myself and

917
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,680
it's and it's it is like clockwork i could set my watch i would i'll know when a show is going to

918
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,760
start because everything in the studio will start going wrong but it'll only go wrong right when he

919
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,120
sits down after he's done with the show then everything returns to silent normal and it's

920
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:36,480
funny yeah and it's funny because like for the most part i managed to skirt that except it must
