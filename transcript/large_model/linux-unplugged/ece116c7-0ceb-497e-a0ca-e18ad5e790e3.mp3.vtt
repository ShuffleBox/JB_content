WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:03.400
Wes, you're not still using that filthy top, are you?

00:03.400 --> 00:04.440
Oh gosh, no.

00:04.440 --> 00:06.000
Basic top?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.520
Age top, come on, at least.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.720
Maybe back in the 80s.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.760
Well, Wes, I wanna introduce you to Vtop.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.600
Vtop.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.020
Yeah, it's got all the top.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.000
It looks so good.

00:14.000 --> 00:14.980
Now, it's a little heavy,

00:14.980 --> 00:17.360
but it's probably in your local package manager,

00:17.360 --> 00:18.760
or you can install with npm.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.360
It's a graphical activity monitor for the command line.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.480
It's pretty slick, dude.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.080
If you have npm, you can just do npm install-g vtop,

00:26.080 --> 00:27.920
but I installed it right here on my machine.

00:27.920 --> 00:28.760
Yeah, you did.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.040
I don't got a lot going on right now,

00:30.040 --> 00:32.420
but you can go through the different processes.

00:32.420 --> 00:33.620
You can look at your memory usage.

00:33.620 --> 00:36.640
You get a real-time graphical representation of your CPU.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.080
It's pretty cool.

00:38.080 --> 00:38.920
Not bad.

00:38.920 --> 00:39.760
Yeah, look at this.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.520
Things are, jeez, Chrome, man.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.440
Chrome's got 34 threads going right now.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.960
It's using 33.9% of my system's RAM.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.000
You know how all a computer is as a web browser these days.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 203, for July 11th, 2017.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

00:59.000 --> 01:01.480
that's installing and upgrading distributions

01:01.480 --> 01:03.360
like some kind of maniac.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.200
My name is Chris.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.040
My name is Wes.

01:05.040 --> 01:05.880
Hello, Wes.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.700
Hello, sir.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.400
Very excited about today's show.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.680
Any day that we get to cover a new big distribution release

01:11.680 --> 01:12.920
is a good day.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.800
Fedora 26, coming to Linux Unplugged.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.640
I'm Chris.

01:16.640 --> 01:17.480
I'm Wes.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.300
Hello, Wes.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.140
Hello, sir.

01:19.140 --> 01:20.440
Very excited about today's show.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.760
Any day that we get to cover a new big distribution release

01:23.760 --> 01:26.880
is a good day, Fedora 26 is here.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.760
It was released this morning, and we've

01:28.760 --> 01:31.600
been installing it on systems all day long.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.320
Not even our own systems, whoops.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.160
I know.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.520
Wait, whoops, uh-oh.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.880
And Matt from the Fedora Project will join us

01:38.880 --> 01:41.920
to cover the new release and explain why we maybe

01:41.920 --> 01:44.520
accidentally installed it on his laptop.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.360
Sorry, sorry about that.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.180
It's our bad.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.020
Sorry about that.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.360
Also, we've got a bunch of great community news,

01:48.360 --> 01:50.640
everything from some Ubuntu shenanigans

01:50.640 --> 01:53.480
to new software projects that we think are super cool.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.280
And updates coming for you Steam users that are,

01:57.280 --> 02:00.520
I don't know, you might say many, many years overdue.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.200
Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous to talk about that.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.000
Then we're also gonna get geeky with NF tables.

02:06.000 --> 02:06.840
Oh, sorry.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.120
Not to confuse you with NFS.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.760
I'm talking about NF tables, the replacement for IP tables.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.160
It's been billed as a performant alternative,

02:15.160 --> 02:17.840
the next generation IP tables.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.720
But has that really been tested?

02:20.720 --> 02:24.540
It looks like a Red Hat engineer took it to the benchmark.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.640
We're gonna talk about some testing that he did

02:27.640 --> 02:31.300
to really throw both NF tables and IP tables

02:31.300 --> 02:33.700
through the wrenches and see how the performance

02:33.700 --> 02:35.720
were different, see where one may perform better.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.840
It's actually very fascinating.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.440
There's a lot of details in there.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.960
Yeah, you found a good one this week, Wes,

02:39.960 --> 02:41.600
so we'll talk about that too.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.980
But we sort of have to get to something

02:43.980 --> 02:44.820
right off the top here.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.600
We've gotta bring in the Mumble Room.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:49.000 --> 02:49.840
Greetings.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.680
Hello.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.520
Good to see you.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.340
Greetings.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.480
Hello, hello, hello, and a special hello

02:54.480 --> 02:55.320
to Matt from Fedora.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.640
Hey, Matt.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.120
Hi there, glad to be here.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.440
Sir, it is always good to welcome you back to the show.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.440
I always love talking to you.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.560
So Matthew Miller is the Fedora project leader.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.020
He's been on the show for the last couple of releases

03:08.020 --> 03:09.960
of Fedora just about here or there.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.280
And today is Fedora 26's release day

03:13.280 --> 03:15.440
with lots of things that are obviously coming

03:15.440 --> 03:17.720
into Fedora 26 from upstream.

03:17.720 --> 03:22.680
The new development tools like GCC 7, Golang 1.8, Python 3.6,

03:22.680 --> 03:26.800
new partitioning tool in Anaconda, the installer.

03:26.800 --> 03:33.800
Also, there is the new LX cute version of the spin.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.720
It's got Kernel 4.11.8, ships with Gnome 3.24,

03:37.720 --> 03:39.260
and all of its new fancy features.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.320
LibreOffice 5.3, Fedora MediaWriter

03:42.320 --> 03:44.120
has gained ARM support.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.800
So if you want to write the Raspberry Pi versions,

03:46.800 --> 03:49.920
Builder now supports things like Flatpak and Rust.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.400
And the cute Odwadia theme has gotten lots of improvements

03:53.400 --> 03:55.240
to make it match the GTK version, including

03:55.240 --> 03:57.240
support for dark mode.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.080
I mean, this is sounding like a great release, Matt.

04:00.080 --> 04:04.320
Have I missed anything that's your favorite new feature?

04:04.320 --> 04:05.680
So one thing I think is pretty neat

04:05.680 --> 04:09.000
is we have a new Python classroom spin.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.480
So one of the things we do, it's actually a lab.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.400
We've divided things up into spins and labs now.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.880
Spins are desktop environments, and the labs

04:16.880 --> 04:19.160
are kind of use-focused things.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.880
So the Python lab, it's basically a classroom

04:22.880 --> 04:25.680
environment in a vagrant box or a Docker container

04:25.680 --> 04:29.240
or a life USB stick that is basically pre-set up

04:29.240 --> 04:32.220
to get your classroom ready to go to teach Python

04:32.220 --> 04:34.680
or a bunch of scientific computing things

04:34.680 --> 04:35.720
based around Python.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.280
Oh, wow.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.580
That's really, I could definitely

04:38.580 --> 04:40.360
see that in a classroom somewhere.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.960
Yeah, and I really like this because as a project,

04:43.960 --> 04:46.440
we've been looking a little bit at our mission

04:46.440 --> 04:50.200
and what we want to do, what makes Fedora unique and special.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.840
And we came up with a new mission statement, which I

04:52.840 --> 04:57.760
cannot say off the top of my head, although it is, yeah.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.920
But the basic idea is we build a platform that

05:01.920 --> 05:04.600
enables our contributors and other software

05:04.600 --> 05:07.120
to make solutions for users.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.800
And so this is a great example of here's

05:08.800 --> 05:10.640
some things that some contributors did.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.000
This wasn't a top-down, let's make a Python thing.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.880
But some people who are involved in Fedora wanted to do this.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.400
And we provide the tooling and stuff to make a kit like that.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.600
And I'd like to see a lot more of those kind of things

05:23.600 --> 05:25.520
for special use cases.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.920
So there's a few things that have

05:26.920 --> 05:30.760
sort of been on the ancillary edges of this release that

05:30.760 --> 05:32.680
have also gotten my attention.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.100
And so what I thought we would do

05:34.100 --> 05:35.720
is maybe talk about a couple of things

05:35.720 --> 05:37.680
that the Fedora project is working on.

05:37.680 --> 05:41.920
And then sort of the second half of this would be our take

05:41.920 --> 05:45.400
on the release, because both Wes and I have had a chance

05:45.400 --> 05:46.160
to kick the tires.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.680
And I've had this long-running Digital Ocean Droplet

05:49.680 --> 05:54.160
instance since either Fedora 24 or 23

05:54.160 --> 05:56.120
that I've been upgrading every single release.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.120
And I run a couple of Docker containers on here,

05:58.120 --> 05:59.760
and I manage it with Cockpit.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.960
And it's sort of been my, how long can you run a Fedora server

06:02.960 --> 06:04.320
and not have it break?

06:04.320 --> 06:07.240
And so I completed that upgrade before the show.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.920
And did my testing on it.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.000
So I'll give you my report on that as well.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.960
But not to take away attention from the release of Fedora 26,

06:14.960 --> 06:16.440
but I always love to do this to you.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.320
I noticed something about future releases

06:18.320 --> 06:19.980
that really got my attention.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.120
And I don't really even know how to put this right.

06:22.120 --> 06:26.560
But it looks like Rawhide is seeing a shift as of about

06:26.560 --> 06:31.840
right now, where essentially it sounds like Rawhide will be more

06:31.840 --> 06:33.680
like a rolling release that you intend people

06:33.680 --> 06:36.080
to use as a daily driver.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.040
I quote directly from the wiki, it

06:38.040 --> 06:39.500
will be generally useful to people

06:39.500 --> 06:41.920
to use as a daily driver and a development platform

06:41.920 --> 06:43.000
and means we no longer need to go

06:43.000 --> 06:45.300
through the process of building, testing, and shipping

06:45.300 --> 06:46.120
alpha releases.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.800
And the entry on the wiki is no more alpha

06:49.800 --> 06:50.840
for the Fedora project.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.320
What's going on here, Matt?

06:52.320 --> 06:53.760
Yeah, that's the plan.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.960
I mean, this is part of an overall push

06:55.960 --> 06:58.440
we have for more automated testing.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.960
This is more validation testing rather than continuous

07:01.960 --> 07:03.840
integration testing, which happens kind of more

07:03.840 --> 07:05.200
the developer side.

07:05.200 --> 07:10.440
But basically, Adam Williamson, who's one of our top QA people,

07:10.440 --> 07:15.320
has been working with the SUSE thing, the open QA tool,

07:15.320 --> 07:17.320
to set up a lot of automated tests.

07:17.320 --> 07:19.760
Basically, all of the basic tests

07:19.760 --> 07:22.000
that we've previously always done by hand

07:22.000 --> 07:23.680
to make sure the alpha was ready,

07:23.680 --> 07:27.520
those are basically imported as automated tests already.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.800
So basically, there's the changes to make those gating

07:32.800 --> 07:37.840
and so that automatic raw hide basically happens.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.600
Something like an alpha happens every night,

07:40.600 --> 07:42.360
assuming all the tests pass.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.160
And so essentially, the raw hide system

07:45.160 --> 07:48.240
is running through open SUSE QA?

07:48.240 --> 07:52.920
Yeah, through the open QA thing that open SUSE made, yeah.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.960
And so yeah, there's kind of two advantages.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.040
The one advantage is that we can get more people using it.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.040
I think it might be a little bit ambitious to say

08:02.040 --> 08:05.400
this is like our rolling release because it's

08:05.400 --> 08:06.680
still going to change a lot.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.040
And I think that if you want to use this,

08:08.040 --> 08:09.880
you've got to be willing to be like, well,

08:09.880 --> 08:11.320
my system broke this afternoon.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.840
I wonder what wasn't getting tested.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.160
This should have been getting tested.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.440
Very good to know.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.880
Yeah, definitely.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.960
But if you enjoy that kind of thing, I think it will be good.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.480
And we do have a number of people

08:21.480 --> 08:25.640
who are running raw hide already, as it is right now.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.040
And generally, that kind of thing

08:28.040 --> 08:31.000
happens maybe once a season or so.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.280
So it's not that bad of a risk.

08:33.280 --> 08:38.840
But if we can reduce that so you can maybe roll back or have

08:38.840 --> 08:40.720
something a little bit better.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.880
So that's one benefit.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.760
And the other benefit is basically

08:43.760 --> 08:47.680
that every time we put out a release, that is a lot of work.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.520
And that's one of the reasons distributions

08:49.520 --> 08:51.280
like rolling releases because it's like,

08:51.280 --> 08:54.480
what else could we do if we skipped all that trouble

08:54.480 --> 08:58.480
we were doing making releases and just did stuff?

08:58.480 --> 09:02.360
So removing alphas is a way of removing some amount of work.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.840
And with the automated testing, we're

09:03.840 --> 09:05.680
feeling pretty confident that we can do that

09:05.680 --> 09:08.480
without negative impact on the project.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.520
Right, and it would seem to me that if raw hide is getting

09:12.520 --> 09:14.320
continuously ran through automated QA,

09:14.320 --> 09:16.680
that it would probably raise the average quality of it,

09:16.680 --> 09:18.680
which would probably make average releases quality

09:18.680 --> 09:19.320
better.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.400
Exactly, exactly.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.960
And yeah, one of the problems we ran into in this last release

09:22.960 --> 09:25.120
is that some of the things came down

09:25.120 --> 09:28.600
to tests that hadn't been done for a while

09:28.600 --> 09:31.360
and they were just done on the last day before the release.

09:31.360 --> 09:34.680
Then we're like, oh, look, virtualization on AMD

09:34.680 --> 09:35.920
is broken.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.720
So then we had to trace down that bug

09:37.720 --> 09:39.280
like all at the last minute.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.320
And so if we have automated tests running all those things

09:42.320 --> 09:45.520
all the time, we can catch them long before they become

09:45.520 --> 09:46.080
a crisis.

09:46.080 --> 09:47.240
Sure, yeah, that makes sense.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.480
I guess so, oh, hi there.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.680
So my little playback there, a little echo back,

09:52.680 --> 09:54.320
but now it's gone.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.720
My follow-up question to that would

09:55.720 --> 09:57.440
be, could you share any of the background

09:57.440 --> 10:02.080
on how the Fedora project began working with the open QA

10:02.080 --> 10:03.200
project from OpenSUSE?

10:03.200 --> 10:06.880
I'm just curious, was there an event and you guys shook hands?

10:06.880 --> 10:09.000
They're like, hey, let me show you what we're doing.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.680
And you guys went, hmm, we could really use that.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.440
How did that process initiate?

10:17.120 --> 10:19.840
I'm not quite sure for this one, but a lot of stuff

10:19.840 --> 10:21.920
happens at conferences like FOSADEM and things

10:21.920 --> 10:24.400
where people get together in the distro dev room

10:24.400 --> 10:26.040
and people show off their stuff.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.840
I think that actually may be the genesis

10:27.840 --> 10:32.000
of this particular thing, but I'm not quite sure.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.760
It might just be us looking around.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.240
A lot of people in the project like

10:35.240 --> 10:37.600
to look and see what cool things other distros are doing.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.440
And it's all open source, so we take advantage of it

10:40.440 --> 10:41.040
where we can.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.440
I think it's actually pretty cool.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.640
It shows an open-mindedness.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.560
Definitely, and we've talked a lot about open QA

10:45.560 --> 10:47.280
here on this show, but haven't necessarily

10:47.280 --> 10:49.320
seen the kind of adoption that we thought might make sense.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.320
So this really bolsters, I think, both projects.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.040
So Rawhide is going in an interesting direction

10:55.040 --> 10:56.400
if things continue.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.200
Is there a trend line here, or is this

10:58.200 --> 10:59.880
just sort of the next evolution and what's

10:59.880 --> 11:00.920
going to stay here for a bit?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.800
And the question, really, what I'm asking is,

11:02.800 --> 11:05.240
are we trending towards a Fedora rolling,

11:05.240 --> 11:09.040
or is this not really likely the end goal of what Rawhide's

11:09.040 --> 11:10.280
to become?

11:10.280 --> 11:12.200
Yeah, so I think I said this on here before.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.680
I've got strong opinions about rolling releases,

11:14.680 --> 11:18.240
and that is there's sort of two people that rolling releases

11:18.240 --> 11:21.120
benefit, and one is enthusiast people

11:21.120 --> 11:23.200
who want the latest of everything

11:23.200 --> 11:25.880
and just don't mind waking up to a surprise,

11:25.880 --> 11:28.240
and now all of the buttons on my screen have moved around,

11:28.240 --> 11:30.360
and hey, it's innovation.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.120
That's one demographic, and that's probably

11:32.120 --> 11:33.440
a lot of your listeners, right?

11:33.440 --> 11:34.040
I don't know.

11:34.040 --> 11:34.600
I don't know.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.400
I can also sympathize with that to some degree.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.280
It can be kind of fun.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.640
I'm getting some new stuff for its own sake.

11:41.640 --> 11:47.520
And the other one is basically the distro themselves,

11:47.520 --> 11:49.160
because it's a lot less work.

11:49.160 --> 11:53.080
But from a user point of view, I think having real releases

11:53.080 --> 11:57.000
is actually a lot better, because in any distribution,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.880
there's just a whole bunch of change,

11:58.880 --> 12:01.280
and you can test to make sure things aren't awful

12:01.280 --> 12:05.160
and don't crash, but you can't test for that thing easily

12:05.160 --> 12:08.320
for the UI changed in this, or now that program's gone.

12:08.320 --> 12:12.120
And so with a rolling release, you need something to target.

12:12.120 --> 12:12.640
Right.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.280
And with a rolling release, you get that basically

12:15.280 --> 12:18.240
whenever the distro developers put it in there,

12:18.240 --> 12:20.320
and then you get it, or else.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.200
And if you decide to not, you then don't get security updates,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.160
because that's the idea, basically.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.560
You take it or you don't.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.520
Yeah, makes sense.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.680
So I think releases are better, because it

12:30.680 --> 12:35.280
lets you have a window when you can decide, OK, this Thursday,

12:35.280 --> 12:38.360
I'm going to maybe have to relearn how my menus work,

12:38.360 --> 12:40.600
because I'm going to the new version.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.920
So I think there's always a bunch of pain as change happens.

12:44.920 --> 12:45.880
Change is pain.

12:45.880 --> 12:49.160
That's one of those life-truth things.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.920
And I think our model of releases

12:50.920 --> 12:53.520
helps users manage that.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.400
So I think we probably always want

12:55.400 --> 12:56.960
to keep that to some degree.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.640
Makes sense.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.760
So let me ask you about another forward-looking thing

12:59.760 --> 13:01.200
that I saw during this release.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.840
And I don't know if I'm saying the name right,

13:02.840 --> 13:04.960
because I've never heard anybody say it out loud before.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.600
Fedora 26 Boltron server?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.320
Or Boltron?

13:08.320 --> 13:09.120
Boltron.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.760
It's like Voltron bolted together, right?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.080
I don't know.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.320
I was thinking that.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.400
There's a nerd joke in there somewhere.

13:16.400 --> 13:20.160
Yeah, so this is actually very related to that.

13:20.160 --> 13:25.200
Because the basic problem people have in an operating system

13:25.200 --> 13:27.000
and a distribution overall is stuff

13:27.000 --> 13:28.720
moving too fast or too slow.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.200
And the rolling release basically

13:30.200 --> 13:33.080
says everything's going to move fast.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.400
And a LTS says everything's going to move slow.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.040
And generally, nobody's happy with either one of those things

13:40.040 --> 13:41.400
and you want something else.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.120
So this basically lets us separate the hardware

13:44.120 --> 13:47.880
enablement in the operating system from your applications

13:47.880 --> 13:50.360
and have different streams where those things can actually

13:50.360 --> 13:51.920
move at different speeds.

13:51.920 --> 13:56.800
So you could, say, have basically a Ruby version

13:56.800 --> 13:58.320
that you keep at the same version

13:58.320 --> 14:00.440
even as you upgrade the base underneath it

14:00.440 --> 14:01.680
and that kind of thing.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.280
How is that accomplished?

14:04.280 --> 14:06.520
There's a crazy thing called module build service.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.120
You basically define a module, which

14:09.120 --> 14:13.120
is a collection of packages, and then say, OK,

14:13.120 --> 14:14.520
build this against this build root.

14:14.520 --> 14:19.400
And then that's built against basically every new base

14:19.400 --> 14:20.560
operating systems out.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.160
We're making this stuff up right now.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.480
So check out Boltron and see a little bit how

14:24.480 --> 14:25.960
it's going to be accomplished.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.760
But if it's successful, it's going

14:27.760 --> 14:31.760
to be a big shift in how we make the distribution.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.840
Right now, we're focused on I'm making

14:33.840 --> 14:37.640
this package for Fedora 26, this package for Fedora 25.

14:37.640 --> 14:41.280
In the future, if this works out, you'll focus on,

14:41.280 --> 14:44.520
I'm making, say, the latest stream of this package

14:44.520 --> 14:47.520
or the stable stream of this package or the version 1

14:47.520 --> 14:49.360
stream and the version 2 stream.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.360
And then you build that stream across all

14:51.360 --> 14:54.920
of the underlying base OSes that we produce.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.520
This sounds like a feature that must

14:57.520 --> 15:00.200
have come from application developer feedback

15:00.200 --> 15:02.640
or enterprise customer somewhere.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.260
What's the background there?

15:04.260 --> 15:05.640
Yeah, well, honestly, it's something

15:05.640 --> 15:06.640
I've been thinking about.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.360
I've been working on Linux distributions

15:08.360 --> 15:11.960
for like 17 years now.

15:11.960 --> 15:15.320
So it's kind of been the thing I've been hearing from users

15:15.320 --> 15:16.040
all the time.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.160
This is the pain I have.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.200
So we wanted to try and address that pain.

15:20.200 --> 15:25.000
So this is one stab at doing that, basically.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.120
It really got my attention.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.600
It sounds like a really cool idea.

15:27.600 --> 15:31.080
And there's been a background debate recently

15:31.080 --> 15:33.240
about new distributions that are coming up

15:33.240 --> 15:36.040
by hardware manufacturers, both Tuxedo and System76.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.200
And one of the arguments that both of them

15:38.200 --> 15:42.920
has put forward is the LTS is too slow for us.

15:42.920 --> 15:46.640
And we have customers that have problems.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.480
And the solution to these problems

15:48.480 --> 15:52.600
is to replace maybe its NGINX, or its PHP,

15:52.600 --> 15:55.720
or it's the SQL server, or it's even the DHCP client

15:55.720 --> 15:57.360
on that server to fix this problem.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.960
And we end up getting in this weird position of trying

15:59.960 --> 16:02.240
to decide if we package that up ourselves

16:02.240 --> 16:04.960
and slip it in as a PPA, or how to evenly manage this.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.200
And it gets to a point where it's, well, screw it.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.320
Let's just ship our own OS, where

16:08.320 --> 16:10.160
we can manage the package releases ourselves.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.720
And this could sort of solve that problem.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.000
Yeah, that's exactly the idea.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.480
And the problem with the screw it,

16:15.480 --> 16:16.840
or we're going to do it ourselves approach,

16:16.840 --> 16:19.040
is that now you've created something that's

16:19.040 --> 16:21.400
yet another thing that fits only one use case, right?

16:21.400 --> 16:22.760
And then some of your customers are

16:22.760 --> 16:25.960
going to have a different use case, and they're out of luck.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, that's a good point.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.520
So my kind of last question is just really self-serving.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.320
But we're sort of at an interesting point

16:33.320 --> 16:35.880
here in studio about what we're considering using

16:35.880 --> 16:37.960
for our production distro.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.480
And Fedora is on my mind.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.240
To be honest with you, my only question

16:42.240 --> 16:48.200
is, what would be the right spin for somebody

16:48.200 --> 16:51.040
who wants an extremely, or spin, or whatever

16:51.040 --> 16:52.840
their terminology is, for somebody who wants,

16:52.840 --> 16:55.840
essentially, a bulletproof workstation that's

16:55.840 --> 16:56.800
Fedora-based, though?

16:56.800 --> 16:59.260
See, when I think of Fedora, I think of a great workstation,

16:59.260 --> 17:02.880
except for these are five, six-year systems

17:02.880 --> 17:04.720
that I'd like to have running.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.000
But CentOS moves too slow for me.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.320
What is the solution in the Fedora world for this problem?

17:12.320 --> 17:15.080
Well, so our main solution is that we've

17:15.080 --> 17:17.880
tried to work on making upgrades less painful for you,

17:17.880 --> 17:20.440
so that we don't have a five, six-year solution.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.960
But basically, they've put a lot of engineering

17:22.960 --> 17:26.040
into making sure that every upgrade goes smoothly,

17:26.040 --> 17:28.680
and so that you go from one release to the next,

17:28.680 --> 17:31.880
and your pain is minimized in doing that.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.080
This is, again, like I often get the,

17:34.080 --> 17:37.000
you should make a roll-on release, or an LTS,

17:37.000 --> 17:40.180
and since those things are opposite ends of the spectrum,

17:40.180 --> 17:41.980
when I dig into it, I often hear,

17:41.980 --> 17:45.080
well, I don't wanna do that upgrade, it's so painful.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.800
So, we've worked on making the upgrades less painful.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.000
So, yeah, upgrades to Fedora 25, 26,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.080
both on all of my systems, have been half-hour affairs.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.480
I started it, went and got some coffee, came back,

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
and then I was like, oh, there we go.

17:58.480 --> 18:01.520
And I think, especially for a workstation,

18:01.520 --> 18:04.160
as GNOME has kind of settled down with GNOME 3

18:04.160 --> 18:06.420
into a nice, comfortable environment,

18:06.420 --> 18:08.520
they've got a lot of the rough edges

18:08.520 --> 18:10.780
from the initial release sort of polished.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.980
And basically, it's kind of increasing polish

18:13.980 --> 18:17.240
instead of disruptive change every release.

18:17.240 --> 18:21.380
Like, back in the first couple of GNOME 3 releases,

18:21.380 --> 18:24.220
not only was GNOME 3 itself kind of shocking,

18:24.220 --> 18:27.280
every point release was also, oh my goodness,

18:27.280 --> 18:28.680
everything's new again.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.800
Or there was GDK breakage.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.640
Right.

18:32.640 --> 18:33.460
Right.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.300
Yeah.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.400
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

18:35.400 --> 18:40.400
And I feel like that's a really solid answer for the server.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.920
I'll just cover really, really briefly to just cover it.

18:46.280 --> 18:51.280
My Fedora 26 server right now running on DigitalOcean is,

18:52.200 --> 18:55.640
I think it's either from Fedora 23 or Fedora 24.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.560
And it's a Fedora server install

18:58.560 --> 19:01.680
that I then installed, or cockpit was installed,

19:01.680 --> 19:02.880
and I installed several droplets,

19:02.880 --> 19:05.000
one of them a Nextcloud instance,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.320
one of them a Plex server and an MB instance.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.240
So I have both those running different containers.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.800
And I've been chugging along with the upgrade releases

19:13.800 --> 19:17.720
on day one of Fedora releases, which, you know,

19:17.720 --> 19:18.560
I'm gonna say is-

19:18.560 --> 19:19.520
That's kind of unheard of for you.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.760
Well, I mean, you know, if you're not in a rush,

19:22.760 --> 19:24.440
go ahead, give it a couple days, let it sit, you know?

19:24.440 --> 19:27.280
But I, nope, because I've been wanting to talk about it.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.480
And sure enough, if not a single thing's broken yet,

19:30.480 --> 19:32.600
the thing is still running today.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.160
I mean, there's nothing really to report.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.480
The upgrade went totally smooth.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.680
It's actually, the process is,

19:39.680 --> 19:41.360
it's actually pretty good.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.280
And Matt, are you the one that writes up

19:43.280 --> 19:45.560
the upgrade posts every release?

19:45.560 --> 19:49.640
Cause these are always easy to find and straight forward.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.160
No, I think Justin Flory wrote those, they're very nice.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.440
Oh yeah, Justin, yeah, I see that, yeah.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.240
And it's just a simple process.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.960
It goes through, it's really easy to do it through the GUI,

19:57.960 --> 19:59.160
but of course I'm doing it on a server.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.920
So I always use the different DNF commands.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.560
And I'm always pleasantly surprised at how clear DNF is

20:05.560 --> 20:06.400
and how safe it is.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.960
It does all the downloads, it does all the checks.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.680
Then you tell it to do a DNF system dash upgrade reboot.

20:12.680 --> 20:15.560
It reboots into the kernel of the current,

20:15.560 --> 20:17.520
of the, you know, the release you're upgrading from,

20:17.520 --> 20:20.040
installs all the packages, verifies everything,

20:20.040 --> 20:22.880
does another reboot now into the new kernel, and you're done.

20:22.880 --> 20:23.720
Bob's your uncle.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.640
Everything's, your cockpit's running again,

20:25.640 --> 20:28.480
your containers are back up and running.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.600
That's the one thing that really stood out to me.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.320
It's like, with that DNF in general,

20:31.320 --> 20:32.960
it seems like it's very, it's been thought out,

20:32.960 --> 20:35.440
it's well-founded, I can trust it a little bit more

20:35.440 --> 20:37.000
than maybe some of the competing package managers.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.200
Yeah, so it's funny, you know, people don't,

20:39.200 --> 20:40.040
I don't think can, you know,

20:40.040 --> 20:42.480
normally think of maybe Fedora on their VPS,

20:42.480 --> 20:43.880
but I'll tell you, it's been working solid for me.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.800
But I don't know if that's gonna hold true, Matt,

20:45.800 --> 20:49.240
if you're somebody who has maybe RPM fusion set up,

20:49.240 --> 20:50.960
or you have, I don't know,

20:50.960 --> 20:52.720
something outside the Fedora repos,

20:52.720 --> 20:54.600
or maybe you have the Nvidia graphics driver.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.560
Isn't it then not exactly as smooth?

20:57.440 --> 20:58.920
Yeah, I mean, that's always hard,

20:58.920 --> 21:00.520
because we're dependent on other people

21:00.520 --> 21:01.600
for those kind of things.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.520
And, you know, some of those third-party repos

21:03.520 --> 21:07.400
package things that we can't even talk about,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.200
so that makes the situation difficult.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.600
Oh, yeah.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.120
So, yeah, so that can definitely be a problem.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.600
I know that some of them had problems in the past

21:16.600 --> 21:19.600
that they are doing better with.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.880
We're also, the workstation team is working

21:21.880 --> 21:25.880
on building some relationships with Nvidia

21:25.880 --> 21:29.040
and with some of the third-party repo providers,

21:29.040 --> 21:32.360
where we can't point to, for legal reasons,

21:32.360 --> 21:33.920
basically to a third-party repository

21:33.920 --> 21:35.720
that has arbitrary things,

21:35.720 --> 21:37.520
but we might be able to point to a repository

21:37.520 --> 21:40.000
that has just a specific thing

21:40.000 --> 21:42.440
that we know is okay for us to point to,

21:42.440 --> 21:44.760
something that we wouldn't include in Fedora

21:44.760 --> 21:47.080
for, you know, it's not free software.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.720
We're never gonna include not free software

21:48.720 --> 21:50.000
in Fedora directly,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.200
but we know people need to make their hardware work,

21:52.200 --> 21:54.840
so we would like to make it easy

21:54.840 --> 21:56.880
to enable those kind of things,

21:56.880 --> 21:59.560
or something that, whatever other reason,

21:59.560 --> 22:00.800
isn't packaged in Fedora,

22:00.800 --> 22:02.360
but we wanna make it available to people.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.360
You know, so there was a post recently

22:04.360 --> 22:06.400
about some future projects that Fedora's working.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.880
In fact, even in the release notes,

22:07.880 --> 22:10.560
or the release post on Fedora Magazine for 26,

22:10.560 --> 22:11.840
there's sort of an inference in there

22:11.840 --> 22:15.320
about some things that are coming down the pipe wire,

22:15.320 --> 22:17.280
if you will, the pipe wire.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.640
Can we, if you have just a minute,

22:18.640 --> 22:20.240
I'm gonna take a minute and I'm gonna mention

22:20.240 --> 22:21.520
our first sponsor, and then that'll be

22:21.520 --> 22:23.160
pretty much my last question for you for the day,

22:23.160 --> 22:24.760
and then we'll let you get out of here.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.880
Everybody head over to linux.ting.com,

22:26.880 --> 22:29.880
support the show, and get a great deal on mobile

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
the way it should work.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.800
They'll give you a $25 service credit

22:32.800 --> 22:34.040
if you bring a device,

22:34.040 --> 22:35.680
and they have CDMA and GSM network,

22:35.680 --> 22:37.840
so the compatibility factor is high,

22:37.840 --> 22:39.680
check their BYOD page,

22:39.680 --> 22:40.920
or if you need a new one,

22:40.920 --> 22:42.920
they'll give you $25 off the device.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.200
I mention this because it's really

22:44.200 --> 22:45.760
a smarter way to do mobile.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.400
It's so simple, it's how things would go

22:48.400 --> 22:50.240
if the wireless industry had to reboot today

22:50.240 --> 22:51.200
and be competitive.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.880
It's $6 for a line,

22:52.880 --> 22:55.520
you choose whether you want CDMA or GSM,

22:55.520 --> 22:56.840
which is super nice,

22:56.840 --> 22:58.200
you can bring an unlocked device

22:58.200 --> 22:59.640
or buy one directly from them,

22:59.640 --> 23:01.200
and then you just pay for what you use.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.440
And with that, you get every feature you would expect,

23:03.440 --> 23:04.280
I mean, really great stuff,

23:04.280 --> 23:06.160
including hotspot and tethering.

23:06.160 --> 23:09.080
Ting doesn't have any agendas for you to be

23:09.080 --> 23:11.360
only using streaming at certain times of day

23:11.360 --> 23:12.840
when you use these certain providers,

23:12.840 --> 23:14.920
or else they're gonna, none of that,

23:14.920 --> 23:17.280
no re-encoding garbage.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.200
In fact, they're a pretty big supporter of net neutrality.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.240
They have no contracts, no determination fees,

23:21.240 --> 23:23.560
nationwide coverage, you just pay for what you use

23:23.560 --> 23:24.600
with a great dashboard.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.040
And they just recently posted a video

23:27.040 --> 23:29.480
about Ting's privacy policy,

23:29.480 --> 23:31.760
which, you know, I think is actually worth playing.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.240
I'll just play a brief moment of it here on the show

23:33.240 --> 23:34.480
because it might be something you're wondering

23:34.480 --> 23:35.960
if you're gonna become a Ting customer.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.080
It's kind of a legit question.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.880
Does Ting sell personal information?

23:40.880 --> 23:42.440
Ting does not sell personal information.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.600
Ting's parent company, Two Cows,

23:45.600 --> 23:49.440
has long been committed to protecting consumer privacy.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.200
We do not aggregate information, we do not sell it.

23:54.200 --> 23:58.280
And in fact, we actively advocate

23:58.280 --> 24:00.680
for consumer privacy protections

24:00.680 --> 24:02.600
at the legislative and regulatory levels.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.560
Can your wireless carrier say that?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.600
I don't know about that.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.920
Linux.ting.com, a big thank you to Ting

24:07.920 --> 24:09.880
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.560
Linux.ting.com.

24:12.560 --> 24:14.560
So I think Matt might have a roast in the oven

24:14.560 --> 24:16.440
after Run Soon, so I just, really kind of my,

24:16.440 --> 24:18.760
sort of my last question to you is,

24:18.760 --> 24:20.040
can we talk a little bit about the stuff

24:20.040 --> 24:21.560
in the incubator, like PipeWire?

24:21.560 --> 24:24.720
That has got my interest piqued,

24:24.720 --> 24:26.560
and I've seen a lot of people in our audience

24:26.560 --> 24:27.840
that are excited about PipeWire.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.080
These are like some crazy projects

24:29.080 --> 24:31.320
that are coming from you guys.

24:31.320 --> 24:34.920
Yeah, PipeWire is something from the desktop team

24:34.920 --> 24:36.800
and can own people.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.800
I'm not actually sure of all the details of that.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.520
You might wanna get Kristen Schaller on here sometime.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.760
He wrote that blog post.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.360
I can talk to him for you guys and get him

24:46.360 --> 24:47.200
to talk about some of those things.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.040
That would be awesome.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.040
I would really, I would love to.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.280
I'm sure he, I'm sure he would,

24:51.280 --> 24:52.840
I won't completely speak for him,

24:52.840 --> 24:54.600
but I'm pretty sure he'd love to do it as well.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.160
So I'll talk to him.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.000
Cool.

24:57.880 --> 25:02.600
Yeah, my thoughts are a lot more on

25:02.600 --> 25:04.160
how we put together the distro

25:04.160 --> 25:06.240
and what we're doing to make it

25:06.240 --> 25:07.720
rather than what's going into it.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.480
His thoughts are a lot more on what's going into it.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.480
Here's my meta question about it though.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.040
So why Fedora?

25:14.040 --> 25:16.360
I mean, like, there's so many things to be working on.

25:16.360 --> 25:19.760
Why are some of these things incubated in Fedora first?

25:19.760 --> 25:22.000
I guess I don't, I don't, I mean,

25:22.000 --> 25:23.360
I understand that everybody wants

25:23.360 --> 25:24.760
to make the experience better,

25:24.760 --> 25:27.920
but there's some mountains that some distributions

25:27.920 --> 25:29.440
don't ever seem to wanna take on.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.760
And then Fedora comes along and just sort of nonchalantly

25:31.760 --> 25:33.960
says, yeah, well, we're gonna replace

25:33.960 --> 25:36.400
the entire audio video pipeline on Linux,

25:36.400 --> 25:39.240
or we're gonna rework the way network management is handled,

25:39.240 --> 25:40.720
or, hey, you know what would be great

25:40.720 --> 25:43.000
is if we had this unified init system

25:43.000 --> 25:46.400
across all distributions, like there's this crazy,

25:46.400 --> 25:49.320
like nobody can do that kind of projects

25:49.320 --> 25:51.480
that get started over in your camp.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.400
And I don't, what is it?

25:53.400 --> 25:54.440
I mean, what is it, why?

25:54.440 --> 25:57.560
Yeah, it's foundational to what Fedora is.

25:57.560 --> 26:00.240
It's basically, it's one of our, you know,

26:00.240 --> 26:02.360
Fedora, we have these Fedora foundations,

26:02.360 --> 26:04.200
which are like the project values.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.880
So features is one of those things

26:06.880 --> 26:08.880
where we try and get all these things

26:08.880 --> 26:10.840
that are going to be the next generation of the operating

26:10.840 --> 26:12.720
system and get the new version of the software there.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.800
And we want to experiment with it first.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.760
So it's part of what we're here for.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.440
So it makes it a natural place for people

26:19.440 --> 26:20.880
who are interested in that kind of thing.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.120
So then it's sort of self-fulfilling

26:23.120 --> 26:24.040
because it attracts people

26:24.040 --> 26:25.840
who want to do those kinds of things.

26:25.840 --> 26:29.440
And also, you know, we've got a slant towards saying,

26:29.440 --> 26:31.000
yes, we're going to do that.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.040
Why the hell not?

26:34.040 --> 26:35.160
All right, well, you know, Matt,

26:35.160 --> 26:37.880
is there anything else you wanna add to all of this

26:37.880 --> 26:39.320
before we wrap it up with you?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.120
I don't think so.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.320
I think this has been great.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.880
I'm glad your upgrade went well.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.400
I was a little bit prepared for,

26:46.400 --> 26:48.400
and then everything horribly exploded.

26:48.400 --> 26:52.400
But no, in fact, I've heard just a lot of good things today.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.960
So that's, it's been a very successful,

26:54.960 --> 26:57.600
nice release day with very few fires.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.800
I mean, it seems like a release

26:58.800 --> 27:00.440
that's just got a lot of improvements

27:00.440 --> 27:01.280
and a lot of refinements.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.640
It's not anything that's dramatic, right?

27:03.640 --> 27:06.560
Yeah, I do have to say that the wallpaper

27:06.560 --> 27:08.680
is like the most beautiful Fedora wallpaper

27:08.680 --> 27:09.520
I've ever seen.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.280
And I'm lobbying to keep it for a couple of releases.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.160
It's so nice.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.440
It's surprising too, like how well it looks,

27:16.440 --> 27:18.640
like when you bring up like the applications menu,

27:18.640 --> 27:21.280
when you log, I logged into the Plasma desktop

27:21.280 --> 27:22.800
and it had that background on there

27:22.800 --> 27:26.760
and just the colors matched the menu bar so well, ugh.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.720
And also the shape there of the tree line

27:29.720 --> 27:31.400
is actually based on the wave form

27:31.400 --> 27:32.680
of somebody saying Fedora.

27:32.680 --> 27:35.320
So it's also super, super geeky.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.160
That's awesome.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.200
I have to endorse.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.080
I'm really, I really appreciate you saying that

27:39.080 --> 27:40.680
because the first time I saw it, I thought,

27:40.680 --> 27:42.480
oh, that's a wave, oh no, those are trees.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.600
So that's awesome.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.200
I've seen a few wave forms in my day.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.720
And it was a nice example of collaborative design too,

27:48.720 --> 27:50.520
where the design group, which is, you know,

27:50.520 --> 27:52.720
a bunch of community people from all over the world

27:52.720 --> 27:55.160
kind of started with this idea of a wave form

27:55.160 --> 27:57.080
and then iterated on it till we came out with this.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.520
So I really love it.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.360
That is great.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.840
Yeah, so if you guys want to see that,

28:00.840 --> 28:03.640
either install Fedora or you can go check out

28:03.640 --> 28:06.240
the Fedora Magazine post where Matt went through

28:06.240 --> 28:07.080
the new release.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.600
Matt, thank you so much for coming on the show.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.720
It looks like a great release

28:09.720 --> 28:11.800
and I hope to hear from you soon.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.640
Yeah, thanks again.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.200
I'll love to talk to you again later.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.160
And I will talk to Christian,

28:15.160 --> 28:16.320
see if I can get him on your show for you.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.160
That would be awesome.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.000
Thank you.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.840
Love to chat with him.

28:18.840 --> 28:19.680
Have a good one.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.080
Cool, yep, bye.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.320
So I had a chance to also, like I was saying,

28:23.320 --> 28:24.880
kick the tires on the Plasma Edition,

28:24.880 --> 28:26.600
which is the first time I've ever done that.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.520
I've always, always gone gnome.

28:28.520 --> 28:29.400
Always have because, you know,

28:29.400 --> 28:31.240
it's just such an obvious solid gnome.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.080
It's Fedora.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.000
So I've just, just got started.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.120
But, you know, out of the box, it does look really,

28:36.120 --> 28:37.400
it looks really nice.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.240
It's definitely, it's got me thinking

28:40.240 --> 28:42.280
about some of the woes we've had here in the studio.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.280
And right now I have been leaning Ubuntu LTS

28:45.280 --> 28:49.560
with maybe like a OBS PPA or something like that.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.080
But now I'm just kind of wondering

28:51.080 --> 28:54.440
if I installed an OBS rig or Fedora 26 rig

28:54.440 --> 28:55.280
and tried to put OBS on there.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.160
What would that look like?

28:56.160 --> 28:57.000
Yeah.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.320
Hmm, I don't know.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.000
I think it might be worth trying.

29:00.000 --> 29:00.840
Because with all this stuff,

29:00.840 --> 29:02.120
like you've been playing a lot with Docker

29:02.120 --> 29:03.640
and we covered some of the stuff about running

29:03.640 --> 29:05.920
even X apps and system D containers.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.160
Like it seems like there's a lot of,

29:07.160 --> 29:10.480
maybe the application relative unavailability of Fedora

29:10.480 --> 29:11.800
that we sometimes talk about.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.160
Maybe that's less of a thing in this modern Linux world.

29:14.160 --> 29:15.000
Speaking of that, Minimac,

29:15.000 --> 29:16.800
you were saying that it's actually much better

29:16.800 --> 29:18.240
as far as like the community goes

29:18.240 --> 29:20.360
with keeping up with Fedora releases now.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.680
Yeah, it is definitely.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.040
For example, OBS Studio is available now

29:25.040 --> 29:27.240
on Fedora 26 on release day.

29:27.240 --> 29:32.120
The third party repositories are really available.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.920
Most of them, most of them.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.720
And it's always, I always surprise.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.960
You see, Chris, you're talking about a Fedora 26 server

29:38.960 --> 29:40.040
with Docker and everything.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.600
And I'm running that on the Chromebook

29:41.600 --> 29:43.680
with two gigs of RAM.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.760
And I have OBS Studio running here with my webcam

29:46.760 --> 29:47.680
and everything.

29:47.680 --> 29:48.760
I'm really surprised.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.360
That's a really good distribution.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.200
Really cool.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.020
Wow.

29:52.020 --> 29:52.860
Really cool.

29:52.860 --> 29:57.440
I'm thinking about quitting another distribution

29:57.440 --> 29:59.400
that shall not be named.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.400
Oh, yeah.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.360
It does seem to be, it's always nice to look.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.200
I mean, I'm gonna be honest.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.600
I've always been a bit of a hopper.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.240
I stayed on Arch for quite a while,

30:07.240 --> 30:10.520
but my hopper tendencies have been coming back recently,

30:10.520 --> 30:12.960
if I'm gonna be honest with you.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.280
You know, Mr. Wes, did you get a chance to try,

30:15.280 --> 30:16.120
before we go on?

30:16.120 --> 30:16.940
I didn't want to say anything else,

30:16.940 --> 30:18.600
but before we go on, are you running it right there?

30:18.600 --> 30:19.440
Oh, yeah.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.280
And you're running the GNOME version?

30:20.280 --> 30:21.120
I am.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.480
I would be, I'd be really interested

30:22.480 --> 30:23.320
to hear your thoughts,

30:23.320 --> 30:24.800
because I have not tried the GNOME one.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.960
You know, it's actually pretty slick.

30:25.960 --> 30:30.960
I hate the default theme a lot less than I normally do.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.760
Honestly, I just installed it.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.240
I've done no customization.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.080
It's pretty usable.

30:35.080 --> 30:35.900
I could use this for a while.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.800
Eventually, I would probably want ArcDark or whatever

30:37.800 --> 30:39.840
installed with a few little tweaks here and there,

30:39.840 --> 30:40.720
dash to dock, whatever.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.540
All the normal things, but right here, it's pretty nice.

30:43.540 --> 30:44.680
And I was very impressed with,

30:44.680 --> 30:46.400
they have a nice little welcome screen,

30:46.400 --> 30:47.320
kind of gets things set up.

30:47.320 --> 30:50.960
The GNOME software's improved a lot over the years,

30:50.960 --> 30:53.280
so that's like a decent experience,

30:53.280 --> 30:56.120
and I've almost always had some kind of problem

30:56.120 --> 30:56.960
with Anaconda.

30:56.960 --> 31:00.400
It's always been my least favorite of the common installers.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.080
This time, okay, first time, it crashed on me,

31:03.080 --> 31:04.920
and I just rebooted it and did it again,

31:04.920 --> 31:06.400
but that time, it worked perfectly.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.920
I have kind of a weird partitioning scheme,

31:07.920 --> 31:10.420
because there's already a couple OSs on here,

31:10.420 --> 31:12.080
and in the past, that's really caused problems.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.960
This time, nope, easy peasy.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.460
Yeah, yeah, and that's the new,

31:15.460 --> 31:17.760
Matt, are you still by the mic by chance?

31:17.760 --> 31:19.120
Because that's one thing we didn't mention,

31:19.120 --> 31:21.120
is there's a new partitioner in Anaconda

31:21.120 --> 31:23.760
if you do the custom partitioning setup.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.840
I am still here, yeah.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.320
Is there anything more to add to that?

31:27.320 --> 31:29.760
So what is, it's got a new name, or, I can't remember.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.120
Yeah, it's called Blivit GUI, which is, I don't know,

31:33.120 --> 31:35.120
another, some sort of in-joke of some sort.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.120
I actually would like it to be something

31:38.120 --> 31:40.320
a little more polished in the UI,

31:40.320 --> 31:43.460
but we'll get to that eventually.

31:43.460 --> 31:48.460
The basic thing is, when there's a big Anaconda rewrite,

31:48.460 --> 31:52.020
like in Fedora 17 or 18 or something like that,

31:52.020 --> 31:55.020
and it was based on a lot of the user studies

31:55.020 --> 31:56.820
on how people install systems,

31:56.820 --> 32:01.020
and the idea basically is, instead of telling it,

32:01.020 --> 32:02.820
I've got this disk and this disk,

32:02.820 --> 32:05.180
and I wanna make a partition on it in the logical volume,

32:05.180 --> 32:07.220
and then this and this and this, and building it up,

32:07.220 --> 32:10.140
you would say, I've got these disks,

32:10.140 --> 32:11.620
I would like redundancy,

32:11.620 --> 32:14.500
I would like a journaling file system, give it to me,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.260
and then it would determine your configuration from that,

32:17.260 --> 32:19.820
so it's kind of a top-down thing,

32:19.820 --> 32:23.660
and I think that's good, especially for people who,

32:23.660 --> 32:26.220
whom, when I say partitions and logical volumes,

32:26.220 --> 32:31.100
they kind of get a panic look, it's really great for that,

32:31.100 --> 32:34.580
but a lot of people have special cases

32:34.580 --> 32:36.140
that didn't feel that covered,

32:36.140 --> 32:39.460
or they definitely want to have partition,

32:39.460 --> 32:41.820
the first partition be home,

32:41.820 --> 32:43.040
because that's important to them,

32:43.040 --> 32:45.260
or they are just more comfortable

32:45.260 --> 32:47.300
doing the buildup kind of thing,

32:47.300 --> 32:49.380
and so those people have, for a long time,

32:49.380 --> 32:52.140
felt like the installer, Fedora installer,

32:52.140 --> 32:53.620
doesn't suit their needs,

32:53.620 --> 32:55.580
so this basically adds a third option

32:55.580 --> 32:59.020
that's kind of a true partition manager thing

32:59.020 --> 33:02.020
that can do a lot of very sophisticated things

33:02.020 --> 33:05.500
for a buildup from the bottom environment.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.300
On the other hand, you can,

33:07.300 --> 33:09.740
and I did several times in testing,

33:09.740 --> 33:12.080
make systems that will not boot that way,

33:12.080 --> 33:14.420
so it really is for, if you know what you're doing,

33:14.420 --> 33:16.280
this lets you do it.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.340
Yeah, I did play around with it a little bit,

33:17.340 --> 33:18.180
that definitely echoes,

33:18.180 --> 33:20.420
it seems, there's not a lot of hand-holding,

33:20.420 --> 33:22.260
but it is a lot more reminiscent of what you get

33:22.260 --> 33:23.520
in a lot of other installers,

33:23.520 --> 33:24.840
or even just something like, you know,

33:24.840 --> 33:25.680
gnome disks or gparted.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.020
And if you're going off in that neck of the woods,

33:27.020 --> 33:29.340
you probably, that's probably the tool you want.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.940
Yeah, it's like a power user escape hatch,

33:30.940 --> 33:32.040
which I think is actually pretty nice.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.260
I didn't use it ultimately to install my system,

33:34.260 --> 33:36.800
I went back to the standard custom solution,

33:36.800 --> 33:38.140
but it really, I think as it evolves,

33:38.140 --> 33:39.900
I'll be happy to use it.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.340
Yeah, and one of the UI problems we have a lot with that

33:42.340 --> 33:44.860
is our installer people discovered that

33:44.860 --> 33:47.180
if you have an advanced option,

33:47.180 --> 33:49.020
people will always pick it,

33:49.020 --> 33:51.400
even if it's going to make their life miserable.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.260
So we wanted to try and figure out

33:55.260 --> 33:58.940
how to freight it properly to get people steered,

33:58.940 --> 34:01.140
not to choose it if they didn't know what it was.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.700
So I'm possibly leaving it named blivet-gui

34:03.700 --> 34:05.860
is the right thing for that for now,

34:05.860 --> 34:07.220
but we'll figure that out.

34:09.100 --> 34:11.200
I, it's a pretty, like I said,

34:11.200 --> 34:13.100
it's a nice solid release

34:13.100 --> 34:14.680
with tons of new stuff from upstream,

34:14.680 --> 34:16.420
cause I mean, just bringing in that new gnome release

34:16.420 --> 34:18.980
and then, and now also the new plasma release

34:18.980 --> 34:21.300
and then when Anaconda gets some nice improvements,

34:21.300 --> 34:24.420
it's just check, it's worth checking out for door 26.

34:24.420 --> 34:26.740
And if you're crazy like me,

34:26.740 --> 34:30.820
it's also very deployable on your digital ocean droplet.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.240
If you go to digital ocean right now,

34:32.240 --> 34:36.020
create an account and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED,

34:36.020 --> 34:38.000
apply that to your account and you'll get a $10 credit.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.500
Now at the moment it's fedora 25

34:40.500 --> 34:42.900
is what's deployable on digital ocean.

34:42.900 --> 34:45.540
However, I just did it a little bit during the show.

34:45.540 --> 34:49.740
I spun up a 25 instance and I upgraded it to fedora 26,

34:49.740 --> 34:51.600
just clean install, worked flawlessly.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.420
So if you want to run that, you can also do that too.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.620
It's all, I'll link to, in the show notes,

34:55.620 --> 34:56.940
I have a link to how to upgrade

34:56.940 --> 34:59.140
from fedora 25 to fedora 26.

34:59.140 --> 35:02.860
I've been, I have a droplet now on this, on digital ocean.

35:02.860 --> 35:05.340
It's four years old.

35:05.340 --> 35:06.180
Wow.

35:06.180 --> 35:08.860
I did not realize I've been using digital ocean that long.

35:08.860 --> 35:11.460
Four years, it's an arch box.

35:11.460 --> 35:12.300
It's an arch zone.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.020
Good work, you've been doing your updates.

35:14.020 --> 35:16.340
I've been keeping on, I've been keeping on.

35:16.340 --> 35:20.260
And I have now also been running a fedora droplet for ages

35:20.260 --> 35:22.060
and then I've got a bunch of Ubuntu droplets

35:22.060 --> 35:24.500
and it's, you know, they also, they offer free BSD

35:24.500 --> 35:25.780
and a bunch of other distributions.

35:25.780 --> 35:29.260
It's a really easy way to spin up infrastructure on demand,

35:29.260 --> 35:31.280
whether you want something personally for yourself

35:31.280 --> 35:32.740
or hosting for your business.

35:32.740 --> 35:35.380
Everything's SSDs from the low priced rigs

35:35.380 --> 35:36.780
all the way up to the high priced rigs.

35:36.780 --> 35:39.280
They have stuff with like 512 megs of RAM

35:39.280 --> 35:41.580
for a nice slim system with things up like

35:41.580 --> 35:45.380
over 200 gigs of RAM, tons of CPU cords, terabytes

35:45.380 --> 35:47.000
and terabytes of transfer.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.220
You can have team accounts, highly available block storage.

35:50.220 --> 35:53.080
They're beta testing object storage right now.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.960
They have loads of pre-built open source apps

35:55.960 --> 35:57.360
that you can just one click deploy

35:57.360 --> 36:00.140
and they're not like magic script setups.

36:00.140 --> 36:01.020
It's legitimate.

36:01.020 --> 36:03.820
Like if an expert system administrator built a system

36:03.820 --> 36:05.920
to host next cloud, that's how it looks.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.420
And like one of my favorite ones to do

36:08.420 --> 36:09.460
is just a quick test.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.640
I can deploy a base LTS system with Docker on it,

36:11.640 --> 36:14.420
try something and then destroy it and spend like three cents.

36:14.420 --> 36:15.260
It's amazing.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.080
So great.

36:16.080 --> 36:18.700
Digitalocean.com use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

36:18.700 --> 36:22.920
and yes, yes, you can run Fedora there as a matter of fact.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.900
You crazy cats, just like I have been.

36:24.900 --> 36:28.140
And you know what I do is I set up Fedora on there

36:28.140 --> 36:29.940
and then I just manage my Fedora box

36:29.940 --> 36:32.100
through cockpit all the time.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.540
It's a super solid way.

36:33.540 --> 36:36.660
Yeah, it's a super solid way to keep a Fedora system running.

36:36.660 --> 36:41.140
And then in cockpit, there is a really simple

36:41.140 --> 36:44.740
straightforward system to search for new Docker images,

36:44.740 --> 36:46.240
click on them, pull them down.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.940
And then when the first time you set them up,

36:47.940 --> 36:49.540
you can set up all of the port forwarding,

36:49.540 --> 36:51.940
you can set up paths and there's a UI

36:51.940 --> 36:54.140
to just set all of that stuff and you hit save

36:54.140 --> 36:55.380
and boom, everything just works.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.700
That seems perfect for the casual admin.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.500
You're not doing it every day, but you know the concepts,

36:59.500 --> 37:01.460
maybe you forgot that command line switch.

37:01.460 --> 37:02.780
Cockpit makes it just right there.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.260
It's nice, it's really nice.

37:04.260 --> 37:05.900
And the other thing that's really cool about it

37:05.900 --> 37:08.760
is we've covered the security architecture of it

37:08.760 --> 37:10.160
a couple of weeks ago, if you recall,

37:10.160 --> 37:11.940
and it's really soundly built too.

37:11.940 --> 37:14.180
So I actually feel pretty safe running it.

37:14.180 --> 37:16.340
It's a pretty solid innovation.

37:16.340 --> 37:20.140
You know, this is sort of tangentially related to Fedora

37:21.300 --> 37:23.440
because they've been shipping Wayland by default now

37:23.440 --> 37:26.220
since the last release and it looks like,

37:26.220 --> 37:28.700
according to Will Cook, who's the head of the desktop team

37:28.700 --> 37:32.300
over at Canonical, they're considering backing off

37:32.300 --> 37:37.300
of their decision to ship Wayland in Ubuntu 17.10,

37:37.460 --> 37:42.260
which could then ultimately impact the LTS in 2018.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.700
Now, I think this announcement has been,

37:45.700 --> 37:46.940
it's not really an announcement.

37:46.940 --> 37:49.700
It's a discussion at this point, so keep that in mind.

37:49.700 --> 37:53.140
This is not like this is being announced officially.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.640
This is them discussing their gut feelings

37:55.640 --> 37:57.220
about maybe Wayland not being ready yet.

37:57.220 --> 37:59.420
And I think that's actually the fascinating thing about it

37:59.420 --> 38:02.860
is that is a conversation to be had.

38:02.860 --> 38:04.860
Is it stable enough?

38:04.860 --> 38:07.540
They said they've taken some input from their users

38:07.540 --> 38:09.380
that have been in testing and seen stability issues

38:09.380 --> 38:11.420
with both Wayland and Ex-Wayland.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.100
My gut feeling, Will Cook said,

38:14.100 --> 38:16.020
is that Wayland isn't ready yet.

38:17.580 --> 38:21.700
That's a tough thing because you wanna skate,

38:21.700 --> 38:23.340
obviously, to where the puck is going,

38:23.340 --> 38:26.220
and you wanna get this thing tested in the 17.10 release

38:26.220 --> 38:30.300
before 18.04 hits, and you've got, obviously,

38:30.300 --> 38:32.980
the Fedora distribution has been shipping it for a while.

38:32.980 --> 38:35.420
But they had some legitimate use case problems

38:35.420 --> 38:37.500
that they've had people writing in to them

38:37.500 --> 38:39.700
in their testing that have come up.

38:39.700 --> 38:41.740
So it's, I don't know.

38:41.740 --> 38:44.580
The flip side of that is that we need this kind of,

38:44.580 --> 38:45.940
we want Wayland to be really good.

38:45.940 --> 38:47.460
We want it to be rock solid for the future.

38:47.460 --> 38:49.660
We need these kinds of, sometimes it takes

38:49.660 --> 38:51.500
another big distribution, being like,

38:51.500 --> 38:53.080
okay, can we really use this?

38:53.080 --> 38:54.900
What would that look like to make sure

38:54.900 --> 38:57.140
that we do iron out all those bugs and make it stable?

38:57.140 --> 38:58.080
Because we don't want another thing

38:58.080 --> 38:59.860
where the pulse audio rollout or whatever,

38:59.860 --> 39:01.420
where now no one trusts Wayland,

39:01.420 --> 39:02.780
it's not gonna get good rep,

39:02.780 --> 39:05.140
maybe less developers want to work on it.

39:05.140 --> 39:08.600
Well, it's just the hard truth of default rules supreme.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.860
So you could even include Wayland as a session option,

39:11.860 --> 39:14.420
you know, GNOME parenthesis Wayland,

39:14.420 --> 39:17.080
and then you could have GNOME X11 as the default.

39:18.420 --> 39:23.420
But you're just gonna have a dramatic volume difference

39:23.420 --> 39:25.300
between the amount of users testing it

39:25.300 --> 39:27.220
and submitting bug reports if you do that.

39:27.220 --> 39:31.420
It's just gonna, it's gonna be a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction

39:31.420 --> 39:33.060
of the Ubuntu user base would use that.

39:33.060 --> 39:34.740
Pretty much people who probably could,

39:34.740 --> 39:35.620
might install it anyway.

39:35.620 --> 39:38.460
I mean, I can tell you all of my Arch systems right now

39:38.460 --> 39:40.980
that are running in this studio all have an option

39:40.980 --> 39:43.920
to log into GNOME on Wayland, and I never do it.

39:43.920 --> 39:46.220
I've had problems, especially I've had problems with Chrome

39:46.220 --> 39:49.340
and I just don't, I guess I'm waiting it out.

39:49.340 --> 39:53.300
But at some point you're right,

39:53.300 --> 39:55.120
you gotta rip the bandaid off.

39:55.120 --> 39:59.660
And Wayland is really at this point becoming a joke

39:59.660 --> 40:01.540
if we can't get this thing out the door.

40:01.540 --> 40:02.580
It's been years in development.

40:02.580 --> 40:04.440
Now I guess, you know, if you look at it

40:04.440 --> 40:05.280
in the grand scheme of things,

40:05.280 --> 40:07.780
I think X has been around since Reagan was president,

40:07.780 --> 40:09.700
so I don't know if that's true,

40:09.700 --> 40:11.940
but it feels like it probably is true actually.

40:11.940 --> 40:12.940
We just have long timelines.

40:12.940 --> 40:15.700
So I guess if you consider in the grand scheme of things,

40:15.700 --> 40:17.380
Wayland is still just a young pup.

40:17.380 --> 40:20.060
And I guess maybe this is just the long haul,

40:20.060 --> 40:22.460
but this stuff isn't easy.

40:22.460 --> 40:24.100
And it sounds like the Ubuntu devs

40:24.100 --> 40:25.700
are just uncertain about which way to go.

40:25.700 --> 40:26.620
So we'll just have to stay tuned.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.600
I'm gonna keep watching it.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.200
There's also, there's a little follow-up news

40:31.200 --> 40:33.860
to something we covered before, GR security.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.240
Remember when we mentioned GR security

40:35.240 --> 40:36.980
was sort of branching off and doing their own thing

40:36.980 --> 40:40.800
and closing up their patch set against the Linux kernel,

40:40.800 --> 40:43.500
which promises to make the Linux kernel super secure.

40:43.500 --> 40:47.700
And now they're releasing it in this stable patch access

40:47.700 --> 40:51.100
agreement license that says that you can take this GPL code,

40:51.100 --> 40:52.280
but you're not allowed to share it.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.640
And if you do, we're gonna revoke your access.

40:54.640 --> 40:57.380
And they kind of have people really sort of

40:57.380 --> 41:01.380
by the elbow here because these are oftentimes

41:01.380 --> 41:04.580
business customers that have systems out on the web

41:04.580 --> 41:08.060
that are doing e-commerce that are being audited.

41:08.060 --> 41:09.460
And this is how they say they're secure

41:09.460 --> 41:11.820
is because they have this, oh yeah, we have hardened Linux.

41:11.820 --> 41:13.760
We've hardened our Linux with GR security.

41:13.760 --> 41:14.600
We've hardened it.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.340
It's used a lot by like multi-tenant hosts

41:16.340 --> 41:18.300
or people running like open VZ containers

41:18.300 --> 41:19.340
or other things like that.

41:19.340 --> 41:20.980
And so what are they gonna do?

41:20.980 --> 41:22.740
You know, they've been using this thing for years.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.180
And then one day these guys decide to go,

41:25.180 --> 41:28.620
ah, no, we're going commercial product and you gotta pay.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.580
Huh, what's that?

41:29.580 --> 41:30.980
No, you pay, you pay.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.300
You can take it and you can use that GPL software,

41:33.300 --> 41:35.740
but you gotta pay and you can't do anything with it.

41:35.740 --> 41:38.140
If you distribute that, if you make modifications to it

41:38.140 --> 41:40.340
and you share that GPL code with anybody,

41:40.340 --> 41:43.700
we're gonna come after you, kind of crazy.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.640
And it's got a few people's attention.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.040
It got our attention a few weeks ago.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.660
We talked about it here on the show.

41:48.660 --> 41:52.700
And Linus about a week ago really ripped him a new one

41:52.700 --> 41:55.220
saying that their code quality was just garbage.

41:55.220 --> 41:56.640
Not really even concerning,

41:56.640 --> 41:58.260
not even really mentioning the license issues,

41:58.260 --> 41:59.380
but just saying that, you know,

41:59.380 --> 42:02.500
they're a bunch of basically dweebs is what he said.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.860
I mean, he said it in harsher terms.

42:04.860 --> 42:07.020
Well, there is a gentleman, Bruce Perns,

42:07.020 --> 42:08.960
who is an advisor to lawyers.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.900
So wrap your head around that for a second.

42:10.900 --> 42:13.820
And what does he advise those lawyers about?

42:13.820 --> 42:15.640
GPL compliance.

42:17.100 --> 42:18.180
You see where we're going here.

42:18.180 --> 42:20.860
Now that GR security has taken their patch set

42:20.860 --> 42:22.540
that they claim makes Linux better

42:22.540 --> 42:23.900
and they've wrapped it behind

42:23.900 --> 42:26.500
the stable patch access agreement,

42:26.500 --> 42:28.260
customers are warned that if they redistribute

42:28.260 --> 42:32.900
any of this GPL code, there's gonna be a penalty.

42:32.900 --> 42:36.900
Well, here's the problem.

42:36.900 --> 42:38.940
You can't deny this one fact.

42:38.940 --> 42:42.180
GR security is a patch for the Linux kernel.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.140
It's inseparable from Linux.

42:46.140 --> 42:50.820
It, GR security does not work without Linux.

42:50.820 --> 42:53.520
So this would fail a fair use test.

42:54.500 --> 42:57.100
Because it's strongly derivative nature of the kernel,

42:57.100 --> 43:00.180
it must be under GPL version two license

43:00.180 --> 43:02.780
or a license compatible with GPL

43:02.780 --> 43:06.660
and with terms no more restrictive than the GPL.

43:06.660 --> 43:09.140
And there is a pretty clear clause of the GPL.

43:09.140 --> 43:11.940
It's GPL section six, which specifically prohibits

43:11.940 --> 43:14.180
any additions of terms as well.

43:14.180 --> 43:15.920
So they're also violating it

43:15.920 --> 43:18.060
by wrapping these additional terms.

43:18.060 --> 43:19.880
They really got themselves in a pickle here.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.820
And I think these guys are ripe for the picking.

43:22.820 --> 43:25.260
I mean, I think this is gonna be one juicy, juicy pickle

43:25.260 --> 43:26.500
that somebody is gonna come along

43:26.500 --> 43:27.640
and decide to take a bite out of.

43:27.640 --> 43:30.260
Nobody has yet, there's no lawsuits yet.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.420
But there seems to be some pretty solid

43:32.420 --> 43:34.540
GPL violation issues here.

43:34.540 --> 43:37.460
And then this Bruce guy here at the bottom of his pose

43:37.460 --> 43:39.740
is like, by the way, if you want to consult with me

43:39.740 --> 43:41.540
and see these guys, it's essentially what he says.

43:41.540 --> 43:43.320
He doesn't say it like that.

43:43.320 --> 43:46.100
Give me a callskies and we'll work something out here.

43:46.100 --> 43:48.020
So it's open hunting season for GR.

43:48.020 --> 43:49.760
You got Linus coming after him.

43:49.760 --> 43:52.300
You got obvious GPL compliance questions.

43:52.300 --> 43:56.720
Well, there's been a lot of, let's say drama back and forth

43:56.720 --> 43:57.560
between the projects.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.920
I mean, for a long time, but even more recently

43:58.920 --> 44:00.940
with they had some threats of lawsuits

44:00.940 --> 44:02.020
against people like Kees Cook

44:02.020 --> 44:03.540
and the Linux self-protection project

44:03.540 --> 44:06.700
for using their work without proper attribution.

44:06.700 --> 44:08.100
And it's just this whole culture of like,

44:08.100 --> 44:10.060
they've certainly had some innovations.

44:10.060 --> 44:11.140
They've done a lot of good research,

44:11.140 --> 44:13.420
but it's been a long history of not using

44:13.420 --> 44:15.360
the kernel standard, not making patches

44:15.360 --> 44:16.660
that have any hope of doing it.

44:16.660 --> 44:18.700
And they just, you know, there's a very,

44:18.700 --> 44:21.260
almost in a similar style to OpenBSD.

44:21.260 --> 44:23.180
It's a security first, but of course,

44:23.180 --> 44:26.020
Linus is never gonna ship a broken kernel

44:26.020 --> 44:26.860
even if it is more secure.

44:26.860 --> 44:27.700
Well, stop right there.

44:27.700 --> 44:30.240
I mean, like what a, that is a huge red flag

44:30.240 --> 44:34.820
is if GR security is based intrinsically on upstream

44:34.820 --> 44:37.860
and they have a hostile relationship with upstream.

44:37.860 --> 44:40.060
Well, that doesn't lead to a good product.

44:40.060 --> 44:42.980
You know, like that's not how you set up a winner.

44:42.980 --> 44:46.260
So it's, this is a difficult situation for them for sure.

44:46.260 --> 44:48.540
And I don't know if it really has direct impact on us

44:48.540 --> 44:50.340
unless any of you out there are working in businesses

44:50.340 --> 44:52.340
that use this, but it's sort of a fascinating one

44:52.340 --> 44:54.860
to sit back from the rafters and watch a bit.

44:54.860 --> 44:57.780
You know, we have a little NF tables stuff to get to,

44:57.780 --> 45:00.380
but I also have a couple of cool apps

45:00.380 --> 45:02.380
that I've been itching to talk about.

45:02.380 --> 45:04.060
Wonder, let's do this.

45:04.060 --> 45:04.980
Let's talk about this,

45:04.980 --> 45:06.640
just this quick little open source app

45:06.640 --> 45:07.480
that we found this week.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.940
Cause this is just a real quickie.

45:08.940 --> 45:11.300
It's called I want, and it's a decentralized

45:11.300 --> 45:14.000
peer-to-peer file sharing command line application.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.620
And this came across both Wes's radar and mine.

45:16.620 --> 45:19.060
And it's just a, it's a CLI tool for searching

45:19.060 --> 45:20.700
and downloading files on your land network

45:20.700 --> 45:21.940
without any central server,

45:21.940 --> 45:23.400
which I think that's kind of cool.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.620
It includes easy discovery of files.

45:25.620 --> 45:27.820
So it's sort of like a search type syntax.

45:27.820 --> 45:29.180
You can download it from multiple,

45:29.180 --> 45:31.060
multiple machines on your network.

45:31.060 --> 45:33.900
This could be handy for us because we have large media files

45:33.900 --> 45:35.020
that we're distributing.

45:35.020 --> 45:37.200
You can do entire directory downloads.

45:38.060 --> 45:39.300
And obviously, as you would hope,

45:39.300 --> 45:42.380
it does support a resumption of file transfers.

45:42.380 --> 45:46.080
It is, it is very careful about getting consistent data.

45:46.080 --> 45:48.180
Any changes made to files inside a shared folder

45:48.180 --> 45:49.940
are instantly reflected on the network.

45:49.940 --> 45:51.360
It works on Linux.

45:51.360 --> 45:53.580
It works on Windows and it works on the Mac.

45:53.580 --> 45:55.700
Although I think this guy even admits like,

45:55.700 --> 45:59.500
Mac version, I wouldn't use it to quite yet.

45:59.500 --> 46:01.940
And if you, if you, if you want to give it a go,

46:01.940 --> 46:05.980
just pip install, I want, it might also be in the AUR.

46:05.980 --> 46:07.900
And I think it's kind of, it sounds like a really cool way

46:07.900 --> 46:09.260
to just toss files around your network.

46:09.260 --> 46:10.880
One of the questions that consistently has come in

46:10.880 --> 46:13.620
over the years is what's the best way to share files

46:13.620 --> 46:14.960
that's not Samba.

46:14.960 --> 46:17.380
And a lot of times what our answer is,

46:17.380 --> 46:19.620
well, if you have, if you have one machine that's always on,

46:19.620 --> 46:21.960
you could consider setting up some NFS mounts.

46:21.960 --> 46:23.340
But a lot of times what we tell people

46:23.340 --> 46:25.680
is just use SCP.

46:25.680 --> 46:28.100
Just toss it around on your network using SSH.

46:28.100 --> 46:30.540
Kind of not super intuitive for people

46:30.540 --> 46:33.380
that are coming from different operating systems.

46:33.380 --> 46:34.980
Yep, and if you don't have keys set up,

46:34.980 --> 46:36.740
there's maybe a lot of passwords and things.

46:36.740 --> 46:38.260
Yeah, yeah, or if you have different passwords

46:38.260 --> 46:39.080
on different machines.

46:39.080 --> 46:39.920
Yeah, exactly.

46:39.920 --> 46:40.740
So this could be a nice way,

46:40.740 --> 46:42.820
if you have a nice, safe, trusted LAN,

46:42.820 --> 46:45.180
like here at the network, here at the JB studios,

46:45.180 --> 46:47.260
you know, we have, we have like large files

46:47.260 --> 46:49.220
that we want to toss around between our machines.

46:49.220 --> 46:51.100
And sometimes just being lazy,

46:51.100 --> 46:52.220
we'll just throw it on Dropbox.

46:52.220 --> 46:53.060
Yeah, exactly.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.580
And it's like, why go all the way up to the cloud,

46:55.580 --> 46:57.780
sync it to all my machines, bring it all the way down.

46:57.780 --> 46:59.700
Why not just toss that one gig file

46:59.700 --> 47:02.360
directly to somebody's machine using something like I want.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.400
And I've played around before with graphical ones,

47:05.400 --> 47:07.460
and I think command line is the way to go.

47:07.460 --> 47:08.860
Yeah, especially if you're listening to this show.

47:08.860 --> 47:09.740
What?

47:09.740 --> 47:11.780
You do say, you do say.

47:11.780 --> 47:14.380
You know, I won't be here.

47:14.380 --> 47:15.280
I won't be here next week.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.660
Are you?

47:16.660 --> 47:17.500
How do you feel about that?

47:17.500 --> 47:18.340
Are you okay?

47:18.340 --> 47:19.180
You gonna be good?

47:19.180 --> 47:20.000
Well, I mean, I'll miss you.

47:20.000 --> 47:20.840
Yeah, yeah.

47:20.840 --> 47:21.940
But I think you're gonna have a great time.

47:21.940 --> 47:23.940
Yeah, yeah, I am heading off to.

47:23.940 --> 47:25.940
You're gonna come back refreshed, ready to podcast?

47:25.940 --> 47:27.420
Hmm, yeah, hopefully.

47:27.420 --> 47:28.860
I'm going to Montana.

47:28.860 --> 47:31.180
I would like to have seen Montana.

47:31.180 --> 47:32.460
And it's gonna be hot.

47:32.460 --> 47:35.080
It's gonna be, it's gonna be really hot.

47:35.080 --> 47:36.780
So hopefully, like when we get there,

47:36.780 --> 47:38.060
it's gonna be like 100 degrees.

47:38.060 --> 47:39.860
There's some sweaty vlogs coming up.

47:39.860 --> 47:40.700
I don't know, I don't know.

47:40.700 --> 47:42.860
The cameras maybe will have to go away from that sweaty.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.060
But yeah, I'm gonna be there with Noah.

47:44.060 --> 47:45.900
He's gonna be doing Ask Noah live from there.

47:45.900 --> 47:47.140
Is that right?

47:47.140 --> 47:47.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:47.980 --> 47:48.800
I don't think.

47:48.800 --> 47:49.640
That rascal.

47:49.640 --> 47:51.220
No, I think, but I think we have a very special guest,

47:51.220 --> 47:54.140
somebody from one of our other shows will be joining us.

47:54.140 --> 47:55.180
We'll be joining Wes.

47:55.180 --> 47:56.000
Yes, that's right.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.900
We'll be joining Wes, because I won't be here.

47:57.900 --> 47:59.380
But you guys, I think, will have a great show.

47:59.380 --> 48:01.300
So if you out there in the audience

48:01.300 --> 48:02.980
want to help the boys out while I'm gone,

48:02.980 --> 48:05.580
head over to jblive.tv next Tuesday and join the Mumble Room.

48:05.580 --> 48:08.620
You can get in the IRC there and just do Bang Mumble,

48:08.620 --> 48:11.460
or exclamation mark, and get the server information.

48:11.460 --> 48:13.420
And then you can hang out with Wes

48:13.420 --> 48:14.980
and his special guest next week.

48:14.980 --> 48:16.060
It'll be a lot of fun.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.500
So there's a particularly cool little bit

48:18.500 --> 48:23.420
of benchmarking and engineering work that was done.

48:23.420 --> 48:26.700
And kind of a nice bit of research

48:26.700 --> 48:29.180
that I would have loved to have done if had I had the time.

48:29.180 --> 48:30.620
Because I've always wondered, what

48:30.620 --> 48:32.660
is the difference between NF tables and IP tables?

48:32.660 --> 48:36.140
And how is this new world, and does it scale

48:36.140 --> 48:38.780
if you want to set up, say, maybe a Linux firewall?

48:38.780 --> 48:42.340
And is it too much overhead if you just want to have it

48:42.340 --> 48:43.220
on your workstation?

48:43.220 --> 48:45.820
These are all questions I've pondered, but never really

48:45.820 --> 48:47.340
sat down to iron out.

48:47.340 --> 48:50.300
And so this next piece was a really solid bit

48:50.300 --> 48:51.820
of research and write-up.

48:51.820 --> 48:54.260
But I want to mention Linux Academy briefly,

48:54.260 --> 48:56.380
because I think this is a great opportunity when you

48:56.380 --> 48:57.640
get into this kind of stuff.

48:57.640 --> 48:59.420
If anything we're talking about goes over your head,

48:59.420 --> 49:00.900
consider going over to Linux Academy.

49:00.900 --> 49:03.980
Or if you just want to just step your skill level up a bit,

49:03.980 --> 49:05.940
stay competitive, maybe get a new job,

49:05.940 --> 49:08.420
or just look good in a review, Linux Academy.

49:08.420 --> 49:10.940
Start by going to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

49:10.940 --> 49:14.100
Sign up for a free seven-day trial of the Linux Academy

49:14.100 --> 49:14.900
platform.

49:14.900 --> 49:17.700
It's a place to learn everything about Linux.

49:17.700 --> 49:19.700
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses,

49:19.700 --> 49:22.860
hands-on labs that give you real experience with this stuff.

49:22.860 --> 49:24.820
And I think probably one of my favorite features

49:24.820 --> 49:26.700
that really makes Linux Academy stand out.

49:26.700 --> 49:28.780
And this is really possible because they're really

49:28.780 --> 49:29.620
all in on Linux.

49:29.620 --> 49:31.020
It's not just something they do.

49:31.020 --> 49:32.700
It's not just something they cover,

49:32.700 --> 49:35.460
along with the Cisco stuff and the Microsoft stuff.

49:35.460 --> 49:36.620
This is what they do.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.140
Everything from the nitty-itty bitties

49:38.140 --> 49:41.020
all the way up to the big stuff, like OpenStack and AWS

49:41.020 --> 49:44.940
and Azure, they have the entire Linux pipeline.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.500
And that's why they can offer instructor mentoring, full time

49:47.500 --> 49:50.460
human instructors who know this material top to bottom

49:50.460 --> 49:52.220
because this is what they focus on.

49:52.220 --> 49:55.060
That's a huge differentiator for Linux Academy.

49:55.060 --> 49:58.060
They have these virtual servers that they spin up

49:58.060 --> 49:59.780
simultaneously with your courseware,

49:59.780 --> 50:01.740
which is a really cool thing because you're going along

50:01.740 --> 50:04.980
and it's like, OK, now SSH into this and try this out.

50:04.980 --> 50:05.740
Boom.

50:05.740 --> 50:08.380
My mind was blown the first time I did that because it's like,

50:08.380 --> 50:11.260
I can sit there with the material on my screen

50:11.260 --> 50:13.620
and then in my favorite console, I'm SSHed in just

50:13.620 --> 50:15.940
like it would be any other system I'm working on.

50:15.940 --> 50:17.300
It's just a brilliant way to learn.

50:17.300 --> 50:19.100
It's especially great for things like AWS

50:19.100 --> 50:20.900
where you're like, how much is this going to cost me?

50:20.900 --> 50:21.660
I don't really understand.

50:21.660 --> 50:22.900
I'm just trying to learn.

50:22.900 --> 50:24.060
You don't even have to worry about it.

50:24.060 --> 50:25.060
Let them take care of it.

50:25.060 --> 50:28.020
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

50:28.020 --> 50:30.220
Big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

50:30.220 --> 50:31.140
the unplugged program.

50:36.820 --> 50:39.100
So this is Benchmarking NF Tables

50:39.100 --> 50:42.300
over at the developers.redhat.com blog.

50:42.300 --> 50:45.580
And it was posted by Phil.

50:45.580 --> 50:48.100
It was a little bit ago, but it was something that kind of,

50:48.100 --> 50:49.620
I think, came across as Wes's radar.

50:49.620 --> 50:52.700
And he passed it on to me, and I was pretty fascinated by it.

50:52.700 --> 50:54.820
For starters, it's just interesting to see

50:54.820 --> 50:57.500
how he decided to do this.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.660
He wanted to figure out how different firewall setups

50:59.660 --> 51:01.140
affected performance.

51:01.140 --> 51:05.220
And so he messed around with a simple test framework, which

51:05.220 --> 51:07.460
he could feed a bunch of different setup snippets

51:07.460 --> 51:08.620
and then cycle through them.

51:08.620 --> 51:10.880
And then he could test scalability with these snippets

51:10.880 --> 51:14.700
by adding a number and a scale ranger from 0 to 100.

51:14.700 --> 51:16.460
And then the test script would go off,

51:16.460 --> 51:19.200
and it would run each possible value to that scale.

51:19.200 --> 51:22.140
And then each value equals a multiple of five benchmarks.

51:22.140 --> 51:25.060
And those are then performed, repeated nine more times.

51:25.060 --> 51:27.860
The results are all plotted out with nice beautiful graphs.

51:27.860 --> 51:30.260
And we end up in this post.

51:30.260 --> 51:33.720
And what we get here is some rather interesting revelations,

51:33.720 --> 51:36.840
including the fact that it seems to be that there

51:36.840 --> 51:38.780
is a bit of a performance difference that

51:38.780 --> 51:43.460
is fairly noticeable between IP tables and NF tables

51:43.460 --> 51:47.580
on really small setups, like 20 or fewer rules,

51:47.580 --> 51:50.820
or even like 100 or fewer rules.

51:50.820 --> 51:54.620
IP tables may actually be more performant than NF tables.

51:54.620 --> 51:58.620
But IP tables, if I read this correctly, there is,

51:58.620 --> 52:00.140
and same to a degree with NF tables,

52:00.140 --> 52:02.780
but I'll talk about that more in a second, with IP tables,

52:02.780 --> 52:06.420
there is some suffering of performance

52:06.420 --> 52:08.260
as the number of rules increases.

52:08.260 --> 52:10.220
Not too surprising.

52:10.220 --> 52:12.100
So the overhead introduced with adding rules

52:12.100 --> 52:13.740
becomes less and less significant

52:13.740 --> 52:16.420
the more rules there are with NF tables,

52:16.420 --> 52:19.060
because NF tables handles this in a little bit different way.

52:19.060 --> 52:21.260
It sort of does some of the logic ahead of time.

52:21.260 --> 52:24.300
And it eats that cost initially, and then that cost

52:24.300 --> 52:27.020
is essentially spent, that time is spent.

52:27.020 --> 52:30.660
And then it is able to scale up more rules much, much faster

52:30.660 --> 52:32.900
and performant than IP tables, which

52:32.900 --> 52:35.180
has to go through the chain and consider

52:35.180 --> 52:37.420
every single rule every time.

52:37.420 --> 52:41.100
And so it's interesting, because at the smaller scale,

52:41.100 --> 52:43.400
that might actually be advantageous with IP tables,

52:43.400 --> 52:45.220
depending on your setup.

52:45.220 --> 52:47.980
But if you consider that NF tables are still early days,

52:47.980 --> 52:49.540
and they're still working on it, that

52:49.540 --> 52:50.720
seems like a performance gap they're

52:50.720 --> 52:51.820
going to probably close as well.

52:51.820 --> 52:52.060
Right.

52:52.060 --> 52:54.380
Really been focused on functionality, not

52:54.380 --> 52:55.340
optimization yet.

52:55.340 --> 52:57.140
What was your take from some of this stuff?

52:57.140 --> 52:58.940
Was there anything that jumped out at you

52:58.940 --> 53:00.540
as sort of an interesting result?

53:00.540 --> 53:02.540
There's just so many tests between these systems.

53:02.540 --> 53:05.460
There's a lot to dig into to this one.

53:05.460 --> 53:08.420
For me, I think that one of the bigger things is, yes,

53:08.420 --> 53:10.980
there's still early days around NF tables.

53:10.980 --> 53:13.700
Some of the command line stuff needs to be worked out,

53:13.700 --> 53:14.620
some of how that works.

53:14.620 --> 53:16.020
There's some unintuitive bits, especially

53:16.020 --> 53:17.540
if you're already familiar with IP tables and kind

53:17.540 --> 53:19.900
of the defaults, the default chains, and tables,

53:19.900 --> 53:21.940
and things that already exist.

53:21.940 --> 53:23.780
But I'm really excited.

53:23.780 --> 53:28.620
What struck me is it looks like NF tables and the NFT command.

53:28.620 --> 53:31.860
There's going to be a lot of things that we can do with this

53:31.860 --> 53:33.780
in more intuitive ways than we can now.

53:33.780 --> 53:35.860
In particular, I think this article highlights

53:35.860 --> 53:38.500
that if you want to do kind of traffic control things,

53:38.500 --> 53:42.180
there's the TC application, which is part of IP route 2.

53:42.180 --> 53:45.300
But it is one of the least intuitive command line

53:45.300 --> 53:46.980
applications I've ever used.

53:46.980 --> 53:48.740
If you actually need to do things with it,

53:48.740 --> 53:50.280
I would definitely recommend something

53:50.280 --> 53:53.100
like Fire QoS that can help automate that in a sane way.

53:53.100 --> 53:56.620
But not only is the way NF tables

53:56.620 --> 54:00.260
uses Netfilter to accomplish some of the same things easier

54:00.260 --> 54:01.700
to do, it looks like it's actually

54:01.700 --> 54:02.460
a little more performant.

54:02.460 --> 54:05.120
So that story on Linux might be getting a little bit better,

54:05.120 --> 54:05.800
which I think is great.

54:05.800 --> 54:06.920
Did you see the part here?

54:06.920 --> 54:09.500
And I just sort of read the highlight of this section

54:09.500 --> 54:11.540
because I thought I'd pass it on to the audience.

54:11.540 --> 54:14.900
He also performed DDoS protection testing

54:14.900 --> 54:18.020
to see how NF tables stood up versus IP tables

54:18.020 --> 54:22.180
and get a bunch of different ways to see how they handled it.

54:22.180 --> 54:26.260
And I took away that essentially NF tables probably

54:26.260 --> 54:29.060
would handle this better in an actual situation.

54:29.060 --> 54:31.220
But I thought I'd list all that in there

54:31.220 --> 54:33.980
because part of what he tested to see was, like you were saying,

54:33.980 --> 54:36.860
is TC and blacklisting IP addresses in real time

54:36.860 --> 54:39.500
and stuff like that and cycling through 100,000 packets

54:39.500 --> 54:42.820
per second using package gen and just all kinds of cool stuff

54:42.820 --> 54:43.860
the way he set this up.

54:43.860 --> 54:46.300
So it's a fascinating read if you guys

54:46.300 --> 54:48.760
want to read through the whole thing.

54:48.760 --> 54:51.900
The TLDR might be the most prominent information

54:51.900 --> 54:56.060
to draw from the experiment is that similar IP tables and NF

54:56.060 --> 54:59.180
table setups are comparable in performance.

54:59.180 --> 55:01.240
NF tables is usually a bit behind,

55:01.240 --> 55:03.280
but given that the development focus at this point

55:03.280 --> 55:05.280
is still on functionality, like you were saying,

55:05.280 --> 55:07.220
it's going to be changing.

55:07.220 --> 55:10.180
IP set is a blessing to any IP table setup.

55:10.180 --> 55:13.500
NF tables follows their path with their native implementation

55:13.500 --> 55:15.060
and their concepts.

55:15.060 --> 55:18.380
Then NF tables could be in a great spot too.

55:18.380 --> 55:20.980
He says he's not still convinced of his test results.

55:20.980 --> 55:23.460
He still thinks there's probably no point

55:23.460 --> 55:25.900
in breaking a leg over implementing something in TC

55:25.900 --> 55:28.900
if the same thing is possible in net filter.

55:28.900 --> 55:30.220
Yeah, that's a good summary.

55:30.220 --> 55:31.380
It's a good post.

55:31.380 --> 55:34.860
And it looks like, I don't know, if you're considering setting

55:34.860 --> 55:36.860
up a Linux firewall, you might want to read it

55:36.860 --> 55:39.240
and just decide, depending on what your scale is,

55:39.240 --> 55:40.240
what would work for you.

55:40.240 --> 55:40.900
Yeah, definitely.

55:40.900 --> 55:41.400
Yeah.

55:41.400 --> 55:42.500
And you might be surprised.

55:42.500 --> 55:43.900
And it might be we're getting close enough maybe now

55:43.900 --> 55:45.920
in a similar vein to Wayland, perhaps,

55:45.920 --> 55:48.660
where, especially maybe for home use,

55:48.660 --> 55:51.500
I don't have crazy performance concerns for my house.

55:51.500 --> 55:52.000
Exactly.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.380
I might be the time where I could convert over to NFT

55:54.380 --> 55:55.220
and see what happens.

55:55.220 --> 55:56.900
Yeah, and start just sort of learning now.

55:56.900 --> 55:58.540
And then, because that's kind of where things are going.

55:58.540 --> 55:58.980
Yeah, right.

55:58.980 --> 55:59.940
I mean, it'll be years yet, I'm sure,

55:59.940 --> 56:01.340
before I want it on the production server.

56:01.340 --> 56:02.060
But someday.

56:02.060 --> 56:02.780
Yeah.

56:02.780 --> 56:05.100
One little story before we go.

56:05.100 --> 56:06.500
Oh, I know that sound.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.860
Your buddies over at Gabe's office

56:08.860 --> 56:12.940
are working on some big updates to the Steam client.

56:12.940 --> 56:15.180
I saw this over on gamingonlinux.com.

56:15.180 --> 56:18.420
And I'll just cover a moment of what they are planning to do,

56:18.420 --> 56:19.380
because it's from them.

56:19.380 --> 56:21.740
Another thing we're working on is a major redesign

56:21.740 --> 56:26.220
of the Steam client, which is probably far overdue.

56:26.220 --> 56:28.720
So that includes a redesign of the whole Chrome

56:28.720 --> 56:30.940
of the Steam desktop client.

56:30.940 --> 56:33.560
But I think probably the most relevant and interesting thing

56:33.560 --> 56:35.800
for you guys is going to be the redesigns

56:35.800 --> 56:37.600
that we're working on for the Steam library

56:37.600 --> 56:38.500
section in particular.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.460
So once a customer owns your game,

56:40.460 --> 56:42.180
what is that experience like in Steam?

56:42.180 --> 56:43.680
Talking to developers, obviously.

56:43.680 --> 56:47.820
So let's get forward a couple there.

56:47.820 --> 56:51.260
So there's kind of two big parts of that update

56:51.260 --> 56:51.860
in the library.

56:51.860 --> 56:54.460
One is going to be a new library home screen.

56:54.460 --> 56:56.860
If you've used big picture mode at all

56:56.860 --> 56:58.340
and you go into your library, there's

56:58.340 --> 57:00.740
kind of a similar thing that's in Steam big picture

57:00.740 --> 57:03.700
mode, which surfaces games that your friends are playing right

57:03.700 --> 57:06.440
now, surfaces things that you've recently played,

57:06.440 --> 57:09.600
surfaces recently updated games.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.440
We're taking that and we're building on that

57:11.440 --> 57:14.220
so that when a customer comes and logs into Steam,

57:14.220 --> 57:16.220
if they really just want to go back and play

57:16.220 --> 57:18.220
the last game they were playing, it's super easy

57:18.220 --> 57:19.500
to launch it right from there.

57:19.500 --> 57:20.900
We're not making that any harder.

57:20.900 --> 57:22.420
I'm going to leave the rest of the video for you guys.

57:22.420 --> 57:23.740
It's 42 minutes long, so I'm not going

57:23.740 --> 57:25.300
to play all that in the show.

57:25.300 --> 57:26.900
But good to hear that update's coming.

57:26.900 --> 57:28.660
And yes, it includes one to Linux.

57:28.660 --> 57:29.500
That's kind of nice.

57:29.500 --> 57:31.620
It's good to see that, too.

57:31.620 --> 57:33.380
Are you much of a gamer, Wes?

57:33.380 --> 57:34.140
Have we ever talked about that?

57:34.140 --> 57:36.180
I don't think we've really done a gaming episode

57:36.180 --> 57:36.980
since you've been a host.

57:36.980 --> 57:38.380
No, we haven't really.

57:38.380 --> 57:42.580
You know, I don't get very much time to play games these days.

57:42.580 --> 57:43.620
But I do really enjoy it.

57:43.620 --> 57:47.540
I try to find time here and there on the weekend to do it.

57:47.540 --> 57:48.980
I've not yet set up my new place.

57:48.980 --> 57:50.660
I've not yet set up my gaming tower.

57:50.660 --> 57:52.340
But it's on the list of things to do.

57:52.340 --> 57:53.940
So maybe we can do that here shortly.

57:53.940 --> 57:55.820
Yeah, I would be, you know, maybe one day.

57:55.820 --> 57:56.460
Maybe.

57:56.460 --> 57:58.300
People don't love it, so we'll just do it experimentally.

57:58.300 --> 57:59.620
But we would love it.

57:59.620 --> 58:00.380
Yeah, right, exactly.

58:00.380 --> 58:01.420
Hey, that sounds like great fun.

58:01.420 --> 58:03.380
Before we go, I want to mention that we're

58:03.380 --> 58:08.340
doing a little sweepstakes for a Dell XPS 13 developer

58:08.340 --> 58:10.540
edition, which means one of the Linux machines.

58:10.540 --> 58:11.640
You've heard Chris talk about it.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.020
Now you can have it in your hands.

58:13.020 --> 58:15.720
Yeah, spic and span, brand new one shipped directly from Dell.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.540
Now, this is US residents only.

58:17.540 --> 58:20.340
This is just sort of the way that this particular one

58:20.340 --> 58:21.260
has to be.

58:21.260 --> 58:23.540
And you have to be 18 years or older.

58:23.540 --> 58:26.340
But if you're in the US and are perhaps

58:26.340 --> 58:28.460
interested in getting a Dell XPS 13,

58:28.460 --> 58:30.780
you can enter the sweepstakes to win.

58:30.780 --> 58:35.220
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click on the Shows menu option,

58:35.220 --> 58:37.140
and choose the User Airdropdown.

58:37.140 --> 58:39.940
And then you can enter to win there.

58:39.940 --> 58:42.060
And we'll be announcing it here soon,

58:42.060 --> 58:44.360
before I think it's coming up.

58:44.360 --> 58:45.980
Now, since I won't be here, you probably

58:45.980 --> 58:47.100
won't hear much about it next week.

58:47.100 --> 58:48.300
So I just wanted to mention it now,

58:48.300 --> 58:49.640
because it's a great opportunity.

58:49.640 --> 58:52.420
And then stay tuned to the User Air program for the winner.

58:52.420 --> 58:53.060
Yeah.

58:53.060 --> 58:55.420
We'll be announcing it in there.

58:55.420 --> 58:57.500
Last week, User Air went out a little late.

58:57.500 --> 59:01.460
So episode 16, Desktop as a Surface, went out.

59:01.460 --> 59:06.300
User Air 16 includes things from more discussion about LTS

59:06.300 --> 59:08.740
overrolling, particularly in certain production

59:08.740 --> 59:13.060
environments, the East slash West divide of Linux

59:13.060 --> 59:16.060
that seems to keep coming up, two different types of cultures

59:16.060 --> 59:17.380
that are clashing there.

59:17.380 --> 59:19.820
We talk more about the Linux Laptop Survey.

59:19.820 --> 59:21.820
And actually, we really dug into that for a bit.

59:21.820 --> 59:24.780
And then end up with Microsoft's Desktop as a Service

59:24.780 --> 59:27.420
announcement, and sort of how that affects Linux users,

59:27.420 --> 59:29.140
maybe helps good and bad.

59:29.140 --> 59:30.940
So it's a pretty great episode of User Air.

59:30.940 --> 59:33.180
It's episode 16.

59:33.180 --> 59:34.940
I know what I'm doing after the show.

59:34.940 --> 59:36.580
You know what I'm doing after the show?

59:36.580 --> 59:40.820
I actually have two ribeyes from the barbecue last week,

59:40.820 --> 59:43.260
cooking in the sous vide machine right now.

59:43.260 --> 59:45.100
So when you're doing TechSnap, I'm

59:45.100 --> 59:46.580
going to be finishing those up.

59:46.580 --> 59:48.380
I am still eating off of the extra food.

59:48.380 --> 59:49.460
That's amazing.

59:49.460 --> 59:51.620
Of course, I'm fasting, too, here and there.

59:51.620 --> 59:52.780
It stretches it out.

59:52.780 --> 59:55.540
But yeah, there was just so much good stuff here, really great.

59:55.540 --> 59:57.020
Great people, great time.

59:57.020 --> 59:57.940
It was such a good time.

59:57.940 --> 59:59.640
So if you missed last week, go check out

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.840
last week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.840
It was a lot of fun hanging out with them, folks.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.020
Well, Mr. West, I just mentioned it there.

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.140
People can find more of you on the TechSnap program.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.660
Oh, yeah.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.260
Stay tuned.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:10.180
You and Dan doing that.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.620
They do it live right after this show.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.540
So if you want to come next week in to hang out

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:17.020
with Wes and his special guest and then just stay tuned,

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:17.500
keep it up.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.380
And you just get to watch the TechSnap program.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.180
Yeah, it's awesome.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:20.860
Back to back.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.940
You are a busy man.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:22.540
You know it.

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.660
Back to back right there.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.660
You can also participate in the Mumble room.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.500
Bang Mumble when you're in our IRC room, which is, again,

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.900
at jblive.tv.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.820
And the live times are all posted at the calendar

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.220
at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.520
You can also go to our subreddit,

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.180
linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.340
You can leave us feedback at jupitabroadcasting.com

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.300

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.260
You can tweet me at chrislas.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.900
Follow the network at jupitersignal.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.980
I won't be here next week.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:50.140
I'll miss you.

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.260
But the show will go on.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:51.980
That's right, it will.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:53.360
And I think it's going to be a really good one.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:53.860
Oh, yeah.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:57.340
First time special guest on this show.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.340
So that's going to be really cool, too.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.780
It's a first time special guest.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.940
We'll put them through their paces.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:02.420
That's for sure.

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:03.180
I'm sure we will.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.020
I'm sure we will.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.700
OK, everybody, thanks so much for tuning

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.860
into this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.860
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.860
Goodbye, everybody.

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:53.780
Oh, boy, the chat room was punny today.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:54.700
Look at these titles.

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.360
A fitting fedora.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.820
The new fedora fits well.

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:01.260
Fedora's new hat trick.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.700
Oh, man, most of these bad ones are WW's fault. No, I'm kidding.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.140
Ouch.

01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:12.540
JamieTitles.com, now we've got to go pick our title.

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.340
Hey, hey, at least I didn't, I'm not the one that came up

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.340
with Boltron.

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:17.620
You can't blame me for that.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.580
That Boltron title, though, I kind of liked it.

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.340
I got it, because it's like bolt on.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.100
But it's Boltron, which is even cooler.

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:25.480
Those fedora guys are working on some good stuff over there.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.260
I'll tell you what, that really is impressive.

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.940
I cannot believe that I have pushed a fedora server

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.220
install that far, running Nextcloud and all that stuff.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.180
Maybe it's the new way.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.020
Maybe it's the new normal.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:38.860
I don't know.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.540
Or maybe I'm lucky.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.940
The hipster BSD.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.460
It was easy.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:43.880
I will say, while you're doing that,

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.420
I installed OBS on the fedora.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.100
No.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:46.660
Super easy.

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:48.620
They actually have instructions that just add the RPS.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.000
Which version?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.340
Can you see which version it is?

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.100
I just rebooted back to R, because I can't.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.700
But I'll check later.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.100
That's cool.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:53.540
That's cool.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.340
That's cool.

01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.620
This on our production one here is 19.02.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:58.300
OK.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.100
19.02-1.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:03.220
JamieTitles.com, the tree speaks fedora.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:04.140
The tree speak fedora.

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.780
What is that a reference to?

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.780
The tree speak fedora.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.860
I don't know.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.780
I'm not sure either.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:12.700
Five people seem to think they get it, though,

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.980
because it's got five upvotes.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.420
It's like the number one title.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.140
It's the wallpaper.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:20.260
It's the wallpaper that means fedora.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:21.020
Right.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.820
It is a nice wallpaper, I will say.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.140
That title, though, is such a head scratcher

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:25.900
when you see that.

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.660
You know what's funny?

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.220
I honestly 100% thought that was a word.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.860
It's like, oh, wait, oh, no, trees.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:30.380
Yep.

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.420
That was interesting.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.420
Yeah, I get it now, XM.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.020
I get it now.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.740
OK.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.500
Remember how I have rib eyes cooking?

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.820
Oh.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.540
Rolling pain, that's not bad.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:44.500
Rolling pains, atomic fedora, fedora's tree line,

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:49.660
fedora incubator, there's boltron bend, the fedora fiasco,

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:55.540
fedora, fedora, adora, ah, jbtitles.com, jbtitles.com.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.380
There's a lot of titles, a lot of titles.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:01.100
I'm just going to put it, there's a lot of titles over there.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.620
There's a lot of titles.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:04.420
Not saying that much more than that, though.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:04.920
It's crazy.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.420
Crazy.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:06.620
It's crazy.

01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.820
Yippee, yay.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.300
So here, I also appreciated this.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.020
Fedora handles UEFI very nicely.

01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:13.020
Let me just say that.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.580
I like that a lot because it did not

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.460
screw up my Arch UEFI install.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:20.020
And gone are the horrible days of overwriting different boot

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:20.820
loaders and things.

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.540
It's like, I just picked the one, boom.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.060
Yep.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.140
That does feel like the future a little bit, doesn't it?

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:26.740
Yeah.

01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:35.820
Finally.
