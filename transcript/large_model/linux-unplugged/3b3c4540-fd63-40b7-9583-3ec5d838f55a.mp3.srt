00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
I know he's the internet in there. Yeah, dude. They're right there. They are right there

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,280
Yeah, yeah

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,840
Ham did you want to say ham come see the internet ham ham come see the internet look it's right there look ham

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,480
That's really right there. That's it. Wow that is amazing. That's where you came from really you came from in there

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,600
That is amazing. I know that is amazing

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,760
Yeah, lady Jupiter pulls you from the internet, and she transitions you to the real world. That is amazing whoo credible technology

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,920
Incredible yeah, yeah the internet the internet beard exists in both reality and the internet check check is this thing on yeah

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,320
Yeah, that's like the worst thing to possibly say professional professional

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,960
This is Lennox unplugged episode 141 for April 19th

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:58,280
two thousand and sixteen

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,440
Oh

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,920
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's podcasting with a full house. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
Hey there, Wes. Yeah, we have a bunch of the crew already here

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,800
Not even everybody yet some of them are just about to hit the air as we record this here episode

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,480
But the jb1 studios are packed and we have a packed show coming up in this week's episode of the unplugged program

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,840
It's here some of the first Ubuntu tablets real have arrived

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,560
We've got first impressions from our audience that we'll cover in the show later on

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,320
We've had a bit of a Linux build disaster. I will tell you about that

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,960
It's and of course it's leading up to our Linux fast Northwest coverage, so it has to be time sensitive

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,840
We'll tell you all about all about that and some of the shenanigans going down this weekend

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,020
And then later on in the show we'll do some follow-up on our 1604 review

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,960
some interesting things that have already changed since we've done that review additional features that we didn't talk about in the Linux action show and

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,880
Of course a chance for our virtual log to chime in with maybe some of the things

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,160
That they have a different opinion on you know just a couple of things

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,160
They might have a different opinion from our review. Did you get a chance to see the review us? Oh, yeah?

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,840
Yeah, and you actually have 1604 we once again right here. We've got an excuse for you to wipe your machine this week

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Every week yeah

28
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,440
It is a warm warm warm. I do here for the Linux unplugged show so thankfully

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Thankfully Wes has brought us a nice cool brusky

30
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,840
This is this is great because Noah's been saying out of ten all week long that he's been here

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,440
this is ten barrel brewing company from Portland, Oregon, I think or somewhere in that area from Oregon and

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,280
We are drinking their sinister black ale

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,040
You know what I love now Wes is people are stopping by the IRC chat room before I like the show like

34
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,880
After tech talk and stuff, and they're saying hey Chris. I got my beer

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,840
I got that today in the IRC chat room. I got my beer ready for our work everyone

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,120
I know aren't you impressed makes us happy and proud

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,780
It's pretty cool now just to give you an idea of what it's like here in the JB one studios

38
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,260
So here is the ten barrel brewing company's website. Here's what it actually looks like in real life

39
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,140
This is what the state of you get an idea here

40
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,860
You can see there's a McDonald's cup off to the right there a beer box

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,220
That's which is what was what the beer comes in some energy drinks and Chinese takeout

42
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
And of course a roll of paper towels

43
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,180
That's pretty much sums up with the JB studio is the condition of the JB studio right now in one photo

44
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,780
It is a crazy time, so you know we need to do we need more people we got to bring in more voices

45
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,640
More voices in my head time appropriate greetings virtual log

46
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,020
Whoa what I

47
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,300
Think I heard like a secret message in there like a Disney cartoon style secrets

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,660
Yeah

49
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,220
all right, so

50
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,060
This this is pretty exciting those of you who jumped right on those pre-orders for your Ubuntu M

51
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:08,100
Tablet may be receiving them in the states at least folks on the East Coast in the US seem to be receiving their BQ tablets

52
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,020
OMG Ubuntu seems extremely excited about the news Joey writes it

53
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,340
It's really here. This is the first device to offer PC convergence as BQ has noted

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,700
That's the Spanish hardware company behind the Ubuntu tablet device

55
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,780
Delivery is our plan to go underway the second week of April which means fingers crossed. You should have your tablet

56
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,460
Really by the time that 1604 is released

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,500
And it's just pretty cool. That's really cool. I really really want to get one

58
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,180
Poppy if you had a chance to try one by now nope yeah, I haven't I have not had a chance to buy one yet

59
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,780
I really want to try one soon. I'm hoping maybe someone at Linux fest will have one. Oh, that would be nice

60
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,540
Yeah, I think so, but we do have a post in our subreddit from adjunct vent event

61
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,720
And he writes he there's the pictures of it pretty neat. I like the artwork on the box there. That's cool. You know the whole like

62
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,980
Production quality of the packaging looks pretty nice, which I think is you know you don't want to see that documentation there

63
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
There's the charger

64
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Nice charge indicator powered by Ubuntu there on the first boot. That's super nice man at that convergence though

65
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,260
Yeah, I see it. Yeah, so he didn't end up. He didn't really well

66
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:26,040
So 23 hours 23 hours ago. Here's what he wrote in our subreddit, so he says so far. I pretty much hate it

67
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,780
Can anyone find a guide for installing arch on this thing oh?

68
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
No, that's oh

69
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,580
No

70
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,860
You want to hear he says the interface is awkward

71
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,060
I can't seem to figure out how to manage apps there isn't a file browser the keyboard doesn't pop up when I need

72
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,420
Regular desktop programs in LibreOffice or Firefox there are settings everywhere for syncing proprietary sites with social media

73
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,140
But nothing for own cloud. I don't know. I'm sure I'll pay

74
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,320
I'll play with it more and get used to it, but the first impressions are pretty disappointing

75
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,060
He says he did manage to find the terminal

76
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,220
He did expect to be a bit more functional and customizable

77
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,780
He feels like maybe he's being tough on it though, and it's not all that bad

78
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,340
He says for one thing the screen is beautiful and the touch apps that are on there are really slick. He says

79
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,000
So and right now. He's browsing reddit and making these posts from the built-in browser you go

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,100
He also says battery life seems to be pretty decent

81
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,100
Put more than maybe he perhaps expected so maybe after some time with it

82
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,980
You know and the tablet category is pretty broad

83
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,800
You know from like very minimally functional for things like the surface

84
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,100
So I think it's not legitimate if this is not necessarily targeting at the moment right out of the bat

85
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,140
The full-on workflow that he has in mind, but obviously it's usable for like what 90% of tablet users

86
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,620
Do which yeah browse reddit plus? I think we all sort of have I mean

87
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,960
I'm not trying to be an apologist, so I hope it doesn't come across this way because I

88
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,560
Guess here's my qualifier. It sounds like this might be a tablet that I'd be willing to buy for myself

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Probably not a tablet. I'm gonna buy for my kids

90
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,120
Even though eventually that's exactly what I'd like the Ubuntu touch experience to be is the tablet my kids could use because that seems the

91
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,040
safest option for them, but I need something you know I'm willing I

92
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Mean I you can now you can ask Noah. He's walking around the studio here. I'm a crazy art user

93
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,040
I'm I'm willing to read an end will set it up

94
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,600
I will read that wiki if I need to and so for me

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,960
It's I sort of have a different level of expectations. I'm not trying to be an apologist

96
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm just trying to say as a technical user

97
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,720
I don't mind a challenge a bit as long as I can get to a functional state where it offers some sort of functionality

98
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,920
I don't know does anybody in the mumble room have thoughts on the new bq a tablet device

99
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,640
Sure

100
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
I'd love to hear it

101
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,800
So I'm inclined to agree with you that I you know if I was if I was looking for a tablet for my kids

102
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
Today right now

103
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,360
I wouldn't buy the bq Ubuntu tablet and that I'm speaking as a canonical employee as an Ubuntu user Ubuntu enthusiast

104
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,800
I've been using Ubuntu for 10 10 plus years, and I wouldn't buy it for them because

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,180
truth be told the apps that they want are not on there and so right they

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
wouldn't be able to do the things they want and it would be a waste of my money because it'd be sat there the

107
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,840
The kind of people who are likely to buy this thing are developers

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,400
early adopters people who are going to write new apps or port existing apps or people who can

109
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,120
Cope with you know the janky edges here and there that there might be janky edges

110
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,700
That's a good title right there janky edges

111
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
Yeah

112
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,400
Yeah, and and isn't that sort of the isn't that sort of the phase it has to be and now now poppy does that?

113
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,760
Disenfranchise you a bit when you think you know the other guys are maybe

114
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Five years into iterating their experience. They're not they're way past the janky edges

115
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,960
Is that too late the other guys that have billions of dollars and thousands?

116
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,860
No, I understand that they have a huge huge tactical advantage

117
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,640
But my point is it doesn't alter the reality of it though right sure and and yeah

118
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,220
I would love for us to be more advanced down the road than we are right now

119
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,840
I would love for us to have more apps

120
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,420
I would love to have the more popular apps that you and I both know or the games or you know the ability to

121
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,700
Export from you know unity 3d or for vplay or all these other platforms to support us

122
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,900
But we've got to start somewhere and right now

123
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,840
We've got the the sum total of one tablet on the market or arguably two if you can if you count two

124
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,680
resolutions of the same device

125
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,560
one on the market so you know

126
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,720
But nobody is going to target a market that has

127
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:28,860
One device with you know some thousands of users, so we've got to be realistic, and so you know we're fine with it being

128
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,260
developer mostly experience at the moment and people who are willing to accept

129
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,860
Over-the-air updates every six weeks that give them new stuff new crack all the time

130
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,460
And you know the fact that you can make the file system read-only and you know you could apt-get

131
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:52,660
Install cow say or whatever you know emacs or whatever you want to if you're willing to accept the compromise that that gives you so

132
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,860
There's you know this swings around amounts there. It's pretty neat like there's a lot of projects

133
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,580
I could imagine where a tablet would work before

134
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,820
But it would just be easier if I didn't have to deal with like an Android build chain or other like if I can just use

135
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
the bantu system

136
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,500
For a lot of that I could definitely say you know if some of these supporting software got there like in media production and

137
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:17,500
You could have a device that was both the capture device say has a camera, right?

138
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,300
And it has the editing software that you could maybe poke at

139
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,740
in in touch mode or

140
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,100
You could at least review clips in touch mode and then when you want to edit you sit down and you could you could you?

141
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,120
Know get a full desktop experience, and you think well a tablet. That's crazy

142
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,860
But you you actually look at like devices like the latest Nexus tablet the pixel or the iPad Pro

143
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,740
They have extremely powerful processors, and you can actually edit video on these frickin tablets

144
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:50,100
But they have a horrible desktop experience right so something they can have the real desktop. Yeah

145
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,220
Mm-hmm. I do want an Ubuntu tablet soundboard as well, mr.. Devlin you have a

146
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,340
developer appeal yeah, I

147
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,740
The promise that it will be much simpler device

148
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,100
deployment

149
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,500
To do the construction of applications when you're going to the other platforms right now is just full of

150
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,860
Frameworks and these and that and it's like vanilla experience that you used to have back in in Windows

151
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,200
See Windows embedded it was simpler to deploy an app

152
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,900
Back in the window see a day. This is a harsh criticism. I'm not sure how to take that

153
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,980
No, no, no, I'm saying that this is what Ubuntu is bringing on the table that Android iOS kind of got away from yeah

154
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,460
Yeah, and so it brings that appeal that you can make your application

155
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,540
It's an easy iteration and because it's an easy iteration

156
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:50,100
I I'm I'm betting that all of the applications that get built are iterating much faster

157
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,140
We're going to iterate much faster. Just because the platform has the ease to the play faster. Yeah, yeah

158
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,780
I don't know about get Google voice support. I

159
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,700
Guess I could argue poppy. Are you aware of any Google voice tricks for Ubuntu touch devices?

160
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,160
I

161
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,980
the support for Google Hangouts

162
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:17,040
Lands in the browser very soon, but Google voice. I don't know. I'm outside the UK. So Google voice is an irrelevance to me

163
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,900
Fair enough. Yeah, I guess that's kind of a you know, you're not really you're probably better off you're better off

164
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,500
It's I have never been super impressed with Google voice and I've been using it

165
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,260
I've been a user since Grand Central so but I bet there's the SIP client you can get for Ubuntu touch

166
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:34,780
Yeah, yeah, I bet there is and I you know, yeah

167
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,920
I I actually I think that's probably the better way to go. Yeah, it just takes a little more setup

168
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,100
You know, there's an there is an in-between step

169
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,740
There is a step you could take that makes sense right now and that's our friends over at ting you guessed it

170
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,820
Linux dot ting comm is where you go to support this show, you know, I noticed on the ting road trip

171
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:58,980
I have the GSM service turned on going down us 90 except for when I was I think at sort of the top of the

172
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,840
Pass, I think I had serviced the whole darn way. Oh dang. Yeah, we use the Nexus 5

173
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,620
To do maps until the Nexus 5 started to freak out on me. I don't know what was up. So

174
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,860
New egg had a had a fifty fifty dollar off sale on the Nexus 5x. I think it's such a steal

175
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,380
Yeah, dude, so I ordered the Nexus 5x while I was leaving to go on the road trip

176
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
don't know while I was on the road trip and

177
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,620
And so my Nexus 5 ended up just the batteries totally shot, you know, it's it's just old and stuff

178
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,500
So let this be the wake, right?

179
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,660
So I just popped the ting out the ting sim out of the Nexus 5 and I went to go pop it into the Nexus

180
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,820
5x pop that ting, right?

181
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
It's like it's a

182
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,840
Like they cannot get these SIM cards small enough anymore. Like the SIM card is tiny for the Nexus 5 that really is

183
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,320
Yeah, and so I'm like, yeah, and I'm like, ah, what am I gonna do? My SIM cards too big

184
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,060
I might I got I can't pop the thing. Oh, geez. Oh

185
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,460
But you know what ting has thought of this stuff ting is an experienced

186
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,740
Experienced mobile service provider. You can just you can just pop the SIM one more smaller. You just pop it

187
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,660
This is all true, I don't understand why it's so funny because it's all true and

188
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,620
So anyways

189
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,300
Now my 5x is activated

190
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,940
Okay, all right, so I hope I'll be the pro I'll pull it together

191
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,620
Anyways, now I have my GSM ting sim in my 5x and it's on the ting network now

192
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
I'll tell you one thing. I've noticed right away

193
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,740
It has two front-facing stereo speakers. I am very excited about that

194
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:00,840
Also, it feels a little bit better and the fingerprint reader is nice. So that's my like, oh, it's real nice

195
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,940
I've only very impressed

196
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,180
I've only had I've only had the 5x literally for an hour

197
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,340
Because I ordered it while I was on the road trip and just got unboxed it and it's been installing updates the entire time

198
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,580
I have had it but they'd like that

199
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,140
Well, so the fact that it's here's what I here's what I just love about it

200
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,620
I went on Newegg because there was a sale and I ordered it. I

201
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:28,460
Never called anyone at ting. I never logged into the website. I just pulled the SIM card out and I put it in a totally unlocked

202
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,540
Totally straight Google experience 5x put it in there and now I have phone service

203
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,660
It took I mean as long as it I thought carriers that would not work

204
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,620
It is so nice and and now I just pay for what I use. It's six dollars for the line

205
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,860
I just transferred it over to this device. I I love it

206
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,500
I end up paying like 40 bucks a month for like three lines

207
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,660
It's great minutes messages megabytes to add them up. You only pay for what you use ting is great. No contracts

208
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,140
No early termination fees and they have a great control panel if you do need it

209
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Oh, I could tell you all about that

210
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,340
But you know what? I think I'm gonna do

211
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,580
I'm gonna say go to linux.com. That'll give you $25 off a device or

212
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,580
Or go get $50 off of 5x if the new if new egg still has that sale going and I think actually even the play

213
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,340
Store has the sale directly. Yep, you know about this. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, so I've been considering you should do it

214
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,380
You should do it because I think the 5x is a nice upgrade from the 5

215
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,780
I think it's a really so I mean you can play with it when it's done here

216
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,220
But I want to at least log into it once for goodness sake

217
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,700
But as it won't bond with you USB see it now when you plug it in it says rapid charging

218
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,980
Oh rapid charging. Yeah, that's sweet

219
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,660
So I think this is I think you know with that with that sale and pay for what you use service from ting

220
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,060
This is such a no-brainer, but they have all the great devices

221
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,300
You can check it out from feature phone SIM cards all the way up and they have a wonderful blog. I

222
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,860
Like this post about minimizing your mobile data usage in YouTube. I think they're like they're just like us

223
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,340
They're they use the phone the same way. Do you need 1080p when you're you know?

224
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,740
Like you probably don't need 1080p when you're on your mobile device and you're on you're on you're on LTE

225
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,340
So they just it's a bunch of great tips. They have some good videos posted over there, too

226
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,380
So just start by going to linux.ting.com that supports this show gets you the discount

227
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,420
You can do that anywhere in the world support this show big

228
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,540
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program linux.ting.com

229
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,260
alright, so the Linux fest Northwest mayhem is approaching and

230
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,860
I think maybe if you're watching Linux action show this week

231
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,700
You might have saw sort of the state of chaos this caused when we do a new Linux build

232
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,380
Which we want to get done before Linux fest Northwest and it is a massive undertaking and of course

233
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:45,420
Of course West things never quite go as you plan you can research the parts

234
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,620
You do your best

235
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,620
You can assign tasks to staff to do research for you and then buy what they recommend and then they blame you for buying it

236
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,980
You can do all of those things and get blamed regardless, but

237
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,500
You cannot accommodate for how they build things today now

238
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,380
I could explain our woes and I could explain our trials

239
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,940
But I thought maybe what we do is a little hot chicken dance swap first and maybe somebody else could tell you

240
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
Oh

241
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,340
Where they truly intro truly worthy

242
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,020
So I got here and there was a bunch of parts that were ordered and

243
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:43,980
we're working on building various things and trying to get various things working and so I

244
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:51,260
Just I am I am like kind of like a whirlwind and then I and I get things done and I worry about the consequences

245
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,340
Yeah, yeah

246
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,540
I do

247
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,380
I just you know like if I open a box and you know the thing is they could make this stuff a little easier to

248
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,420
Do if you know when a video card just came like if the video card just came in like a simple box

249
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,060
But no, they have to have all this plastic around and they've got a guy like, you know, it's fancy manuals

250
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,220
So they've got discs and that's all stuff. I don't need I don't care about and so the first bit of it went pretty well

251
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,020
I'm filming like every part and trying to give you guys a real good idea of exactly what's going on and then

252
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,260
We went to turn on the computer now. I built a fair amount of computers myself and

253
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:29,760
I have always built the computer and turn it on and it just works now Rekai tells me

254
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,520
I know what you should do is test each individual component like outside of the case and I'm like

255
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,600
That sounds like a waste of time. Like who's gonna sound like I just build the computer. I'll just pay attention to it

256
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,960
Right, it'll be fine. So I built the computer bring it into the studio disconnect all of Chris's nonsense that he needs to do

257
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,200
a little podcast

258
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,240
Plug in the computer and turn it on no boot. So then I'm like, wow

259
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,760
So I take all of his stuff that he needs to do his podcast out in living room where it's not so hot and I

260
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,480
Can see what I'm doing and plug it in out there and still not working

261
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,720
So then I start taking individual parts out as the video card was at the RAM

262
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,080
Is it the so finally I get down to just the motherboard and I read on the motherboards website that

263
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:14,260
Supposedly the motherboard is supposed to be able to update from the BIOS if you plug into a special secret super secret USB port

264
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,640
Yes, I heard of such things. I download actually I didn't download it. It asked the beard to do it beard downloads

265
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Onto the US that's the same as I did

266
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,280
By the way, I was not the one that picked this stuff out so I

267
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,660
I we've done we download this stuff onto the USB port

268
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,460
Under the USB flash drive and I stick it in the computer turns on for like three seconds and powers off then turns on for

269
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:39,540
Three seconds and powers off then turns out three seconds and powers off. That is no good. Well, that's not updating well, so

270
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,900
Then I'm like, well, let's just open the second motherboard because we got two of these and let's see if the second one is any

271
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,780
Different right? Well, that's good troubleshooting. It's having the second one and by this time I'm like

272
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
stinking

273
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,740
I

274
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,260
Hold on if you have easier phone in your pocket, no

275
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,980
You could just play it but of course we'd have to beep it though a lot. Yeah

276
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,860
Hmm, maybe we'll save it for another time

277
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,380
There's a lot of swearing but it would be really great to play it. But okay

278
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,700
All right

279
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:13,460
So I was less than please because by now it's like so this is of course we always figured to do this stuff at like

280
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,380
You know five in the morning

281
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,540
That's the most productive time and Rekai's upset. I didn't I would I see upset about it

282
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,660
What I didn't three under the bus

283
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,060
Anyway, so anyway, so what I did home no, so what I did was I

284
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,800
What I did was I

285
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,260
Opened the second one up and realized that the second one is just as defective as the first one now

286
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:42,300
I'm not very happy about this entire process and I just you're telling me we had

287
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,380
We had two defective gigabyte motherboards

288
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,140
Like I mean like the first little thought that Chris you're not gonna date. Here's what I here's what I here's the message

289
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
I get Chris. You're not gonna be happy

290
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:59,620
I'm like what both motherboards are dead. I'm like, I'm like no not both motherboards something wrong. No, not both motherboards

291
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,740
He's like, yeah, trust us. We've tried it. So and you know, you got a feel for Noah here Noah

292
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,020
Here, let's all right. So a disclaimer. This was never ended to enter. It was it was never intended to air

293
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,180
It's all right. It's all right. I don't care Rekai can bleep, right?

294
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,660
Or maybe for maybe we should just say for the next

295
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,940
How long is this clip? That's about two minutes. So just if you have small children around

296
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,420
Turn this up. I usually try to keep it pretty family-friendly

297
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,980
No, you gotta understand this is like three in the morning five in the morning

298
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Okay, and I have to get up and do last the next day because of course we don't plan this

299
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,300
This is Saturday night and so and this is all there's a lot there

300
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,060
You know

301
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:41,580
Basically if this Linux big build doesn't work out we might end up having to switch to a Mac for this work and that that

302
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,620
Is really I think what is driving Noah's passion about right and so then I will climb a clock tower

303
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:51,180
And I don't want to climb a clock tower. All right, so you've been warned. Okay for your ears earmuffs put on your

304
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,640
Okay, let me show you why you should never buy a fucking gigabyte motherboard

305
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,820
You're supposed to be able to update this son of a bitch

306
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:06,360
By plugging a fucking flash drive into the white thing what you should just

307
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah, I should but I'm too pissed to record it for the show

308
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,700
Oh, you notice the fan spins up

309
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
And then it stops

310
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,700
And then it stops

311
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,260
Then it spins up and then it stops

312
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,420
So I have been stripping components because they're but we we're two of these goddamn things

313
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,740
And I this one I got completely assembled because I'm used to using Asus that just fucking works

314
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:43,420
And then we bought these two fucking things. I didn't buy them Chris bought them. Ooh about this but

315
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:52,260
It just does this just they start up and stop and so we have researched the fuck out of them apparently

316
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,640
They just fucking blow and so they just restart constantly even with all the components removed. I mean I put the RAM back in but

317
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,980
Fucking blows. No, so don't buy gigabyte ever

318
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,660
particularly the

319
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
The hell's this goddamn piece of shit

320
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,260
x99 SLI

321
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
trash total trash

322
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Merry Christmas

323
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:25,420
So that was my not never intended to be aired but like I was like, you know, you know people don't understand

324
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,900
You know when you spend from you know

325
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,180
9 10 p.m. Until 4 or 5 in the morning and then you know, and then constantly there's this there's this threat of

326
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,940
The antithesis of your being being the only alternative

327
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,420
that I that you get to a point you get really driven to get something done and then and then when you realize that you

328
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,140
Are being cock-blocked not by not by the inability of your operating system

329
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,360
which is supposed to be where the troubleshooting and problem is supposed to be no you are being cock-blocked by a

330
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,700
a totally useless manufacturer that manufactures something that is better suited to adjusting the height of your monitor then functioning as an entire

331
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,260
System board to connect all of your components not even very good at that

332
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:08,020
It's no because it doesn't turn out it would the best thing I could do with it was it was it was a decent

333
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,580
Nightlight, that's really what it was good for

334
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,700
So basically then and really I like Chris is laughing

335
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,580
But it honestly has caused him a lot of stress and trouble because now he has to the burdens on money to get new

336
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:24,220
A replacements of that and of course those come and UPS is so incompetent that they managed to break one of those kind of sort

337
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,500
of we're kind of in the process of dealing with that and so

338
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,500
You know, it's very very well

339
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,620
Maybe that I may end up ordering a third one because I think at this point it's Chris has tapped out

340
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,000
So but to until we have a chance to return all of these things and of course if you've ever ordered anything with new egg

341
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,820
You know that they're not as awesome as Amazon where I can just tell them that it didn't work and then they take it back

342
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,300
No, there's got to be a process and I probably have to send it to gigabyte

343
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,620
and they're gonna tell me that I did something wrong and try and update something and I'm gonna tell them that they can take their

344
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
motherboard and

345
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,180
Yeah, exactly or they can stick it in their ear and then

346
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,800
They and then they can take that and then get rid of it cuz I don't really want to look at it anymore

347
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,260
But I think when we get done we depend on a positive note when we get done

348
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,780
I think what we're gonna find is that Chris is going to have

349
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,620
Two amazing machines that are going to fundamentally change the way that we're able to do productions here in the studio

350
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,340
But I think it will all be worth the headache and troubles. Uh,

351
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:41,940
Yeah, I think that I think it's all content and at the end of the day it's all come on guys you're in my house

352
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:52,260
It's been crazy it's been crazy. It's the Linux fest Northwest. You guys know it's coming up. We are preparing like another website

353
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,260
I know it is just makes me happy. You know, we were I think it was hand that asked me on the way back from

354
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,800
Picking him up in Idaho. He said why is it in Bellingham and not Seattle?

355
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,580
And I think that might probably crosses a lot of people's mind because when you think of this area you think of you think of

356
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Seattle and the Space Needle and all that crap

357
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,040
Well, first of all, it's I think the core reason is because it's put on by the Bellingham Linux users group

358
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,580
you know, we have a virtual lug here and

359
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,100
They have a real they have a have a real lug there and I think this is one of the things

360
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,620
It's pretty unique about the Linux community and other open source

361
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,380
communities now as well that have taken a page from this is

362
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,300
They are capable of putting on events like Linux fest Northwest self scale and you know

363
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,860
Of course a bunch of others that I I don't go to as well. Obviously, it's pretty impressive. Yeah

364
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,340
Yeah, it really is. And so that's one of the reasons why it's in Bellingham, but it is genuinely one of the prettiest areas

365
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,780
in the country

366
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,300
It is really

367
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,140
Yeah, it is great. You know, it is truly gorgeous there

368
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,900
And if you have an opportunity to make it out, it is really worth it meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

369
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,480
We have a meetup page. We're gonna be organizing the switch competition, which you guys know is coming up

370
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,500
Even though Emma's been Emma hacked us last week during the Linux action show. It was rough. We got hacked art by team Emma

371
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,220
And they've been out in Denver, Colorado good. They've been practicing Denver, Colorado teams

372
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,700
You know, there's you know, as you know, there's betting taking place behind the scenes here in JB

373
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,380
Yeah, yeah

374
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:25,140
I am I I have a I I have a lot riding on this also we in today in tech talk today

375
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,140
We decided that if we got to a certain level of patrons on

376
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,540
Patreon.com slash today that no one I would wear he'd wear a window shirt and I'll wear an Apple shirt

377
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Yeah. Yeah, so that's in tech talk today. If you guys curious about that. Yeah, we're really we're looking fun

378
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:45,780
And we have more crew showing up tomorrow, which is pretty exciting with so there is a project out there

379
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,660
that promises to bring Libre office C file the KDE group and

380
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:58,780
Maybe so I'm guessing some own cloud back-end code bring it all together to give you a Google Docs and Google apps like experience

381
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:03,700
Using all Libre software, so we're going to talk about that because you and I were poking at this

382
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,660
Noah's been poking at this and I want to talk about it for a little bit

383
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,420
So and it's probably something you could run on a digital ocean droplet

384
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:10,860
Oh, yeah

385
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,500
Hey, oh if you think about anything if you think about it

386
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,480
You probably could do unplugged as our promo code to use over digital ocean, you know as you're gearing up for Ubuntu 1604

387
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,680
You'll notice that they have new guides coming out on Ubuntu 1604. It is a great hosting provider built on top of Linux

388
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,740
They use KVM for the virtualizer SSDs for all the drives tier one bandwidth

389
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,700
They have locations all over the world if you want to deploy images or entire application stacks or just docker containers. Oh

390
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,940
Digital ocean has got that do unplugged is the promo code one word ten dollar credit now their basic rig

391
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,380
$5 a month

392
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,940
That's nothing

393
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,420
$5 a month you get 512 megabytes of RAM

394
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:55,580
I owe a terabyte a transfer 20 gigabyte SSD because they all SSDs and I love the fact that it is

395
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:01,500
Blazing fast even though even the $5 rig is blazing fast like log in there and do a package update and just

396
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,880
Just just update the package cache and witness the gorgeous speed that you get

397
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,380
I love awesome, you know, I've been playing around with track car

398
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,620
It was obvious to put that up on a digital ocean droplet when I wanted to convince know to use sync thing

399
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,100
You know what? He does he puts it up on a digital ocean droplet natural and like an animal

400
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,740
He just FTP's up to the digital ocean droplet and then let's it sync to me like some kind of animal

401
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,820
I hope that's SFTP

402
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,440
Me too Wes me too. Hey Wes, did you know that they have introduced now don't tell anybody

403
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:35,980
But did you know they have introduced a sign up for the block storage program? Oh, yeah, I think that's gonna be really cool

404
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,460
Yeah, and like I was sign up right now like I was mentioning earlier

405
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,700
They do have great tutorials now like how to upgrade to a boon to 16 before how to take it engine X and let's a crypt

406
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:48,940
I'm 1604 and go look at their new command-line client to manage your digital ocean. I'm so excited about that

407
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,700
I know I know me too drop down terminal has never been happier digital ocean comm just use the promo code D

408
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
Unplugged use it just like that

409
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:06,260
Do you unplugged over a digital ocean comm one word and you can sing it when you type it in that also it doesn't give

410
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
you a more like

411
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,220
credit on the account

412
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,500
But it makes you feel good. Oh, it really does make you feel deal

413
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,220
Unplugged

414
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,500
one word

415
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,540
digital ocean comm all right, so this week on the Linux action show

416
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,060
We had a candidate that we bumped

417
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,940
We were gonna talk about this online libre office

418
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,300
thing that exists it's called

419
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:40,140
Open 365 dot IO obviously a take on office 365 create

420
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:47,260
It says create the first open-source cloud with libre office online online libre office online plus C file plus KDE

421
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:53,340
Yeah, yeah, it promises to bring like libre to the online web space

422
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,860
Oh

423
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,060
You know what I got to do. I got to hook up the audio so you get well

424
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,820
You don't really need the audio you can hear the audio in the background

425
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,780
I so tell me West though when you look at that does that does that remind you of own cloud a little bit it really does

426
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,700
Yeah, I'm so I'm thinking they must be using some own cloud on the back end

427
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,020
They're using C file for the file distribution now. I know no you and I had it

428
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,940
We're looking at this too. What were your impressions of this sort of online libre office thing here?

429
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:23,980
You know my thing is that I've actually I've been excited about office 365 simply because it runs perfectly fine on Linux and so those

430
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:30,260
The dorks that insist on using office products that don't want to use a real office suite, then I have a solution for

431
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:36,300
but the more that I use things like like giggly docs and the more I use things like

432
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:42,780
Office 365 I find myself thinking you know for certain collaboration things and for certain you know I just need access to

433
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,060
You know to compose a document a little bit note more than what you know a traditional note-taking

434
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,820
Application offers that is the kind of time where I really want would like to have a cloud-based office suite

435
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,340
And it's not something that would be a primary driver, but it's definitely something that I would be using to you know

436
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,300
Maybe maybe even for showdocs

437
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,700
I'm probably not because there's probably not markdown support

438
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,500
But certainly if you know you could add that you and I were collaborating on a letter a couple days ago

439
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,060
And that would have been really useful to be able to have this you know all this thing opposed

440
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,380
And you can make edits, and I can make edits and stuff like that

441
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,880
We can keep you know the you know the rich text formats and stuff like that. Yeah

442
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,960
Yeah, and not having to have Google Drive would be nice. I think what what I find what I find sort of

443
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,920
interesting about this and also sort of off-putting at the same time is

444
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,640
It clearly seems like you're bringing a Qt application or something like this

445
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,800
Into the web browser. Yeah, that's weird

446
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
Like it's got the full regular menu

447
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,320
It's got a file menu and edit menu a view menu like it's LibreOffice embedded in the website

448
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,120
and I guess what what strikes me about that is

449
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,480
Hmm

450
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,120
Look at that though. Yeah, it does seem very functional

451
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,480
It does seem very functional, but what strikes me about it is it doesn't seem forward-facing. It seems like right

452
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
It's sort of what we have now. It's not

453
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,880
Trying new things that work. Yeah, and I mean not to be this guy

454
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,000
But if I have my bqabuntu touch tablet this doesn't really look like it's gonna work in that

455
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,480
I it

456
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
feels a little bit like

457
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,480
bringing a

458
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,080
Another desktop environments application over to say your desktop environment just something's quite not quite there about it

459
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,440
gigglydocs

460
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,080
Zoho and

461
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,920
Others they feel like they should be online

462
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,760
document editors that feels like you've taken a web desktop application and

463
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:41,120
Integrated it into own cloud and called it something that stuff looks like it's web, but you're right once you start editing. Yeah. Yeah

464
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,480
Yeah, I'm curious. I'm curious if anyone in the Mamba room has had a chance to look at this at all

465
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,800
And if you guys have any opinions on it because it's it's been getting some press coverage recently

466
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,920
And we've been debating whether to cover it in the shows or not

467
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,080
Yeah, I don't think anybody's really played within our community

468
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,500
But Noah, and I were you know this one thing that really jumps out at me about it is if I could self-host it

469
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,200
Hmm. I probably would prepare the show most the time on my desktop device anyways mm-hmm. Yep

470
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,320
I mean, so if I can self-host it. Yeah, you know we switched over to pretty much using simple note no, and I have to prep

471
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,960
last and

472
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,000
It just gets a simpler cleaner faster environment

473
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,560
And we both prefer having a dedicated desktop application to do this so nice

474
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
That's one of the things is I I guess

475
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,200
I'm I'm ready for us to move beyond cloud integration meaning. It's something that's embedded in your web browser

476
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,880
I think okay. I think I'm getting to the core of what bothers me about this

477
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,520
I think this is a great idea, and I'm really glad they're doing it

478
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,080
but when I get to the core of what bothers me about it is I am I am I'm ready for all of the features of

479
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,080
cloud integration and syncing to be just

480
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,240
Part of a desktop experience. Yep

481
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:57,280
I want something like simple note and Chrome web browser that seems to be fully in sync with a back-end cloud service

482
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,840
But the front-end representation the way that that way that result is displayed to me is a native

483
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,320
Application that looks right in my desktop environment, and I don't want to have to run a runtime of my browser

484
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,800
I don't want my browser to become my runtime and

485
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,400
If that's if that even means that things like electron projects sort of hide all of that from me

486
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,480
Then they split they still accomplish that well, okay. I'm gonna try to build my next rig with more RAM

487
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
I mean, I'm ready for that. Let's bring it

488
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,880
But I want it

489
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,400
I want it in a desktop experience not crammed into a web page

490
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,560
And I think that's kind of what where this gets all the desktop integrations and full support for

491
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,960
Dragon drop and native speed native speed it launches as fast as my SSD can feed the bits to the CPU and as fast as

492
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,280
That can be blasted to my screen

493
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,120
I don't want anything in between that and I want it to come as fast as possible because honestly

494
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,720
That's why I buy a new computer. That's why I build new rigs

495
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,160
That's why I consider playing with the Linux scheduler

496
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,120
That's why I want to do a RAM disk for my Chrome browser, right?

497
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,760
I want it to be as fast as possible all the time. You've worked to get done

498
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,480
That's right

499
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,760
And so if you could make it if you could make a local native application that

500
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,440
Instantly launches but yet pulls in the latest data from the web. That's from like an API for a cloud service

501
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm all about that and that's the perfect sweet spot for me mumble room any thoughts before I let Noah jump in with his thoughts

502
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,240
All right, Noah, they don't have any thoughts

503
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,160
Do you have any kind of closing thoughts on unlike the way that because I know one of the things you and I talked about

504
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Is well, it kind of looks like they've just take LibreOffice and put in a web browser

505
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,040
But I have a sense that that isn't that probably doesn't bother you

506
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,520
It doesn't bother me because if you think about it, that's I mean really that's what we look for

507
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,440
And that's the that's the that is the very essence of open source

508
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,600
Somebody created a really good cloud based web browser system, which is own cloud. Somebody created a really great office suite

509
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:51,080
That's LibreOffice and somebody took a and B and combined them together to make office 365 and made basically a patent infringement calling it

510
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,040
Open 365 and they'll probably have to change

511
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,400
The great news about report on it then yeah, right

512
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,040
But the great news about that is that we have essentially

513
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,720
We have we've taken two great open source projects and combine them if that's in fact what they're doing and really I don't really care

514
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,240
How they're doing it

515
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,480
But even if nothing else the fact that we have the option at least I can tell

516
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,160
Clients when I tell them you should switch a LibreOffice and they go well, I'm really into the office

517
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,300
365 because I like doing everything on the web and in the cloud and that's great and it's backed up and accessible from home

518
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
I have an answer to that

519
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,440
That's about what they sound like

520
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,720
And and it's better than Google. I don't have to ask. I don't have to tell them, you know

521
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,800
You know how unprofessional it sounds to me to walk in and say I have a great solution for you

522
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,680
Let me show you how we're gonna do

523
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,440
This is how I tell people to do it what I'm going to recommend to you is I think you should

524
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,480
Go to gmail.com and sign up for a Google account and use the bill. That just doesn't sound like that is not

525
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,840
That's not providing a solution. And the other problem is is I have zero control

526
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,280
It's not like Google works with me to say these are the things that are upcoming

527
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,020
So by the way, make sure your clients are aware that this menu is going away or that menu is great

528
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
you know, that's a great point because

529
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:03,620
Even when you're giving them Google Drive and Google Docs and a Google Apps account if you're through business what you're really saying is

530
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,760
Even though it's easy. Here's another service. You need to manage. Here's another service. You need to pay

531
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:15,400
Here's another thing. You need to keep track of users on so that way you're not paying too much. Here's another thing xyz and

532
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:22,520
When you come at them with here's an implementation as a service provider that I can give you that is an entirely managed package

533
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,940
You write me one check a month. I take care of all user management all features all security updates all integrations

534
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,760
Where do I sign right? That's it. And you maybe if they hope if they allow you to host this you could do that on your

535
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,480
own

536
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,480
So that's that's a point well taken though

537
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,280
be interesting to see if it sees deploys to wear something where like, you know, maybe paying too much for like the

538
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,560
365 hosted in the secure data center where you have like really secure documents and you need you want the features of 365

539
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Yeah, you need it to be internal to your land, you know, I wonder

540
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,280
North Ranger could this be something that local ISPs and different people in this space could come up and say hey

541
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,520
Yeah, you've heard of Google, but what about this and they could sell it. Is that kind of what you're thinking North Ranger?

542
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,800
Yeah from what you've just described. I think back in the day when you used to sign up for an ISP

543
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,560
It was your local ISP. They offered you email. They maybe offered you a shell account, you know, so

544
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:16,760
You know

545
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,560
Maybe it's not the actual ISP that you have because apparently today's ISPs are more

546
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,140
Interested in bundling a phone and a TV with you

547
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,080
But let's move ISPs more to like a VPS provider where you not only have email

548
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,200
but oh, by the way, we'll host your sync account or

549
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,440
your calendar or your photos and

550
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,040
You know use I'm not saying you have to use own cloud

551
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,920
But something like that where you know, you can be you can host it yourself

552
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
but when you go offline or

553
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
You know whatever like your ISP can you know have the canonical copy so to speak?

554
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,520
That's it. That's actually an interesting idea and also maybe a great way

555
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,640
What I what I would what I would love about that kind of business is

556
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,560
It's a way for open source to get deployments. It's a way for a company to make money using open source software

557
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,640
And then that means fixes or start going upstream bug reports start coming in

558
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,960
Yeah, and it doesn't answer all your security, you know problems

559
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,600
But at least in it like your ISP is someone you pay, you know

560
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,880
Like that's in their interest to help you out

561
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,440
So it should at least you know

562
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,480
They're not necessarily doing all the kind of my data mining that someone else might be now shots were fired in native versus web apps rotten

563
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,960
Do you want to close out the thought on just commenting on that a lot of the times?

564
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,120
The web apps actually look really nice and I don't really care if it's native or not as long as it doesn't look like garbage

565
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,960
So if it if it's if it's gonna run like an electron thing

566
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,600
I'd prefer it not because it's not gonna be as fast

567
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,040
But at least they look good and they run well, so I'm okay with it. What happens?

568
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,840
What do you do rotten when you have two?

569
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,240
Replications that are web apps and you need to move back and forth them and you're moving data back and forth now

570
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,960
I've got if I like these I think that works if you're using one or maybe even two

571
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,720
but when you start to get a plethora when I had

572
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,240
When I had own cloud and I had Evernote and I had you know Google Docs and I had you know

573
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,120
Whatever else you start to get like four or five different these web apps open wonder list for example

574
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,000
Moving between them is almost like they're I start to eliminate the ability of the operating system to manage my window

575
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,820
So I can't don't have you know along the side of unity. I can't switch between those applications now

576
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,040
I have to rely on the tab switching inside of the web browser

577
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Well to be fair

578
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,440
There are window managers that can do that

579
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:42,760
But I would say that the art that that example is not very good because all of those essentially accomplish the same thing

580
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,000
So I think the issue is that you are using multiple like you Evernote and Google Docs and stuff

581
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,440
They're basically all the same

582
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,440
So if you were using a to-do list editor or a to-do list web app and then a web app for like telegram

583
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,300
Those would be completely different things. You wouldn't have to have that but I actually do kind of synthesize synthesize

584
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,620
I do actually kind of connect with what Noah is saying because

585
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,000
I have found myself like ripping tabs off all the time and all right

586
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,480
Oh, yeah

587
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,560
Me too this tab goes on this monitor now and I'm gonna I'm gonna I'll put this tab over here

588
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,240
I'll put that I'll shrink this tab and I'll float in them on top

589
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,680
Yeah, it's getting to be the point now where and the other thing I find myself doing in all the time now is right now

590
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,040
I have three tabs pinned. I always have at least three tabs up

591
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,600
Yeah, it's getting to be right there and and and I started to feel like they're forcing me to live a Chrome OS existence

592
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,120
a little bit

593
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,680
Well, they kind of are but there's also solutions in Linux

594
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,400
native applications that can provide a

595
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,020
you know direct connection with a window manager for example instead of having like the tabs being splayed out and then you have like

596
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,020
multiple different Chrome

597
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:54,660
There's a couple different options too that I've used to basically give a dedicated process to each web app, right?

598
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,100
We talked about that last year with the yeah, apricity and that's nice that works

599
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,780
For one apricity is actually using something that's still using Chrome, right?

600
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:11,980
Created by peppermint OS which is interesting. You should check that out. But the the reason I

601
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,980
Was talking about is that?

602
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,460
Chromium's web app solution is terrible

603
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:24,100
You have one session that is still like every single web app you make with chromium or with ice

604
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:29,500
It's still one session. So it's not organized at all. It's not separated. It's all just in math

605
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,300
I've run into that problem connected with that group if you look at epiphany and

606
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
Midori both of those have

607
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:41,860
Web app built in so they're all separate individual sessions for each web app you create. There's an

608
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,700
Web app manager for each one of those and there's also

609
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,220
Ubuntu has their own browser that you can use that was created for the Ubuntu touch

610
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:50,460
Yeah

611
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,420
But also works on the desktop and you can do the same thing and create different sessions

612
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:00,540
So they become like real processes as also it's also interesting to see like a lot of different open source

613
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Wrapper applications, like what's that? What's that slack one called scud or something, right? Yeah, there's different and then Noah and I were playing with a

614
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,540
messenger

615
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,540
Application that is just a web app

616
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:19,820
And what it does is it uses one application and multiple tabs to integrate every messaging service from slack to telegram to what's-app

617
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,860
Everything that has any kind of web Skype anything has any web app all in one application

618
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,140
and that's kind of interesting because then it takes care of like

619
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:34,540
Now notification badges and stuff like that for you for all those different services, but and brykes it off into its own process

620
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,060
Which is kind of interesting

621
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:41,540
There was one that was created a couple years ago for Linux. That was awesome. And then it was discontinued. It was called fogger

622
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,140
Yeah, I know I did and you know, and and that's sort of why I've tried to recreate

623
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,060
Just using the the built-in Chrome thing

624
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,740
But yeah, you're right. It's not it's not the same. Yeah, and sometimes I'll use some stuff and yeah

625
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,060
If they made the sessions properly, it would be great

626
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,340
But like the fact that if you create a Netflix session if you open it in Chrome or you open it in the web app

627
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,940
It's still the same thing. So you're still in the same sessions

628
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,540
You can't have like for example

629
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,140
If you have two different Twitter accounts that you want to open up Twitter

630
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,140
You can't log into the separately with the chromium solution

631
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,140
But if you did it with like epiphany or you did it with Midori you can do that

632
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:24,540
And I think the Midori is probably one of the best options. Yeah, I

633
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:29,740
Try I tried Midori for a little while in it. I was starting to get it eventually would run out of memory. Listen

634
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,340
let's class it up in here for a second because I

635
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,060
Want to open the floodgates I want to talk about our Ubuntu 1604 review. I've gotten

636
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:46,940
Thanks, nice, I've already gotten like several like geez you and Noah really got into it kind of comments

637
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,340
And they don't even know the half of it. We got into it again today just out in the living room

638
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,140
So we got to talk about this so we got it we got to bring it up a notch

639
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:02,740
Got a clear space for our discussion. So first I want to thank Linux Academy

640
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,740
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

641
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:11,460
Got a clear space for our discussion. So first I want to thank Linux Academy

642
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,700
I want to welcome them into this episode of Linux unplugged episode 141

643
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,940
why don't you welcome them to at linux academy.com slash unplugged go there and

644
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:27,140
Celebrate their support of your unplugged program by visiting linux academy.com slash unplugged

645

2369 self-paced courses

649
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:47,020
Instructing married you're gonna learn something. I mean it rubs by accident accidentally learning at linuxacademy.com slash

650
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,780
Scenario based labs are totally badass because they put you in the middle of something that's real

651
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,660
God damn it. What is you just crew at least all of today?

652
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,540
If that doesn't work they have instructor mentor which I think you're gonna need you

653
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:15,220
For listening to this, but they'll set you right and you'll learn but remember it doesn't matter what we say because the music class

654
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,220
Just want you to know while this music is on but I don't hate you I

655
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,980
I think you're wrong about a bunch you but we can still be friends you can use arch

656
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:33,760
Yeah, except for I did back you into agreeing with me earlier. Anyways, Linux academy.com slash unplug go there learn about their great and server exercises

657
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,900
developing Linux

658
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,500
Applications learning about Linux firewalls and fundamentals routing all those things

659
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:45,880
Python development PHP opens that great chef tutorials up there. Thank you for mentioning that you're right

660
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:52,420
They are really good ones Amazon Web Services and the server is included. Oh, man. I know right? It's great

661
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,660
7-plus distros. It's

662
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,740
It's a wonderland Linux Academy comm slash unplug go invest in yourself

665
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:14,520
Slash unplugged. All right, we're headed out of here. It is time for us to follow up on our Ubuntu 1604

666
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,460
review

667
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:22,480
Now there are many things to discuss in regards to this review and I want to cover all of them as much as we can

668
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,480
If you have not had a chance, it's not a prerequisite, but I would invite you to listen to episode 413 or watch

669
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
episode 413 of the Linux action show

670
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,400
Where we did our review and just as a background because I don't know if I really went into this in the show or not

671
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
but uh

672
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,400
Basically every machine in my life except for that one right there that bonobo got reloaded to Ubuntu 1604 Wow

673
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:51,420
Ubuntu edition was the one I ran with the longest and then I put the neon packages on there because I loves me the

674
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,420
fresh neon and

675
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,360
It I guessed actually going back for they really started the day. I got the Apollo. Yep. I

676
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:05,800
Got I got really excited by what a good implementation of Ubuntu Mate 1510 on the Apollo was and then as soon as it felt

677
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:12,280
Reasonable, I brought that up to 1604 and then I started bringing all my other machines to 1604 and yeah

678
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,440
And so I spent you know, I spent a real solid month in Ubuntu

679
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,560
which for me was a big transition again going back and

680
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,640
But part of the reason I wanted to do it is because I really wanted to spend

681
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
You know when you just do it for a couple of days

682
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:33,240
You get totally overwhelmed by all the little rough edges that are just different, you know

683
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,680
Just because it's not it's not comfortable and familiar. It just it feels abrasive

684
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,360
But if you actually spend time with it you you learn. Oh, yeah, I do it this way this now and the true character

685
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,160
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and so, you know, I really wanted to give it its due

686
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,200
and so when we walked away I walked away with some some impressions that I had reflected on for that whole month and

687
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,320
That would those definitely took the stage of the review

688
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,600
I think that the bulk of the stage, but there's a lot of things covered in the

689
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,520
1604 review and I was curious Wes

690
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,000
If you why don't we do this if you be up for this?

691
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,040
Let's get your impressions sort of at the top

692
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Then let's go to the mumble room

693
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,120
Get some of their updates and follow-up and their impressions and then towards the end of this shenanigans

694
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
Let's talk about some of the things that have changed

695
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,400
Already or fixed already since Sunday's episode of the show so it like a full spectrum coverage

696
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:33,320
So as follow-up to our 1604 review Wes, what are your sort of out of the first gate impressions of this brand new?

697
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,200
LTS release. Okay, so first for context both in work and kind of at home

698
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:43,720
I both skip to work the 1404 release and then that I use that at home, but I didn't use too much

699
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,560
So I guess this is kind of a this is kind of like for

700
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,280
For you a huge upgrade. Yeah, it really is a huge upgrade. That's an interesting perspective

701
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,400
So you've been stuck at 1204 for years and a majority, you know, I use some 1404

702
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,240
I do have like one system at 1510, but but yes, there's a lot of 1204 and so

703
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,200
There there's so much new and so much I'm excited about

704
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,640
I mean, I've used Ubuntu on system D before but I just I love doing you know

705
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,680
System control status and just seeing that breakdown. It's I'm really excited to see it at servers on work

706
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:18,080
Now did you play with the in-between ones? Yeah, I played with them a little bit. Okay, you just didn't use them wise

707
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,760
I just yeah, I didn't really deploy them. Yeah, and I'm kind of in the same boat

708
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,100
I mean, I didn't I traditionally just stick to the LTS, right, you know

709
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,520
And so and and it seems like a good point right now where when once it's out

710
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,160
It'll have it'll have fresh packages for quite some time

711
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,480
And then you have the snap packages and you have CFS right there. Have you played with CFS on 1604?

712
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:43,940
I haven't on 1604, but I've used it, you know building it myself or loading myself. Okay, it's on a third party

713
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,680
On earlier version. So like I'm really excited also about like LXD 2.0, which just came out

714
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,920
Uh-huh. I like LXD. I like I like that model and Ubuntu supports it very well

715
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,440
Yeah, so do you use a lot of this? So do you use a lot of other desktop environments other than just unity?

716
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,200
Yeah, I almost never use unity really. So I'm trying it out right now. It's not bad

717
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,160
The animations are pretty slick and it's definitely I've seen the touch-ups from what I'm used to, you know

718
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,600
Especially seen it work a lot of the deployments before so

719
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,200
So, you know you news nice but you know, normally I use a cinnamon a lot for Linux man, or I use a tiling window manager

720
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,680
But I'm really excited for just having like I feel like 1604 will be a release

721
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,520
I can deploy in almost every part of my life the places where I don't need

722
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,560
First-hand management or where arch doesn't make the most sense, you know

723
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,900
Maybe for less minimal stuff

724
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,480
But but anywhere where I just need a general Linux where I know that the packages will be what I need

725
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,040
They'll be away, especially with snap packages

726
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,200
There'll be a way to get the software that I want and I can figure it the way I need

727
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:46,920
It'll just be I'm really excited. Yeah, I that's sort of my takeaway too, and I kind of wanted to I

728
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,000
Tied I joked a lot during the live stream

729
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,760
I actually am kind of curious on Popey's take for it because not just be not just because he worked with

730
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,860
Ubuntu and works at canonical

731
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:01,720
but honestly because he's obviously been following this for a long time and has good insight on this and I

732
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:07,760
Wonder too if if maybe these are some of the elements that he's excited about and I know I've kind of asked him to dance

733
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,760
it like a monkey before on this topic, but I

734
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:15,160
I know that the snap packages are sort of the weakest area of coverage in our review and it's sort of I feel like the

735
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,280
Biggest long-term ramifications of 1604 and so I don't know puppy

736
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,040
Do you have any just sort of take on our review and thoughts on it and maybe thoughts on snap packages specifically?

737
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,120
Can't talk Chris. I'm busy playing games on 1604

738
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:36,220
Nice. Yeah. Okay. You know what? That's another thing is it is a great platform for steam game. Yeah, I kid I'm joking

739
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,720
I was actually believe

740
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,040
But

741
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,640
Yeah, the snap stuff, you know when I first heard about this company years ago

742
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,400
I

743
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,920
Was kind of skeptical because the guy who was telling me about this was outside a hotel

744
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,360
You know

745
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:01,720
We'd all had an intro to what snappy was and only a few people have been involved in what it what it was going to

746
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,120
Be and I I didn't quite get it and it's only now

747
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,720
that I realize how many people depend on things like a you are in arch or

748
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,200
Your self-updating applications like Chrome

749
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,280
And other things that just like sort themselves out and nobody nobody has to worry about it

750
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:26,240
Right, and you know, we used to think that PPAs were a marvelous way to get stuff to to users

751
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,080
But actually it's quite abrasive to get from you know

752
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:36,660
I want to have the latest version of whatever atom or you know sublime or whatever

753
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:43,340
Whether it's free software or proprietary. It's it's quite abrasive to get from I want that thing to

754
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,660
getting that thing and I think

755
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:52,860
snap can make that a whole lot easier and also make it so that you can

756
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:59,380
Have the latest version of stuff up to date all the time on your system and that that is compelling for a lot of people

757
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:02,220
Yeah, extremely and I know every year

758
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,420
I talked to Frank about this problem from own cloud and this I'm really curious this year to say

759
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,540
What do you think about this? What are your thoughts on this?

760
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,500
I know they're relying right now on the open source of build service

761
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,540
And so one of the things that we kept going around and around about is

762
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,260
This seems maybe like a little bit

763
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:25,740
Too late. Oh, it seems like maybe this should have come about but if you look at the origins of where snap packages

764
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,020
were originally created for

765
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:33,540
There is almost no no route to here without having gone through the Ubuntu phone

766
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,020
process, right

767
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:42,860
Yeah, we learn a lot from click packages on the phone and click back. That's click packages. Thank you. Yeah

768
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:47,820
Yeah, so, you know, it's like I'll give you a good example. There's a developer

769
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,460
who

770
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,380
created a game for Ubuntu phone called balls and

771
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:58,980
Hits, it's an SD. It's written in SDL to it works on the phone and

772
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,780
He cranks out a new version once maybe twice a day

773
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,740
Wow, he can just push a new version to the store and

774
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,260
It's on his

775
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:16,420
Customers handsets or his users or whatever you want to call them that the people who play his game

776
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,340
He can build a new level in 15 minutes that he has to work on his game

777
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,300
He can build a new level crank out a click package shove it in the store

778
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:31,380
Then thousands of people have it straight away, right and and so that works great on the phone

779
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,740
But you know you and I both know I'll give you a little secret, right?

780
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,460
We don't have millions and millions of phone users, right?

781
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:43,580
But we do have millions and millions of Ubuntu desktop users. So

782
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,540
Take that technology that we used on the phone to deliver

783
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:53,020
Applications super fast to the users on the phone and bring that to the desktop

784
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:58,980
Then all those millions of users can potentially have super up-to-date packages

785
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,860
With all the lessons we've learned from the phone. Hmm. I do like that

786
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,860
I feel like it's one of those things though. We won't see pay off for quite a while though

787
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:13,020
Potentially, I mean we're working on tools to make it easier. So like, you know, we're all working on

788
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:20,100
Snappifying we call it not formally. That's just like a stupid term not snapcrafting or

789
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,700
Yeah

790
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,500
There's not a verb for it really snapping

791
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:28,580
Yeah, you don't want to snap. Yeah, so we're all working on

792
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,060
Yeah, snapification sounds good. It sounds very George W. Bush

793
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:38,060
And we're all doing a bit of that to iron out all the kinks and figure out you know

794
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:44,700
Because every application is different and some things need have different requirements, right? And because of our security model to ensure that

795
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:49,340
One application can't stomp on the files of another or you don't get one file

796
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,100
You know

797
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,820
Able to access the data from another application and like send your key presses elsewhere

798
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,180
Yeah, there's the security side of things is

799
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,820
super critical and

800
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:09,460
We're just discovering the edge cases of you know, what each application needs in terms of security

801
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:14,140
We're snappy and so we're pushing the boundaries of that trying to make sure that we're getting all that done

802
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:18,220
So that when a developer comes along wants to snap if I they're crap

803
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,980
It's already full. This is this is something that I want to talk to you about

804
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,220
because I

805
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,900
was just

806
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,540
arguing with Noah that

807
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:33,220
one of the emails we get all the time on quarter radio and one of the things that Mike has run into is

808
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:37,260
He says right. Okay. I'm gonna develop for a boon to I'm gonna go

809
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,580
I'm gonna release an app for the Ubuntu desktop for Ubuntu users, and I'm going to use

810
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:51,300
Which SDK which tool kit which back-end language and I distribute it to my end users with reliable

811
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,300
Secure updates how?

812
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,780
Okay, so if I want to distribute for Ubuntu reliably via software update

813
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,580
How do I do that?

814
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:04,420
And if I'm just say just say I'm like salmon the developer of your favorite application that's available for another platform

815
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:09,500
That just has decided now's the time to target the Linux desktop. How do they how do they figure this out?

816
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,780
They either a somehow get it submitted to Debian

817
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,580
Downstream so it gets included in the Ubuntu repos and thus gets updated when they're set up

818
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:25,660
They figure out to how to create a launchpad account and create PPAs and publish their own repo

819
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:31,300
They figure out how to package a deb file or pay somebody

820
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:38,580
Which is a common thing that developers do is just hire some guy or gal to package a deb file for them and

821
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:44,020
Then they post it on their website, which then means you don't get to take advantage of any of the built-in package management

822
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,020
Nope

823
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:50,660
Check back. And so, you know what Mike and I have kicked around a ton on Coda radio is this is a shitty story to tell

824
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:57,180
Developers this is just this does doesn't work for them. They they can't they can't bank on that. They can't take that to the bank. And

825
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:04,540
And so I think that the snap packages is probably the best answer to this and I think it I think it answers a bigger

826
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:09,900
Question than we all realize is being asked. Do you agree with my sort of rough assessment poppy?

827
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,500
Right, and you know for for a slow-moving free software project

828
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:20,340
There's a good argument for you should put it in Debian or a you are or wherever sure that yeah

829
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:24,620
That hits the most number of free so that's not really practical for a lot of people

830
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,580
They're maybe bringing something over to the Linux desktop for the first time

831
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,340
Right and and and that's just one, you know method

832
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,100
I'm just trying to say that putting it in Debian is not a good idea

833
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:40,940
I'm just trying to say that putting it in Debian is not a not inherently a bad thing, right? There's nothing

834
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:45,900
There's nothing inherently if you could do it. It's great, right, but we've seen or if you can find a

835
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,460
Debian developer to sponsor your

836
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:54,540
Whatever the process is but we've seen recently friction in Debian where an upstream developer

837
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:56,540
wants

838
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:01,020
more recent versions of their application in the distro and

839
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:07,820
The Debian policy doesn't allow that to happen. Right? You're referring to the extreme saver thing, right and and so

840
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:13,900
with with a system where the developer is put in control of how they distribute their code and

841
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,300
With automated reviews and sandboxing these three things put together

842
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:20,060
means that

843
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:25,420
Developers are happy because they can distribute the version of their software that they're happy with when they want to

844
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:31,740
Users are happy because they get the latest version of crack that they want and users are also happy and sys admins are happy

845
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:35,580
Because the system is secure because the apps are siloed from each other

846
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:39,180
So it seems like a win-win-win all the way around our brown

847
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,060
I wanted to give you a chance to jump in because uh, uh, also

848
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,060
I mean, we've seen this play out in a lot of instances

849
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,860
But own clouds are probably one of the more prominent ones. Wouldn't you agree?

850
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,580
Yeah, um, they're a pretty good example of of one of those

851
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:59,180
Yeah, um, they're a pretty good example of of one of those projects where yeah, they're they're really well in the case of the

852
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,900
The debian one. It wasn't just a case of not able to get the version in there

853
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:10,220
But also the debian developer putting in what own cloud considered was an unsafe upgrade path, right?

854
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:16,860
Now, uh richard, I just want your frank opinion not even as a representation of susa, uh, just as a representative

855
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:19,820
As a representative of the linux community

856
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:24,540
Do you bang your head against your desk? Do you facepalm a little bit when you go guys guys guys?

857
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,820
We've got the open busus a build service. It's working great projects like own cloud are using the hell out of it

858
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,420
Don't reinvent the wheel of snap packages. Just put it in the open build service

859
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,380
Does it is there is there a facepalm moment for you or or do you see it in a different light?

860
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:45,580
I I there there is to a large extent when you mix in the wouldn't you mobile thing?

861
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:49,740
There's maybe a case to be made there, but i'm i'm not sold on it though

862
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,540
hmm, yeah, I

863
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:57,340
This is where our debate was going. I see uh in in the living room and and uh, no

864
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:01,100
No, I don't know when we talked about it. My my my take was

865
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:08,320
See, I guess it's i'm of two opinions because snap packages on their own right are are pretty slick technology

866
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,180
And a pretty great idea and something that I think

867
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:18,380
Pretty much anyone who's new to the scene? You can look at how to build these these things how to how to write the description file

868
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,420
And you're gonna get it. It's it's gonna be easy

869
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:26,940
I love that a lot and it might be familiar for how you're doing packaging things for other systems already. Yeah

870
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:32,540
Yeah, so that I I just I i'm pretty jazzed about it in in the big picture at the same time

871
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:34,940
um

872
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:36,940
I don't want to say this in a flamey way

873
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:42,300
but if if if ubuntu would have just if if we could have gone if it could have gone like this like what what if

874
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:47,180
It could have gone like this like canonical would have been like, all right, we're gonna go focus on mobile for a bit

875
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:51,020
So, uh, what we're gonna do is if you want to worry about getting desktop software on

876
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,580
uh on our desktop

877
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,980
We're just gonna hook in with the open open source to build service

878
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,860
And we're just gonna we're gonna hook in with that and that's what that's gonna be our sort of our official avenue for getting software

879
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:04,060
on our desktop and I feel like that would have

880
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:11,180
Been a game changer for desktop linux because instead of now getting packages bundled for debian and ubuntu out of the goodwill of

881
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:18,140
The developer it would have been a standardized method to deliver tech software to the linux desktop

882
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,020
What guarantee would canonical have had that the open source?

883
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:26,060
So it opens his bill service would have kept their values and their priorities in mind

884
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:31,900
Besides the fact we've been doing it for 10 years now. Well, i'm so I guess what i'm trying to say is

885
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:36,060
You know canonical has canonical invented the you know, the ppa system and the

886
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:39,820
Better for better for worse. They have these devs that are available on on the download

887
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,060
But that was at the time that that came out

888
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,500
That was far and away better than anything else we had had on linux

889
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,220
And so I think it's a little unfair to say that because other competition has rose up around them

890
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:55,660
And they are now taking those steps to advance it. I think it's a little unfair to say well all of a sudden

891
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:01,100
Canonical has just done it all wrong. And I guess no, I have that and I don't want to I don't want to come across to

892
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:07,020
Saying they've done it all wrong because I don't I don't agree. I think that ppas were a decent addition

893
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:11,580
And so here's where i'm coming from on this and and just just really quickly is uh,

894
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:16,300
Seuss martin in the uh, linux action show subreddit said sorry chris. No offense

895
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:23,980
Which is always it's like about to say something offensive. Yeah, I think it's a little unfair to say that

896
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:29,580
It's about to say something offensive. Yeah, I just I just pissed in your flower bed. No, not to upset you. Uh, anyways, uh,

897
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,100
but uh

898
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:36,780
That was not a review more like an hour-long monologue about how bad ppas are

899
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:42,940
And I want to stop right there. I I actually think as far as ppas go if they're not an awful system

900
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,620
I don't think it's that bad

901
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:48,300
I think it was a good addition when ppas were launched a long time ago

902
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,640
I'm trying to look at wikipedia to find out the date, but they don't have it 2009

903
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,640
Thank you

904
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,040
It certainly filled the need right? Yeah, this was solid in 2009 great idea

905
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:08,640
2009 is too long ago now and it needed to be iterated on continuously since then and what happened in my estimation

906
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,720
Is it just didn't become a priority?

907
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:19,600
And then the cloud took off and then rapid software development took off and people start creating entire applications that run on the web based on

908
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,240
node.js

909
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,760
And plugins that can be completely revoked. Yeah, you know what i'm talking about

910
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:32,640
And in days they have a new web application and then in months they have iterated three times and all of a sudden

911
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,640
we now find ourselves in a world where

912
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,820
unarguably openSUSE were the leaders

913
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:44,180
Where fedora has a very competent solution where arch has a crushing lead with the user repository?

914
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:50,240
We now find ourselves in a world where ubuntu is behind in this regard. I'm not saying ppas are bad

915
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,640
I'm saying that if we could have switched over to another solution by now

916
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,640
I like the build service just as my personal one. Yeah works well

917
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:05,280
We would have fundamentally changed how software is distributed for linux the answer for developers that I talked about earlier

918
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,920
Would have been target the build service

919
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:15,360
With clear documentation a large community and it would have made available to just about every damn distro on the planet

920
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,600
Now i'm very excited for snap packages

921
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,360
But at the same time I kind of feel like it's too little too well not too little but it's too late

922
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,480
Go ahead rotten

923
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,360
Well, I just want to say that the the

924
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,200
The problem with the dev files is not necessarily

925
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:43,120
The devs is we we can't have like devs kind of suck. Like if you think about it, there's

926
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,720
You you unpackage a deb. You have three archives and then you have another archive and set up another archive

927
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,880
They're they're kind of annoying to do

928
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,160
And I think anybody who's ever packaged a deb would would agree with that

929
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,640
It is but the problem is that the dev files are also a locked down structure for the just the linux

930
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:07,520
Entirely the ecosystem of linux is either stale stable releases or rolling super fast releases

931
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:12,400
You really can't have this. You can't have rolling applications sitting on top of the stable

932
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,400
stable core because

933
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,520
Those depend on new toolkits that are constantly being updated

934
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,040
So if your new application requires on a toolkit that this is not available

935
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Well still having to but snap packages

936
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,480
I know that's the point. That's what i'm saying snap packages

937
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:33,600
Like they're not too little too late because we still even though even the open super boost build service is awesome

938
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:40,080
But it still has the exact same problem of the of the core. Yeah, uh packages not being updated. All right

939
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:45,440
Okay, okay. Okay for that. Okay, you the snap is it's i'm excited for the snap because it

940
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,440
Let me okay. Okay. That's a great point rod. Let me punt this to richard. So richard, uh, you mentioned in the chat room

941
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,840
You know a build service been around longer than ppas

942
01:09:54,480 --> 01:10:01,920
What is your sober estimation of why it just simply hasn't been adopted then because it's clearly a competent platform with solid technology

943
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Behind it yet. Here we are

944
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,680
Fedora has copper arch has aur

945
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,380
uh canonical is developing snap packages and and and

946
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:17,780
I guess I also you gotta you gotta admit the system they've developed is more modern. You know, it utilizes containers

947
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:24,740
It supports read-only file systems. It it pulls in directly from the project's upstream build services. It's very compelling

948
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:32,340
what is your sober estimation now of perhaps why this hasn't been adopted more widely and maybe if there is some sort of

949
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:36,100
perhaps modernization that now needs to take place with the build service or maybe

950
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:39,140
Not i'm curious now where you think this thing stand

951
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:46,260
Most of the features you stated have been in the build service for some time like for example refreshing the stuff direct from upstream

952
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:51,460
We've had that feature for so long. We've just rewritten it in 2.7, which we just released nice

953
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:55,620
So there's there's you know that that that's always ongoing that's always improving

954
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:01,080
Um, why wasn't it adopted? I I think that's typical not invented here syndrome. I mean if you look at most distributions

955
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:09,080
They're they're gonna trend towards their own tools and there there isn't many projects besides open suzer who kind of hits this approach of

956
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:14,120
We're going to build our tools for ourselves and everybody else as well. Why don't you come join us and

957
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:19,160
I I wish more distributions took us up on that offer. It's still open. It's still there

958
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,200
We're not going anywhere. The build service is still being developed. So

959
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,640
but but you know distributions have to get over this hump of

960
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,600
We know best how to how to build this stuff. It's it's not necessarily true

961
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:35,080
And even if it is true, I think we can do really exciting stuff when we do stuff together

962
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,080
And there's only yeah, there's not many projects that take that mindset

963
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,240
Popey how important is the ubuntu brand behind this idea?

964
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:49,240
So I know one of the things that so my fair estimation of the emails I've gotten is if I told them

965
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:54,200
This is the canonical recommended path or the ubuntu recommended software distribution path

966
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,280
And this is the open source community solution

967
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,400
They actually would be more inclined to go with the ubuntu solution simply because of brand name recognition trust in the in

968
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,560
in sort of a long-term investment there and

969
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,600
It's simply more familiar with how they expect things to operate on proprietary platforms

970
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,680
And so we are sitting we're saying oh you could have done the build service. There's a ur out there

971
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:19,960
But in reality, how important was it? Do you think that it was actually a solution from within?

972
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:27,000
How do you mean a solution from within well, why not how do you think there is serious technical and and obviously

973
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,320
Tactical advantages to developing snap packages versus using somebody else's solution

974
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,640
So snap packages service a need that we've identified that developers need

975
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,200
And that our customers want

976
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,680
And I i'm not sure

977
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:47,800
That other platforms do provide that I mean it's quite obvious that

978
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:55,800
other uh, non-linux platforms are trending towards that with the way android and uh chrome silo their things and the way

979
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,880
The windows, uh app store is going and the way the ios app store

980
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:03,900
Everyone else seems to have figured this out and is going in that direction

981
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,080
We're doing the same thing

982
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:13,320
But in the linux environment i'm i'm not sure do you think it's so when we're looking at this

983
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,400
Do you think it's a fair perspective?

984
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:21,020
To say this is a solution for the ubuntu platform. And this is something for ubuntu platform customers

985
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:29,720
Well, it's for it's for our customers and for free software and proprietary developers

986
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:35,080
It's sure i'm not saying it's closed source. I'm just saying like it's it's developed for people that are in the ubuntu ecosystem

987
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,800
Which is based on linux. It's not saying that there's not linux involved

988
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,920
But it's simply there are people that simply they deploy ubuntu workstations. They deploy ubuntu servers

989
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,560
They have an ubuntu cloud and so they're looking for things

990
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:50,440
That are yeah, I see where you're going, but I I don't see I don't see how

991
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,360
you know as

992
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,560
as

993
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:59,880
Someone who's been an advocate of ubuntu for you know, 10 plus years. I don't see why I would think anything

994
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:07,400
Other than this is for our users and customers and developers. Well, you know, what what else would it be for?

995
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:11,480
So I actually see a bigger point in here. Okay

996
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:15,880
It's it's like for the last part that you mentioned is like

997
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:23,000
By that principle canonical wouldn't use software developed by other open source projects and they completely do so the name is not necessarily the thing

998
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:29,800
The fact that canonical uses for those that care about the branding would be enough like canonical says we're using obs

999
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,240
Then it will be enough for those that want the canonical support

1000
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:40,440
on it because if canonical picked it is because it's in line and those that are trusting a brand name will just trust it anyways

1001
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:48,840
I guess the problem of the lack of adoption has to do with the strategy on the outreach the open source has had

1002
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:54,360
Over time versus the other distributions arch has a core users that they target

1003
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,880
Open source that wants to be so impartial. So

1004
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:04,920
So generic so to allow everyone that suddenly fails to capture in each group that will be uh, evangelist about it

1005
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:12,600
So because there's no evangelism about it people just think it's oh, that's a nice thing and it doesn't get out of the nice thing

1006
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:19,320
And someone that has evangelists and has people pushing forward the technology in terms of vocality about it

1007
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:23,160
We'll get to have the perception even if not the usage at the time

1008
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:29,800
Vocality about it. We'll get to have the perception even if not the usage at least the perception so that it's wider

1009
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,320
uh

1010
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,000
You know what? I hadn't thought of that wes. How much do you what do you think?

1011
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:40,200
Do you think maybe the reason why the aur and things like that have more buzz is because it's the arch user

1012
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:46,280
Repository and the build service is targeted more to just those practical developers that want to pump out builds. And so

1013
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,680
There's no hype machine

1014
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,680
That is probably a good point. I mean

1015
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:54,920
Yeah, especially like with the with the aur, you know, the users are directly involved

1016
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,720
They're picking people to maintain the packages not always the developer. There's there's the comment system

1017
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,400
And you know, it is a little bit harder to get involved with the build service

1018
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,440
So that's a good that's a good point. All right, no at the end of the day

1019
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Here's the thing

1020
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:14,920
The practical real world implementation is it's still if you wanted to play software on ubuntu

1021
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,480
It's going to be your best bet. Don't you agree? I mean you still think

1022
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:24,760
I I might I might say other services and other systems and other projects have better technology for developing and delivering and

1023
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,080
updating software

1024
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:30,920
But in terms of day-to-day practical use out in the real world deploying for clients

1025
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,440
Where's ubuntu at? I think that and I think we hit on this

1026
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,000
Maybe we should have clicked on it, you know on sunday

1027
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,680
And I don't think we necessarily honed in on this

1028
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,040
But one of the things that came up in a discussion today was that you know

1029
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,040
I'm looking at this from a perspective of

1030
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:49,240
I am a person that maybe was previously using windows or maybe i'm using macos and now i've come over to linux

1031
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:56,040
And so I am going to cherry pick the applications that I was formerly comfortable with now if you had somebody

1032
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,480
um

1033
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,320
Like myself who will be available oddlinux, press northwest switching people to linux

1034
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:03,080
Like I maybe have done

1035
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:08,360
What would you say three or four times every place we've gone and had absolute 100 success rate if you have something buddy like that

1036
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:12,760
Then that person is already switching you over to those linux applications while you're on windows

1037
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:18,120
So your transition is easier. However, if you don't have that you boot into linux for the first time and you say

1038
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:23,480
I need my friend to help me you download team viewer. You say I need to uh,

1039
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:28,840
To you know to what was the other uh program I was talking about today is team viewer

1040
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,720
And what was the other one that bit me? There's another one is proprietary and I hate mentioning it all the time

1041
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,200
Virtual box for example, uh virtual box

1042
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,960
Some of those applications

1043
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:43,480
They work perfectly fine on ubuntu right out of the software center or right off of if you install from the command line

1044
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,160
But it might take a little tweaking, you know, and another one comes to mind my ubiqui

1045
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,560
Ubiqui works basically right out of the box

1046
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,920
I just plug it into my computer and I can use a smart card reader right off of ubuntu

1047
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,640
On arch I have to install a package and configure it now

1048
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,440
That's not a hit on arch daemon and then configure it

1049
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,440
Now that's not a hit on arch because arch is a configurable distro and you know that going into it

1050
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,200
And so there's probably somebody out there that didn't want that smart card daemon running

1051
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,120
and so they rightfully so don't have that installed and configured by default, but

1052
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:16,920
I don't think it is fair to say that coming out of the gate ubuntu is the hardest distribution to install packages on

1053
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,120
unless we take it to the level of

1054
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:25,800
Here's the entire app ecosystem and the majority of these applications are you know

1055
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,520
Aren't going to be available on ubuntu for a couple of years

1056
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,120
And they are going to be available on arch if you look at it from that lens, then I think you're right

1057
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:37,880
but but I think for the practical lens of these are the software programs that that i'm using and I am cherry-picking a couple that

1058
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,480
Come to mind because i've had problems

1059
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,200
In a day-to-day basis what I found is oftentimes I find myself having to tinker with arch to get it to work

1060
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,360
You know for a daily use case

1061
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:51,560
I think I think my opinion about it is uh is sort of I actually agree with you in some levels

1062
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,800
Ubuntu is going to be out of the mind when they package virtual box

1063
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:59,080
For example, or maybe let's go with your team viewer example because that's a little more esoteric

1064
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,600
uh

1065
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,600
When you install team viewer on ubuntu

1066
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,680
That package maintainer made the decision. He said hey, you know what while I still have root permission on your service

1067
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,320
or while I have room while I still have root permission on your linux box because you

1068
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:17,800
When you executed my install script here, you gave me root privilege

1069
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,720
While I still have that root privilege i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to start

1070
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:27,720
This remote listening service as root and i'm going to go ahead and tell that to start every time your system boots

1071
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:32,380
I actually think that's probably the right decision to make on a user-friendly distribution

1072
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:34,840
And you want to install team viewer to get help

1073
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:40,520
You probably want to receive remote connections. That's probably why you're installing team viewer, right? I could also

1074
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:47,240
Very clearly understand why the arch package you're said, you know what maybe not i'm going to do the absolute minimum thing

1075
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:52,040
I need to do while I have root privileges and i'm not going to touch your system any more than I have to and if

1076
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:56,840
You want to start that daemon you can use system ctl enable team viewer dot service or whatever

1077
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,640
Dot service or whatever it is and you can have added haas

1078
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,120
And i'm going to be gentle while I have root i'm going to respect your security, right?

1079
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,600
I can understand both perspectives

1080
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,480
This is a wacky example. Actually, this is really a wacky example

1081
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,920
You're implying your implication is that someone who's packaging a deb is somehow

1082
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:23,080
potentially nefarious in in their

1083
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:26,080
In no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1084
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,280
Somehow that a arch arch packaging

1085
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:38,760
One is developing for end users one is packaging I should say for end users and they probably just figure i'm going to make it

1086
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:42,360
A little bit easier and one is packaging for a linux enthusiast and you know what?

1087
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,960
I'm not going to make it easier for the enthusiast. I can understand both perspectives

1088
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:52,400
I don't I don't think that makes one easier to install than the other I think what makes one easier to install than the other

1089
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:57,480
Would be software availability and what is availability in your repository?

1090
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:04,280
tie and if I can do packer dash s install team viewer or packer dash s virtual box or packer dash s heru pad and

1091
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,200
I know with absolute certainty that I'm getting the absolute latest version of that package

1092
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:14,380
And it's going to continue to get updated by my package manager in my estimation that is easier than other

1093
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:19,940
Well than Ubuntu so that one packet you you're saying packaging for the Linux enthusiast

1094
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:26,700
You're aiming for a target that has like half a percent of worldwide PC sales

1095
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:31,880
If that right is that is that where you want to target or do you want to target where?

1096
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:36,820
Real people spend real money on computers that I have us on them

1097
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,120
Don't don't understand

1098
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,420
I completely agree if I'm gonna target if I were gonna release a desktop Linux

1099
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:47,300
Application that I thought would be great for web developers or people that are developing Android

1100
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:53,020
Applications or anybody that wants to get worked on on Linux my primary user base would be Ubuntu

1101
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:55,020
And I would do a PPA if I could absolutely

1102
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:01,880
But my point is that doesn't the goodwill of developers and how they have assembled their packages does not

1103
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:06,940
Excuse the fact that the platform itself does not provide a better means for sustainable software

1104
01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:14,060
But if it wasn't for the ease people wouldn't want a wart if it's exact a wart is just trusting

1105
01:22:14,060 --> 01:22:18,900
You know these can give people also packaging things that you are going to try to run exactly

1106
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:25,220
You know what? You know what? I'm sorry my my my long time experience with the community is in whole

1107
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:31,100
I I actually trust the community more than I trust any individual company and the AUR has a vote system

1108
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,980
It has a comment system. It has a self vetting system

1109
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:40,940
I I wish I could divorce the AUR from the distribution wars thing because I just want to talk about it in terms of a software

1110
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:44,380
Delivery platform that's why I started this conversation with the build service

1111
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:51,860
But the reality is I actually think the AUR provides a better example because it's user powered and then it's community vetted and it

1112
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:55,100
Allows for me to go in with a certain level of confidence

1113
01:22:55,100 --> 01:23:00,420
I'd like I like me able to come on to the show for Linux action show into a desktop app pick and say

1114
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:08,260
You can install this package and I had to drop three really really really really great desktop app picks last week

1115
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:14,660
Because I couldn't come on the air and say this is how you install it on Ubuntu. I think that's a major bummer

1116
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:20,660
But how many of those three were because the person hadn't provided a 1604 version yet?

1117
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:26,300
All of it none of none of it was version specific none of the issues were version specific at all

1118
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:33,740
None of it was it all was a matter of packaging and availability and repos and and all of it in every single

1119
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:39,700
circumstance was available in the AUR and it just it just struck me as this glaring and the thing was is

1120
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:46,300
You know one of them was like a two-year-old drop-down terminal that just never made it into downstream Debian or upstream

1121
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:51,540
However, you look at it, and I just kind of felt bad because you know they're creating something really great here

1122
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:55,220
And one of them was a chat program that I just mentioned earlier that

1123
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:58,140
And what was that program no I had to build from source

1124
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:00,620
And I actually started to write up the instructions

1125
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:04,260
And I was just gonna give people and here's the other problem is it was an Ubuntu review episode

1126
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:09,420
So I wanted to make sure that the Ubuntu the desktop app pick could actually run on Ubuntu right because that'd be a pretty jackass

1127
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,620
thing to do

1128
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,380
And so the good news is that's the thing we're fixing

1129
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:19,820
Exactly yeah, right. I love that. I think and I agree, and I think that's why even though

1130
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:24,500
It's not something that's already existed. It's still a very valid solution. What do you think Noah?

1131
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,060
I

1132
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,060
Think my tummy hurts

1133
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:32,820
As soon as you said that he asked me like I told you so I told you that's I've told you all morning

1134
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:38,380
That's what they're fixed. That's why I'm doing this house. I keep saying I think that I mean you know really

1135
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:39,340
I think we're kind of going in circles

1136
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:43,740
That's what I think but I think that I think we've gotten to a point where we have addressed that there is a problem

1137
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:47,220
I think we all agree that there is a problem and that there needs to be a new solution

1138
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:50,420
I think we've also all agreed that canonical has addressed that solution and

1139
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:57,380
has or has addressed the problem in is formulating a solution and that really I think really what it comes down to is you and

1140
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:02,860
I fundamentally disagree on if you think if if the software is available in the OR even if you have to tweak it

1141
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:03,940
That's better than it

1142
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:08,100
Just not being available and I would personally argue that it as far as easy

1143
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:12,820
Installation even if I have to go to a website and download a deb that may not be as secure

1144
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:19,260
And that's not a great overall system, and yes it may or may not screw other distros because it's occupying developers time on a specific

1145
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:26,780
distribution, but I think that that provides a fundamentally easier way to get at you know linear in application running on a given distribution well

1146
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:32,500
I definitely gives them more windows familiar feel I search for my installation thing I download it from the web, and I install it

1147
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,180
I'll give you that I okay, so let's move on

1148
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,340
Yes, that is true

1149
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,220
But I want to move on because I don't want to bore people with this whole debate

1150
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:46,900
I want to talk about some of the things that have actually already been sort of fixed up since our review, but

1151
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:51,540
Honestly poppy. I'm really genuinely curious about your thoughts on 1604 it to me

1152
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:54,820
It feels like one of the biggest releases for Ubuntu ever and I'm curious if you feel the same

1153
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:58,140
Yes, I do

1154
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,020
Honestly, that's it folks. You know no to you

1155
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:06,660
I'm really what do you think that means in terms of long-term long-term impact of 1604?

1156
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:12,500
And I'd also if you're willing to share with class why you think it is that it if it beyond snap packages

1157
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:18,820
So we know that the vast majority of our users stick on LTS releases like significantly

1158
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,460
like double-digit percentage higher

1159
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:26,860
People stick on LTS is they don't

1160
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:32,020
Generally our users don't want bleeding edge. They don't want the very latest

1161
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:38,740
Colonel they don't necessarily want the very latest of like lib C or whatever wacky library

1162
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:44,700
They just want something that's reliable and stable isn't going to change when they boot it up today from when they booted it up yesterday

1163
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:47,420
So LTS is always important to us

1164
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:53,460
But the flip side of that is app developers are changing things and chrome changes

1165
01:26:53,980 --> 01:27:00,220
Frequently chromium changes frequently and other applications that people depend on change frequently. And so I think

1166
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:07,040
1604 could be one of those quite long-lived versions of Ubuntu a bit like the

1167
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:12,960
Maybe the Windows XP of Linux. Yeah, I was gonna say 10 around I was gonna say 10 of 4

1168
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,260
I still run into some 10 of what there's oh I do do you run into 10 of 4 still? Yeah, I do

1169
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,760
Doesn't make me happen

1170
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:27,240
with with with snappy packages that have the very latest version of an application which can override whatever

1171
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:31,240
Core library is on the system without jeopardizing an existing

1172
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:37,240
Package that's already installed right and not interfering with any other application that's already installed

1173
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:41,940
That seems like that that could have the potential to live for quite a long time

1174
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,160
Either that's very well put even though I said not about snap packages

1175
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:51,060
You managed to put in such a great way that I completely agree and I'm willing to take the snap package answer

1176
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,080
also, I think it's a pretty solid release because

1177
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:03,000
Pretty soon a lot of S is gonna change in Ubuntu and if if people don't like the way things are going you can now

1178
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,400
Say well just install 1604 and snap packages will keep you going while they

1179
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:11,680
Right, isn't don't you think that's a guy so like, you know, you might say well

1180
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,780
There's a unity 8 stuff is different and all these apps are different

1181
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:18,380
Just install 1604 and shut your face

1182
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:24,200
And it's gonna it's not gonna be in the past where you would say well, okay sure

1183
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:30,000
But now I can't have X Y Z because I don't have GTK X or right that problem is gone

1184
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I think it's a big deal for that

1185
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:36,640
Richard I wanted to ask you though. Honestly just kind of tingling in the back of my head here

1186
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,640
Do you feel like when?

1187
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:43,480
When a new when a new Ubuntu release comes out is the oxygen sort of sucked out of the room for some of the other

1188
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:50,400
Distros because I see a lot of people talking about switching to Ubuntu open to this 1604 upgrade that and it feels like nobody's

1189
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,320
talking about

1190
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,320
anybody else

1191
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,360
You know, in fact, in fact, we've seen a bit of a spike of tumbleweed downloads

1192
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:07,960
I mean the servers were slow even because of it. Wow, we got it. We got a backer right there. We got a second. I

1193
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,920
think I mean I just I'm saying that I experienced them slow and

1194
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:17,760
It happened to be in the same time. He said about the spike. So all right

1195
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,680
Well, we can't be in a bit busier than usual

1196
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,360
I you know, it's funny because a lot of people we said hey Chris

1197
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,800
Why don't you shut up and install tumbleweed?

1198
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,980
That's a lot of people said in the in the comments a couple of things

1199
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:27,440
No

1200
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:33,280
I think you'll be glad to see fixed is the erase disk and install create and then create swap space bug that we ran into

1201
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,720
That s has been fixed

1202
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,960
Also a couple other little naglers have been fixed including a few other things we ran into actually

1203
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:46,160
So I'm you know, and I'm glad I'm pleased to say that overall it was a pretty quick turnaround

1204
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,980
You were you were pretty disappointed in this bug. Yeah, I was well

1205
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:56,920
I prefaced it and I'll restate this I cannot really hold canonical or Ubuntu responsible for that bug

1206
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,200
Unless it made it past release date, right?

1207
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,160
Like absolutely tell you when you download it that you're downloading a pre-release software

1208
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:08,680
It's not it is not fully baked yet. And so it would be wholly unfair. I mean

1209
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,600
People start complaining about that pretty soon. They're just gonna stop letting you download it

1210
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,560
Does it give you pause that it made it this far? No, not at all. As long as it's a liar

1211
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,740
It doesn't it doesn't line hand to God. It gives me zero pause that it made it this far

1212
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:26,840
As long as it doesn't make it past release I can hear you grouching just the other day about how you're really super

1213
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:32,420
Disappointed that an LTS release like this has a bug that's gotten this far in the process and nobody noticed it

1214
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:39,360
Hold on a second. Yeah, I was disappointed that it was an LTS release that had that that they that they would even consider shipping

1215
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,800
With that book, but they didn't they fixed it and I don't think that that's I don't think that's at all fair like if

1216
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,680
Especially it's coming from you like somebody who wants all these changes if you want companies to embrace

1217
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,080
You want all the new stuff all the new crack

1218
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,600
If you want all that you got to give them up until the very last day to fix

1219
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:04,200
Just me that's that's not why rolling distributions are taking off like crazy. That's not why things like tumbleweed are blowing up

1220
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:08,320
That's not why things like ours are continuing to see new users. That's not why things like it's just me

1221
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,840
No, it's just you you're all your special snowflake

1222
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:16,600
But but I just I don't know I can't hold them at all responsible if they fixed it before the release because here's the thing

1223
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,720
If I would have downloaded out the day, then I would have just never even known. I'm not asking you that

1224
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,760
Oh, what are you asking? I'm saying they did their job. They did a great job. They got the problem solved

1225
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:29,820
Absolutely out of ten out of ten Noah, but what I am saying

1226
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:36,920
And you just won't admit it on air is a little bit of you was disappointed that something like this existed and it and that it

1227
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:43,160
Got this far and you won't admit that to you it felt like nobody was even trying to install this until we and other people

1228
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,440
Started notice this problem, and you won't say it on air, but I know deep down you felt that way

1229
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,160
I agree with part of that

1230
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,200
I get I agree a part of me agrees with that when you when you phrase it like that

1231
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,680
I guess I I'm a part of me agrees with it, but it's still it's just feels super

1232
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:01,720
That didn't happen like it's I've installed it one two six nine four about six times. Yes

1233
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,600
January and February all throughout the month. I didn't have that problem until I got here

1234
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,320
Yeah, I got same here. Yeah, okay fair point. You know what fair pointer goes to rotten corpse. I didn't run it

1235
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,320
I in fact we noticed

1236
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,040
That I think about it

1237
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:22,920
When we started to install I'm like I don't know I never ran into that problem man, and I've got it like on four rigs

1238
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,880
Let's be you

1239
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,800
He's told me he's like yeah, so you don't know how to install bunch. That's okay

1240
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:35,440
Let the archers that come over here install a bunch you for you. I was that guy for a little bit

1241
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,440
I will admit that I'm like always that

1242
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,880
You can't help it because you're like I don't know wasn't me

1243
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,640
I don't know what it's doing when I was in IT services. I was even the guy that said don't blame me

1244
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:49,080
It's a hardware problem. I wore that shirt. I was I went all-in. That's why you're no longer in that

1245
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,000
That is that's why I had to get out

1246
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,600
So anyways yeah, it was funny to to sort of

1247
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:59,280
One of the things that I enjoyed and I just want to wrap it up was I was all-in on Ubuntu Mate edition

1248
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:04,520
During like my 1604 run that was my favorite spot to be so no one I basically swapped yeah

1249
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:08,480
Yeah, yeah, I loved I loved me on desktop, but I mean in terms of

1250
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,480
Well, I guess you know I had it here hooked up to the stream

1251
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,000
I wanted a daily performer that was really sort of

1252
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:18,400
Minimal that I didn't have to change a bunch of defaults

1253
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,480
So that way stuff didn't pop up on the stream and Mate just nailed it

1254
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:22,800
And it was a great experience

1255
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:28,920
And I really like some of the changes that were made and so I was all about the Mate edition so and Noah

1256
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:32,200
Traditionally because that's what he deploys for clients. I assume right is

1257
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:39,560
Mostly a unity user plus. He and he'll sometimes he likes it because he can change the scaling etc etc right so we basically swapped

1258
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:44,240
I said Noah you got to use Mate for the next day. I got to use unity for the next day and

1259
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:51,720
No, I don't think you actually enjoyed it that much you you seemed like you were the feeling like it was sort of well

1260
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:55,680
So in fairness to Ubuntu Mate I was running on on

1261
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:59,920
Hardware that was giving me a lot of trouble and so that right off the bat created

1262
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,000
I mean I spent the first 40 minutes, okay, actually hold on just a second this

1263
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,360
This was your first hands-on with the Liebman 15

1264
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,400
So I install a bungee Mate and I ran into the little swap here, and that was fine

1265
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,400
I got through that but the real problem was

1266
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:18,800
You know I spent the first 40 minutes trying to figure out how to turn off tap to click because I kept selecting text

1267
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,000
I can't even scroll in the web page you also ran into problems with USB ports being powered. Oh, yeah, okay?

1268
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:29,040
Backup, I couldn't even get the operating system installed because the USB ports half the time

1269
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,720
They're powered and half the time. They're not I don't mean different USB ports

1270
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:37,040
I mean a single USB port and I guess the answer is just to cycle the laptop numerous times until

1271
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:42,000
Thank God I had a flash drive with the light on it because if I didn't I don't know how I would know if it's

1272
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:42,480
Gonna boot or not

1273
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:48,240
This is legit because I was trying I was trying different distros having a thumb drive that lights up when you add when it gets

1274
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:52,320
Powered is very valuable information when you're troubleshooting this kind of stuff so half the time

1275
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:56,120
There's no power the other half the time there is I'd say it's about 5050 so finally

1276
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,720
I just keep restarting the computer until I see the light come on then I'm like well don't screw up because we got a good

1277
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:03,280
One now and I get into and then I hit that installer error

1278
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:08,160
Which was kind of a pain and so again not Mateus fault USB port problem not Mateus fault

1279
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:12,320
So I restart another five seven times and 40 minutes later. I'm finally in the installer. Thank God

1280
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:19,080
And so I'm clicking through and I get finally get the operating installed like fine good all right now

1281
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:22,720
It's on to easier waters right well turns out. There's no touchpad driver

1282
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,900
It shows up as a ps2 mouse, so I can't I have no

1283
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:32,500
Are you saying this built for Linux laptop doesn't have out-of-the-box touchpad support $1,800 built for Linux

1284
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:38,060
Laptop support and my my $500 system 76 was washing the walls with it

1285
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,360
So it is I I can't scroll

1286
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,320
I can't even

1287
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,840
Research how to fix the scroll because I can't scroll and I can't type because I type three letters and it erases all my

1288
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:47,960
Text I have to start all over again

1289
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:53,440
so eventually I I drove to Best Buy and bought a trackball and then come back and

1290
01:35:53,880 --> 01:36:00,520
Seriously, and I'm working I'm working on this trackball trying trying to and I eventually research and find out not that they're this is

1291
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:03,920
How I fix I I'm telegramming wimpy in the middle of his workday

1292
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:09,160
Yeah to ask if they're why the touchpad support isn't in and of course he tells me what I knew he was gonna

1293
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:14,780
Tell me which is it's perfectly in there if you have a touchpad well Ellis PCI showed me that the Libra um is

1294
01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:17,580
So I don't have touchpads, so I can't really size

1295
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:20,900
So then the end of the night so I take it home with me back to the hotel

1296
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:24,940
And I'm at the hotel and I start using it and that's when things kind of started to change

1297
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:29,260
That's kind of when I started to see that like if I wanted a not changing desktop

1298
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:32,180
Which I do like and I and I just wanted to get work done

1299
01:36:32,180 --> 01:36:34,940
And I didn't I and I didn't care for that doc which a lot of people don't

1300
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:42,460
I can see Mate being a really really great alternative sure like that's that's just the desktop environment

1301
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:45,980
What did you think about like the welcome stuff, and then they went to a tweak with me?

1302
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:50,500
I am totally I didn't care about the mute that was not my thing. I mean if I was gonna have mutiny

1303
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,500
I'd probably just have a

1304
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:55,300
Traditional unity, but one thing I did care

1305
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:00,900
I mean that software center that software boutique is so good. I will put it on every Ubuntu machine

1306
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:07,700
I install from now on every single client that gets an Ubuntu installation from me will have that that that installation package that

1307
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:10,900
Welcome package that is far and away

1308
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:14,060
They should make that its own app store, and they should port it to like every well

1309
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:18,500
Here's what it's that good Wimby isn't here right now, but here's a telegram. He sent me yesterday

1310
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,780
He said he just pushed an update to Ubuntu Mate welcome

1311
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:27,700
If you installed on another desktop flavor now the software boutique will appear in the menus

1312
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:33,220
It was previously only in Mateia sessions. I got the idea while watching your review because we gave

1313
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,540
We got the we gave the command to use to just launch the software

1314
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:42,940
This is a perfect example of how Martin Wimperis does everything right?

1315
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,960
No, I'm serious now. No now you think about what just happened. Okay? He listened to

1316
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,780
You and I are not involved with the Matei project

1317
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:56,080
And so and he he's not involved with you broadcasting and yet

1318
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,780
I mean I would say he's involved quite a bit, okay fine fine, but as a member

1319
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:01,780
He's not you know we don't get a paycheck

1320
01:38:01,780 --> 01:38:08,540
Yeah, so he is a community member and we because we are members of the same community and he saw on his own volition

1321
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:11,720
Saw a problem that without we were having it really wasn't even a problem

1322
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:16,740
He goes out of his way to make sure that it's going to be smoother from everyone if every

1323
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,680
software distribution had somebody like Martin Wimperis on their team I

1324
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:24,520
Agree because it's not what he actually did that's not what's the big deal

1325
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:30,100
It's the fact that he kind of recognizes a pre problem and solves it before it's even a problem

1326
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:35,300
Or you even have to ask yeah, and that's what I think makes the Matei edition of Ubuntu 1604 kind of special

1327
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:40,400
Yeah, is and and I'm sure Wimpy if he was here would say that credit goes to a lot of other people, too

1328
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:46,400
But I just it's all right Chris, I'm telegramming everything you're saying

1329
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:49,740
Thank you

1330
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:54,860
So that's why I wanted to I think that's what we sort of wrapped the review on it

1331
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:59,460
But we kind of you know we got some grief for not mentioning Zubuntu and Ubuntu gnome edition

1332
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:01,460
But you know

1333
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,980
Talking about Matei talking about Zubuntu

1334
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:06,460
your buddy

1335
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,980
Mr.. Michael Arbel over at for Onyx

1336
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,580
Did some benchmarking?

1337
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:15,260
Let's see it. We've got some Ubuntu

1338
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:19,980
1604 benchmarks, that's how you have to say it

1339
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:23,820
Yeah like that yeah like that

1340
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:31,740
For nice I compared unity is XFCE KDE LXD gnome Matei and

1341
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:36,420
Open box in a head-to-head comparison of some classic open source games

1342
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:38,780
Wes

1343
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:42,460
Before I tell you Wes before I reveal Wes

1344
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:52,180
Do you have a guess of which desktop environment, and we're not talking by huge margins here

1345
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,180
Not big margins, but do you have a guess?

1346
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,060
Which desktop environment perform the best?

1347
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:00,780
for mr.. Lara bells

1348
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:04,660
Benchmarks, I'm gonna guess open box. Oh, let's see here

1349
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:15,580
No, I am sorry Wes that is not at the house

1350
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:18,460
That was not a correct answer

1351
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:23,300
Mr.. Noah, do you have a guess as to which desktop perform the best about you, but say

1352
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:26,060
That's what I would have guessed

1353
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:30,360
Anybody the mumble room have a guess as the disk as a desktop environment. Yes, go ahead Poby

1354
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:33,380
Was it by any chance?

1355
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:34,980
What you know?

1356
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:38,220
No, it was not. It was not only because

1357
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:41,740
It was actually plasma 5 fared very very well

1358
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:45,060
Ubuntu gnome did not fare well because

1359
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:51,220
For whatever reason the Ubuntu gnome desktop detected that the apps were no longer responding even though they were

1360
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:55,180
Responding and kept coming up like the force quit prompt and just trashed performance

1361
01:40:55,900 --> 01:41:02,300
Otherwise Ubuntu gnome would have fared better. No ladies and gentlemen the number one performance desktop

1362
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:10,660
Is unity

1363
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:16,420
Are you serious yeah

1364
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:19,420
Now this is only if you do not

1365
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:26,200
Alter defaults if you go with a default install desktop and want to play games with the current 1604 flavors

1366
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,940
Unity actually gets you that's a great job by a very thin margin

1367
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:33,980
By a very thin extra three frames a second

1368
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:38,140
Supposedly I guess

1369
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:43,620
Unity will give you the best performance so there you go as much as much tersh talk as we gave

1370
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:48,580
Tossed towards unity you know what I'm gonna keep it right here on my this

1371
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:54,220
This is my this is my unity desktop here plugged into the production stream. I'm gonna keep it as long as possible

1372
01:41:54,220 --> 01:41:58,180
I made it with Kubuntu for almost a month on the live stream. I

1373
01:41:58,180 --> 01:42:00,980
Think I could make it for unity for two months at least

1374
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:05,940
1604 I'm gonna lock it in now the only thing I could see changing this is I

1375
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:09,980
Really want to demo a piece of software. I want to do a how-to or something like that

1376
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:12,300
And it's just not available for Ubuntu which happens all the time

1377
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,860
So yeah, yeah there you go if you want absolute performance be like me run unity I

1378
01:42:21,940 --> 01:42:24,620
You know what I haven't had the flicker problems anymore either

1379
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:28,420
I started having the flickering problems when I hooked up my HDMI external and poppy

1380
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:29,420
I wonder did that happen to you, too

1381
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:31,860
Did you not have flickering until you try to a second monitor?

1382
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:36,020
So I recently bought a new ThinkPad and yes

1383
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:39,260
There's flickering and it's an upstream Intel video driver problem

1384
01:42:39,260 --> 01:42:45,580
Okay has been going for like four months see I had flickering once when I hooked up external HDMI

1385
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,500
But I have not had a problem since then

1386
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:52,720
So I consider myself lucky. I have a sky I did something that I promised myself

1387
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:57,240
I would never do which is I rebuilt my own kernel, which I

1388
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:03,940
Tried not to do that

1389
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:04,460
Yeah

1390
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:11,660
Patch one single line in the Intel video driver before and rebuild my own count before I was an Ubuntu user when I when

1391
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:16,060
I was living the gen 2 life. I I was all about that. I was all about that

1392
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:17,620
I just all the time

1393
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:23,580
But since I since I started switching over to it basically every other distro since then I'm like, I just it's not

1394
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:29,420
It actually is kind of my friends could can tell me hey

1395
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:34,180
This is the line you need to patch and I patch it and then I rebuild my candle and now I'm no

1396
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,180
I'm never ever moving off of this

1397
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:40,540
This machine now becomes precious

1398
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:46,980
Any any ideas of when that might actually get fixed ask Intel

1399
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:51,540
Oh, okay. Doon. Oh, hold on. Who do I hold on? Hold on. Hold on. No, come on now. Come on

1400
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,820
I wasn't ready for that. Who do I ask?

1401
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,300
Intel I actually I'm still not ready. There we go

1402
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:06,620
I'm so anyways, I'm just happy with my Ubuntu 6.04 install overall now that I have all my applications installed

1403
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:11,220
I'm gonna keep it for a while. That's sort of my my ending thoughts on it. I'm gonna just yeah

1404
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:13,260
I'm just gonna see how it feels. I'm gonna stretch it out

1405
01:44:13,260 --> 01:44:17,900
So Noah you you did a thing today you hosted tech talk today

1406
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:22,700
What what? No? Yeah, it was it was great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was good

1407
01:44:23,660 --> 01:44:26,980
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're gonna fly over every Tuesday, right? Yeah, absolutely

1408
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:35,220
And so we stepped in the thing you and I you started it actually what you do this every time what I don't know

1409
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:37,220
I legitimately have no idea what you're talking about

1410
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:39,980
You're upset with me about a lot of things today

1411
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:46,060
So it's kind of hard to pinpoint the exact thing that you're upset about in this specific. I actually think maybe I don't need to explain it

1412
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:50,460
Maybe I should play it for the audience and then let them come to their own conclusion. You just tell me what you're talking about

1413
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:54,580
Yeah, I could so I'm talking about the ending of this week's tech talk today, right?

1414
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:57,220
You didn't you know, you started you started real strong

1415
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:03,260
Well, um, you know what I like about you Noah is you're a hell of an improviser

1416
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:08,580
Wow, there's that you you know, you like like if you're gonna be stuck at say like a Linux fest

1417
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:13,660
Yeah, and you were gonna say have to vamp for like six hours on a live stream

1418
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:20,040
Yeah, or like maybe the entire weekend of self. There's almost nobody better to be with then Noah like

1419
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:24,340
Yeah, like oh, I'm a blabbermouth. Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm just an expert in my own opinion

1420
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:28,020
If we were gonna storm a building and I like I really feel like you would have my back

1421
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:33,020
It's like when we storm when we storm a stream. Yeah, you've always got my back. Yeah for sure

1422
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:38,740
So in in traditional Noah style you just you had my back you rolled into this patreon, but I'm gonna play

1423
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:44,020
There's poppy so there's poppy holy smokes. Why is why is that?

1424
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,900
That was way too much poppy that was and why is he in why is he in the tubes of the youth?

1425
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:54,300
He was in tech talk today. He was in tech talk today. I'm coming. I know what you're talking about now. Yeah, okay

1426
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,940
I listen to tech talk today when I did I did but I don't know if I know what you're talking

1427
01:45:57,940 --> 01:46:03,300
I'm excited to see so basically hold on. I'm gonna play it. I want cuz I don't want I don't I don't know

1428
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:05,060
Yeah, okay. I do. I figured it out. All right

1429
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:08,460
like a day later a beer koozie shows up my front door and

1430
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:15,120
You can get a beer koozie and random other gifts throughout the year. So Noah, you know, he's doing the tech talk today show

1431
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:20,320
He's helping sort of direct attention to the patreon because it's critical to funding for the network

1432
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:26,940
And so Noah mentions some of these things and I want you to just sort of understand how Noah is trying his best here

1433
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:29,660
He's gonna come at this and he wants to build this up

1434
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:36,100
but then he gets sort of towards the precipice of the cliff and realizes he doesn't have an answer and he's just got to make

1435
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:41,040
Something up and he eventually winds up putting him and I in something that is going to be utterly

1436
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:47,380
Embarrassing and perhaps completely damaging to our brand if you were to support not only tech talk today

1437
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:53,660
But the entire network and you can do that at patreon.com slash today now, this is a way for you to show

1438
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:59,020
That you care about the network and that you can hear he's thinking right there. You can hear him thinking

1439
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:07,460
The network and if you're the kind of person that says I want less ad spots, I don't like ads

1440
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:08,300
I don't want ads

1441
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:10,220
I you guys are selling out to the ad

1442
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:15,500
Advertisers because no all he talks about is is how many GSM ting cards he has and how many droplets he has on Digital Ocean

1443
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:17,500
if that's you

1444
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:21,500
Stop complaining and go put your money where your mouth is go to patreon.com slash today now

1445
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:28,460
Here is a here is a special offer special special one-time offer and I know Ange, you know

1446
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:30,460
I've known Ange for oh my god. He's gonna give something away

1447
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:37,140
Totally totally sitting where West is sitting right now and she's just

1448
01:47:37,780 --> 01:47:44,260
Quietly panicking because what Angela and and she's completely right. She's thinking oh my god, whatever he's about to say

1449
01:47:44,260 --> 01:47:47,500
We have to stand by I actually I'm the one that's gonna have to do the work

1450
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:53,660
And so she's thinking what what is he about to say this and I'm listening upstairs. I'm like, what is he about to say?

1451
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:57,060
If I'm making this up on the fly, I don't have a special

1452
01:47:58,900 --> 01:48:07,180
If you if we if the current patron is at 562 so if people that people that's how many people are patrons right now

1453
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,180
so if we can get to

1454
01:48:09,820 --> 01:48:11,340
570

1455
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:12,780
570

1456
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:20,020
Before we'll say you could tell he's totally making this legitimately trying to think how long could I realistically get it?

1457
01:48:20,020 --> 01:48:23,020
It's short enough time to make sure that it's evident that it came from this episode

1458
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:26,500
Eight more people eight more people we get eight people to sign up before

1459
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:33,260
Linux fest will say and that would show Chris that even though Noah has like staggered his way through this entire show

1460
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:39,700
We got a couple patrons. So he actually did a reasonable job if we can do that. I will and this is where I'm

1461
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:46,180
I'm sure yeah, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna do something. I'll do something crazy. You think about that?

1462
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:50,140
I'm just gonna say you know, this is and right. She's trying to cover for you right now

1463
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:54,740
So she did a great job pulling me through that episode. I appreciated having her here. I've been totally hosed

1464
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,500
She's got good cover

1465
01:48:57,500 --> 01:48:59,500
Go go tech talk today

1466
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:06,380
Forward slash today supports the whole network. But also if you do watch and filter and that's more your bag

1467
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:11,680
You can support us there as well patreon.com Ford shots. That's a good idea. Yeah, so good content

1468
01:49:11,780 --> 01:49:16,260
Yeah, because we do I mean people do want to support in both places, but we understand you can't do that

1469
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:20,740
But so as if you want to represent and support cheaper broadcasting you can do either one

1470
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:21,020
All right

1471
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:25,660
Here's what I'll do if you guys go over and we get up to five. What did I say 570?

1472
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:29,620
Yeah, if we get to 570, I will wear a window shirt to Linux fest Northwest. Oh

1473
01:49:30,340 --> 01:49:34,100
Wow, I will wear a windows. You're gonna have to go find one, right? I

1474
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:39,060
I will wear a Windows shirt to Linux fest Northwest if we can get the

1475
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:44,620
570 well, so we could this is kind of where I start to crap kittens. I'm sitting upstairs and I'm like

1476
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:53,220
I'm thinking Saturday and Sunday. We're on the live stream

1477
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:56,740
I'm thinking we meet a thousand plus listeners and Noah's wearing a window shirt

1478
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:01,520
I'm thinking all right, if we're gonna do this, we got to do this and salvage the I hope so

1479
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:06,060
I hope that that chat room and the listeners come together and say we forgive you know for totally

1480
01:50:06,180 --> 01:50:12,660
botching this episode if you listen carefully in the background, you might hear me scrambling down the stairs and let me let me just clarify the

1481
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:18,220
The can koozie that Noah received in the mail is for the swag level members. Oh, yeah, there's good patreon

1482
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:23,220
Yeah, there's a there's a limited number of those. So just check out the different patreon levels on

1483
01:50:23,900 --> 01:50:28,900

1485
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:36,740
She's gotten good at this show. So I'm at actually at this moment

1486
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:39,820

1487
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:45,060
Talk today dot reddit.com. I was just thinking. Oh, no, if we I'm in trouble

Like both of us so eight for Noah and 40 for you

1490
01:50:56,060 --> 01:51:01,100
Well, if I'm going otherwise, I'm there otherwise I'm there to promote my brand not Microsoft

1491
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:06,140
Yeah, so that brand being Linux action show at the Linux fest Northwest. I mean it makes sense, right?

1492
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:08,380
We want to let Linux users know check with you before

1493
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:14,380
Okay, I just think that'd be great what if we did it I or I'll wear an Apple shirt

1494
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,660
So you'll wear a window shirt. I'll wear an Apple shirt

1495
01:51:17,180 --> 01:51:18,380
Okay

1496
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:20,380

1499
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,860
562 right now

1500
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:40,380

1501
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:46,940
Six oh what if you don't 601 601 we should do before doing this

1514
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:45,660
Oh, man, just to clarify just just to clarify before everyone freaks out because I see people freaking out in the chatroom

1515
01:52:45,660 --> 01:52:49,580
I see people freaking out about to freak out in the mumble room. I don't run Windows. I don't have Windows install

1516
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:53,580
I'm not going to install Windows. I'm just gonna wear the shirt guys. I will be on I will testify to that

1517
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:58,620
I'm more concerned about you in a girly top

1518
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:04,040
Yeah, me too. I'm not concerned about that at all. It's better than him. I've seen him without pants on

1519
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:09,320
Yeah, I know trust me well, I guess

1520
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:16,640
Yeah, it's gonna be fun, I'm really oh I'm getting a call right now should we take it well yeah sure yeah

1521
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:21,440
No, I don't know. It's a private number. I know we could do the thing but yeah

1522
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,560
I'm gonna dismiss call because I don't know although I think I just turned on it

1523
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,680
I think I also just turned on NFC and Wi-Fi calling so

1524
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:31,320
Boy, that was that was a mess

1525
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:37,820
So this is sort of our last moment of tranquility as we wrap up this episode of the unplugged program

1526
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:42,460
I we currently don't have a live on filter planned because we're gonna start tearing apart the studio and

1527
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:49,600
So we needed to get out the studio. Yeah. Yeah, don't worry. It's gonna involve more Linux. Yeah

1528
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:55,220
Potentially a lot more Linux, and we will be making content out of that as we can

1529
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:59,660

1533
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:18,940
Although if you're Noah, it's really hot. It's too hot and he's got allergies. Yeah. Yeah

141 I would love to have some clips and good stuff are unplugged from Linux fest

1541
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:49,380
So if you're gonna be at Linux fest Northwest and it can maybe even get a little video of some of the sessions or something

1542
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:53,300
Like that come see us at the booth and let us know maybe we can incorporate into a future unplugged

1543
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:55,540
We'll get some coverage from our virtual lug

1544
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:57,660

1545
01:54:57,660 --> 01:55:03,360

01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:38,020
And

1559
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:40,940
There we go. We're in Noah's the yeah

1560
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:48,340
Windows has now bash on it. That's true. How did I know somebody who's gonna say no and make a great Windows user?

1561
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:57,820
Hold on we've got our first submission for a Chris wears an Apple shirt now

1562
01:56:57,820 --> 01:56:59,180
Here's the problem in order to get this in time

1563
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:03,820
I'd have to order it now and I don't know if we're actually get to 601 once you go back you never go back

1564
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:05,820
Well, then it can just live on the studio wall

1565
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,820
Mm-hmm

1566
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:10,860
JB titles calm

1567
01:57:10,980 --> 01:57:15,820
You have totals JP titles. I thought I'd get more schooled by mr. Popey. That's what I was expecting

1568
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:21,940
That's what I thought. All right. Look at that wimpy wasn't here, but he's got a title suggestion. I'll Pope. He's just a nice guy

1569
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:25,220
Correct

1570
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:27,660
So no, what was your impression right in lady jupes?

1571
01:57:28,740 --> 01:57:30,740
Why yeah your takeaway impressions

1572
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:32,820
the

1573
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:36,000
The oh jeez, huh? Wow. Wow fail

1574
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:40,060
It's super nice. The thing I think that stood out to me most was

1575
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:45,460
The concept like the total nomadic concept right like so when I am at my house

1576
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:48,880
I have all of you know, I go we go grocery shopping once a month

1577
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:51,960
We have all the groceries in the house and you know, the kids have all their toys

1578
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:57,300
They'd have a bedspread that I really like on my bed. And when we go into our RV, it's

1579
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:01,500
We've got a stock the RV for you know food that is gonna be

1580
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:06,620
You know easy to take along easy to pack isn't gonna go bad real fast that kind of thing and

1581
01:58:07,140 --> 01:58:11,900
I we buy separate bedding that isn't terribly expensive because we know we're not gonna be in there a whole lot

1582
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:13,100
and so

1583
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:18,980
the ability to just you are living the entire week and I came and spent some time with you early last week and

1584
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:25,540
Then all of a sudden. Oh, we're gonna leave and in you know, 30 minutes you push a couple buttons

1585
01:58:25,540 --> 01:58:27,580
You pull a couple hoses you unplug a couple things

1586
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:34,220
and all of a sudden you take your house and bring it on to the interstate and now your house is rolling down the interstate and

1587
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:38,540
That's awesome. Well, and he gets he gets like we get partway there, right?

1588
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:40,700
and

1589
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:45,580
Chris goes I'm hungry and just like we just stop his house stops in the middle of the interstate not in the middle of the

1590
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:49,260
Interstate but you pulled off. There's actually it was like a historical pull-off area. It was actually kind of cool

1591
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:51,260
No, no, no on the way down. Oh

1592
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:54,780
Yeah, so we stopped actually was in front of a tire change start. I think yeah

1593
01:58:54,780 --> 01:59:00,700
You're kind of worried about it. But but so he pulls his house to the tires change store and pushes a couple buttons and his

1594
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:03,540
House transforms. It's like transformers. He goes back from mobile

1595
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:08,220
traveling down the road back into a house and then he walks into his kitchen and

1596
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:13,960
His girlfriend starts making him a sandwich in the kitchen with the groceries that they I assume bought for the month

1597
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:16,580
Is this some sort of paradise? Yeah

1598
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:20,940
He eats us he gets out of his driver's seat and

1599
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:25,460
And walks he wasn't in his boxers, but he could have been because he does shows that way so I was barefoot

1600
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:28,860
Yeah in this version. He is in his boxers. Yeah. Okay. He's in his boxers

1601
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:32,440
And so he gets out of his seat if you weren't there I would have been oh really?

1602
01:59:32,660 --> 01:59:33,180
Okay

1603
01:59:33,180 --> 01:59:39,340
so he has he had picture this no shirt just boxers and gets gets out of his seat of his driver's seat and walks over and

1604
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:41,660
eats a sandwich and

1605
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:43,660
chats her a little bit and relaxes and

1606
01:59:43,820 --> 01:59:48,220
Then he gets back up and goes well, I guess we better get on the road and goes back and sits down still with no

1607
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:53,060
Clothes on I took a leak too. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you piddle a little and then sits back down in his chair

1608
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:59,160
What's back and drive and then we continue on we never once left the RV on the way down there and we?

1609
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:06,300
Like we didn't even it wasn't even really like a full like let's stop and transition into we're no longer driving anymore

1610
02:00:06,300 --> 02:00:08,920
We just basically stopped you push two buttons to like I don't know what you did

1611
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:11,060
I suppose you put the jacks out and let the slides out

1612
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:16,620
But like it was it was it was just interesting to be able to be to go from

1613
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:18,620
Mobile to stationary to mobile

1614
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,980
In under minutes, you know mere minutes

1615
02:00:21,980 --> 02:00:22,140
Yeah

1616
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:25,280
And so and then we got to the our overnight spot

1617
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:32,140
Which we just found happened to find on the internet on using all stays app and it was I mean like I would have paid

1618
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:37,620
To stay here. Right? Yeah, so Chris was explaining that he has a trifecta. He likes it to be

1619
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:43,420
Inexpensive he likes it to be close enough to the interstate so he doesn't have to spend a bunch of time effort gas

1620
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:46,980
Etc getting out to the place and the third thing is

1621
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:53,220
He likes it to be private and this place had all three plus it just happened to have like this little creek and it happened

1622
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,980
To have a wildlife. Yeah, it was just a beautiful place

1623
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:58,820
So we get there and then Chris of in his typical Chris fashion

1624
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:03,060
Reaches under some storage bay and pulls out a grill and he's like this needs to be assembled

1625
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:08,140
Where'd the brown man go brown man go to work and hands it to me and then I'm like but master I need to he's like

1626
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:10,780
We don't have tools assemble with your hands boy. I'm like, alright

1627
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:17,220
So I slave away outside putting the grill together and then we ignited it and you I had some of the best

1628
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:21,740
Marinated grilled chicken this goes back to the fact that we just have our house with us

1629
02:01:21,740 --> 02:01:24,820
You know, we'd gone grocery shopping and had he had just thrown some chicken

1630
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:30,940
She made up a marinade of like some spicy sweet chili and sesame sauce and stuff and just had it in the fridge

1631
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:33,580
So we you know, we weren't sure if we're gonna get to cook anything

1632
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:36,000
But since we had it we just threw it in the on the barbecue

1633
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,600
So we we get after after after I slaved away instead assembly the barbecue

1634
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:46,800
Then Chris walked over and clicked the chicken a couple times and made it into I guess. Okay. No, no, it's really good

1635
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,160
It was it was actually it was actually some of the best barbecue chicken. I'd ever have well

1636
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:52,520
I'm not really barbecued more of grilled, but you know, whatever

1637
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,040
Excellent point no. Yeah. Yeah. Are you a believer?

1638
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:00,920
I

1639
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:06,040
Fall somewhere in the middle. Okay. All right, that's fair. So after eating some of the best grilled chicken

1640
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:08,840
I think I never had then we curl up for a night of watching

1641
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:15,720
Netflix and YouTube because just because you live in an RV apparently doesn't mean that you give up normal internet life

1642
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:21,040
So we did that for a little bit and then just crawled up and went to sleep and the great thing is here's how I woke

1643
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:24,640
Up, I'm you might say I'm a heavy sleeper, right, dude

1644
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,900
Well, we have learned is which is great actually for RV living

1645
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:32,640
No, you're a really good RV guest because when Hadid and I just needed to get up

1646
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:37,400
We just got up started walking around made our breakfast just walking moving around Noah and Noah just sleeps through it all

1647
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:39,480
You have to intentionally try and wake me up

1648
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:42,040
But so I'm sleeping and I don't even notice that they're out

1649
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:47,240
I'm just passed out and then the way I woke up was I felt us moving and I'm like, oh

1650
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:52,720
We're driving down the road and then I realized like my arm is getting pushed like slowly above my head and I'm like

1651
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:55,000
What is happening?

1652
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:00,760
So I kind of like open my eyes and look around and there's Hadid with like an ear-to-ear grin and she's bringing the slide in

1653
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:02,680
I'm sleeping on the couch that's on the slide

1654
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:07,640
And so the slide is like moving in it like my arm is slowly getting pushed up and I'm like, oh good morning

1655
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:13,280
And you know they've been up for a while and then so basically I just got to lay there for a little bit like

1656
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,800
a lazy son of a gun and

1657
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:20,720
we got on the road and started moving and when I was darn good and ready then I got up all the way and

1658
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:25,800
And leisurely made my way up to the cab and said hello and hung out for a little bit and then went and had my breakfast

1659
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:28,720
And whatnot, but to be able to live like that is

1660
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:34,920
I don't know. There is something super appealing and I think the first thing is I'd really like to see a

1661
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:37,920
Paradigm shift I would like to stop seeing people

1662
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:42,960
You know demeaning those and looking down on people that live in smaller homes, you know

1663
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:47,000
Like campers or trailers or tiny houses. There is a stigma

1664
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,880
I think and I think that it's actually way more efficient and way more fun than people give a credit for yeah

1665
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:55,600
Yeah, I thank you, sir. That's a good that was good. That was that was a good fun story

1666
02:03:55,600 --> 02:04:01,360
I loved I was so jazzed up about that boondocking spot that we found because it was

1667
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:07,880
It was like three minutes from the highway, which is a big deal when you have a really large vehicle and you need to go

1668
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:10,040
You got to go park

1669
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:13,960
but you have to be really careful about where you end up because you don't want to end up down a road that you end

1670
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:19,320
Up having to turn around or back up because you might end up having to back down a road for a mile or two and that's

1671
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:25,600
Extremely challenging. So it's always kind of a stressful thing when you decide to go off in a town

1672
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:30,420
You don't know and you just kind of go down a dark road because of course we decided to drive into the night

1673
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,560
like we always do and

1674
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:36,080
So when we found this place, it was so dark. I

1675
02:04:36,640 --> 02:04:39,000
Could tell there was a lot of space and there's a lot of gravel

1676
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,400
There was some uneven ground and stuff like that, but it was so dark

1677
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:44,960
I couldn't really get a didn't know what you'd found. Yeah, I couldn't get a perception of how big it was

1678
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:50,760
And then when the Sun when the Sun came up it was like movie picturesque because we have a wind we have a couple of

1679
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:55,640
Windows in our bedroom, but we have one window that that faces what's what side does the Sun rise on?

1680
02:04:55,640 --> 02:04:57,520
I guess we were parked that direction

1681
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:05,280
So I guess we're our bedroom window is faced perfectly east and the Sun's the Sun literally came up and like rose in our window

1682
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,280
In our bedroom, so we it was just this

1683
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:13,720
Extremely yellow sunlight that came in and just blasted our bedroom with just gorgeous yellow sunlight

1684
02:05:13,720 --> 02:05:19,480
And that's what I woke up to and then when I came outside and realized that we had parked around lakes and ponds

1685
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:25,840
And there were bridges and they were like there were trails and it was just really something and it was it was gravel

1686
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,800
And so it was nice and clean gravel

1687
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:33,880
It was you know you could walk around you weren't bringing a bunch of dirt into them into the rig and just just a perfect spot

1688
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:40,080
And absolutely free they just have a three night max and the thing is is lady dupes has about 12 hours of battery

1689
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:42,600
give or take and

1690
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:48,200
then then a generator to cover any of the gaps there and the way the way the generator works in lady dupes is

1691
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:51,400
It kicks on until the batteries are charged back up

1692
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:56,280
Or if you're doing something that's extremely demanding electric electrical wise right have more look

1693
02:05:56,280 --> 02:06:00,960
Yeah, and then once you're done with either the batteries charged, or you're done with your demand the generator turns off

1694
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:07,200
So you're not always running the generator. Yeah, so it's just basically a way to supplement the batteries, and so we're sitting there watching

1695
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,840
Netflix and YouTube and it's all silent

1696
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:16,080
It's it we're in the middle and like you got the windows open so you can hear like all the wildlife outside, and it was

1697
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:22,880
Unbelievable it was it was kind of the perfect night to just start the road civilized adventure. Yeah, it was it was

1698
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:30,280
Mm-hmm on the flagship of the Jupiter Broadcasting Network USS June
