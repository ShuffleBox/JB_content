WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.980
Actually, no, I do remember Chris. Are you wearing your usual lumberjack shirt? No, I watched two live episodes

00:12.880 --> 00:15.200
Got some great swag, but I can't wear it because it's green

00:16.840 --> 00:20.840
The new jacket which I gotta say so wimpy sent me a

00:21.560 --> 00:23.560
buntaise

00:23.600 --> 00:26.880
Fancy with his auntie. Yeah, he's going custom design and

00:26.880 --> 00:31.180
And the shirts are green like I would just be invisible in the studio

00:31.180 --> 00:37.980
Which is kind of cool, but the jacket's black with a green logo like you know where the Star Trek comb badge would be obviously right

00:37.980 --> 00:42.300
And so kind of looks like I have a Star Trek comb badge actually because it's kind of like

00:43.340 --> 00:47.780
Well, I left it at home because the girlfriend loves the new jacket

00:47.820 --> 00:51.460
She wanted me to personally thank wimpy because she thinks it's very well

00:51.460 --> 00:53.780
I can't remember the word she used but she likes it. That's great

00:53.780 --> 00:59.740
Yeah, likes it on you or likes it for herself. No, well no likes it on me. She likes she thought I was yeah

00:59.740 --> 01:02.800
She thought was a good fit. Well, you're welcome Chris. Yeah. Thank you

01:04.460 --> 01:10.420
That's what I'm saying now, of course the I do have that one of the shirts upstairs here, but otherwise it's all at home is

01:11.860 --> 01:14.660
It took a little while because it came from where did it come from?

01:14.660 --> 01:20.660
This is a good question a part of Europe that I can't even remember the name. Yeah, I remember looking at I'm going

01:20.660 --> 01:23.140
What what is what did I get from? Oh, this must be

01:23.820 --> 01:25.820
Yeah, yeah

01:26.060 --> 01:31.420
Yeah, so the guy the guy the guy that runs this place Gabor. His name is it's brilliant

01:31.420 --> 01:33.740
So it's a hello tux and they do

01:34.900 --> 01:36.620
official

01:36.620 --> 01:38.140
Linux

01:38.140 --> 01:41.140
merchandise for a number of projects

01:41.140 --> 01:44.300
and they originally started up as like a part-time endeavor and

01:45.100 --> 01:47.100
it was they've got a

01:48.620 --> 01:52.940
Computer system that you can fit, you know make designs effectively using Inkscape

01:53.460 --> 01:57.980
Feed that into this stitching machine and then it embroidered as you know

01:57.980 --> 02:04.540
These designs and originally that was all running on Windows and he reverse engineered the whole thing

02:04.900 --> 02:06.900
To get it all to run under Linux

02:06.900 --> 02:12.980
That is great. Yeah, and I think just recently like within the last nine months or so

02:13.700 --> 02:20.060
He he is actually doing hello tux and these things as a full-time

02:20.700 --> 02:25.460
Occupation now, but he gives back a rather hefty slice

02:26.180 --> 02:32.820
To each of the projects. So, you know Debbie and are on there and open suzer and you know countless other things

02:32.820 --> 02:40.220
And every time somebody buys one of the items from there, those projects get a kickback from the items

02:40.220 --> 02:43.180
He sells so I like I like his you know

02:44.060 --> 02:45.060
his

02:45.060 --> 02:50.900
Business model and did you get a memory stick in amongst all those that was the slickest thing?

02:50.900 --> 02:55.940
That is one of the smallest tiny neatest looking branded. I mean, it's I

02:55.940 --> 03:02.180
It's like pinky size. It's upstairs. I should grab it. I will I'll grab it before we start the show. I really like those

03:02.180 --> 03:08.220
Yeah, that is slick like I would buy that like if you were if this is back in the day where we had software on

03:08.220 --> 03:12.220
Shelfs and stores right and I would go down to the computer store and I would buy it some new software

03:12.220 --> 03:17.060
This would be like that like minimum price for that $40. It looks like a $40 like wow

03:17.060 --> 03:20.940
It's a hike. It's a high-class like if I ever know why you're buying that

03:20.940 --> 03:25.940
Much pain that much for these kind of things. No, I know I know that's crazy, but I get I take your meeting. Yeah, I got

03:25.940 --> 03:28.340
Look at the guy. He's like I almost wish I had to reload

03:28.340 --> 03:33.180
I just would love to see this in the side of the Apollo. It's because it's a metal nice-looking thumbstick. Yeah

03:33.180 --> 03:40.060
Yeah, and those those you get free if you order like two of these things you get the the USB stick for free or you

03:40.060 --> 03:45.860
Can order it, you know independently as well. So yeah, he's he's a good guy. It's amazing

03:45.860 --> 03:50.860
What's the site for people to check out? Hello tux.com. Let me just

03:51.860 --> 03:53.860
I'll go there right now

03:53.860 --> 03:57.860
This is Linux unplugged episode 135 for March 8th

03:57.860 --> 03:59.860
2016

03:59.860 --> 04:06.860
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's hunkered down in its secure enclave and celebrating International Women's Day

04:06.860 --> 04:11.860
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Well, hello there, Wes. Good to have you here, sir

04:11.860 --> 04:13.860
Oh, yes, it's a beautiful bunker. I think

04:13.860 --> 04:15.860
It's a beautiful bunker

04:15.860 --> 04:17.860
It's a beautiful bunker

04:17.860 --> 04:19.860
It's a beautiful bunker

04:19.860 --> 04:21.860
It's a beautiful bunker

04:21.860 --> 04:23.860
It's a beautiful bunker

04:23.860 --> 04:25.860
It's a beautiful bunker

04:25.860 --> 04:27.860
It's a beautiful bunker

04:27.860 --> 04:31.620
Oh, yes, it's a beautiful bunker. Thank you. It's a nice enclave, right? It sure is

04:31.620 --> 04:31.860
Yeah

04:31.860 --> 04:32.420
well

04:32.420 --> 04:38.740
Broadcasting from today's enclave is a great show coming up in today's episode a brand new version of own cloud and it may

04:39.180 --> 04:45.860
Dress some serious concerns I've had and also open up the door for those of us on a VPS that maybe doesn't have enough storage

04:45.860 --> 04:50.060
At the moment super excited about some of the improvements in own cloud 9 including their code sign

04:50.060 --> 04:54.860
And we're gonna be talking about that then later on in the show. It's a big topic. It's a huge topic

04:54.860 --> 04:57.940
You've probably heard me talk about it already if you cause more recent shows

04:58.180 --> 05:02.440
We've got to get the virtual lugs take on Microsoft announcing sequel server for Linux

05:03.020 --> 05:05.580
That's melting my my whole head

05:05.580 --> 05:09.380
what my whole head is melted by this as somebody who used to I

05:09.740 --> 05:12.340
used to have to deploy sequel servers and the whole like

05:12.780 --> 05:18.660
Lock-in that sequel server used to bring to an organization was unprecedented. So to have that ship for Linux melts my head

05:18.660 --> 05:20.860
We're gonna talk about I'm curious to get your take on it too and then

05:20.860 --> 05:28.260
Later on in the show towards the end of the show there is an application for the Linux desktop focused on the Linux desktop

05:28.580 --> 05:35.820
That promises to seamlessly and transparently deliver Android applications today on your Linux desktop experience

05:35.820 --> 05:40.740
And I'm talking like you go to your launcher you type in the name of the application hit enter boom that Android app is

05:40.740 --> 05:42.580
Up and running on your Linux desktop

05:42.580 --> 05:48.300
Wes and I have it loaded here in studio. We've thrown a few apps at it. We're gonna get your take and

05:48.300 --> 05:52.540
And before we do all that we have like a whole bunch of project updates to get into whoa

05:52.540 --> 05:58.220
I know it's so much show. I talked to the whole opening music. That's how much show it is. Holy smoke

05:58.220 --> 06:00.580
So why don't we start by just talking about this beer super quick?

06:01.420 --> 06:04.100
Wes you brought you brought us something special today

06:04.300 --> 06:11.060
You brought us a lady for International Women's Day from Nineski Brewing Company. Ninkasi. Nineski Brewing Company

06:11.580 --> 06:13.580
Ninkasi? Ninkasi. Ninkasi

06:13.580 --> 06:20.500
Brewing Company. Yeah, I got that part right. Heyo! That's two-thirds Chris. Dawn of the red IPA

06:20.500 --> 06:24.940
It is over on the beer advocate getting an 87 score, which is pretty darn good

06:25.380 --> 06:32.540
It's pretty darn good. It says very good there. Yeah, pretty darn good rocking in at a seven point zero zero percent ABV

06:33.260 --> 06:38.180
It's got it's got a whole lot going on with this beer. It really does, it's complex. Yeah, when you drink this thing

06:38.180 --> 06:43.100
There is a freshness that is happening in your mouth. I feel like it's I feel like when I drink this thing

06:43.100 --> 06:46.700
Would you say it's bursting with tropical notes Chris? Is that actually on the bottle?

06:46.700 --> 06:50.460
That is exactly what I would say. I would say it burst the last year of

06:51.020 --> 06:54.660
Layers of skin and sediment on my tongue right off my tongue when I put this in my mouth

06:55.180 --> 07:00.740
Perfect kind of thing for doing a podcast. Exactly. Clears up the mouth. Alright before we get into our project updates

07:00.740 --> 07:03.620
Let's bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

07:03.620 --> 07:13.020
Yes, of course, so I got I got a secret I'm very excited

07:14.220 --> 07:21.500
I'm planning to pick myself up something in the near term new toy. Yeah, I I hate using the term toy

07:21.500 --> 07:27.860
I hate calling it a toy new business item. Yeah, well because in my estimation it is legitimately

07:27.860 --> 07:30.900
I'm comparing these different solutions. I mean I go legitimately I'm curious

07:30.900 --> 07:37.820
I've been hankering for a really good Cody box and a really good plex box. Yeah, really good Netflix box

07:37.820 --> 07:42.380
I wanted to do all of these things and then if you can throw in some YouTube and maybe a Hulu app

07:42.900 --> 07:44.580
Now you're really getting my attention

07:44.580 --> 07:45.500
But I you know

07:45.500 --> 07:50.700
I don't I don't I don't really want a lot of the different options that are out there and I don't want to build a box

07:50.820 --> 07:56.420
Really? I don't really want to use Raspberry Pi 3 because or 2 because you know, I want Netflix and whatnot. Mm-hmm

07:56.420 --> 08:02.700
So I've been thinking about Cody but thinking about Cody I'm gonna tell you what up my solution is very curious first

08:02.700 --> 08:05.660
I'm gonna just talk a little bit about the new Cody release that I'm getting pretty excited about

08:05.740 --> 08:09.420
So version like 17 or some crap like that. I'll give you the exact number here in a second

08:10.100 --> 08:16.140
Coming out real soon and they got a brand new look you guys a brand new look today with is a new milestone

08:16.140 --> 08:20.900
They say a sanctuary. I think is how you say this one West. What do you think estuary estuary estuary?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.900
I like in sanctuary estuary

08:22.900 --> 08:26.660
And it's a brand new look it's pretty cool. You'll see that

08:26.660 --> 08:29.020
It's got the main new eye catcher is a whole new home screen

08:29.020 --> 08:32.060
Which will guide you through all of the main sections that are available

08:32.420 --> 08:37.620
They've added some useful widgets for movies and TV shows like random and recently added in progress

08:37.620 --> 08:42.860
Actually sounds a lot like it's been inspired from Plex unplayed. Most played are also available. Look at this UI

08:43.420 --> 08:46.180
It's looking pretty good. They're calling this said they're calling this there

08:46.180 --> 08:51.220
What's cool about this is this is also gonna be something that will make available for touch interfaces with a slight

08:51.220 --> 08:53.220
Reface retouch of the UI

08:53.740 --> 08:58.700
Enter the library you're gonna notice new views have received some facelifts developers tried to keep functionality information and balance

08:58.700 --> 09:03.820
I think I think it does look pretty nice. It does look pretty nice and the one thing they also say

09:04.380 --> 09:07.820
They've enabled themes in the default or colors in the default theme

09:07.820 --> 09:10.900
So you can have a whole bunch of different colors now in the default theme which is which is new

09:11.300 --> 09:13.300
Here's where I'm going with this West

09:14.380 --> 09:19.860
Starting in version 17 encrypt on you're gonna be able to use this this nice-looking. I think it looks better than Plex

09:19.860 --> 09:24.340
It's got you know all the plugins and features of Kodi plus if you don't like this look

09:24.340 --> 09:26.340
There's a bunch of other games you can apply. Yes

09:27.980 --> 09:32.860
So I've been thinking what would be the ultimate box and I mean I have a special requirement is I wanted to be able to

09:32.860 --> 09:35.180
Run Kodi. I want to build a run Plex and I want to be able to do it

09:35.180 --> 09:37.820
I want to build a run Plex offline if possible

09:38.420 --> 09:43.380
Mmm, because when I'm going down the road and I got three monsters strapped to seatbelts behind me

09:43.380 --> 09:45.980
I it is yeah, it is a road safety

09:45.980 --> 09:50.660
Imperative that I can have inside out or frozen playing on the television

09:50.660 --> 09:55.400
I mean it saves lives literally because otherwise it's dad. Can I have this dad? He did this dad?

09:55.400 --> 10:00.820
I want this the whole drive Wes. Okay, do you understand what I'm saying? I understand so I

10:02.840 --> 10:08.140
Think I'm looking at the Nvidia shield TV. Whoa. Yeah, I did not expect that. Yeah, I didn't think you would yeah

10:08.140 --> 10:12.820
Tell me more about it. Well the Nvidia shield TV, you know, yeah, it's got good performance

10:12.820 --> 10:17.180
You can run all of these applications. It's actually got the newer version of Google's

10:17.740 --> 10:20.540
Television OS on there. That's not their first attempt at it

10:21.140 --> 10:22.300
and

10:22.300 --> 10:25.920
All of the apps we love available for it crazy great performance

10:26.620 --> 10:29.100
Think I do 4k video nice. Yeah

10:30.220 --> 10:33.620
I'm wondering right on the website says Cody. Yeah, I'm waiting likes. Mm-hmm

10:33.740 --> 10:37.780
Yeah, they've tout all the different apps it runs you do you pair that up with something with Cody

10:37.780 --> 10:40.020
So my thinking is wait till that thing drops in price a little bit

10:40.020 --> 10:43.700
I'm gonna jump on that thing and that's gonna be my home entertainment setup. What's it? What's the cost now?

10:43.700 --> 10:44.940
Well, it depends on which one you want

10:44.940 --> 10:49.700
See, I need offline storage and I don't know what the you can get one with up to a 300 gigabyte hard drive

10:49.700 --> 10:51.700
But the price starts to get to $300

10:51.820 --> 10:55.460
So that's a little expensive, but I need the office so I'm gonna wait or maybe I can see if I can add my own

10:55.460 --> 11:00.340
Storage, but I'm just thinking Nvidia shield TV with Cody is a super sweet

11:00.940 --> 11:04.540
Low-power quiet combo. Yep. It could be a good way to go

11:04.540 --> 11:08.740
I bet there's probably a lot of other boxes anybody the mumble room just waiting to shout out like Chris

11:08.740 --> 11:11.220
There's this Cody box. It's so great. You can just get it right now

11:11.900 --> 11:13.780
You'd know of one

11:13.780 --> 11:15.380
I've heard a few

11:15.380 --> 11:17.520
There's a there's some like some

11:18.160 --> 11:23.740
Some Android sticks that are on Amazon. They could get for pretty cheap that accomplished the same fundamental thing

11:23.740 --> 11:29.620
So you can still use Cody and you know Plex and Android apps so you can get the same experience

11:29.620 --> 11:32.380
But it's not gonna be like for you. I don't know if I want to stick

11:33.040 --> 11:38.260
You know, I don't know if I want to stick because the thing is is I want I want this is over sticks

11:38.260 --> 11:40.260
I

11:40.740 --> 11:47.820
Am over sticks because I just I want this thing to be as fast as possible. I I do not ever want time

11:47.820 --> 11:52.580
I just I I want it to feel like it's right on the metal and I

11:53.140 --> 11:55.140
for me, it's worth it like big-ass

11:55.540 --> 11:57.540
MKV files and

11:58.180 --> 12:02.220
HD streams and video games like it's all worth it for me to have

12:02.220 --> 12:09.560
If the sticks they're just they're just as low-end as possible. I know I know I know speaking of sticks though

12:09.560 --> 12:11.500
You know who is into the sticks?

12:11.500 --> 12:17.940
Mozilla on March 1st, Mozilla senior vice president for connected devices announced that the open source organization

12:18.940 --> 12:24.780
Seeks to develop test and evaluate for Internet of Things software projects. That's coming from Mozilla

12:25.860 --> 12:29.700
project link project sensor web project smart home and project

12:29.700 --> 12:34.620
What do you think West Vanny VAA and I Vanini?

12:35.340 --> 12:37.820
mumble room anybody VAA and I anyways

12:39.340 --> 12:41.640
They got it was funny, but yeah, okay

12:41.780 --> 12:45.940
The announcement didn't really mention anything about Firefox OS at all

12:46.340 --> 12:51.520
But it's probably a safe bet that these things have it there. It's probably a safe bet

12:51.520 --> 12:56.820
It would use these things West my reaction and then this is just me being an out-of-touch Chrome user

12:57.020 --> 12:59.020
my reaction when I hear this is

12:59.020 --> 13:00.860
a

13:00.860 --> 13:02.220
What

13:02.220 --> 13:04.140
What Mozilla is doing what?

13:04.140 --> 13:09.460
Why what I mean I what I don't understand is how does this make Firefox a better web browser?

13:09.460 --> 13:15.420
Is this a super old way a limited way of thinking? Yes. I mean, I guess we'll see

13:15.420 --> 13:20.760
I think Mozilla has been trying to pivot to something like this or at least explore for quite some time, but

13:21.540 --> 13:24.820
There hasn't been a lot delivered. So I don't know. I'm curious to see what it would look like

13:24.820 --> 13:29.700
I believe that Mozilla has the best intentions or at least very good intentions

13:30.300 --> 13:32.300
But I don't know what this will really look like

13:33.460 --> 13:37.740
It does seem separate though from them also having a pretty good browser

13:40.140 --> 13:45.860
Their announcement about the Firefox OS not doing phones anymore. They yeah, they did say they're gonna do internet of things stuff

13:45.860 --> 13:48.620
They're gonna do tablets and stuff like that. So it kind of goes in with that

13:48.620 --> 13:56.460
But I mean if they as a Firefox fanboy, I also don't care if they can make pretty good standard supporting web

13:56.580 --> 14:04.180
Focused internet of things maybe even secure devices then I would support that but I guess it really remains to be seen if that's what

14:04.180 --> 14:05.260
they do

14:05.260 --> 14:08.260
when they if they bring in the new

14:09.260 --> 14:14.580
Engine their runtime engine. Oh, come on, dude. Yeah. No, you're just trying to get me upset

14:14.580 --> 14:21.440
You're just trying to upset me right now. Stop it Rod and you are trolling me. That's good move, but I'm not falling for it

14:22.620 --> 14:28.180
It's just around the corner, right? It's just gonna be yeah. Yeah. Yeah, could it be the next one? Of course

14:28.780 --> 14:30.180
So let's start booby

14:30.180 --> 14:32.500
I think you and I have talked about maybe it was on tech talk today before

14:32.900 --> 14:36.820
Maybe was a Kickstarter of the week hadn't we talked about how we thought if there was gonna be a

14:37.460 --> 14:41.140
IOT type device a chromecast type competitor or something like that. What do you think of that idea?

14:41.140 --> 14:45.780
Um, well, they tried well someone tried before doing their matchstick

14:46.340 --> 14:50.820
Matchstick that we think that was horribly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I

14:51.820 --> 14:57.540
I'm I'm taking with a pinch of salt everything was that are doing at the moment. I haven't seen recently one of their

14:58.300 --> 15:00.300
employees post a whole lot of

15:00.580 --> 15:02.580
internal information about how

15:02.900 --> 15:06.900
How the company works? I'm kind of just wait and see see what they come up with

15:06.900 --> 15:10.100
Hmm kits and kitty. I want to hear your thoughts on this. I

15:11.140 --> 15:17.540
Just think it's more in the line with all the news that has been coming out with Mozilla both good and bad

15:17.540 --> 15:21.900
you know the bad being GTK 3 getting snubbed again and

15:22.500 --> 15:28.500
45 but they do have all this really cool stuff working behind the scenes Mozilla servo

15:28.500 --> 15:32.580
Which is breaking records right now in terms of JS performance

15:32.580 --> 15:35.780
But the other interesting thing that I thought was

15:37.300 --> 15:44.500
Rather interesting coming out of Mozilla was they're wanting to push gecko again. Did you hear about this in what context?

15:45.620 --> 15:51.620
I mean the web browsers context or do you what do you mean when gecko is the rendering engine of Firefox, right as a framework?

15:52.260 --> 15:54.260
To build other applications. It was

15:55.220 --> 15:56.740
hmm

15:56.740 --> 15:58.260
well

15:58.260 --> 16:00.260
That seems like a good idea

16:00.260 --> 16:05.380
well, um, that seems like it almost makes more sense, even though I don't I don't know why that is

16:06.420 --> 16:08.420
Boy, yeah, that's an uphill fight

16:08.740 --> 16:12.100
It is and I just like whenever I see this story

16:12.180 --> 16:15.940
It just makes me think back to the icky situation around the early

16:16.160 --> 16:19.960
2000s where they tried to do the same thing and they came out with like nightingale

16:20.340 --> 16:26.740
Uh music player, etc. Oh great. Yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah, and it was just a bunch of uh,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.120
disappointment really one thunderbird

16:29.120 --> 16:30.160
Yeah

16:30.160 --> 16:32.160
quiet

16:31.760 --> 16:37.600
Uh, that's interesting. Hmm. I I was a good player though. Yeah, actually I would like I would love

16:38.240 --> 16:40.240
I would love to see where they go with this

16:40.480 --> 16:45.760
In other things, uh, I don't even know what the hell that means and it gives me a little bit of a stick in my

16:45.760 --> 16:47.760
Stomach every time I think of it

16:47.760 --> 16:53.200
I I know it's something that it's the only thing they talk about at trade shows right now and I know it's uh,

16:54.320 --> 16:56.320
it's a huge industry I just

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
I

16:58.400 --> 17:00.400
It feels like 3d to me a little bit

17:01.440 --> 17:03.440
you know, it feels like uh

17:03.840 --> 17:08.080
It's something we all talk about and it's something we all procrastinate about or you know

17:08.380 --> 17:11.760
Procrastinate or whatever you want to say about what's gonna could or couldn't could go wrong

17:12.320 --> 17:17.200
But who's actually buying these things outside of geeks that are just dorking around with them like you?

17:18.640 --> 17:22.000
I'm not even buying things is is marketing to not geeks

17:22.000 --> 17:26.640
It's like all kind like the amazon echo and stuff like that. I think the echo is the

17:27.840 --> 17:32.000
I think the echo is the biggest example of a successful internet of things product

17:32.080 --> 17:34.640
And I think what we do is we just arbitrarily go around and say well

17:34.640 --> 17:38.720
This is now an internet of things product. What makes it an internet of things product?

17:38.800 --> 17:40.880
It has an ip address. Is that where we're drawing the line?

17:41.440 --> 17:44.480
It can query apis. Is that what makes it an internet of things?

17:44.960 --> 17:47.120
I think it's just it's a device that has access to the internet

17:47.120 --> 17:52.240
By itself without having to connect to any other devices, but it doesn't have access to the internet by itself

17:52.320 --> 17:56.080
It requires a infrastructure in place a a wi-fi

17:56.480 --> 18:01.600
LAN and a router, but I mean like it doesn't have to connect to like another like for example the freaking

18:02.000 --> 18:05.040
Android watches like they require another device to even work

18:05.520 --> 18:07.520
Like that's what okay

18:07.520 --> 18:11.280
Okay, boy, that's that's a pretty broad broad definition

18:12.320 --> 18:13.680
Yeah, but also, you know

18:13.680 --> 18:19.200
It goes to the same thing about the cloud being incredibly broad. Well, doesn't that technically make the xbox and the playstation?

18:19.280 --> 18:24.720
An internet of thing device that's an or smart TVs were kind of an early front of that

18:25.200 --> 18:27.840
So I think it depends on how much they're made the default, you know

18:30.720 --> 18:34.080
Yeah, it's starting to feel like a lot of marketing bs it's starting to feel like

18:34.800 --> 18:40.560
You can call it a successful category because you can call anything an internet of things device and therefore if anything sells

18:40.560 --> 18:44.560
That you put that label on you can say internet of things is successful, but in the broad context

18:44.560 --> 18:46.560
Nobody's actually buying the shit or putting it in their homes

18:46.960 --> 18:50.800
Uh except for us geeks and even then I think it's a subset of the geeks

18:51.040 --> 18:57.120
Like I don't have a nest or the only internet of things like I have hues lights because i'm in a studio

18:57.280 --> 19:01.440
And I want to match color to my green screen. That's a pretty niche reason to buy hues lights

19:02.080 --> 19:07.120
Otherwise, I don't know if I would buy them like they're not in your kitchen. I bought them and gave them to my dad as a gift

19:07.120 --> 19:12.240
And he's colorblind so that's not even a great gift like he uses them

19:14.240 --> 19:17.280
You know like it feels like it is a gimmick

19:17.680 --> 19:23.600
And I don't know so I wish mozilla all the luck as they cast off into a completely nebulous category

19:23.840 --> 19:25.840
That seems to have no meaning to me. I mean

19:26.400 --> 19:28.320
Anybody can feel free to disagree with me in the mumba room

19:28.320 --> 19:32.240
But to me it feels like anything we want is internet of things when they say this is what they're doing

19:32.240 --> 19:37.120
It sounds like a company that doesn't have really great focus is moving into a category that doesn't have any focus

19:37.280 --> 19:39.280
Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me

19:40.080 --> 19:44.960
But you know, they do have that super fast javascript thing down. So that's true soon as they ship that

19:46.240 --> 19:47.520
Yeah

19:47.520 --> 19:49.360
Soon as they ship that. All right

19:49.360 --> 19:54.320
So we have a few more updates to go through uh before we get into some meat of the show

19:54.320 --> 20:00.080
But I thought this one was interesting. I was getting tweeted this one a lot this week the fail overflow folks have released their ps4

20:00.080 --> 20:04.720
K exec style code to load the current linux kernel

20:05.440 --> 20:10.480
From the freebie freebsd based os. So that is really something they're not cool

20:10.560 --> 20:16.640
They're not breaking the playstation. It's a kernel module. Wes. They must have had to break the kernel module must be signed

20:16.800 --> 20:20.720
I mean they must have to have a sign module. So like what they say with this is that you need a way

20:21.440 --> 20:25.600
To execute this. Ah, so if you get yourself an exploit like theirs was in webkit

20:25.600 --> 20:30.800
For example, then you just take this you can compile it up run it and boom. There you go

20:30.800 --> 20:35.280
Now you run it codes up on github. Yeah, I think that's pretty neat. That's pretty cool. You know what that means

20:35.840 --> 20:40.160
That wolf cluster. Yep. Yeah, it does mean a cluster though. That is that is and they were talking about how they like

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
extract the radion driver and

20:43.280 --> 20:48.560
Make it like work with linux this to me actually like if I was gonna buy a console would push it

20:49.040 --> 20:51.600
I mean I was already in ps4, but this would push it right?

20:51.600 --> 20:56.400
For for a linux geek like me. Oh, man. Yeah, probably it pushes it. It's just fun to make it right

20:56.560 --> 21:00.320
I don't know. I had gen 2 on a wii at one point. Maybe maybe one day

21:00.560 --> 21:04.000
Maybe one day they can really get some performance out of it and use a tin code video. Oh

21:06.000 --> 21:10.400
I see your angle. All right, so I gotta give a little shout out to the elementary os folks

21:10.800 --> 21:15.280
we talked last week with wimpy about funding of ubuntu mate and uh

21:15.680 --> 21:20.160
Daniel from elementary os has posted an update about some of their funding initiatives

21:20.160 --> 21:24.800
He said I want to put a quick update about our bounties as you might know elementary has a bug bounty program where we pay

21:24.880 --> 21:30.640
Out people to fix certain issues anyone can create a bounty on any issue or contribute to an existing bounty. It's pretty great

21:31.280 --> 21:35.760
So far elementary has paid out over 14 000 to developers fixing bugs

21:36.400 --> 21:40.480
Uh, here's some of the big ticket ones were that are still open and you know what I you know

21:40.480 --> 21:46.720
I was looking through this wes and something sort of really jumped out at me as I was browsing through elementary os's bounty source. Yeah

21:47.200 --> 21:48.720
um

21:48.720 --> 21:53.280
And I had an off off air conversation with daniel in the subreddit a little bit about this too

21:53.600 --> 21:57.280
Because I asked, you know, is it slow things down because you can't just go contact the developers directly

21:58.320 --> 22:04.320
And daniel said well, uh, no, we think it doesn't and he said he said I like the kind of transparency that it provides

22:04.640 --> 22:07.920
Uh, of course bounty source isn't loading right now. That's the bounty source website

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
It's just all that's a whole lot of white in your face

22:10.480 --> 22:16.240
But what you what you get by looking at elementary os's bounty source page is you get an idea of where the project is going

22:16.240 --> 22:21.600
Like i'm pretty clear like you can see there's 300 worth of money to work on the file manager right now

22:21.840 --> 22:24.320
And what those top you can really see where they're putting their money. Yeah

22:24.320 --> 22:25.920
Where's the top concerns in the file manager?

22:25.920 --> 22:29.120
They link all the bugs in the bounty source to launchpad, uh bugs too

22:29.120 --> 22:31.360
Which is kind of a nice way to do for a boom to base distro

22:31.600 --> 22:33.600
So it seems like a pretty good system wimpy

22:33.600 --> 22:39.120
I wanted to just sort of get your sort of off the cuff take on a system like bounty source versus sort of the funding

22:39.600 --> 22:42.480
that you've sort of come up with where you're working with developers directly and

22:42.480 --> 22:48.240
Did you look at bounty source and decide it wasn't for you or you just think it's a a different strokes for different folks

22:48.240 --> 22:50.240
What's your impressions on that?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.560
Yeah, I mean bounty source is um

22:53.360 --> 23:00.820
It's definitely a tool, uh platform that you can take advantage of I did look at it and I decided

23:01.920 --> 23:04.240
Uh, it's a small project. We've been to math

23:04.320 --> 23:09.200
There's a small project with a small group of people and I wanted to focus on

23:09.200 --> 23:13.440
on building relationships with people rather than

23:14.080 --> 23:15.760
so

23:15.760 --> 23:20.320
With bounty source you can have a drive by committer who can choose to work on a thing

23:21.040 --> 23:23.040
For 50 or whatever it might be

23:23.520 --> 23:27.280
And work on that one thing and then never be engaged with the project again

23:28.400 --> 23:32.080
And I wasn't so keen on that approach. I wanted to

23:32.880 --> 23:33.760
um

23:33.760 --> 23:40.080
Approach and reward people that had demonstrated a commitment to the project. So that's sort of the the

23:41.120 --> 23:46.160
The route that i've taken I think that and I could also see different depending on the scale of the project how a different approach

23:46.240 --> 23:52.400
Makes sense too. Yeah, I like I like browsing through there and uh seeing what they want fixed and I like the idea

23:52.480 --> 23:56.480
that as a sort of somebody who doesn't have any capacity to um

23:58.000 --> 24:00.880
Contribute code I could contribute money to their bounty source

24:00.880 --> 24:07.200
But then also I found myself kind of confused like should I be contributing to the patreon or should I be contributing to the bounty?

24:07.200 --> 24:09.200
source seems like

24:09.200 --> 24:13.760
It would be better just to sort of focus everyone's efforts in one spot. Let them decide where it should go

24:13.840 --> 24:14.240
Yeah

24:14.240 --> 24:19.760
But well the patreon is like what they do the bounty sources is what they decide needs to get attention

24:20.000 --> 24:24.800
So if you go to the patreon you're giving money to the project to then they could disperse it to bounty source

24:24.800 --> 24:29.120
Wherever they deem that makes sense. Okay. Yeah, and that's that's so that's and of course

24:29.120 --> 24:34.000
You could you could subscribe to bounty source directly too. It's yeah. Yeah, but there's also um

24:34.880 --> 24:38.080
Like just to point out that 14 000 number is not true

24:38.960 --> 24:44.080
They this is they've already posted this before not not this particular example, but about two months ago

24:44.160 --> 24:48.000
They posted like we got 9 000 out for bounties and it's like well no

24:48.320 --> 24:52.080
That's the total number that is potential to be given

24:52.400 --> 24:56.400
Well, he's saying number given but he's saying here in this post he's saying paid out

24:56.400 --> 24:59.520
He's saying that we have paid out not what's event what's hanging out there hanging

25:00.240 --> 25:06.720
Yeah, but if you look at the claimed bounties, um, the math is not accurate. There's like four thousand dollars missing from their claim

25:07.520 --> 25:10.720
Which i'm not saying that they aren't doing what there's you know

25:10.720 --> 25:13.920
They're not doing a good thing and getting developers money and stuff like that

25:13.920 --> 25:17.440
I'm just saying that they they they kind of inflated a little bit

25:17.760 --> 25:24.000
So the uh, I always prefer them not to do that bounty source page is not loading properly for me right now

25:24.000 --> 25:27.680
But it is worth it. There's a link in the show notes. It's actually I think

25:28.400 --> 25:31.520
Elementary os when you when you follow them from the outside seems a little opaque

25:31.520 --> 25:35.840
It's kind of hard to see what they're doing where they're going, you know, they got they're probably working on stuff

25:35.840 --> 25:37.680
But when you go to this it's it's sort of

25:38.240 --> 25:42.560
Sort of it's like pulling back the curtains insider's view. Yeah, you can you can get a you can get a pretty quick

25:42.560 --> 25:48.880
Uh, yeah, this page just loaded for me. So you can see there's 625 dollars worth of bounties available for their new mail program

25:49.360 --> 25:50.720
elementary os

25:50.720 --> 25:56.560
565 bounties for gtk plus 520 for the shell 365 midori

25:57.180 --> 26:00.160
315 pantheon files and they have different stuff in here

26:00.160 --> 26:01.840
You can see like for their app center

26:01.840 --> 26:06.000
One of the things they want work on worked on is the show the most popular apps feature and they're willing to pay money

26:06.080 --> 26:07.520
for that nice

26:07.520 --> 26:12.640
I remember this is making me excited for when their next version comes out. Yeah, it's been so long and I haven't wanted to

26:13.360 --> 26:16.160
The current one's so old it is it is kind of fascinating to watch it

26:16.160 --> 26:20.320
From that perspective, so I decided I'd toss him a few bucks to the bounty source

26:20.320 --> 26:21.680
Just because I think it's an interesting idea

26:21.680 --> 26:24.160
Totally, you know because when i'm i'm the reason why i'm what i'm

26:24.720 --> 26:27.040
For those of you that are wondering why i'm looking at this stuff so much is

26:27.280 --> 26:31.280
I eventually want to come up with a model like this for jb when we can afford to do so through our patreon

26:31.520 --> 26:32.800
But I don't know

26:32.800 --> 26:36.320
Support the community that keeps you here. And so I was kind of looking at the wimpy's model

26:36.320 --> 26:39.360
I like that a lot because I like establishing those relationships with people, right?

26:39.680 --> 26:42.080
Uh, but then this is another way to go

26:42.080 --> 26:47.200
But this seems like for something that's not a if you're not a software project this this model doesn't really work very well

26:47.440 --> 26:51.120
But it's interesting to kind of check in and see what different people are doing and I find both

26:51.600 --> 26:54.720
Approaches to be very valid. So it's it's good to watch I think

26:55.280 --> 27:00.240
All right, wes the way yes, go ahead. You could adapt the way you could adapt bounty source to jb

27:00.560 --> 27:02.560
Is that if you are using?

27:03.040 --> 27:05.920
uh open source software in the production of

27:06.560 --> 27:07.520
your

27:07.520 --> 27:09.520
podcasts and video casts

27:09.520 --> 27:17.040
You could post bounties to add features or fix issues in the tools that you're using

27:17.760 --> 27:23.040
Sure, because that that way then let's pick ffmpeg because I know you use it a lot

27:23.040 --> 27:25.840
Let's suppose you need it to tell you the price of tea in china

27:26.320 --> 27:33.360
You put a bounty up for that to happen in ffmpeg and ffmpeg benefit and you've clearly funded that

27:33.840 --> 27:37.360
Body of work so you could make it work for you know

27:37.360 --> 27:42.000
You know what you're doing and it might be a little easier to navigate because obviously elementary is a

27:42.480 --> 27:48.800
A rather large project and there's lots and lots of bounties there and I imagine your the scope of your bounties would be a lot

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
Smaller. Yeah

27:50.880 --> 27:55.520
There's a there's a big problem bounty source though in the sense that if you put money out for a particular thing

27:55.600 --> 27:58.000
And then no one does it that money is still out

27:58.880 --> 28:00.880
Like there's a difference between pay like that

28:00.880 --> 28:04.160
This is actually one of the things that are mentioned about them paying money to developers

28:04.160 --> 28:07.200
This is not true because of the way bounty source is structured

28:07.200 --> 28:13.680
You're paying money to bounty source because as soon as it's put into that particular project to or that task

28:14.160 --> 28:15.920
It bounty source takes that money

28:15.920 --> 28:23.520
So maybe elementary has paid out that amount of money in general to bounty source, but no one's actually claimed it

28:24.000 --> 28:26.480
So if you don't like if you scroll down their list

28:26.480 --> 28:32.080
It says this is how much has been claimed by developers and it's it's a lot different than what has actually been put into the

28:32.080 --> 28:34.800
The bounty source itself. So if you're going to

28:35.520 --> 28:39.520
Donate to a particular project. It's better to just give them the money to the project

28:40.240 --> 28:44.080
And say maybe maybe ask the ear market for this purpose or something

28:44.800 --> 28:47.760
That sucks for elementary. So you're saying that elementary have

28:48.800 --> 28:52.400
Put money into bounty source to say we want these things

28:52.860 --> 28:59.200
Implemented or fixed or whatever they want and they've paid some 14 000 in to a thing

28:59.200 --> 29:03.520
And that money has been invested by them, but the work hasn't been done

29:04.320 --> 29:08.480
And it's the money's effectively sitting in escrow waiting for somebody to do the work

29:09.360 --> 29:12.800
Yes, there's about four thousand waiting for someone to do it

29:13.520 --> 29:17.440
I guess they figure that it's in the wash that eventually somebody will come along and claim that work

29:18.240 --> 29:20.240
I hope so. Yeah, what happens if that does it?

29:20.720 --> 29:23.200
Or you maybe the people don't even maybe there are people in those projects

29:23.200 --> 29:26.080
They're not even aware that those are a thing that they're willing to pay for

29:26.080 --> 29:30.640
And what if you cancel? Oh, that's a good point. Like if it's gtk work, for example

29:30.800 --> 29:34.560
A gtk maintainer might not even know there's a a elementary bounty for it

29:35.200 --> 29:38.320
yeah, he might even do the work and then that money is just

29:39.200 --> 29:43.280
Already put into banning source, but no one claims because they didn't know to claim it and it's just there forever

29:44.000 --> 29:48.320
I guess until they cancel the project right if they canceled that line item, I guess it would probably return the money

29:49.600 --> 29:51.040
I'm, not sure about that

29:51.040 --> 29:56.880
I I didn't know that's how bounty source worked. I'd certainly be really interested in hearing more about

29:57.760 --> 29:59.280
particularly from elementary

29:59.280 --> 30:05.200
um, i've just listened to a fascinating podcast today with stewart langridge on the uh, simply elementary podcast

30:05.280 --> 30:10.080
It was a really insightful talk about his experiences with elementary and some of his

30:10.640 --> 30:14.480
Thoughts on on their project and their direction. It's a great listen

30:14.560 --> 30:17.440
If you if you've not heard that it's definitely one to go and listen to

30:17.440 --> 30:22.800
But I I feel bad for elementary that they may have invested money that they're

30:23.440 --> 30:26.000
Not getting full value out of

30:26.800 --> 30:31.680
I would I would estimate it's a matter of counseling the bounty and then the money probably returns

30:32.480 --> 30:37.760
So if so, but then it's but then of course, it's just the process of administratively following up on those things, right?

30:38.560 --> 30:42.800
Yeah, there's a few of those gtk things those line items for gtk. They've been in for a while

30:42.800 --> 30:48.080
For a while. I I know for at least at least two of those i've seen for a long time because I used I was

30:48.320 --> 30:52.960
when they first the reason I know about this thing about a source of stuff is because when they announced this like

30:53.600 --> 30:54.480
Uh a couple months ago

30:54.480 --> 30:59.680
They said like 9 000 was paid out and I had a conversation with daniel and one of the developers that essentially

31:00.000 --> 31:02.160
I was I realized that it's not

31:03.280 --> 31:06.560
It's not exactly paid out to a developer. It's just paid out to bounty source

31:06.560 --> 31:11.440
So, um, I didn't ask him about what happens if you cancel it, but um, hopefully

31:12.080 --> 31:16.480
They could if they cancel that they get the money back. But at the moment it's just you know in limbo

31:17.440 --> 31:21.200
Yeah, bounty source seems to have continued to grow but it hasn't grown at the rate i've expected either

31:21.280 --> 31:27.600
So they have continued to expand it's it's uh, it's worth. I've also kind of created as

31:28.160 --> 31:29.760
code based

31:29.760 --> 31:34.960
Patreon type thing too. Hmm. I think that's interesting. I think for us i'm going to look at it

31:34.960 --> 31:40.000
I'm going to look at it. I don't know if if if it works directly well for us or not, but I like it

31:40.080 --> 31:44.240
So i'm going to play around more keep looking into it. I'd love to hear from the elementary os project. Yeah, absolutely

31:44.800 --> 31:48.320
Okay, so I want to shift gears and start talking about this new own cloud release

31:48.320 --> 31:52.320
This looks like version 9 is a pretty big deal. Uh, and you know, you could probably deploy

31:53.040 --> 31:55.520
Own cloud on a digital ocean droplet. They'll probably have

31:56.000 --> 31:58.640
They'll probably have a really easy deployment here in a few days for version 9

31:58.720 --> 32:02.960
So use our promo code if you would do unplugged and get a ten dollar credit over digital ocean

32:02.960 --> 32:06.880
Digital ocean is a simple cloud housing provider dedicated offering most intuitive and easy way for you

32:07.440 --> 32:12.560
Discipline up your own server up in the cloud. They have uh, mostly linux. I mean, let's be honest west

32:12.640 --> 32:14.160
It's the superior os

32:14.160 --> 32:17.280
But they do have a little free bsd too. You can get that's your fancy

32:17.440 --> 32:17.760
Yeah

32:17.760 --> 32:22.880
You can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start only five dollars per month for 512 megabytes of ram

32:23.200 --> 32:28.640
A 20 gigabyte ssd because they all ssd's a blazing fast cpu and a terabyte of transfer

32:28.640 --> 32:34.880
Their pricing plan is crazy straightforward. In fact, you can go to their pricing page and do yourself a favor tab it over to hourly

32:35.360 --> 32:37.040
Look at that wes

32:37.040 --> 32:43.360
Three cents an hour two gigabytes of ram two core processor 40 gigabyte ssd and three terabytes of transfer, you know

32:43.360 --> 32:46.800
It's kind of it's becoming you have just something you want to do. Oh you're compiling the kernel

32:47.760 --> 32:50.000
Yeah, just do it on digital ocean droplet, you know

32:50.000 --> 32:52.560
If you're using things like docker too, it's really ridiculously fast

32:52.800 --> 32:57.120
You can get deployed on a droplet in no time and they've data centers in new york san francisco. Singapore, Amsterdam london

32:57.120 --> 32:59.120
Toronto

32:59.140 --> 33:03.620
Germany got a new one opened up in india, too. That stuff's crazy. I tell you what, but you know, it's cray cray

33:04.180 --> 33:05.620
super cray cray

33:05.620 --> 33:07.620
intense cray cray

33:07.620 --> 33:12.500
That interface. Yeah. Oh my goodness wes that interface is so good. They have a straightforward interface

33:12.500 --> 33:15.140
That's very easy to use but yet extremely powerful

33:15.380 --> 33:21.220
I'm saying you can set like multiple machines dns host names at the same time set up ssh private keys backups

33:21.300 --> 33:26.580
You can transfer between data centers. You can do private networking. You can destroy the machine

33:26.580 --> 33:32.260
It html5 console all of that one click application deployment, but it's still cray cray simple

33:32.420 --> 33:34.900
I'm saying cray cray simple and they have a straightforward api

33:35.780 --> 33:37.300
To make it even better

33:37.300 --> 33:38.820
To just step it up a notch

33:38.820 --> 33:42.820
They have a really great api and there's a lot of great open source code written around and go check out some of those

33:42.820 --> 33:47.140
Great community tutorials written too in their community section super good stuff super

33:48.020 --> 33:53.780
Really well written well documented digital ocean.com. Just use the promo code do unplugged and a big

33:53.780 --> 33:57.620
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring linux unplugged linux unplugged

33:58.660 --> 34:03.140
Okay, so, uh, I don't know if uh, you guys in the mumble room are own cloud users wes

34:03.220 --> 34:05.620
Are you an own cloud user? Come on wes on and off again

34:06.100 --> 34:07.700
But i've been thinking about using it again

34:07.700 --> 34:08.900
I got I got an own cloud instance

34:08.900 --> 34:13.220
I've been running out for about a year and I got a real heavy into it for a bit and I backed off for file

34:13.220 --> 34:16.580
Syncing i've been using it for card dav and cal dab. See that's what I was thinking about. Yeah

34:16.660 --> 34:21.460
Are you liking it? I do and I use sync thing for the file syncing and i'm using dropbox still as well

34:21.460 --> 34:23.460
Hmm can't help it

34:24.180 --> 34:26.180
So own cloud 9 is shipping

34:26.260 --> 34:31.300
Uh, and this is kind of a major release the own cloud version 9 shipped with code signing

34:31.780 --> 34:34.020
They say which promises to offer users with safer

34:35.220 --> 34:40.900
Code, I don't know exactly how but by verifying the integrity of their own cloud installations during upgrades or installing apps

34:41.540 --> 34:42.900
code signing

34:42.900 --> 34:43.700
Yeah

34:43.700 --> 34:50.020
Uh, they say with 8 million users own cloud is the world's leading file sync and share solution providing users with safe home for all

34:50.020 --> 34:55.860
Of their data founded six years ago as a project with the goal of bringing privacy and control back to users own cloud is where it

34:55.860 --> 34:59.300
Is today thanks to contributions from well over a thousand

35:00.020 --> 35:02.900
Open source programmers designers translators and others

35:03.780 --> 35:05.780
Uh the big hot features

35:06.340 --> 35:10.260
You ready for this one? Oh, I want I want to hear administrators will happily

35:11.060 --> 35:16.680
Happily learn that it is now possible to add as many own cloud servers as they want or need as trusted servers to their infrastructures

35:16.680 --> 35:21.980
Multiple own cloud servers y'all sharing and exchanging of usernames along with automatic name completion

35:22.840 --> 35:29.160
Yeah from all the shared servers is a breeze trusted own cloud servers can be manually added by admins who have control over the automatic

35:29.160 --> 35:30.600
edition of servers

35:30.600 --> 35:35.080
And starting version 9.0 organizations and institutions like cern. Yeah, that's right

35:35.400 --> 35:40.120
We'll be able to integrate deeply with their massive own cloud installations with their various storage solutions

35:40.680 --> 35:44.380
In their infrastructure thanks to the addition of a new storage api

35:44.380 --> 35:49.900
That allows for unimaginable scaling levels. Don't even try to imagine it folks built into own cloud

35:50.220 --> 35:55.500
Enterprise edition is also coming next month. We got some nice ui improvements that look great. Hello slack

35:56.540 --> 35:58.540
Nice calendar. Hello

35:58.620 --> 36:00.620
It's looking really good

36:00.700 --> 36:02.540
I want to talk a little bit more about this

36:02.540 --> 36:06.380
But I thought instead of me talking about it west I'd play a little bit from the own cloud site

36:06.380 --> 36:09.500
Are you ready for this one? Let's hear it. This is direct from the own cloud site

36:09.500 --> 36:16.700
I thought we'd hear it from the horse's mouth as always. We are working hard to give you tools to manage your files. Wait

36:17.660 --> 36:20.620
Wait, that's no good. That was no good

36:21.180 --> 36:23.740
I we got it. We got it. We got it. We got to give them a little tip

36:23.740 --> 36:27.340
Let's fix that out. Hold on. Stop the show. Stop the show. We got to give them a little tip

36:27.580 --> 36:30.620
This is this is us contributing back to the open source community wess

36:31.580 --> 36:35.580
This is how we would do if you're gonna create you first you got to get yourself some hipster kickstarter music

36:35.580 --> 36:41.020
For the that is essential, right? So you get that going that makes everything sound better

36:41.180 --> 36:43.500
You wait for that to play a little bit then you start your video

36:45.500 --> 36:50.780
Hello own clouders and welcome to your personal guided tour of own cloud 9

36:51.180 --> 36:54.860
The newest own cloud release is full of improvements and new features

36:55.900 --> 37:02.540
This is better, right much better. Let's start on the main files page. This is the default landing for the web interface

37:02.540 --> 37:07.020
In fact, we should just have that for the whole show. That's not bad. I'm down to keep listening

37:08.700 --> 37:11.660
So that's our advice to the own cloud project good release solid release

37:11.980 --> 37:17.260
But you know, maybe uh put some hipster music in that video. Come on now, so it makes everything better

37:17.980 --> 37:21.500
Uh, look at that though. It's looking really great. So own cloud 9 wess

37:22.380 --> 37:25.900
What's been holding back sharing? What's been holding you back? Be honest with me

37:26.700 --> 37:28.700
Take the gloves off wess

37:28.700 --> 37:32.860
I think mostly just that there had been those concerns about you know large file syncing and I have

37:33.100 --> 37:36.620
I've been using sync thing for a long time. So i've had that problem solved

37:36.700 --> 37:38.380
So it's more been like am I ready?

37:38.380 --> 37:40.860
Do I want to set up the card dev cal dev server?

37:41.180 --> 37:45.580
But with like the documents app and like kind of the more features they're getting it's making it more like well

37:45.820 --> 37:51.180
I already have more than enough servers lying around or I could spin up in an instant. So why not man?

37:51.180 --> 37:53.580
This ui is looking is looking really good too

37:53.580 --> 37:59.260
Anybody in the mumble room currently using own cloud and willing to maybe try upgrading to version 9 and reporting back in the near future

38:00.780 --> 38:02.780
I'm I might do it

38:03.580 --> 38:07.660
Oh, look at that. No, wait, hold on. Sorry. Let me see. That would be completely unknown

38:08.620 --> 38:11.180
Nobody wants to do it. All right fine

38:11.980 --> 38:16.860
I've never installed gnu slash. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. You could take the you can take the fault

38:16.940 --> 38:18.940
I don't want to have to do it

38:19.660 --> 38:22.380
I'm not using it at the moment. I've tried

38:22.380 --> 38:25.980
Uh, I think five six seven and eight

38:26.780 --> 38:28.940
And yeah, the file syncing

38:29.420 --> 38:32.540
Uh was a thing that I wanted to work and it didn't work for me

38:33.340 --> 38:35.340
But i'm gonna try nine again

38:36.540 --> 38:42.940
And I really want own cloud to work and and there are features of own cloud that I should be using because I do have

38:43.180 --> 38:43.980
um

38:43.980 --> 38:50.060
Sort of um notes that I sync around between all of my machines and it would make much more sense to actually

38:50.060 --> 38:55.500
Use something like own cloud to synchronize that stuff. Yeah, I think I really want

38:55.740 --> 39:00.380
I really want the file syncing to work and that just hasn't quite cut it in the past

39:00.380 --> 39:07.020
So with that article about CERN and all of their petabytes of data that they're shunting around the place every day

39:07.420 --> 39:12.220
I'm hope hoping that that's just not marketing spiel and and that's really being

39:12.220 --> 39:15.020
I see i'm worried that until they replace c-sync

39:15.020 --> 39:20.860
Because of the underlying sync library. I just I worry that the the actual client sync is never going to be enough

39:21.420 --> 39:22.540
I just want to be good enough

39:22.540 --> 39:26.700
So like my wife or I could like put up have a own cloud server with my friends

39:26.700 --> 39:29.740
You know what you could do too is you could always point own cloud at a sync thing directory

39:29.740 --> 39:31.180
That seems like the way to go

39:31.180 --> 39:35.100
So I want to get a couple other people to jump here. So Rarian, you're you're a heavy own cloud user

39:35.100 --> 39:38.060
Could you tell us are you looking forward to version 9? What are your thoughts?

39:39.820 --> 39:41.820
I don't know. We'll see

39:41.820 --> 39:47.660
Are you too worried or you're too dependent on it to upgrade?

39:49.100 --> 39:52.540
I'm too dependent on it to upgrade. I I've had a problem with any

39:53.020 --> 39:59.520
Syncing issues like you guys have described but I don't sync huge files like isos

40:00.140 --> 40:05.500
So, okay. I'd be curious to see what muhahaha has to say in the mumble room

40:05.660 --> 40:08.220
Does it sound like you might be planning to upgrade to version 9?

40:08.220 --> 40:14.700
Yes, I just start to use it. So I don't think it will be that big of a problem. You're already using version 9

40:15.180 --> 40:21.260
Oh, um 8.1. Oh, oh, oh, you mean it's a sort of a fresh install of 8.1. So it's probably gonna be an easy

40:21.260 --> 40:25.340
Yeah, that does make sense. Yeah. Yeah jump on that. That's why you can all right

40:26.380 --> 40:30.140
Maybe I should do it. It seems like yeah, maybe it'll be fun to just get it going

40:30.140 --> 40:32.140
I could do a review of it too if I didn't upgrade

40:32.860 --> 40:36.060
And would people be a chat room? Would you be interested in a rate and share files with each other?

40:36.060 --> 40:38.940
Do people care anymore? Yeah, go ahead

40:40.940 --> 40:42.940
Sorry, uh, so

40:43.100 --> 40:47.500
I you I know you're a heavy gnome user chris and uh, so am I

40:48.460 --> 40:53.900
And it integrates very well with the gnome desktop it integrates with the built-in notes app in gnome

40:54.220 --> 40:58.460
Uh, so it's easy to sync notes across. It's really great in that regard

40:59.740 --> 41:00.780
Hmm

41:00.780 --> 41:02.780
See i've been i've actually been really enjoying mate

41:02.780 --> 41:05.580
Okay, so I was actually considering

41:06.540 --> 41:11.500
Switching but yeah. Yeah, that is nice. That is nice. You're just dropping the bomb like that. Yeah

41:11.900 --> 41:16.540
Well, I don't know. It's just I've been I sat i've been using the apollo a lot and then when I sat down

41:17.020 --> 41:19.020
Uh at the gnome 3 desktop

41:19.580 --> 41:21.820
It was the file manager the file manager

41:22.860 --> 41:24.860
I like I prefer the way kaja

41:26.060 --> 41:27.500
works

41:27.500 --> 41:31.420
That to me just works better. But yeah points well taken. I do like the integration with gnome 3

41:31.420 --> 41:34.460
I'll consider if people are interested. Let me know about a review of own cloud

41:34.620 --> 41:39.020
I'll take a look at it. Even if it even if it blows up in your face. That's still another episode. Jeez. Thanks

41:39.420 --> 41:42.460
Thanks. Yeah. Uh, well, hey, no, I can't blow up my face because

41:43.740 --> 41:45.180
code signing

41:45.180 --> 41:48.700
You're secure code signing good to go. Don't have to worry about it

41:49.500 --> 41:51.740
Hmm, I guess I do like the idea of updates

41:51.740 --> 41:55.580
But you know, this is all goes back to own clouds when one of the big advocates that don't get updates from their repo

41:55.740 --> 41:57.740
Right get them from us directly

41:57.740 --> 42:02.220
All right, i'll dig around i'll see where i'll give it a i'll give it a consideration, you know, I was

42:03.020 --> 42:06.860
I've been i've been recently thinking too about using own cloud to store. Uh,

42:07.580 --> 42:11.900
Like a digital filing cabinet because uh, I just got so much paperwork, right?

42:12.300 --> 42:16.060
Like, you know, like when you buy something or you get a divorce

42:16.620 --> 42:18.620
Or you get a loan or whatever

42:18.620 --> 42:24.060
Like there's just moments in your life where all of a sudden you have all this paperwork just dropped in your lap

42:24.060 --> 42:30.140
And I feel like if at that point in time if I scanned it and saved it to a system that I used for years

42:30.780 --> 42:32.220
I could I could actually manage this

42:32.220 --> 42:35.580
But the problem is I set all the paperwork down aside and then it just goes a scatter

42:35.900 --> 42:38.540
It goes all over the place and it never makes into a filing cabinet

42:38.540 --> 42:43.580
So I was thinking geez if I could if I could get some scans of these things put them in an own cloud server

42:43.580 --> 42:45.420
That's protected

42:45.420 --> 42:49.260
But then I would be every time it came time to do an upgrade. I'd be like, oh my stuff you need backups

42:49.580 --> 42:52.220
Yeah, that's true. You need backups. That's a good point

42:52.220 --> 42:57.420
So I might I might I might give it a go because I have been needing like a digital vault for some things like that

42:58.060 --> 43:01.340
And so you never know you never know kaja is pronounced kaha

43:02.700 --> 43:04.700
Not like cougar or coger

43:05.340 --> 43:10.860
Yeah, kaja the file manager kaha kaha. It's a good file manager. Yeah, it is a good reminds me of the good old days

43:11.420 --> 43:15.180
All right, you know what else reminds me of the good old days ting because they're keeping mobile simple, man

43:15.180 --> 43:18.620
They're keeping mobile simple and I love that they're just out to make mobile make sense

43:18.780 --> 43:21.340
It's your minutes your messages your megabytes and that's what you pay

43:21.340 --> 43:27.820
It's a flat six dollars for the line and it's your usage on top of that very straightforward. No contracts

43:28.140 --> 43:29.980
No early termination fees

43:29.980 --> 43:31.980
Really good customer support

43:32.060 --> 43:35.740
It's kind of obvious average annual savings per device for a business

43:36.380 --> 43:38.940
with 11 to 20 employees per device

43:40.360 --> 43:42.360
440 dollars

44:32.480 --> 44:38.240
That's the way to go. It really is also they've got the nexus devices like they've got a refurbished nexus 5 on sale right now

44:38.480 --> 44:40.480
They got the internet phones. They got them all

44:40.480 --> 44:46.820
Linux.ting.com go check them out linux.ting.com support the show by visiting them try out the savings calculator

44:47.280 --> 44:53.600
You'll be very happy you did. I think so linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged

44:54.640 --> 44:58.560
Okay, we got to talk about this a little bit with the virtual lug because I just don't know what to make of it

44:59.600 --> 45:03.720
Microsoft's gone totally cray-cray and they've announced sequel server on linux

45:03.720 --> 45:09.800
On linux. Popey and I had a chance to talk about this a little bit today on tech talk today and Popey said he actually fell

45:09.800 --> 45:11.400
Out of his his chair

45:11.400 --> 45:17.080
So I think he was pretty surprised what was your reaction when Microsoft made this announcement. I was pretty surprised too

45:17.080 --> 45:19.080
I'm curious to see it running

45:19.480 --> 45:23.040
Yeah, so mumble room. Let me know in the chat room if you have well

45:23.040 --> 45:26.740
I'd love to know your initial reactions, but Popey for those who didn't get a chance to listen to tech talk

45:26.740 --> 45:32.580
Recap here your thoughts when you heard that sequel server coming out for Linux, and what do you think it means?

45:35.860 --> 45:38.380
Popey that's your just talking to you Popey anyway, all right

45:39.740 --> 45:44.660
Andy Karses you your takes you think this is a go to go up against Oracle you go

45:45.340 --> 45:47.020
Yeah, I mean

45:47.020 --> 45:52.620
There's been so much David losing so much ground to the Linux Oracle constellation hardware servers

45:52.620 --> 45:56.700
I think you think that you so you really think it's more of a straight Oracle competition play and less of a

45:57.540 --> 46:00.240
Trying to stay relevant by going to Linux play

46:01.260 --> 46:08.660
Well, I mean they also want to sell this stuff like with virtualization being the primary platform being you know cloud first

46:08.900 --> 46:12.900
Then you know the primary apparatus they need to get as much

46:13.620 --> 46:17.740
Value at as they can so they need to like sell sequel server licenses

46:17.740 --> 46:24.060
And if you're not gonna put Linux on the machine then at least you know be using a code for Visual Studio

46:25.220 --> 46:29.460
Yeah, you know I think it's a pretty good move. I could I I wouldn't deploy it personally

46:29.460 --> 46:31.460
But I could see it like at least from my perspective

46:32.540 --> 46:36.400
you know if there's DBAs that manage the databases if that's what they want to do to provide like a

46:37.380 --> 46:41.700
Redundant sequel interface that I connect to then if it works. That's great. I

46:41.700 --> 46:46.860
I wonder if any of you recall a time and place where I

46:47.860 --> 46:50.500
Was in a spot, and I wonder if any of you found yourselves there

46:52.900 --> 46:57.740
You're sitting down you're trying to come up with the pros and cons of deploying different systems and when you look at an application

46:58.060 --> 47:00.220
that required Microsoft sequel

47:00.820 --> 47:03.700
from a Linux administrator standpoint I knew that meant a

47:04.220 --> 47:07.420
Windows IIS server most likely a Windows server server

47:07.420 --> 47:12.260
Windows sequel server, so maybe two three Windows servers locked into a sequel box

47:12.260 --> 47:19.060
It meant that this was going to be yet another deployment a frickin Microsoft Windows and sequel sequel was the way

47:19.980 --> 47:21.980
was such a was such a

47:23.180 --> 47:28.000
Conversation stopper for me when I would go into oftentimes for clients one of the things I could do is we can move these things

47:28.000 --> 47:33.460
Over to Linux you won't have to upgrade to Windows 2003 whatever etc etc won't have to go to 2008. We'll go to this

47:33.460 --> 47:40.480
But when sequel came up that totally stopped the conversation and that in exchange right well, I'm just still

47:41.020 --> 47:49.220
There's other things that's worse, but yeah, I wonder if if for people like me now who are coming into shops and

47:50.460 --> 47:51.740
Trying to get people to move over

47:51.740 --> 47:57.300
Maybe move off of Windows and move on to a different system like you could now spin up a frickin droplet running sequel server

47:57.300 --> 48:01.980
Yeah, right right use that as your as your sequel server your your off-site premise of sequel server

48:01.980 --> 48:06.700
I mean you can't right now Greece. It's not shipping at the moment, but it will be mid 2017. Yeah

48:07.260 --> 48:09.700
they say I just find that to be a

48:10.820 --> 48:15.580
Game changer, it's like and that combined with their announcement today as well

48:17.460 --> 48:19.460
That they are joining the Eclipse Foundation

48:20.500 --> 48:21.420
They say today

48:21.420 --> 48:26.700
I'm happy to share that Microsoft is taking its relationship with the Eclipse community to the next level by joining the Eclipse Foundation as

48:26.940 --> 48:28.860
a solutions member

48:28.860 --> 48:35.360
Joining the Eclipse Foundation enables us to collaborate more closely with the Eclipse community to deliver a great set of tools and services for all

48:35.360 --> 48:36.620
development teams

48:36.620 --> 48:41.340
Continuously improve our cloud service services SDKs and tools what?

48:43.660 --> 48:51.500
What did you know that at Microsoft their developer mission is to deliver experiences that empower any developer building any application on any OS

48:51.500 --> 48:56.440
Get it out of here this I don't like that tone. I don't even I don't use though

48:56.440 --> 49:03.560
Uh-huh. Yeah, it's pretty it's it's it's it's great except for the contradiction of the universal Windows platform

49:04.320 --> 49:11.160
Yeah. Yeah, that is interesting in that light. You're right. You're right. I I actually wonder if this if this isn't really just about

49:13.280 --> 49:18.720
Getting people to develop more services that use Azure in a long long run. I don't know though. I could be wrong on that

49:19.840 --> 49:22.080
Java developers, don't you want to use Azure?

49:22.080 --> 49:27.400
Yeah, wimpy you look at this and you say okay. We got Visual Studio code. We got Microsoft sequel

49:28.200 --> 49:32.800
Dotnet going open source joining the Eclipse Foundation, but wimpy where the hell is Skype?

49:33.560 --> 49:34.920
Where Skype?

49:34.920 --> 49:36.600
well

49:36.600 --> 49:38.600
And this is the important distinction

49:39.240 --> 49:42.680
The previous four things you mentioned are all squarely

49:43.560 --> 49:47.000
developer and enterprise focused and Skype is

49:47.000 --> 49:51.240
desktop focused for Linux and

49:52.480 --> 49:56.320
Microsoft don't love Linux Microsoft love enterprise Linux

49:57.560 --> 50:03.920
And my only concern is if you adopt Microsoft SQL Server on Linux

50:03.920 --> 50:09.280
What happens if it falls out of favor at some point in the future and you've got everything

50:09.280 --> 50:17.240
Invested in it. Then where do you go? And this is why open source is the safe bet because you can't have

50:17.440 --> 50:23.920
The rug pulled from beneath you, you know as best as people have tried when when Oracle

50:24.640 --> 50:25.680
acquired

50:25.680 --> 50:34.760
Open Office and MySQL and other projects and other organizations have they have always come out better and stronger because of open source. I

50:35.760 --> 50:36.960
agree

50:36.960 --> 50:44.520
What does Microsoft SQL have that Maria Mongo couch Postgres and the others don't?

50:45.040 --> 50:47.360
Well now we're asking a question above my pay grade

50:47.360 --> 50:52.760
But I do know that it's a well-respected SQL database server that has some nice features that I do know

50:53.560 --> 50:56.200
Microsoft SQL Server. Yeah, I don't know

50:56.920 --> 51:01.000
Microsoft on it. I well, I know the origins of the Microsoft SQL Server

51:01.880 --> 51:04.040
Because I worked for the company that Microsoft

51:04.040 --> 51:11.240
Bought their SQL Server from in order to create Microsoft SQL Server. This story is going full circle of us

51:12.560 --> 51:16.480
Way way way way back. So Microsoft SQL Server was actually

51:17.600 --> 51:24.800
Sybase SQL Server four point something. Oh, I remember that and they they bought the rights to the old

51:25.680 --> 51:28.440
Code, so I think when Sybase released Sybase

51:29.520 --> 51:30.600
SQL

51:30.600 --> 51:38.420
10 or 11 they sold the source code to four point nine or something like that to Microsoft and then Microsoft, you know

51:39.240 --> 51:41.240
reinvented it into Microsoft SQL Server

51:42.240 --> 51:47.600
Yeah, wow good good callback. That is that does ring a bell. So what do you think wimpy?

51:47.600 --> 51:49.600
What were your impressions when you heard this story?

51:49.720 --> 51:51.720
That's that's a history with this

51:52.960 --> 51:56.800
well, I was never involved in that side of the business at Sybase, but

51:56.800 --> 52:04.160
It doesn't surprise me. I mean, yeah, Microsoft's loving of Linux is clearly enterprise focused and

52:04.720 --> 52:10.080
It makes sense for them to have their database product in that lineup alongside

52:10.760 --> 52:14.640
You know with the Xamarin acquisition and they develop a story

52:14.640 --> 52:20.080
Which I think is going to continue to grow and we will probably see other Microsoft technologies

52:20.080 --> 52:24.720
I think we'll know when they're really serious when exchange could run on Linux

52:24.720 --> 52:27.680
Yeah, you know, I just look at this now though

52:27.680 --> 52:31.480
And I two things strike me about this number one when it comes to Microsoft

52:31.480 --> 52:38.440
You now live in a world where you can use Visual Studio code to write open source.net software to use Microsoft SQL services or

52:38.920 --> 52:40.920
Linux servers running on Azure

52:40.960 --> 52:42.040
That's pretty weird

52:42.040 --> 52:46.680
And then the other thing that I find to be really interesting about this is at the other end of the spectrum is Apple

52:47.040 --> 52:53.560
Open-sourcing Swift making Linux general libraries and the runtime available. I like all of the compiler like

52:53.560 --> 52:57.040
This is a really crazy time for Linux on the server

52:57.040 --> 53:02.760
It is it is so far and above the accepted platform now for on the server side. It's really remarkable

53:03.160 --> 53:06.720
So eat that free BSD. I'm sorry. What what'd you say? What?

53:07.840 --> 53:11.040
I didn't hear a word. This is BSD unplugged

53:12.840 --> 53:18.360
Yeah, yeah, go ahead with yeah, I think you're right I think that

53:18.360 --> 53:24.200
My Microsoft are reinventing themselves as a well as two things

53:25.520 --> 53:28.320
It's clear. It's cloud and mobile

53:28.760 --> 53:33.280
There are cloud and mobile first organization, which I would never quite understood how you can be first in two things

53:33.280 --> 53:35.280
But hey, hey. Yeah, I thank you. Thank you

53:37.160 --> 53:45.280
But I think this is a tacit admission that Linux has won the enterprise server space and that Microsoft have to

53:45.560 --> 53:47.320
be a

53:47.320 --> 53:53.480
Provider of software in that enterprise market in order to continue to be relevant, right?

53:53.880 --> 53:58.320
it really has nothing to do with Microsoft being a good open source citizen or

53:58.400 --> 54:02.680
No, and keep in mind sequels not open source, right? Just releasing it for Linux runs

54:02.960 --> 54:04.960
It has to do with that

54:05.080 --> 54:10.480
Linux is in such a market a dominant position that after years they finally bent to this position

54:10.560 --> 54:12.560
But they seem like they're bending fast now

54:12.560 --> 54:18.760
Yeah, now that they've come to this new reality. They seem like they're actually moving in the direction

54:18.760 --> 54:23.720
Yeah, I mean this this sequel server must have been in the works for some time because that's not something you just cook up

54:23.720 --> 54:26.480
You know in in short term that must have been

54:27.020 --> 54:34.320
Going for you know, many many months. Yeah, and and even in terms of internal staff knowledge

54:35.320 --> 54:39.200
Retooling your staff to work on Linux or bringing the staffing up. That's a big move

54:39.200 --> 54:45.280
Yeah, like that all of that takes like when you think about behind the scenes a company who makes a competitive product

54:45.480 --> 54:47.480
Having to retool to ship this on Linux

54:49.080 --> 54:55.520
That's that's some interesting stuff right there and it's Microsoft we're talking about it's not Adobe which would be incredible

54:55.520 --> 54:58.680
It's Microsoft and man, there's a lot of people that figure all into that

54:58.680 --> 55:01.680
Just want to get things done crowd. It's like that's the tool they know

55:01.680 --> 55:06.680
Mm-hmm, and so if that means that they can deploy it on Linux and they'll just works. That's that's that's nice

55:06.680 --> 55:12.880
Well exactly right, you know, you've now got a migration strategy that doesn't involve changing your underlying

55:13.720 --> 55:20.760
rdbms right you can just have a Microsoft SQL Server on Linux that scales out horizontally and

55:21.200 --> 55:28.240
Your application can scale with that and you're not constrained by the limitations of the underlying operating system

55:28.620 --> 55:34.640
You know, which is you know in order to do web scale applications. You need to be able to do that these days

55:34.640 --> 55:39.000
I bet it was I bet it was ZFS coming to a point to the made him do that was

55:42.080 --> 55:49.400
Huh, this is interesting though and what's next is there something next for Microsoft is there another thing coming I

55:50.280 --> 55:53.120
Don't think it's exchange because I think exchange is too hooked in with Active Directory

55:53.640 --> 56:00.560
Mm-hmm. So I think it's got to be see sequel sequel was its own beast on its own anyways. Yeah, so there's something else out there

56:00.560 --> 56:04.200
Something else. They're gonna put office on Linux. No, I is

56:05.960 --> 56:10.760
Oh, I hope not. Oh boy. I hope nice new you know, though

56:10.760 --> 56:17.400
I do have a bit of a recommendation for all the gals and guys over at Microsoft that are having to train up on Linux

56:17.520 --> 56:19.800
That's our friends over at Linux Academy

56:19.800 --> 56:25.060
This is where you go to get brushed up on your skill set whether it's for your gerb whether it's maybe because you're a

56:25.060 --> 56:31.220
Multinational multi-billion dollar corporations with tens of thousands of employees that has to retool on the new market reality

56:31.220 --> 56:37.460
There's probably a use for Linux Academy. So go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug to get the unplug discount over

56:40.740 --> 56:42.860
2325 video courses man

56:42.860 --> 56:48.900
What would be crazy is a mash-up of over the like last year of that number because this has been going up and up and up

56:49.500 --> 56:53.220
Self-paced courses are awesome and I love that for somebody who is self-motivated

56:53.220 --> 56:57.980
But what I think is also really great about that is they have a great community to kind of help move you along a little

56:57.980 --> 57:02.780
Bit when you need that and they have instructor help they have instructor help. They have instructor help did I mention?

57:04.100 --> 57:08.900
Instructor mentoring is available. Yeah, that's nice scenario based labs. Those are really great

57:08.900 --> 57:15.380
You can you go into an everyday environment you get something done you work in that advanced lab environment from beginning to end over SSH

57:15.380 --> 57:16.940
So you're not an animal

57:16.940 --> 57:22.940
Which is really nice. I tell you what Wes when I'm over at Linux Academy comm slash unplug

57:22.940 --> 57:25.780
You know what I'm doing? I'm saving money on my future. Yeah, yeah

57:25.780 --> 57:32.780
I'm making an investment in Chris and that feels good. The graded server exercises are brilliant. Why sit around and wait all day?

57:32.780 --> 57:34.780
We got computers that can compute right now

57:34.860 --> 57:41.560
Graded server exercise give you real-time feedback like a boost like they should you got a little exam anxiety. Ooh

57:42.380 --> 57:47.180
Here's my tip drink a whole bunch before the test if you don't want to do that though

57:47.180 --> 57:52.100
What you ought to do is go over to Linux Academy because they got stuff over that I'll help you prep for those exams

57:52.100 --> 57:54.100
They have a fantastic

57:55.300 --> 57:57.580
Availability planner you tell it how much time you got available

57:58.060 --> 58:04.700
Automatically creates courseware for you you guys seven plus distros to choose from it's just the courseware and the server that it spins up

58:04.700 --> 58:08.940
On demand. Oh, you need to learn AWS. They got courseware on that you get in the Red Hat stuff

58:08.940 --> 58:16.720
They got courseware on that you're developing Python Ruby get into Android or PHP. Guess what courseware on that all of it and more

58:16.720 --> 58:22.920
Linux academy.com slash unplugged go check them out and a big thank you to links Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

58:23.920 --> 58:31.600
Okay, so I'm pretty sure I actually did a little research before the show to make sure I'm getting the pronunciation of this right

58:31.600 --> 58:36.520
It's it's something we've never talked about before. It's kind of new. I hadn't really heard about it

58:36.520 --> 58:40.920
It's called I think you say shaw link and I got a little video to introduce. Oh, let's see

58:40.920 --> 58:46.120
Hi guys, welcome to my channel today. I'm making something absolutely amazing

58:46.120 --> 58:53.120
It's called shashlik and in translation is basically big pieces of meat on the skewer, which are grilled or barbecued

58:53.120 --> 58:58.360
Oh wait, that was that was another video. Sorry. No, it's not it's not barbecue skewers

58:58.360 --> 59:06.680
It is software that allows you to transparently run Android applications on a standard Linux desktop as easily and simply as possible

59:06.680 --> 59:14.680
Not large chunks of meat. Don't sound good though. That's too bad because I thought that was a you see much better than the own

59:14.680 --> 59:19.680
Cloud video it says the music and they got music on the on this one. I thought that was pretty good music and me

59:19.680 --> 59:22.960
Yeah, they got music meat and you know what it really yeah

59:26.400 --> 59:28.400
At this to the JB repertoire

59:28.400 --> 59:36.400
At this to the JB repertoire man, I'll tell you what you're gonna talk about if you're gonna talk about meat on sticks

59:38.400 --> 59:43.400
This is that is well, unfortunately, it's not what we're talking about what we're talking about is shashlik and

59:43.400 --> 59:48.400
Wes and I you you've tried it on a couple of desktops. I tried it on an arch desktop

59:48.400 --> 59:53.400
I've tried it on an Ubuntu Mate 1510 desktop. What are you trying it on right now? I'm trying it on Linux Mint right here

59:53.400 --> 59:59.400
Okay, so this is a pretty new project and I'm excited that they're like

59:59.400 --> 01:00:04.400
They're really giving a go at this and it's it's it's a big ambitious project. I gotta say Wes

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400
I ran into a few bumps

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.400
Yes, it's definitely it's definitely bumpy

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:16.400
Hmm. Okay. I was hoping maybe we had more success cuz I've only got one application. I've got one as well

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.400
But it did work, I mean it like it it really did work and that was cool. Okay. Okay. All right

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.400
So when I tried it, I tried the snapchat own cloud

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.400
I tried Evernote. I tried telegram. Oh, I didn't think of that

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:35.400
And here's the first couple of there's a couple of limitations when you're gonna run these Android apps on your Linux desktop

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.400
They have to have

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400
x86 builds

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.400
Not all of them

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.400
On your Linux desktop. They have to have x86 builds

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:51.400
Not a lot of Google Play apps are doing that at the moment because you know people are downloading on mobile

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:57.400
They want them to be as small as possible. So they're optimizing the builds. So that's one big downside is it does have to have

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:01.400
x86 build in it another downside, of course

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:07.400
You're not gonna have play services and then maybe on the minor category of downsides is it does pull down a bunch of KD dependencies

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:14.400
Oh interesting. So I installed the dev on their website and it didn't it didn't you know, there were no dependencies

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.400
I just installed it. I did have to comment out it did try to use KDialog

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.400
Yes, I just commented that out and it's been working. Oh, okay. Okay, cuz it still prints the message

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.400
It's trying to make a dialogue for

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:33.400
Okay. Okay. So I did have a it looks like some things on F-Droid have the x86. Oh, yeah. Sure. Okay

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:40.400
That's nice that I was able to download the Jupiter broadcasting app and open the live stream on your desktop on my desktop

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.400
That's cool. Emulated Android. That was pretty neat. I wanted to try the audible app because I have an audible subscription

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:50.400
And there's no way to listen to audible on Linux that I know of and so I was like, well

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.400
That's a perfect opportunity is I will run the audible app. It just crashes immediately

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:01.400
I couldn't get Evernote to install because Evernote didn't have an x86 build in their play store. So Evernote was a no-go

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:07.400
I will say it does seem to take quite some time to load. Yeah. Yeah that sounds a little

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.400
Little weird because the atom processes are x86

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.400
Yeah, I agree. I don't know

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.400
I thought that's why I thought there would be more there were x86 as well because there's there are x86 Android phones on the market

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:28.400
I was surprised by that Kodi would be an interesting one to try out the why would you bother since you could just use the Kodi Linux version

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.400
True. They show they show a whole bunch of apps

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.400
But the ones they don't actually show any of the ones I tried in there in their main screen

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:42.400
But here's what the experience is like is once you have it you download the APK you you tell shosh link to install it

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.400
And then it actually gets integrated in with your desktop launchers desktop menu

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:53.400
When you launch the app it shows up in your taskbar as a running application with the desktop app icon

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:59.400
So when I ran the audible app it showed up in my dock on gnome 3 and it had the audible icon

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:06.400
Which was pretty cool and I launched it by hitting the super key and typing audible in gnome 3 search and hitting enter

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.400
And so that but that part of it is really damn slick and they're iterating on this thing super super fast

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:18.400
I wonder if people out in the audience have messed with this anybody in the in the Bumble room mess with any of these

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:25.400
There's a couple other out there that let you run Android apps on your Linux desktop is anybody played with this in the mumble room

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.400
There's some validity to it I think

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.400
I've used not this one but I've used the one that Google was talking about

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:36.400
Right there's one that integrates in with the Chrome browser that I've used too

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.400
And there's also some I'm actually kind of yeah I was kind of bothered by when you said it uses K dialogue

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.400
It kind of makes me confused because KDE deprecated that like

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.400
Well there's that

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:53.400
You know that was just an install script too

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.400
Hmm okay well yeah I guess you were able to disable with that right so

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.400
I literally just commented that line out yes

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:05.400
Yeah yeah so it has so as you would imagine it's a couple it's a couple of pieces of technology

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.400
You have the shosh link D which runs Android space and responsible for a few things

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:15.400
Drawing a custom boot splash drawing the back and you know menu buttons and notification receiving and pass them to the host operating system

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:21.400
So that's pretty cool and then they have the runtime that's the desktop side of the integration layer provides small scripts to install APKs

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:26.400
Extracting the icon and creating the desktop menu icon and copying any relevant files around

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:33.400
It also provides the startup script which launched the emulator oh the emulator yeah that's the name suggests this is a fork of QMU

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:39.400
Of the QMU Android emulator from the SDK so that's where they're kind of getting the secret bolts

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:46.400
I see yeah it's modified to show the window icon and the title of the app are running not like the emulator

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:52.400
That's kind of an interesting approach though near future plans

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:57.400
Drop the manual APPD parsing fixed network stuff which I don't know what that means

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.400
Yeah I was I was you were able to stream video I was watching the live stream

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:09.400
Yeah simple window resizing to be more intuitive tighten the packaging getting access to the better access to the file system using fuse

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:14.400
It would be pretty neat like if you get this going and get good pass-through of you know devices

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:20.400
Honestly yeah because there are applications that come out for Android that I would kill to have on the Linux desktop

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:28.400
And I would use these for a decent Android or the Evernote client from Android that could actually use my microphone

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:37.400
Control clients on yes different things like that yes honestly you know what the huge light app would be nice to have on my desktop

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:44.400
A very simple app like that would be great so I could definitely see this there's a few things out there even maybe Microsoft Office

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:52.400
Hey possibly yep which is great great I remember many thoughts on Android apps on on the Linux desktop for you close the book on this topic

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:59.400
I haven't tried this but the idea is awesome because you guys should try it out and see which ones work see if we can find something that is it useful

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:04.400
Yeah I give them credit for shipping something right now yeah it's worth checking out and playing around with

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:09.400
It is a little hard to figure out like yeah when I installed the dev it didn't get added to the path or anything

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:16.400
Oh really I installed from the AUR on my machine and I did the bin so I did shoshlink-bin from the AUR

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:23.400
And then you saw I ran the you do the you do install and then there's run you don't have to mess with run but you do install install the APK right and that was it

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:32.400
But then you know you think about this maybe in context of Ubuntu phone right right and you think maybe this would be a decent way to run some APKs on Ubuntu phone

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:42.400
That would be pretty sweet be the right size hmm except for its arm yeah I gotta work on that so it's called shoshlink-shashlik

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:53.400
And we have a link in the showroom says no they do not want this for Ubuntu touch no Micah is upset about that sorry Micah sorry Micah you should join the mumble room and tell me why

01:06:53.400 --> 01:07:00.400
Because it might be a way to get some nice like what about Waze right what if you want Waze or what if you want Google Maps on your Ubuntu touch device

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:08.400
I don't know if they would work because the play API and all that but I think I think they're actually some serious I think they're actually some serious uses for this

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:18.400
Doesn't mean stop developing Linux desktop applications certainly not that would be crazy we would never say that you know what else is crazy not attending a live Linux unplugged

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:32.400
Oh just don't make that mistake be here you really you really sold that way don't don't don't do that that would be don't don't no hey you know we should give a quick mention

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:39.400
You can come say hi to Wes at Linux Fest Northwest and me and the crew yeah that's Northwest is coming up the end of April all right jblive.tv for live shows

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:47.400
jupyterbroadcasting.com calendar linuxactionshow.reddit.com to get it converted to your local time zone we do it every single Tuesday we'd love to have you in our mumble room

01:07:47.400 --> 01:08:03.400
Thanks for being here see you next week

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:39.400
Wow we haven't had a short Linux unplugged for a while that's kind of refreshing wow yeah crazy hey Chris yes sir I gotta go but I just want to tell you I just signed up for the Linux Academy

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:47.400
Hey very nice that's great enjoy that Mr. Radios all right have a great rest of your day sure right on you too we'll see you guys later right on

01:08:47.400 --> 01:09:05.400
Actually I think we had two firsts today in terms of JB shows oh late on me we began 10 minutes early and we ended early no way we began early wow I began on the nail I started this show early no way no way it was

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:19.400
10 minutes early yeah 10 minutes early wow I never do that how did we not usually we have enough things happening yeah I just I'd managed to get through all the things wow there you go look at that

01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:26.400
Rekai mentions I can use MPV to listen to audible books I don't know I don't know how to do that but that sounds good Rekai you gotta give me details on that

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:38.400
Oh I just installed Flappy Bird really using the using the thing I don't know if it'll work but that would be that would be decent that wouldn't be bad you know a games yeah that wouldn't be bad yeah

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:51.400
That's actually a game that I'm surprised hasn't been ported to Linux is Flappy Bird or like a clone of it yeah because there's web versions of it everywhere and there's like 5,000 different clones of it

01:09:51.400 --> 01:10:02.400
Well Rodden I wouldn't mind a K Flappy Bird on my system that runs natively no that's Clappy Bird Clappy Bird oh there we go I like that come on let's not talk about that

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:17.400
Hey look at Rekai linking me to the Arch wiki here with how to play your frickin audible books use an MPV how about that I got Icon are you are you playing Flappy Bird not yet it's loading very slowly it's very slowly loading

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:28.400
Well you know that's a big game that's a real big game yeah that's a big game very complex too yeah this is not the fastest of computers no that's what it is it's the computer yeah blame the computer

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:38.400
Linux's fault slow as a dog you know what you gotta do is get yourself that new Sputnik that's got the Thunderbolt on there I have thought about that oh yeah I have

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:45.400
Is it on sale yet? No no although you could probably get the Windows version now can't you for some arbitrary reason

01:10:45.400 --> 01:11:01.400
I want one of those new 76 systems that are out yeah which one it's the one that's one up from the gazelle I was looking at that one I was like man I need to find a need and justification for me

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:20.400
Oh I know right yeah hey look at this look at this yeah that doesn't surprise me using pie game there is a clone of Flappy Bird yeah are you I wonder if this is I wonder if I search the AUR if this is an AUR oh I'm not using Arch on this computer

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:32.400
I was gonna say if this is an AUR I'm gonna get it right now huh there's probably a PPA yeah there's probably a PPA
