WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
Should we talk about some good news real quick? Did you guys see that KDE 5.2.2 popped out today a bug fix release really?

00:06.840 --> 00:09.080
It's a new month of work though

00:09.080 --> 00:13.940
So that's always interesting and some GTK 3 stuff has been cleaned up for those of you who have a mix

00:14.240 --> 00:16.240
Kaywin's got some fixes as well

00:16.400 --> 00:18.720
So there you go and look at the screenshot. It's really coming along

00:19.280 --> 00:21.520
KDE 5.2 is looking sharp. I

00:22.360 --> 00:28.140
Still have a little I still I still find gnome to be a little bit a little bit more high DPI friendly

00:28.140 --> 00:31.680
But I keep trying out the plasma 5 desktop as well

00:31.680 --> 00:35.760
So yeah, if you guys didn't notice the 5.2 to just dropped today

00:36.440 --> 00:40.300
So now we've had a little more a couple more people show up. Did anybody make it to?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.980
Kansas Linux fest this last week

00:44.200 --> 00:46.360
Nobody. I know Tyler made it but Tyler is not here today

00:46.840 --> 00:48.680
He was there rocking some JB swag

00:48.680 --> 00:54.560
but I did see a blog post that I'll link in the show notes that it a roundup of Kansas Linux fest looks like they had

00:54.560 --> 00:58.680
a attendance of about a hundred and thirty folks who signed up through Everbright and

00:59.480 --> 01:05.240
It was the first annual Kansas Linux fest. That's really cool. And I know I noticed you saw this on g-plus 2 Matt

01:05.580 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, I actually thought it was it was a really cool picture and a great with a blog post that I thought was interesting

01:10.000 --> 01:13.640
So I wanted to share that and it looks like it could have been a lot of fun. Yeah, absolutely

01:14.400 --> 01:18.960
so I'll be curious to see how this fest grows and if you're in the area and maybe be interested in going next year check

01:18.960 --> 01:26.480
out the blog post you can also check out open Kansas dot us and Kansas Linux fest dot us and they have a

01:26.760 --> 01:29.460
IRC channel on free node pound open, Kansas

01:29.680 --> 01:34.520
But that Kansas Linux fest us looks like it's the domain of the of the fest

01:34.520 --> 01:35.920
But it wasn't loading at the time of the show right now

01:35.920 --> 01:41.240
So I don't know if it's down or what but yeah, I think Kansas Linux fest, you know, it's early

01:41.240 --> 01:42.960
I wouldn't say it's one we're gonna go to yet

01:42.960 --> 01:46.480
But it's exciting to see another one pop up and watch it go

01:46.480 --> 01:52.160
So we'll keep an eye on it and maybe in the future. Oh, look at that their site just loaded and maybe in the future

01:52.160 --> 01:56.640
We'll have a viewer stop by and give us a report on how it went. In fact, if you ever go to an event

01:57.400 --> 02:02.920
You know like anything in your area. That's a Linux II or open source event. I want to come back and give us a report

02:02.920 --> 02:05.400
We'd love to hear it. We're trying to give more exposure to this kind of stuff

02:06.200 --> 02:10.000
They're really neat, especially the stuff. We don't get a chance to go to that's across the pond

02:10.000 --> 02:17.000
That's stuff that we really love to hear about because that makes me really jealous. I get really jealous man. I just want to fly. Exactly.

02:21.280 --> 02:28.120
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by steak and eggs. My name is Chris and my name is Matt

02:28.120 --> 02:33.240
Hey there Matt. I I went to the little restaurant the mom-and-pop restaurant by the studio called Ellie's and

02:33.240 --> 02:40.880
It they nobody nobody makes a better breakfast sirloin than than Ellie's Matt. I mean it is just so good

02:40.880 --> 02:46.520
So today I'm protein. I'm fired up. I'm ready to go to solve some problems in today's episode

02:46.520 --> 02:48.520
episode 85 is all is gonna be

02:48.680 --> 02:55.040
It's gonna be a little naval gazing a little reflective a little sausage factory this week. Why?

02:55.040 --> 02:59.760
Well, we do have some really great feedback to get to including a make good that I think is definitely important

02:59.760 --> 03:01.160
We make a correction on

03:01.160 --> 03:05.240
And then if I can be selfish, I don't think I've really ever done this before

03:05.240 --> 03:07.920
I want to spend part of the show today

03:08.280 --> 03:13.960
Discussing buying my son his first official Linux laptop for his sixth birthday that comes up later in April. He right now

03:13.960 --> 03:16.120
he's on like a tablet I've had him on a Chromebook and

03:17.640 --> 03:21.360
He's really just kind of getting frustrated with some of the games and stuff

03:21.360 --> 03:22.720
I just want to get him a nicer computer

03:22.720 --> 03:26.080
But where do you start with something like this something that's not a lot of money something that's rugged

03:26.080 --> 03:31.620
But something that'll be a good Linux experience and I'm thinking maybe a laptop maybe a desktop maybe a NUC

03:31.720 --> 03:37.520
So I'll discuss it with the mumble room and Matt and we'll maybe we'll all walk away with a good idea of what would make a good

03:38.140 --> 03:40.140
starters Linux computer

03:40.360 --> 03:46.540
Excellent. Yeah, and maybe specifically for kids maybe not but we'll do that coming up later on in the show

03:46.800 --> 03:52.920
Also, we're gonna just discuss a little bit of our coverage of distributions and see if we should make some adjustments if we've given too

03:52.920 --> 03:56.120
Much attention to some distributions. So it's like I said a little navel-gazing

03:56.400 --> 03:58.400
But I hope at the end of that discussion

03:58.560 --> 04:03.400
We'll not only kind of have an idea of what what we cover and why we cover it and maybe what we could change

04:03.520 --> 04:06.640
But maybe we'll walk away with a little bit of a mutual

04:07.360 --> 04:12.040
Understanding of the distributions we think are most relevant today. We'll see that's a little ambitious

04:12.040 --> 04:13.920
I don't know if we'll get that far

04:13.920 --> 04:19.560
Something to try but before we start let's bring in our mumble room because they're here today fired up to help us get through everything time

04:19.560 --> 04:29.440
Appropriate greetings mumble room I'm glad yeah

04:29.920 --> 04:35.060
Because our first email I wanted to discuss with you all this whole secure boot hoopla

04:35.060 --> 04:39.000
We talked about it on this week's Linux action show, but I wanted to get it from the folks, too

04:39.000 --> 04:44.600
So Liam writes in to kick off the conversation about alt OS lockout as he calls it. I'm very new to Linux

04:44.600 --> 04:48.640
He says I'm interested in finding out a solution to a potential alternative OS lockout

04:48.640 --> 04:50.520
It's been years since I built my own PC

04:50.520 --> 04:53.760
I'm not very technical to begin with if this is eventually implemented

04:53.760 --> 05:00.160
How would someone like me install Linux on a laptop would this make it harder for system 76 or people like system 76 to deal?

05:00.160 --> 05:05.480
With this and of course he links us to this this ours technica article about Windows 10 making secure boot

05:06.280 --> 05:09.840
More of a reality by telling vendors they no longer have to leave an option to turn it off

05:10.600 --> 05:14.120
And Matt I wanted to just kind of start here. You've been around for a while

05:14.120 --> 05:18.760
You've seen Microsoft at their where the best and their worst literally and figuratively

05:18.880 --> 05:23.040
do you suppose this is Microsoft's sneaky way to try to

05:23.720 --> 05:29.800
Lock down what used to be the open PC market to make it a Windows market or is this an overreaction by the tech press?

05:30.480 --> 05:34.600
it's well, it's the end result is that it could end up being a

05:35.400 --> 05:40.640
Situation to where there's some lockdown is it intentional. I don't think honestly they care

05:40.640 --> 05:44.600
I mean they do and they don't but I think they realize that you know

05:44.600 --> 05:49.200
They're actually setting themselves up for trouble say like perhaps in the EU where you know

05:49.200 --> 05:52.800
They've been known to be dragged through the antitrust suit woods a few times

05:52.800 --> 05:57.520
I don't think it's intentional, but I think that it's one of those things to where they see it as an opportunity

05:57.520 --> 06:00.600
I think they like to kind of set it up. They know it's gonna they know what they know what it does

06:00.600 --> 06:04.040
They know it's gonna happen, but I don't think that was the purposeful reasoning behind it

06:04.040 --> 06:08.080
I think it was just kind of a happenstance, but I'm sure they're they're not gonna lose any sleep over it

06:08.080 --> 06:13.800
I'll I'll I'll tip it over to the mumble room then and maybe I'll bounce it to wimpy first

06:13.800 --> 06:18.120
It's just kind of coming in from a distro developer standpoint and to somebody who's been working really hard on

06:18.560 --> 06:19.960
power PC

06:19.960 --> 06:25.520
Hardware where they have their own unique kind of firmware something very different that makes it a challenge to work with us specifically

06:25.520 --> 06:27.000
It's not designed to lock you out

06:27.000 --> 06:29.680
But it is very different and so wimpy win in that

06:29.840 --> 06:35.560
Context when you look at secure boot and you make it you look at making what is a fairly open platform the x86 platform as far

06:35.560 --> 06:36.560
as installing

06:36.560 --> 06:40.340
Operating systems goes when you'll make it when you look at something that could make that harder

06:40.340 --> 06:42.340
Does it give you pause does it give you concern?

06:42.840 --> 06:44.840
It does. Yes

06:45.600 --> 06:47.600
this feels like the

06:48.480 --> 06:50.480
extinguish in the three E's

06:50.640 --> 06:55.320
Frankly, doesn't it? Yeah, the extended embrace or embrace love Linux so much

06:55.320 --> 06:58.420
They're gonna like I'm gonna try and cut us off

06:59.320 --> 07:02.800
It's interesting the secure boot stuff in principle. It's a good idea

07:02.800 --> 07:05.180
But

07:05.180 --> 07:13.340
Yes, if you make it more difficult for people that have bought their commodity hardware to install Linux then that is is going

07:13.340 --> 07:15.100
to have an effect on

07:15.100 --> 07:22.420
Linux adoption and you know when you look at the server space, there's almost no secure boot or

07:23.620 --> 07:25.620
EFI

07:25.980 --> 07:28.940
Systems in the server space it's all traditional BIOS

07:28.940 --> 07:34.940
Yeah, because frankly just about every server that anyone set or sells ends up running Linux these days

07:35.300 --> 07:41.020
So why would you put those things on that platform that make it harder and more cumbersome to work with?

07:41.460 --> 07:47.840
So yes, I have looked at this Microsoft announcement and it does give me cause for concern

07:48.780 --> 07:54.760
I think that this is potentially damaging and we'll just have to see how things play out

07:54.760 --> 07:59.880
Because the other thing of course is is that there are distributions that even now can't do secure boot

08:00.480 --> 08:07.800
Correct, right and that the big players all can and with if this feature becomes, you know mandated

08:08.160 --> 08:13.560
Then I think what you're going to find is there's not going to be so many boutique distros anymore

08:13.560 --> 08:15.640
You know, you may actually see the Linux

08:16.440 --> 08:18.440
distro choice

08:18.720 --> 08:22.600
Sort of collapse a little bit around the major distributions

08:22.600 --> 08:28.880
Yes, because now this is assuming this takes off and we are in a place where the majority of the marketplace now has this technology

08:28.880 --> 08:29.760
in place

08:29.760 --> 08:35.300
And so if you accept those two factors and you accept that could happen which would really only take time

08:35.720 --> 08:37.760
Really? It's the only thing you just have to go out a few years

08:37.760 --> 08:43.860
Yeah, wouldn't it make it extremely harder for a small startup distribution perhaps someone even the size of Ubuntu Mate?

08:44.400 --> 08:50.080
From getting like this signed key and is there is there challenges and hurdles there? How would that work? I

08:50.080 --> 08:54.840
I to be honest with you. All I know is that as an Ubuntu flavor

08:54.840 --> 08:58.040
I benefit from the work that Ubuntu have done

08:58.640 --> 09:04.240
Partnering with Microsoft to get the signing keys so that they can have signed kernels

09:04.240 --> 09:08.820
And I just get that for free as a you know derivative first as an official

09:08.880 --> 09:11.040
But we certainly know that not everybody gets that advantage

09:11.840 --> 09:13.800
No, exactly. So

09:13.800 --> 09:19.760
And that you know that could you know stifle some some innovation because you know

09:19.760 --> 09:24.840
If you look at distributions like evolve OS with their budget desktop

09:25.160 --> 09:30.400
They've they're not doing secure boot at the moment. It's something that they're planning to add

09:30.920 --> 09:36.640
But then they've got you know, if they have additional hurdles to jump through they may struggle in the in the new

09:36.800 --> 09:42.980
You know the new world order. Let's assume worst-case scenario in actually getting you know their kernel

09:43.840 --> 09:48.920
Signed so that it can operate in this environment and that would be a shame because you know

09:48.920 --> 09:55.240
They're doing interesting work and lots of people get to benefit and get inspired by what some of these other distributions do

09:55.520 --> 09:58.080
So, you know, I look to some of the the more

09:58.960 --> 10:04.800
Design centric distributions to get some ideas and things and if they're not there then it makes that you know

10:04.800 --> 10:10.640
The Linux ecosystem all that more bland and uninteresting right be a real show

10:10.640 --> 10:15.600
It would slow down the pace of innovation. Let's get a coat. Hi. I also tie a cool high

10:15.600 --> 10:19.640
I call to he a coffee. Oh, okay

10:21.880 --> 10:23.880
Well, I'm just gonna say that

10:24.520 --> 10:27.920
There's not really much that they're gonna do

10:28.480 --> 10:30.480
the reason why I'm saying that is because

10:30.800 --> 10:36.120
There are plenty of people that have already invested in having Linux run into their daily lives

10:36.720 --> 10:38.720
Especially on like the business side

10:39.400 --> 10:43.740
so when you try to set up servers or try to set up a

10:43.740 --> 10:51.140
Consumer products with secure boot. They still need to put it in an option to get rid of secure boot if needed because it would be

10:51.700 --> 10:54.020
Kind of like a anti-competing

10:54.740 --> 10:59.340
Kind of thing especially like monopoly loss in that scenario

10:59.340 --> 11:04.140
Couldn't you see like anything above a certain price point in most cases would have that menu flip

11:04.140 --> 11:11.100
But machines like the stream PC that you're seeing from HP right now. That's $200 that ships with Windows 8 one with Bing

11:11.100 --> 11:18.100
No, the reason why I say that is because there's plenty of startups that need to have a low budget and

11:18.860 --> 11:23.420
Forcing people to choose Microsoft it would be you know

11:24.700 --> 11:28.420
That would just not go through. I don't see it. Oh, I don't know

11:29.420 --> 11:33.340
They they're not forcing you to do anything if you want a $200 stream PC

11:33.340 --> 11:39.460
Then you get one that's subsidized by Microsoft because Microsoft has helped subsidizing that cost if you want to spend more money

11:39.460 --> 11:43.580
Cost if you want to spend more than $200 and want something that's not locked down. That's fine

11:43.580 --> 11:48.380
That's your choice. You can go get something else and it's not much different than what Google does with the Chromebooks

11:48.660 --> 11:50.980
It's not impossible to put Linux on there

11:50.980 --> 11:51.700
But you know

11:51.700 --> 11:56.220
It's not really what Google wants you to do and they're slowly taking steps to make to lock that down a little bit more

11:56.220 --> 12:01.300
At a time I I I'll go to Colton go ahead Colton DRG. You wanted to add something in there

12:02.540 --> 12:05.340
Yeah, I I just the whole

12:05.340 --> 12:12.220
EFI thing ever since you know, we started seeing it in the in the consumer PC market

12:12.260 --> 12:17.860
it's kind of been something that I am I don't know if I want to say I'm

12:18.540 --> 12:20.540
Kind of like I just I don't

12:21.380 --> 12:24.980
it's it's kind of scared me a little bit almost just because

12:25.460 --> 12:30.180
just the way it it works with the operating system to lock everything down and

12:30.180 --> 12:36.220
So like when I got my new computer the first thing I did or when I got when I built my new computer the first

12:36.220 --> 12:40.140
Thing I did is I went into the motherboard settings and I turned EFI office

12:40.140 --> 12:45.620
I would just rather deal with legacy bios. Yeah, not have to think about the EFI thing

12:45.620 --> 12:50.660
Yeah, I've also done that as well because you know what honestly it just makes it easier for me

12:50.660 --> 12:55.260
I actually curious wimpy to hear about your perspective working with OEMs

12:55.260 --> 13:00.860
Yeah, so um in the not-too-distant future Ubuntu Malta will be available

13:01.580 --> 13:03.580
pre-installed on a range of

13:04.380 --> 13:07.500
OEM hardware and if you look at

13:08.500 --> 13:16.420
Distributions like Linux Mint and black lab they've already they've already got a history of working with OEMs as a means of you know

13:16.420 --> 13:18.420
shipping their distributions

13:18.660 --> 13:23.820
pre-installed on hardware to sidestep some of this complexity true and I think

13:23.820 --> 13:27.740
I think all the distributions are going to have to have some sort of

13:29.700 --> 13:31.700
Hardware vendor

13:32.300 --> 13:37.940
Agreement Wow, because it may well get harder and harder to you know, do home hacking

13:38.660 --> 13:42.260
Solutions and if there's enough distributions working with OEMs

13:43.060 --> 13:45.060
with Linux friendly hardware

13:45.380 --> 13:46.540
then

13:46.540 --> 13:48.540
it might be that the the

13:48.540 --> 13:55.340
Barrier-to-entry is the cost of buying a computer that's ready to run Linux. I do that. That scares me a lot, you know

13:56.140 --> 13:58.900
And I I don't we don't know what's gonna happen

13:58.900 --> 14:04.260
But I think it's so important what could happen that it might be a little bit worth worrying about right now because what we are

14:04.260 --> 14:06.260
talking about fundamentally is

14:06.580 --> 14:12.780
You know I grew up and got the exposure to all of the technology and all the different operating systems

14:12.780 --> 14:15.980
I did because I wasn't restricted growing up playing with things

14:15.980 --> 14:20.740
So, you know, I would do things like run DOS for a little while then I would retry BIOS for a little while

14:20.740 --> 14:23.740
And then I would try some sort of crazy other operating system

14:23.740 --> 14:26.980
Then I would try the Mac for a little while and be like, oh really I can't really do a lot with this

14:26.980 --> 14:27.860
This isn't as much fun

14:27.860 --> 14:32.860
Let me go try this other platform that lets me do the things I want so I can learn more and it would keep

14:33.020 --> 14:37.460
Drawing me back to the PC platform over the Mac every single time. So I

14:38.220 --> 14:41.940
I fear that this kind of transition would fundamentally limit the

14:41.940 --> 14:47.260
Potential exploration the future generations could do that scares me a little bit. Well, yeah

14:47.260 --> 14:53.580
So so if I have to buy a machine first, it's already pre-loaded for me. That's not yeah, that's a great solution for grandma

14:53.580 --> 14:56.620
I agree and it's good. I'm really excited for you. I'm not putting it down

14:56.620 --> 14:59.260
But what I'm saying is that kind of leaves me a little sad

15:00.100 --> 15:03.860
So a couple of things it's all been a bit dreary and gloomy

15:03.860 --> 15:09.700
But if you've bought yourself a computer pre-installed with Linux, then that may be a good solution

15:09.700 --> 15:14.420
pre-installed with Linux then that means it's capable of being installed with any

15:15.340 --> 15:19.380
You know flavor distribution of Linux, so that's that's good

15:19.500 --> 15:23.640
But I think what's going to happen is if the PC gets locked down

15:24.500 --> 15:31.980
Fine, maybe it's time to kiss the PC era goodbye and let Microsoft have it because these ARM devices

15:32.300 --> 15:37.620
Are kicking on time after time. We've got the 64-bit ARM CPUs now

15:37.620 --> 15:45.380
Things like the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Odroid c1 whilst not powerhouses are very low cost

15:46.340 --> 15:53.780
Entry devices that you can run a range of operating systems on and they could well be the platforms that the next generation

15:54.860 --> 16:01.900
Experiment with and tinker on and there are maybe and maybe you know our Linux future is on these

16:01.900 --> 16:08.300
I cross my mind as well. You might be very right. All right, let's give heaven's revenge a chance to talk me down

16:08.300 --> 16:09.660
Go ahead heavens

16:09.660 --> 16:13.340
You guys are really over exaggerating this as you can sell

16:14.460 --> 16:21.700
And you can boot it anyway, even with secure boot enabled as long as you it's even if they try to put secure keys in

16:21.700 --> 16:25.060
The firmware do you think they're gonna keep us out of it? We can just sign it with those keys

16:25.140 --> 16:30.100
Sure, it's very easy to probe hardware. I kind of though I kind of feel like even so this is a

16:30.100 --> 16:33.340
Most things for secure boot is good one

16:33.340 --> 16:39.580
It keeps that nasty little NSA that all of you always care and worry about out by keeping the secure

16:39.580 --> 16:43.140
Oh, I disagree with that. No, that's not gonna keep them from squat

16:43.740 --> 16:47.760
The company does it and they have their own self-created images

16:48.260 --> 16:51.500
And it can just give more determinism to the whole system. Oh

16:52.220 --> 16:58.420
secure well, I agree with that part you were right here a lot of stability and it's almost like core OS for

16:58.420 --> 17:02.940
Yourself instead of just for the corporate environment

17:04.420 --> 17:08.940
Colonel in it. Did you want to jump in? Did you have something? Do you wanted to respond there because I have

17:09.420 --> 17:15.580
Yeah, I mean essentially basically we've lived without secure boot for the last 20-some years. Nothing bad's ever happened

17:15.580 --> 17:19.220
I just I feel like it is a solution to a problem that never really existed

17:19.300 --> 17:25.740
Well, I mean there are they are trying to do it more than they're trying to apply the problem to way more than it

17:25.740 --> 17:31.300
Ever needs to know. Let me back out. So what heavens I what I what I fundamentally disagree with is your premise that it's not that

17:31.300 --> 17:35.000
Hard to get around you know, you can self-sign etc. Etc. It's kind of like it's easy. Well, I

17:35.540 --> 17:40.020
That's kind of like saying it's kind of like saying well, well Linux doesn't support my wireless card

17:40.020 --> 17:43.460
But if I patch and rebuild my kernel, it works. No problem. It's really easy

17:44.460 --> 17:51.420
Yes, it is very easy to do that. But to tell somebody who is learning Linux for the first time

17:51.420 --> 17:53.340
Oh, yeah, you could totally load Linux on your rig

17:53.340 --> 17:57.180
You just have to have a self-signed certificate first that is gonna blow their brain off, you know

17:57.180 --> 17:59.940
They're not gonna have any idea what to do with that. Yeah, it'll definitely

18:00.580 --> 18:06.740
Prevent new adoption from people who don't know that's what I'm fundamentally worried about is I'm worried about that user who buys a PC

18:06.740 --> 18:12.220
Running Windows says this isn't good enough. I want something better. Here's about this Linux thing this Ubuntu thing

18:12.220 --> 18:14.220
Whatever goes to install it and can't

18:14.780 --> 18:16.860
Well, this thing is actually scriptable

18:16.860 --> 18:19.940
All you need to do is run a simple script because it's all automatable

18:19.940 --> 18:26.940
Even though it would be a single step before installing the secure boot to kernel. It would be just one step

18:26.940 --> 18:34.020
It wouldn't be that much of a hard situation to like learn some command-line options or yeah installing packages

18:34.020 --> 18:40.060
It's just an extra step that is an inconvenience and I'm not obviously the I was just making who me

18:40.060 --> 18:43.740
I was just making a comparison like a lot of times we say things are easy to us

18:43.740 --> 18:49.040
But they're that's not necessarily means they're easy to everybody else and it's but it's not like a little difference though

18:49.040 --> 18:51.580
It's like a fundamentally they can't there's not an option for them

18:52.140 --> 18:54.460
Well, and that's something I wanted to touch on a little bit

18:54.460 --> 18:56.460
There was a time that I actually used to do

18:57.080 --> 19:01.460
Various screencasts and things like that showing people how to install Linux because it was you know

19:01.460 --> 19:05.300
For the most part bios was pretty unified. It was pretty stupid easy to do nowadays

19:05.300 --> 19:11.740
I gave it up why because every single solitary implementation of secure boot is friggin different on every friggin computer

19:11.740 --> 19:15.220
I can't what I'm looking at may not be the same as the other guys looking at

19:15.220 --> 19:19.920
I mean Asus has got their thing and the other guys got their thing, you know, it's already a huge hurdle

19:19.920 --> 19:25.260
And now we're adding an additional thing to it. Honestly, I'm kind of to the point to where great now

19:25.260 --> 19:29.100
We're forcing people to buy computers supporting an operating system that supports us

19:29.900 --> 19:31.900
Fantastic. I'm on board. Yeah

19:32.060 --> 19:34.860
I'm to that point now without a frustration. I'm down with wimpy

19:34.860 --> 19:41.600
It's like I think it's a $25 raspberry pies and $35 are you know, all these all these, you know, sub $100 boards

19:41.980 --> 19:44.380
$150 boards. It's really gonna be where people experiment

19:44.380 --> 19:49.660
So that gives me some hope and as far as the charitable case as to where they're not able to afford a new computer

19:49.660 --> 19:51.800
There are and increasingly more of them

19:52.620 --> 19:58.380
Organizations out there that will help you get refurbished of hardware and I guess you know, there are solutions what I wanted to say is I

19:59.140 --> 20:04.080
And I okay Colonel X I agree. It's not a MacBook Pro but for experimentation and learning purposes it works

20:04.080 --> 20:08.420
But I guess here's the point I wanted to end on is really what this tells me

20:08.420 --> 20:10.940
Is that if we really care about this then?

20:10.940 --> 20:17.480
I we as users should probably begin looking into the free BIOSes and figure out what which one we want to back

20:17.860 --> 20:21.900
You know this core boot and all these other ones that are out there that are like

20:21.900 --> 20:24.820
I forget what ships on these a core boot that ships on the Chromebooks

20:25.300 --> 20:26.700
You guys remember?

20:26.700 --> 20:28.620
Yeah, there's there's different

20:28.620 --> 20:34.580
We this is an alternative and maybe if there's a way we could get it to a point where we could I don't know

20:34.580 --> 20:40.820
With scare but if you'd be possible to replace the firmwares, but if we can continue to drive that forward that might also be a solution for us

20:41.300 --> 20:45.380
It's not perfect yet, but it's it's out there in the wild. It's shipping. So yeah

20:45.940 --> 20:50.440
To start there's so so, you know what they always say when Microsoft closes the door

20:51.140 --> 20:56.660
Open-source always opens a window. Wait a minute. Is that not sure? That's the right thing usually with a crowbar. Yes

20:57.420 --> 21:02.200
Hey now, let's take a minute here and talk about DigitalOcean because they rock and they're a sponsor of the Linux unplugged show

21:02.200 --> 21:05.420
Go over to DigitalOcean and check them out and bring our promo code of power with you

21:05.420 --> 21:10.780
That's do unplugged do unplugged one word lowercase. I'll get you a $10 credit over DigitalOcean

21:10.780 --> 21:13.140
Now why my friends would you want a $10 credit?

21:13.140 --> 21:17.940
I'll tell you why it's like magic in your pocket, but in the cloud and not in your pocket at all

21:17.940 --> 21:22.680
They're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up your own cloud server

21:22.820 --> 21:26.440
You can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start

21:27.620 --> 21:31.060
$5.00 a month $5.00 $5.00. You know what? I I

21:31.060 --> 21:31.980
I

21:31.980 --> 21:35.860
Spend more on apples when I go get apples now like not not computers

21:35.860 --> 21:37.860
I mean like the red ones that you eat

21:38.500 --> 21:44.500
Alright, like it is so crazy that I can do this for $5.00 a month. It blows my brain organ all over the wall here

21:44.500 --> 21:48.940
It's all over the soundproofing them and in 55 seconds, you're gonna get that thing up and spinning. It's crazy, right?

21:48.940 --> 21:54.080
You're gonna get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one terabyte of transfer. Did you hear me say SSD?

21:54.080 --> 21:56.080
Cuz they're all SSDs. I

21:56.080 --> 22:00.140
Think I need to I gotta say that again. They're all SSDs. Now. Why is that matter?

22:00.140 --> 22:05.620
Well, you see back in my day if you wanted really good performance and you want to have like a database and your website all

22:05.620 --> 22:08.860
On one array you would be crazy to have that on a single drive

22:08.860 --> 22:12.380
It just wouldn't work unless unless you didn't have very much traffic, which that's kind of sad

22:12.420 --> 22:15.300
But if you had some traffic you needed to have that on a storage array

22:15.300 --> 22:19.000
You're probably gonna have that either fiber attached or scuzzy attached or god forbid

22:19.000 --> 22:24.640
Maybe I scuzzy if you've got a separate network with its own dedicated gigabit switch and this is serious money for one of these sands

22:24.640 --> 22:25.380
That's crazy

22:25.380 --> 22:26.220
and when you're doing

22:26.220 --> 22:30.300
Koala hosting things like that it drives the cost up way more because then you also have to pay for that to be in the

22:30.300 --> 22:32.300
Rag when DigitalOcean came along there

22:32.300 --> 22:37.140
They looked at all of the technologies like Linux and KVM and the best web standards the best Linux

22:37.300 --> 22:41.400
Distributions and of course the best storage IO and that's SSDs

22:41.400 --> 22:47.540
That's why they're SSDs throughout the entire infrastructure you combine that with their incredible bandwidth of their tier 1 data centers and it freaking rocks

22:47.540 --> 22:51.180
They've got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam and London

22:51.180 --> 22:54.260
And they do a lot of mirroring to make things faster for like some of the repo updates

22:54.260 --> 22:59.860
It's just it's crazy great service you combine that with their amazing simple and intuitive control panel

22:59.860 --> 23:04.140
Which you can replicate the functionality of that control panel on a larger scale with their API

23:04.140 --> 23:09.420
There's tons of great apps around the API. It's amazing how freaking productive how much you can get done

23:09.420 --> 23:14.700
How much infrastructure is at your fingertips for such a low price point all of that in one place?

23:14.700 --> 23:18.420
Powered by Linux and you can try it out for two months for free when you use our promo code do

23:18.420 --> 23:24.860
Unplugged do unplug to get you a $10 credit. It's route the $5 rig two months for free go put core OS on there

23:24.860 --> 23:30.260
Or go put Ubuntu 1404 on there try something out for a while with a good long-term support do the updates

23:30.380 --> 23:34.020
Deploy own cloud try out their one-click installations for things like git lab

23:34.020 --> 23:37.460
It's a really awesome service and it's perfect for our audience

23:37.820 --> 23:44.660
Digital ocean comm and use the promo code do unplugged when you check out and a big thank you to digital ocean

23:44.660 --> 23:50.980
Go have some fun guys, and I love also hearing about what you use them for so keep sending those into the show as well

23:51.780 --> 23:57.260
Sometimes gives me ideas. I think it's you know for me. It's the limitless possibilities that you can use it for

23:57.260 --> 23:58.060
It's like here the other day

23:58.060 --> 24:00.060
I wanted to see if I I did a long time ago

24:00.060 --> 24:04.100
I did an article on Moodle and I wanted to see you know what that would look like on running on digital ocean

24:04.100 --> 24:08.180
It was stupid easy. It's just and and how fast it is when you're running your updates and stuff

24:08.180 --> 24:11.020
It's crazy, and you know they just put out a really great tutorial

24:11.020 --> 24:15.500
I'll link it in the show notes about how to resize your digital ocean droplets

24:16.540 --> 24:20.380
Really nice which I had to do kind of recently for my own cloud one because I've been putting stuff in on cloud

24:21.100 --> 24:26.580
So yes, yes check it out. Hey, okay. Let's do a correction on the sync thing thing

24:27.140 --> 24:29.540
we've talked about sync thing a lot and

24:31.100 --> 24:33.100
We got a couple emails about that

24:33.380 --> 24:35.380
So he says I want to drop you a line to correct an error

24:35.380 --> 24:38.540
I've heard repeated multiple times on Linux unplugged and the Linux action show

24:38.540 --> 24:41.080
I think sync thing is not that hard to manage anymore

24:41.380 --> 24:47.980
People keep saying the key exchange becomes unmanageable behind a beyond a couple of devices this may have been true a while ago

24:47.980 --> 24:51.980
But they've added a feature to address that exact problem starting in version

24:52.700 --> 24:57.260
0.9.18 which I think I tracked that back to September. Oh, yeah, that's what he says. It's called intrude

24:57.260 --> 24:58.420
Oh, I'm sorry

24:58.420 --> 25:03.220
Introducer node interdruser node and you can read about it here long story short

25:03.220 --> 25:09.420
It makes it so you only have to do do you only have to do the key exchange with one central node and the new

25:09.540 --> 25:12.500
Clients will get the keys for all your other nodes

25:12.500 --> 25:18.260
I personally have sync thing set up for seven nodes and key management has been a breeze thanks to using introducer node

25:18.320 --> 25:22.880
So to kind of maybe help you understand if you're not totally familiar sync thing

25:23.980 --> 25:25.620
unlike

25:25.620 --> 25:31.120
Other sync products the way you kind of add devices to sync thing is they kind of they find out about each other and then

25:31.120 --> 25:36.460
You put them within each other's. That's what to put it, but you know blessed areas. I am losing

25:37.220 --> 25:40.380
So long, but you you kind of say yes, this one's allowed to sync with me. Yes

25:40.380 --> 25:44.740
This one's approved to sync with me. They're both approved with each other and then they start sinking he's saying

25:45.520 --> 25:48.540
That they introduced this feature called introducer node and wimpy

25:48.540 --> 25:54.140
I'm not sure if you've ever looked into this but this introducer node feature kind of automates the handing out of future

25:54.540 --> 25:59.260
Clients and so they talked to this introducer node and it automatically adds them to the sync pool

25:59.260 --> 26:07.060
Yeah, I I imagine it is probably the same person that sent you this email contacted me in the week and told me about it

26:07.060 --> 26:11.140
And I haven't installed it or tested it, but I have read about it and it does seem to solve

26:11.740 --> 26:13.740
the problem that I have

26:16.300 --> 26:21.000
Misspoken about so I'm I feel like an a chump now

26:23.580 --> 26:27.020
Yeah, it looks like something have created a solution

26:27.020 --> 26:32.580
Yeah, that could be really positive, right? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so I'm gonna look at sync thing

26:33.980 --> 26:38.620
More closely again now. Yeah, I I think I will too and of course the last time I looked at it

26:38.620 --> 26:42.340
I guess was before September. I can't really remember last time I looked at it

26:42.340 --> 26:46.900
I thought I've looked at it more recently than that, but I didn't look for the introducer node feature

26:46.900 --> 26:51.180
That's for I didn't know to go specifically look for that. I will say right here if that works

26:51.700 --> 26:56.980
Very excited about that because I very much would like to use sync thing because everybody wants me to use sync thing

26:56.980 --> 27:00.460
For one thing, but I also like that's top to bottom open source all of that jazz

27:01.020 --> 27:03.460
So thank you very much for sending that in

27:03.460 --> 27:06.060
I'll play with that some more and maybe wimpy if you play with it and let us know too

27:06.060 --> 27:06.660
That'd be really cool

27:06.660 --> 27:09.700
And I have a link in the show notes if you're curious about how that works

27:09.780 --> 27:13.860
Because it looks like it makes distributing files via sync thing to a larger audience much easier

27:13.860 --> 27:17.820
I'm still a little skeptical about how well that's gonna scale and

27:18.100 --> 27:21.920
Also, what happens if my introducer nodes offline and things like that, but you know what?

27:21.920 --> 27:28.420
I could see like setting up the main node here at the studio and then the introducer node up like on a DigitalOcean droplet

27:28.820 --> 27:32.700
There you go, right and then just let that run 24-7 and hand out the keys

27:34.060 --> 27:39.380
Same to me. Yeah, like current Linux exactly. Yeah, same thing when my own cloud server goes down, which doesn't really ever happen. I

27:40.420 --> 27:43.140
Live in I live in 2015. I use Linux so

27:45.100 --> 27:47.860
Doesn't really go down unless I break it that's when it goes down

27:47.860 --> 27:51.340
I tease V to T to the Z to the V to the I writes in

27:51.980 --> 27:56.580
With one more bit torrent sync kind of follow-up thing or another sync thing follow-up thing

27:56.580 --> 28:01.460
He says I've been a JB fan since some time in 2009 Apollo last lupin tech snap religiously

28:01.620 --> 28:02.380
Just a quick

28:02.380 --> 28:06.220
Thank you to Chris and wimpy for bringing up the bit torrent sync issues and suggesting C file

28:06.220 --> 28:08.220
It gave me the push to make the switch

28:08.300 --> 28:14.380
My setup has an interesting twist and that I couldn't actually host the data on my do droplet due to the size and well the cost

28:14.380 --> 28:18.180
That would be there. So I have the front end on do which is this is exactly something

28:18.180 --> 28:24.220
I've thought about doing and then the back end low on a local server connected via SSH tunnels and SSH FS

28:24.460 --> 28:30.460
He documented his work at TSP ITC calm and all the link in his you can find a link in his email in the show notes

28:30.460 --> 28:36.980
I recently got a job offer from Rackspace and I can definitely tribute everything I learned to you guys. Oh, oh that buddy decline the job

28:36.980 --> 28:38.060
Oh

28:38.060 --> 28:43.580
Wow, that's really good for good problem to have yeah, so there you go. I hope that makes you feel better

28:43.580 --> 28:48.260
To T to the Z to the V to the I a longtime listener is loving C file. Do you feel better?

28:49.100 --> 28:52.300
Yeah, I don't feel like such a chump anymore. Good. Good. Good. I

28:53.340 --> 28:59.620
Have not yet played with C file either, but yeah, I'm now I just don't know what to do. I'm totally totally for club

29:00.460 --> 29:03.560
Alright, so let's do a super quick Linux fest Northwest update

29:03.560 --> 29:08.500
I know those a lot of you aren't going don't care, but I'm just really excited. This is like my full-time job right now

29:08.500 --> 29:12.980
It's ridiculous how much time this is taking but we're in a really good spot. It's really paying off

29:12.980 --> 29:18.580
We've got obviously the shirt going on right now teespring.com slash Linux it hit its goal

29:18.580 --> 29:24.520
And I think there's still five days left to get a black and white or a red more blue and white or whatever

29:24.520 --> 29:26.460
It's it's so sharp

29:26.460 --> 29:28.180
Linux action show hoodie

29:28.180 --> 29:33.300
T-shirt ladies T kids T teespring.com slash Linux the funds raised there are helping our Linux fest

29:33.820 --> 29:39.900
Northwest efforts and standing at right now. I believe mr. Q 5 sis his ticket has been purchased

29:39.900 --> 29:44.540
I think rotten corpse you're close. Are you rotten are you in here? No, no

29:46.980 --> 29:51.300
Chris Moore is locked in Alan Jude is locked in

29:51.820 --> 29:54.420
I think Michael Dominic is locked in now

29:54.420 --> 29:57.780
I haven't gotten the confirmation, but I talked to him on Monday. It sounds like he's locked in

29:57.900 --> 30:01.100
So we're gonna have a lot of people out

30:02.100 --> 30:08.280
Is there are we missing anybody? I don't think I don't think we're missing anybody. I think we're gonna have everybody there of course

30:08.280 --> 30:13.320
Yes, yes. Well. Yeah, of course I didn't mention us because we're in Washington, but of course exactly yeah for us

30:13.320 --> 30:16.300
It's like a drive right no isn't no it's gonna be there as well Matt's gonna be there

30:16.300 --> 30:21.140
I'm gonna be there Chase is gonna be there all of us local guys will be there and Noah's gonna fly in so

30:21.500 --> 30:25.020
It's gonna be all of us in one place for the first time ever

30:26.040 --> 30:30.820
Which is really awesome. That's really cool, and so we're gonna get some great local recordings

30:30.820 --> 30:33.160
We're gonna do some interviews at the Linux fest guys have

30:33.160 --> 30:39.040
Volunteered a dedicated room for us to do interviews in so we can get some good evergreen content for a lot of our shows

30:39.640 --> 30:43.680
In-person interviews we're gonna try to do in-person shows as much as we can and of course

30:43.720 --> 30:47.140
We're gonna have a lot going on Friday and Saturday nights

30:47.140 --> 30:52.000
We're gonna we're gonna just go down and hang out with the Linux fest after-party Saturday night

30:52.000 --> 30:56.320
It's so if you'd like to hang out with the crew and just in a more relaxed setting that's definitely the place to do it

30:56.560 --> 30:58.720
Or come to the fest and say hi to us

30:58.720 --> 31:04.140
And we're gonna have two days of streaming if you can't make it at jblive.tv, and it's April 25th and 26th

31:04.640 --> 31:08.960
You can probably tell I'm pretty excited. It's gonna be really cool, and it's taking a lot of work, but

31:09.880 --> 31:12.440
We're gonna have it's if you can make it

31:12.440 --> 31:16.640
It's totally gonna be worth coming and see us because we're gonna have the best stuff to give away at all the booths

31:17.960 --> 31:20.640
Well everyone that shows up always has a really great time

31:20.640 --> 31:23.520
I mean, it's you know well except for that you that one year

31:23.520 --> 31:26.800
I mean that was that's a different situation, but yeah, I mean for the most part

31:26.800 --> 31:30.240
It's been really really cool, and it's always neat to see the people and kind of assign them

31:30.240 --> 31:31.920
You know it's like oh, yeah, I know your chat room handle

31:31.920 --> 31:36.840
oh, yeah, well yeah, it's like our royal Gabe, and I just had a great exchange this morning about about email and

31:37.360 --> 31:40.480
Now when he comes to Linux fest Northwest he can give me a hard time in person

31:40.480 --> 31:44.400
And I'll be able to immediately remember the whole exchange and we'll have a nice laugh, and I'll feel like a jerk

31:48.960 --> 31:54.720
Linux fest Northwest org if you want to pre-register and but the hotels are filling up and stuff like that. Oh, yeah

31:54.720 --> 31:56.240
I'm super excited

31:56.240 --> 32:01.640
Yeah, and Odyssey Westra Odyssey. I hope you could make it too. I mean I know it's a bit of a drive for you

32:01.640 --> 32:06.360
But you can I think he is at least that was what I heard last time. I heard from him

32:06.360 --> 32:09.080
I think soft to check wimpy. It'd be really great if you go

32:09.080 --> 32:13.440
I know it's impossible, but it'd be really great if you'd make it transport technology would solve this issue

32:13.440 --> 32:17.600
Yeah, I I was looking into it to be honest. I really did want to

32:18.120 --> 32:20.920
Find a way yeah, yeah, it's just crazy. It's I know

32:20.920 --> 32:26.460
All right, what we need is like one of those telepresence robots that you could just like a Skype into

32:29.800 --> 32:35.600
All right, it's a gypsy robot yeah, there you go. Yeah, gypsy into exactly yeah, well, I would assume it would run Linux so

32:36.240 --> 32:38.960
Yeah, all right. Well, that's probably enough about Linux fest Northwest

32:38.960 --> 32:42.080
I'm just crazy excited about it, and we'll have clips and stuff in the shows

32:42.080 --> 32:49.680
But we we got to solve a few problems for me. I got I tell you what Matt. I have I have reached the point

32:49.680 --> 32:51.680
Where it is time to replace?

32:52.200 --> 32:56.480
Maybe introduce the most important Linux computer of my lifetime

32:57.600 --> 33:02.600
But before we get to that I got a thank-ting, and I really mean I've got to thank ting ting

33:02.600 --> 33:06.160
Thank you. Thank you for saving me so much money over the last two years

33:06.160 --> 33:13.400
Thank you for challenging the duopoly of the mobile industry and ting. Thank you. Thank you so much for actually having

33:14.520 --> 33:18.280
The will to fight that fight because I I tell you it wears on me

33:18.280 --> 33:22.080
It does wear on me and ting the reason they make a difference is

33:22.400 --> 33:28.200
They're challenging sort of the status quo, and they're just by doing it in just the most direct and honest way possible

33:28.200 --> 33:35.080
It's no contracts. No early termination fees for ting service. They're out there a mobile service that truly makes sense

33:35.080 --> 33:41.320
They have CDMA and GSM coverage available, so definitely check out their coverage map. There's just a flat rate for your phone

33:41.320 --> 33:43.000
It's six dollars a month for the phone line

33:43.000 --> 33:43.800
And then you just buy your phone

33:43.800 --> 33:48.680
And you just put it on the account so the phones are unlocked because you own the phone outright you just put it on

33:48.680 --> 33:53.160
The ting service six dollars a month, and then it's just your usage on top of that

33:53.160 --> 33:59.960
It is as basically as bare and raw just like you own the whole process if you want or you can work hand-in-hand with their

33:59.960 --> 34:04.440
No-hold customer service, and that's what I like about it is you know I've got the Nexus 5

34:04.440 --> 34:09.080
I just put lollipop 5.1 on there. I put the ting GSM sim in there. I'm doing this all on my own

34:09.080 --> 34:13.040
I'm not talking to anybody because they have an incredible website that walks me through all of their services

34:13.040 --> 34:15.560
It walks me through all of this stuff, and now I have

34:16.520 --> 34:18.520
unbelievable speeds unbelievable I

34:20.400 --> 34:28.160
Chases house a hundred and six megabits a second download on the GSM service a hundred and six megabits on the GSM service

34:29.480 --> 34:31.800
Unbelievable speeds, I don't even know how like I I

34:32.800 --> 34:36.760
Mean I'm gonna have to retest it. It's so incredible because like at my house. I'm getting like 25 megabits

34:36.760 --> 34:42.480
I'm then I'm like that's great. I'm getting 25 megabits. Yeah, buddy, but it chases like what so anyways

34:42.480 --> 34:46.160
I've had incredible performance even like in the spots where I've had low performance. It's

34:46.760 --> 34:53.400
It's been improved. It is really great regardless of what my speeds are I am super thrilled because I'm only paying for what I use

34:53.400 --> 34:55.400
And things dashboard lets me manage all of that

34:55.600 --> 35:00.440
And I actually have used our Android app to send me a push alert if I go over like two gigs which that's just so

35:00.440 --> 35:04.520
I know and you can really kind of play around with it and see kind of what you would pay by going over to

35:04.680 --> 35:09.640
Linux.ting.com that'll take $25 off your first device click on their savings calculator

35:09.640 --> 35:14.920
plug your current usage information in there and see how much you would save over like a two-year contract period and

35:15.120 --> 35:20.780
Then keep in mind to the ting has early termination relief programs to help you get out of a contract if you're in one now

35:20.780 --> 35:23.360
As these devices become more and more important to me

35:23.360 --> 35:28.040
And I have more and more things that I do with my head device so like with my Nexus 5 for example

35:28.040 --> 35:33.800
It does sort of personal things for me. It tracks my sleep including like recording my noises. I make at night. Hello

35:34.160 --> 35:37.400
It talks to my car right and it tracks everywhere

35:37.400 --> 35:42.120
I drive using automatic and if then then that and logs that to spreadsheets

35:42.480 --> 35:49.360
It has become a very personal computer device to me that has things on it that nothing else holds and to me

35:49.720 --> 35:52.900
As I think more about how the technology I ref I use

35:53.120 --> 35:58.080
Reflects on me as a person just like that article Dan Gilmour wrote and why he switched to Linux from Windows

35:58.960 --> 36:00.700
Ting plays a role in that for me, too

36:00.700 --> 36:04.600
And that's why I say thank you to ting go to linux.ting.com take

36:04.600 --> 36:10.320
$25 off your first ting device or go get a ting sim card to give you a $25 service credit that will probably pay for

36:10.400 --> 36:16.060
More than your first month and now when you're on ting you can do CDMA or GSM and think about the flexibility that gives you

36:16.060 --> 36:20.520
And don't forget every ting plan includes hotspot and tethering that could be really wicked

36:20.880 --> 36:26.520
Or you can just get a GSM sim and pop it in like an old tablet or a security device during the pre-show

36:26.520 --> 36:32.720
I got somebody told me you know I just had a I had a Nexus 7 tablet that I wasn't using the GSM sim

36:32.720 --> 36:37.000
And so I've got a ting one for $9 and now when I use the data. I have it linux.ting.com

36:38.120 --> 36:40.120
big thanks to ting

36:40.640 --> 36:46.360
You know you think back to the early days of cellular and how you were just excited if you actually got coverage in your area

36:46.360 --> 36:50.040
And then you think about what you do with your smartphone through ting nowadays

36:50.040 --> 36:56.560
I mean and you hold that in like a comparison. It's just mind-blowing yeah. Yeah, it really is it's it's a new era

36:56.560 --> 36:59.160
I mean, it is really not to make it sound old, but it

36:59.160 --> 37:01.160
Is

37:03.920 --> 37:08.320
Speaking of the early days. I think it used to be easier to buy a computer for kids than it is today

37:08.320 --> 37:16.040
Oh, yeah, I was looking around and I don't okay, so I my son Dylan his birthday is coming up

37:16.040 --> 37:20.480
it's a 20 days away as from when we record this episode of Linux unplugged and

37:21.800 --> 37:24.120
Here's here's what I'm doing right man

37:24.120 --> 37:29.660
I'm I'm shucking and jiving because the conversation comes up Dylan's got an iPad and his iPads kind of old

37:30.280 --> 37:31.800
right

37:31.800 --> 37:33.120
Okay

37:33.120 --> 37:37.760
So that seems pretty it's like okay. That's a matter of fact. There's no debating. I know Angela suggests

37:38.880 --> 37:41.920
Maybe we want to buy a new iPad for him

37:43.240 --> 37:44.940
I think yes, well

37:44.940 --> 37:50.180
Maybe I would like to buy a new iPad and I think I could I be okay with buying another iPad for my son

37:50.180 --> 37:52.600
I think to myself right yeah, I can I can I can do that

37:52.600 --> 37:56.200
You can start like that I don't need to and I thought about it some more and I thought about some more and I thought

37:56.200 --> 37:58.960
No, I'm I'm actually not really okay with that

37:58.960 --> 38:02.680
I mean, I don't have any judgments out there if you want to buy one. That's fine me personally

38:02.680 --> 38:04.680
I just I didn't want to do that plus

38:05.000 --> 38:11.500
Plus my son has been enjoying using an actual computer more than the tablet these days including playing Minecraft on the computer

38:11.680 --> 38:13.860
So I thought I said to myself I said self

38:15.000 --> 38:20.480
This is your opportunity to strike. This is the moment. This is where you leap in the iPads got to be replaced

38:20.480 --> 38:25.200
I get him on Linux. He wants to use a desktop machine. He's got a dedicated minecraft rig

38:25.960 --> 38:31.200
But it's all about the execution. It's got to be the price point. It's got to be durable and preferably portable

38:32.440 --> 38:39.120
Okay portability so thing okay, okay, so this is this is where I and and and to be honest with you

38:39.120 --> 38:43.520
I would like it to be preloaded with Linux so that way I'm supporting the Linux vendor

38:44.200 --> 38:46.360
Right right these are my requirements now

38:46.360 --> 38:50.400
I've looked at a lot of rigs. There's a lot of ways

38:50.400 --> 38:54.600
I could go base requirements is I think I'd like it to be able to play minecraft

38:54.600 --> 38:58.280
So let's just say an Intel HD 5000 or better. Don't you think?

38:59.360 --> 39:02.480
Yeah, you definitely want to be future-proof and that's you know

39:02.480 --> 39:07.440
That's we're actually reasonably spec'd for not just future-proofing but again for minecraft and things of that

39:07.440 --> 39:12.520
I don't think these requirements are too far out for probably a lot of dads and moms that are kind of like you know

39:12.520 --> 39:15.640
What my kid could use a computer and I could see this six is maybe a little young

39:15.640 --> 39:17.080
But I could see ranges, you know

39:17.080 --> 39:22.840
I could see a wide range that of ages this would apply to so I just but I don't know where to begin

39:24.320 --> 39:29.440
Boy, you know, I what do you think Matt? What what you had, you know, you're taking care of your nephew for a while

39:29.440 --> 39:31.840
What was he using right? Well, so we yeah

39:31.840 --> 39:36.320
We actually used to we actually used an old laptop that I had it was a I had it installed

39:36.320 --> 39:42.680
I think it was running one of the arch variants and I basically set it up to where first of all open DNS all day long

39:42.680 --> 39:44.280
Especially as they get older

39:44.280 --> 39:49.520
Because your parental controls all the other like software solutions regardless of platform or crap

39:49.840 --> 39:53.360
I'm a big big firm believer of open DNS because it actually works

39:53.400 --> 39:56.000
So you do that at the router level as far as the computer itself?

39:56.120 --> 40:01.200
He didn't really do much in the way of gaming on that particular rig outside of emulation

40:01.200 --> 40:05.960
He did some emulator games was perfectly happy with it plugged a controller and it was pretty straightforward

40:05.960 --> 40:08.640
He actually was figuring stuff out pretty quickly on his own

40:09.080 --> 40:12.480
And never used to Linux previous to that and actually now prefers it. Hmm

40:12.480 --> 40:16.400
So, you know as far as going forward with what your needs are though

40:16.400 --> 40:21.240
I think you're really wanting to definitely think long as far as future-proofing

40:21.240 --> 40:26.360
So I definitely don't want to buy one in for a few years. Yeah, right. So you really want to future-proof that out

40:26.360 --> 40:30.400
Yeah, I'd like portables. I'd like something maybe you could bring to the studio with him

40:30.920 --> 40:32.920
But it doesn't have to be

40:33.200 --> 40:36.760
And also what what level of gaming would he be doing on that too?

40:36.760 --> 40:41.320
Like what you know, are you okay with something that's integrated even as you know, the technology continues to progress

40:41.320 --> 40:45.120
You know, I'm thinking gaming is not a huge. I'm thinking minecraft and stuff. I don't really

40:46.440 --> 40:50.980
I look at something that would be for a first user's experience

40:50.980 --> 40:53.680
I want something that like it's gonna be really easy to reload if he messes it up

40:53.960 --> 40:56.420
So that way, you know that the reload process is quick

40:57.380 --> 41:01.860
Yeah, I don't know I wouldn't be I noticed you mentioned maybe to get two computers. Is that what you said?

41:02.640 --> 41:04.640
Yeah

41:05.960 --> 41:08.280
My other comment was his don't get a tablet

41:08.280 --> 41:15.200
And the reason I think that is because I think if you give a child a tablet they become

41:16.200 --> 41:18.200
consumers of

41:18.400 --> 41:26.140
Content and games. Yeah, and that's what they're limited to they're never going to challenge themselves to be producers of anything

41:26.360 --> 41:30.720
So I think if you want to use this as an educational tool, it has to be a computer

41:31.080 --> 41:37.280
Right, I agree and I think that you know, if you want a proper computer, you know

41:37.280 --> 41:40.400
A laptop of some sort then that's fine

41:40.400 --> 41:46.160
You know a computer that you can sit down at and get stuff done and maybe in a couple of years is

41:46.680 --> 41:52.160
Suitable for playing some games on that's also good because kids do want to play games on their stuff

41:52.480 --> 41:57.720
but the second computer that you absolutely should get is a Raspberry Pi 2 and

41:58.160 --> 42:02.920
get a couple of micro SD cards set them both up and

42:03.420 --> 42:06.160
keep one spare so when he

42:06.160 --> 42:10.260
Experiments and screws it up. You can just swap in the

42:11.000 --> 42:16.040
Second SD card and he can be up and running again. That is that is the nice prepare the second one

42:16.040 --> 42:19.480
that's and a Raspberry Pi 2 in a case is

42:20.920 --> 42:22.020
Mobile, you know

42:22.020 --> 42:28.320
He can just take that to wherever he needs to go and he can plug it into keyboards mice and monitors

42:28.320 --> 42:33.560
Where wherever he goes and he can run Minecraft on it Colonel Linux you have a different take

42:33.560 --> 42:37.280
Hmm. Yeah. Well, my thought is if your son is anything like my son

42:37.280 --> 42:40.960
He's going to some degree to some degree expect it to work out of the box, right?

42:40.960 --> 42:48.000
And so I feel I completely agree with where wimpy is coming from and I hope I can only pray that my kid when he gets

42:48.000 --> 42:51.700
Older wants to actually play with the internals of the computer

42:51.700 --> 42:58.120
But at the moment he's not really interested in doing that. He's just interested in in in accomplishing a task

42:58.120 --> 42:59.980
He wants to go to YouTube. He wants to watch his videos

42:59.980 --> 43:05.840
He wants to play his games and I would be somewhat I would be somewhat afraid that right the Raspberry Pi

43:06.120 --> 43:10.360
Didn't provide the experience. He was looking for he would not only write off the Raspberry Pi, but he would write off Linux

43:10.360 --> 43:16.320
So that was my thought to my thought was the first computer is this is a computer that's fun

43:16.320 --> 43:19.120
You can do it like there's nothing weird about this computer

43:19.120 --> 43:24.560
Just just use it like a normal computer make using Linux the norm nothing different about it

43:24.560 --> 43:28.400
And then as he starts to experiment, I love the idea of swapping in pies

43:28.400 --> 43:33.680
As sort of like the the computer where if something goes wrong, it's just an SD card swap away

43:34.320 --> 43:40.920
And also if you've got the first computer, which is a Linux computer and it's a you know

43:40.920 --> 43:44.360
A proper desktop computer that can be used

43:44.360 --> 43:49.880
He can teach himself how he makes his SD card images and how he downloads the different

43:50.000 --> 43:54.720
You know versions that are available for the Raspberry Pi to experiment with you know

43:54.720 --> 43:59.040
This is why you want two SD cards. So the Raspberry Pi is there for

43:59.840 --> 44:03.680
experimentation and learning and you know if if he gets really

44:05.520 --> 44:10.400
Interested and he totally fries it then. Okay, you're down $35 and you buy another one

44:10.400 --> 44:15.960
Yeah, you know that that's that's what they're they're really good for do and it's how I'm it's how I'm doing things at home

44:15.960 --> 44:22.400
The Raspberry Pi for you know, poking prodding putting fingers in sticky sweets all that sort of thing and

44:22.400 --> 44:27.400
Proper computers for you know showing how to do, you know more

44:28.160 --> 44:30.160
compute orientated things

44:30.440 --> 44:32.440
Colton you had a question you want to bounce off me

44:33.680 --> 44:35.680
Yeah, I think one thing that's

44:36.520 --> 44:42.420
That in my it would be important for me at least if I was going into a situation like this is what?

44:42.680 --> 44:45.000
You know, how much am I really willing to spend?

44:45.880 --> 44:49.020
Yes. Yes, right. That is a big component. Thank you

44:49.020 --> 44:53.080
I can't believe that really has been brought up until this point because it is a huge component. It's not a lot

44:53.080 --> 44:59.080
You know, I mean we the original budget was like maybe a Nexus 9 kind of area was kind of what we were thinking. So

44:59.760 --> 45:04.440
Right, so you're going from there then, you know, how much like like, you know

45:04.960 --> 45:10.640
If you want to go with a laptop then then are you gonna be able to find a laptop?

45:10.680 --> 45:16.120
That's in that price range. It's gonna do enough to you know, keep them busy. Right?

45:16.120 --> 45:19.240
Yeah, a coffee you had a point to make a

45:21.400 --> 45:25.440
Caught a cote a cottage. Yeah, I I just think that uh, I

45:29.360 --> 45:30.800
Just think that

45:30.800 --> 45:35.600
You know, what do you look at costs? I mean it's cheaper to go with the desktop and

45:36.480 --> 45:40.560
You know later on you can actually build out from that by like

45:40.920 --> 45:45.960
Allowing them to open up at the desktop and just kind of see what parts what yeah

45:45.960 --> 45:51.080
I think I mean, that's how I started when I was a kid. Yeah. Yeah, it is funny

45:51.080 --> 45:55.000
I'll open it up and play around I'm surprised though. I mean like what how come nobody's really recommended the NUC

45:55.560 --> 46:02.180
Seems like or the meerkat from from system 76. It seems like a decent rig. All right, I'll tell you there is one machine

46:02.180 --> 46:06.020
I'm holding all my I'm not I haven't put all my cards on the table. I do have one machine in mind

46:06.080 --> 46:08.040
This is not a plug

46:08.040 --> 46:10.880
But I did notice that system 76

46:10.880 --> 46:16.080
4 days ago on their Google Plus page. So they have a Lemure 14-inch coming in early April

46:17.080 --> 46:21.520
I'm not like super stoked about the resolution 1366 by 768, but then again

46:22.320 --> 46:26.560
He's not gonna care and if it's Intel six, yeah Intel graphics, you know

46:26.560 --> 46:28.560
That might be better for Intel graphics to be honest with you

46:29.200 --> 46:34.080
And it's so it's it's a lot like the ultra Pro the galagal ultra Pro but bigger

46:34.080 --> 46:39.560
So here's the other 14.1 inch screen, so I and this starts at $599 so this might be the way to go

46:40.320 --> 46:44.720
Well, and here's the other component is oh now you going back to your iPad. I'm gonna wager

46:44.720 --> 46:51.240
You've got Otterbox like protection around. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What's your what's your protection plan for a laptop?

46:51.240 --> 46:55.040
They don't make Otterboxes of those that I know of it. I yeah responsibility

46:55.760 --> 46:57.400
Yeah, and that's it's a big one

46:57.400 --> 47:00.160
I mean like my nephew who now he's 18 now

47:00.160 --> 47:04.360
But when he was 17, it's like that laptop was I mean, yeah, I was used but it's like you break it you bought it

47:04.360 --> 47:06.360
That's it. You know, there's no

47:07.320 --> 47:08.320
Yeah

47:08.320 --> 47:10.920
It's very true. If I do end up getting this Lemure though

47:10.920 --> 47:12.440
I'll do a review for it on last as well

47:12.440 --> 47:17.240
But I think you know, I don't know that so I was kind of leaning towards NUC or a laptop because a NUC

47:17.240 --> 47:19.240
I could also just pick up and bring to the studio

47:20.240 --> 47:23.480
Yeah, the bonobo would just be too heavy for him. You know, that's the nice thing about this

47:23.480 --> 47:25.480
Yes, it's half the weight of the bonobo

47:25.480 --> 47:29.200
Well, and I guess you get him a proper like a good laptop bag

47:29.200 --> 47:32.920
I mean, you know real nice and padded and all that that's got good reinforce reinforcement there

47:32.920 --> 47:35.120
I mean, he'd probably be fine with that before I pull the trigger

47:35.120 --> 47:39.680
I'd like to hear the audience if from the audience if any of you picked up like any of these more recent Chromebooks and had a

47:39.680 --> 47:43.160
Just the Chromebook seems like a bad way to go because it's so easy to wipe them

47:43.160 --> 47:49.640
But I would I would like to hear the audience's route. I'm leaning towards the system 76 a

47:50.200 --> 47:52.200
Because I'd like to hear the audience's route

47:52.200 --> 47:56.400
I'm leaning towards the system 76 a because I'd like if I'm gonna spend the money

47:56.400 --> 47:58.560
I'd like it to go towards the Linux ecosystem B

47:58.560 --> 48:04.240
I don't want to have to ever hassle with it when I reload and see I like system 76

48:04.760 --> 48:09.120
Yeah, yeah, they have the meerkat too. But so I don't think it'll be I don't know if it'll be shipping in time

48:09.240 --> 48:11.640
It's gonna be tight because this doesn't ship until

48:13.440 --> 48:18.200
Like April something so it's really and his birth his birthday is like on the 14th

48:18.200 --> 48:21.000
So it's really gonna be a tight if I give I can pull it off

48:21.000 --> 48:22.880
but

48:22.880 --> 48:25.520
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, it might yeah

48:26.040 --> 48:30.240
Yeah, Colonel Linux you you wanted to point out the packing it around something that a dad has to factor

48:30.520 --> 48:35.240
Well, no, I've just yeah, it's so you're going to the studio. He's coming with dad. You're gonna get some work done

48:35.240 --> 48:38.240
Can you imagine when he's like dad? Can I bring my computer and you're like no problem, son

48:38.240 --> 48:43.240
Let me disassemble the LCD and the computer and grab a keyboard and a mouse and put it all into it

48:43.240 --> 48:45.640
No, just get the Lamar that makes more sense

48:45.640 --> 48:49.760
I actually know he held it. Yeah, he really

48:50.360 --> 48:55.360
By the time you're done putting a solid state in that in that bad in that bad guy and you're buying him

48:55.360 --> 49:00.360
You know decent keyboard and mouse and you buy the LCD you're probably into it for close to what the Lamar would be anyway

49:00.360 --> 49:05.600
Yeah, I'll put you I'll put pledge a couple bucks towards getting Linux or getting Dylan off the apple juice

49:06.200 --> 49:08.200
Yeah, I think having a solid

49:08.720 --> 49:10.720
solid solid

49:10.840 --> 49:14.680
Laptop that actually runs correctly the first time would be right

49:14.680 --> 49:16.000
Yeah

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Yeah, I think it's pronounced lemur

49:18.640 --> 49:24.720
Name Earth lemur. Yeah rotten corpse tells me that somebody from Kansas Linux fest joined us towards the end of the show here

49:24.960 --> 49:26.600
Is that true?

49:26.600 --> 49:32.480
Yep, that's me. Well, hey Ryan. Hey Ryan, you know what? I'd love to talk to you. Why don't we do that here?

49:32.480 --> 49:35.200
Why don't I take a I'll take a quick break and then we'll chat a little bit

49:35.360 --> 49:38.360
So I'll let you guys know what I decided to do with Dylan's laptop

49:38.960 --> 49:44.640
and then I'll give you a kind of a review of whatever I end up getting and how the whole deployment goes and

49:44.640 --> 49:48.720
His reaction to I mean he's played with Linux before on I've had it on a Chromebook for him for a little bit

49:48.720 --> 49:50.280
But it always ends up going the wrong way out

49:50.280 --> 49:52.520
I also had it on an old HP laptop, but it keeps dying

49:52.640 --> 49:57.560
So every time every machine I've given him Linux on it's kind of been a little bit of a rocky ride

49:57.560 --> 50:01.400
And I don't think he's blamed Linux, but it's because dad keeps giving it on hardware

50:01.400 --> 50:05.600
That's like my secondary hand-me-downs and right and so the end-all experiences

50:05.600 --> 50:09.560
it's to him these computers are things that work for a few days until the hardware craps out on them and

50:10.320 --> 50:13.280
So this next time around it's like for his birthday and it's like, okay

50:13.280 --> 50:17.920
Let's get him on his own computer and we'll see what happens. So I'll update you guys in the future

50:18.400 --> 50:23.040
Well, I think if you also have it pre-loaded with all his favorite stuff, you know, minecraft set up and ready to go

50:23.040 --> 50:27.400
I mean it because it's a birthday experience. I think that adds to the wow. This is awesome. Dad. Yeah

50:27.400 --> 50:28.320
Yeah, yeah

50:28.320 --> 50:32.200
The mirror cat the mirror cat comes out on the 26th that might be a route to go to but see then I have to do

50:32.200 --> 50:34.200
All the disconnecting and reconnecting every time

50:35.480 --> 50:39.440
Unless there was like a perfect but not travel case he could bring now go laptop. Yeah, I think so

50:39.440 --> 50:43.200
Hey Matt before we talk a little bit about Kansas Linux Fest, which I'm excited to hear about this new Linux Fest

50:43.200 --> 50:48.880
First year they did it. Let's mention Linux Academy. This would be this will be like Dylan's like 8th birthday present, right?

50:48.880 --> 50:53.360
I'll get him like a like a year of Linux Academy and then then he'll really be off to the races

50:53.400 --> 50:55.280
But you don't have to wait you can start right now

50:55.280 --> 51:00.240
We're going to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged get our special 33 percent discount

51:00.320 --> 51:02.720
Linux Academy is a great resource for our audience

51:02.720 --> 51:08.360
perfect for you guys built by Linux and open source enthusiasts and educators developers and system administrators and

51:08.400 --> 51:12.420
Linux Academy has a whole bunch of courseware and they're constantly improving that courseware

51:12.420 --> 51:16.340
Retroactively and also adding new courseware. It's a really nice system

51:16.340 --> 51:19.260
So when something brand new comes out in the Linux sphere that you need to learn about, you know

51:19.260 --> 51:21.940
Linux Academy is on top of it. I've since they've been a sponsor

51:21.940 --> 51:26.380
I've really watched them jump on top of great new technologies and not just like have courseware on it

51:26.380 --> 51:29.620
But truly deep understanding course with it when you're done

51:29.620 --> 51:34.260
You're really gonna walk away feeling knowledgeable about it because they have real world scenario labs

51:34.260 --> 51:37.820
They have virtual machines that spin up you choose from seven plus Linux distributions

51:37.820 --> 51:40.800
You go through the course where you actually work with the actual technology

51:40.800 --> 51:43.460
You just SSH in from your desktop and start working on the rig

51:43.460 --> 51:49.020
It's really a nice experience. And if you use like, you know SSH with a little compression or something like that

51:49.020 --> 51:53.700
It's really fast. It's I mean we all know that right but they know that so they would they make it

51:53.700 --> 51:57.140
So that way their lab server spin up give you a public IP a login to him you set up the stuff

51:57.140 --> 51:59.140
It's really cool

51:59.180 --> 52:02.460
And I think one of the things that you know, I've struggled with when I was an IT

52:02.460 --> 52:04.460
It's not really an issue for me anymore

52:04.500 --> 52:09.500
But there are sometimes like branches of technology that all of a sudden you just find yourself falling back into

52:09.500 --> 52:11.500
Oh now all of a sudden I have to support

52:11.620 --> 52:16.500
Something that connects to Amazon s3 or something that uses Amazon simple DNS or simple mailing service

52:16.500 --> 52:20.940
I have no idea how to do that. Well Linux Academy's got your back you get access to all of the coursework

52:20.940 --> 52:22.860
So if all of a sudden you find yourself having to worry about that

52:22.860 --> 52:25.980
They got you covered or if you want to make sure your resume just looks a little bit better

52:26.020 --> 52:30.220
They got you covered. In fact, I've been getting notes from Anthony over there about some of the amazing things

52:30.220 --> 52:34.600
They have coming up like on April 16th. They're gonna have a big content release and you can watch it live 9 p.m

52:34.600 --> 52:36.240
Central April 16th, that's really cool

52:36.240 --> 52:41.300
but they've also from CompTIA been approved for quality content requirements meaning that you can go take the

52:41.940 --> 52:47.660
LPIC1 and Linux plus exams after you've taken the courseware Linux Academy and get your certification and you're done. You're done

52:48.220 --> 52:51.780
By going to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged you get started right now

52:51.780 --> 52:58.020
They've got courseware on Python Ruby Android development back up like using our sync. I mean the whole spectrum

52:58.020 --> 53:00.860
It's everything and when you get to choose from seven plus Linux distributions

53:00.860 --> 53:03.700
You get to download the content offline and listen like a podcast

53:03.700 --> 53:09.340
You can learn on the go and be productive while you're doing stuff. It's just a great solution for the people that have time constraints

53:09.340 --> 53:11.700
or free time Linux Academy comm slash

53:12.460 --> 53:14.460
Unplugged go check it out

53:15.020 --> 53:20.700
All right. Well Orion. Thanks for joining us sort of last minute. I suppose and

53:21.900 --> 53:25.100
Tell it tell me about like what you did at Kansas Linux Fest and how it was

53:26.220 --> 53:31.500
Okay. Well, I was one of the original two organizers for Kansas Linux Fest great and

53:31.500 --> 53:38.180
We spent kind of the whole year planning it. I've been living in Kansas for two years

53:38.180 --> 53:43.260
I got a job as a Linux systems administrator over here and I want to thank you

53:43.260 --> 53:45.260
I'm actually kind of nervous talking to you because

53:45.820 --> 53:49.660
I was really getting into Linux and then I found your show

53:50.260 --> 53:54.300
Really has been with me my entire journey, you know

53:54.300 --> 54:02.620
of going from being somebody who knew very little about Linux and open-source software to being a big advocate now and

54:02.660 --> 54:09.140
Putting together events like Kansas Linux Fest. Well, what what made you crazy enough to try to do a Linux fest?

54:09.140 --> 54:11.140
I mean that's pretty ambitious

54:11.500 --> 54:17.540
well, actually I was just it came from I was pissed actually because I

54:18.060 --> 54:20.060
got into town and

54:20.100 --> 54:22.900
in I live in Lawrence, Kansas, which

54:22.900 --> 54:24.620
is

54:24.620 --> 54:27.580
at home to the University of Kansas and

54:29.460 --> 54:31.100
There was no

54:31.100 --> 54:34.180
Active Linux user group in town and that drove me crazy

54:34.300 --> 54:40.980
I could find like six web pages of old Linux user groups that had died out, but I I was like

54:40.980 --> 54:41.820
Where am I gonna go?

54:41.820 --> 54:47.060
I'm this geeky guy and I want to talk to geeky people who love open source

54:47.060 --> 54:50.220
And so I decided to just start my own Linux user group

54:50.220 --> 54:57.060
about the same time I met this guy Mike DuPont and he is brilliant and he was

54:57.660 --> 54:59.180
actually putting

54:59.180 --> 55:00.860
Open Kansas

55:00.860 --> 55:06.940
It's open Kansas dot us. Yeah, it's a group that is in Kansas. It's promoting open knowledge

55:07.660 --> 55:09.660
open source software

55:09.700 --> 55:11.700
and and Linux and

55:12.060 --> 55:15.700
He said hey, I've been thinking about putting together an open source conference

55:15.700 --> 55:20.460
And you know you're head of the Linux Lawrence Linux user group. Do you want to help me out?

55:20.460 --> 55:22.460
And I was like, yes, of course I do

55:23.300 --> 55:30.860
The funny thing was we really only expected about three people to show up 20 20 you say

55:31.340 --> 55:35.020
30 or 30 to 30 we expect that many people we thought yeah

55:35.020 --> 55:41.540
We'd have our speakers and then maybe an additional 10 or 20 people we ended up we counted it up after the event

55:41.540 --> 55:43.540
We ended up getting around 200 people

55:43.540 --> 55:48.820
So we really that really shattered our expectations. That's great

55:49.940 --> 55:54.780
Yeah, not to mention we we had Rackspace who came on as a sponsor

55:55.540 --> 56:00.740
We had we had many local places Cal testing they do end-of-year

56:02.260 --> 56:05.820
Assessment software for like student testing for a whole bunch of states

56:06.740 --> 56:09.780
We had I don't want to leave anybody out

56:09.780 --> 56:14.820
But I know I'm going to we had our local one of our local ISPs. We had

56:15.700 --> 56:20.100
Unfortunately, we some people kind of didn't get on board until it was too late

56:20.660 --> 56:23.780
So we didn't really have time to put things together with them

56:25.060 --> 56:29.540
fortunately Linux Pro magazine came on and they they provided a whole bunch of

56:30.420 --> 56:33.100
their magazines for free cool and

56:35.340 --> 56:37.340
Actually, it's funny because

56:37.340 --> 56:41.900
You talked about Linux Academy and they're actually based out of Lee's summit

56:41.900 --> 56:47.700
Which is right next to Kansas City and we're right on that east side of Kansas where the fest was at

56:47.700 --> 56:49.580
And so we asked them to come

56:49.580 --> 56:54.340
Unfortunately, I didn't realize they were that close until a couple weeks before the event

56:54.340 --> 56:58.900
So they said no, we're not gonna make it this year, but we'll we'll be there next year cool

56:58.940 --> 57:00.940
So I'm gonna try and hold them to that

57:02.100 --> 57:04.420
but we had a lot of

57:04.420 --> 57:11.900
Interest from people like Ricky Endsley if you guys know about her she's from Lawrence and she's actually part of what inspired me

57:11.900 --> 57:18.300
to start the Linux Lawrence Linux user group here in Kansas because I went to Linux con 2013

57:18.940 --> 57:20.940
which was in New Orleans and

57:22.220 --> 57:28.940
While I was down there I ran into her as well as three other people from Lawrence and I'd never met them before I said

57:28.940 --> 57:32.140
Why did it take us coming down to New Orleans to meet and?

57:32.140 --> 57:35.580
And network like this. I said we need to do something back home

57:35.580 --> 57:41.580
And and so that's where that's where this effort came from. So and you're crazy enough to do it again next year. It sounds like

57:42.540 --> 57:47.100
Absolutely. I actually I'm so glad that you said that because you our biggest sponsor

57:47.740 --> 57:55.980
Was individuals walking in the door. We made over two thousand dollars from individual sponsors coming in and making donations

57:55.980 --> 57:57.340
That's great

57:57.340 --> 58:02.860
And I think you know, I like to watch these things because I've noticed these the even this actually some of the the events

58:02.860 --> 58:06.540
You know when there are a couple of hundred people are really really perfect

58:06.540 --> 58:12.380
That's a sweet spot where the crowd's small enough that everybody's really nice to each other because they keep bumping into each other and you

58:12.380 --> 58:14.380
know, you actually start conversations and

58:14.860 --> 58:18.460
Some actual things can happen in in communities. It's really neat

58:19.260 --> 58:25.100
The and the energy level I just want to say the energy level was so high and the engagement was so

58:25.100 --> 58:30.860
So high and the engagement was so high. I've never seen that I've been quite a few open source

58:31.420 --> 58:38.860
That's at this point. Yeah. Yeah, and we had big speakers, you know, we had the one of the guys over at twitter's open source

58:40.700 --> 58:44.380
I don't remember exactly what it is or open source outreach group or whatever

58:44.860 --> 58:49.900
And we had a guy from oracle come in and give and give a talk about you know

58:49.980 --> 58:52.220
kind of what they're doing in open source and

58:52.220 --> 58:57.180
Uh, we just had so many awesome speakers and i'd if you guys can you know

58:57.260 --> 58:59.900
I I tried to put as much as I could on my blog

59:00.620 --> 59:03.180
Which I posted in the chat and i'll post it again

59:03.660 --> 59:08.700
Uh it but and maybe we can get it in the show notes if you put putting that in

59:09.020 --> 59:10.700
I tried to put as

59:10.700 --> 59:16.460
Awesome. Well, I tried to put as much as I could in there about who was there and and what we did

59:16.460 --> 59:22.460
And it was just it was just super awesome. And it's really it's really great because it's building

59:23.100 --> 59:26.220
Communities on top of the community that we that we built there

59:26.540 --> 59:31.980
Uh, there were the wichita, which is a pretty big city here in in kansas

59:32.140 --> 59:37.260
There were there was a guy who stood up at the beginning and he said i'm so happy you put this together. I'm the

59:37.820 --> 59:40.620
president of our linux user group down in wichita

59:40.620 --> 59:45.820
Wichita and he said, you know, and he kind of went through his whole spiel about what they were doing

59:45.900 --> 59:50.460
And then another guy stood up and he said i'm president of a linux user group down in wichita, too

59:50.540 --> 59:52.860
And I had no idea. There was another one in town

59:52.940 --> 59:55.420
We need to get together and do some stuff

59:55.500 --> 59:59.820
And so it was a lot of interactions like that that really I think

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:06.380
Built the community and we had an after party where unfortunately I got really really drunk. So I don't remember all of it

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.460
but the

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:14.140
But there was a point when uh, one guy was telling me he says i've been living in a bubble

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:19.580
He's like I didn't know there were all these people around me. Yep, who were interested in the same thing

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:19.900
Yeah

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:24.620
And you discover that when you show up and you like you or like around here if you go to meetup.com

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:26.620
You discover that's the same thing. Uh

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.420
Ryan a coffee has a

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.580
Has a coffee has a question for you. Go ahead

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.660
uh akati

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:38.700
Akotai akatis. Yeah, I was just wondering what was your cost of entry this year?

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:45.260
Oh boy, um, well a lot of it came out of pocket and I really want to thank mike

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.860
He's such a phenomenal guy. I think he spent over a thousand dollars just out of pocket costs

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.340
Of he might have meant entry to the fest

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:56.140
Oh, there was no one no no cost of entry

01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.380
You didn't have to sign up you could just so we could keep track of who was who was there?

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:04.300
But uh, that's actually why don't we don't have firm numbers. Um, right, right

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:10.620
Yeah, you we we we didn't want to prevent anybody from coming just because they didn't sign up or they didn't have the money

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.780
And so we we told everybody come in we're completely open

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:21.980
um, and and so there was no cost of entry only if you wanted to donate and and if you donated we had

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:28.700
Some swag to give you you know, just for a little bit of love and giving back and so

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.820
Uh, but yeah, just going back to that, you know, definitely want to thank mike. He put so much, you know

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.420
He was my other organizer

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:39.580
Yeah, we tried to pull as many people in but I don't think many people took us seriously

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:42.700
Until like a week before the conference started. Yeah

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:48.460
And then people started we had we had all sorts of companies reaching out to us at that point

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.700
And we had a couple of speakers saying like I want a part of it and at that point it was really hard to get

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.140
Yeah, anybody else fit in but yeah, i'm hoping that

01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:02.060
Because we've had so many people reach out to us that next year we'll be able to incorporate more speakers and more

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.700
Sponsors and and I would say, you know as it gets like, you know, you as you get to them

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.780
I would definitely go to that next year. Yeah

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:11.180
Yeah, let's let people know if you get to the month or two point out

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.220
You know, we can start helping spread the words people can make plans to attend

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:20.940
Well awesome and uh chris, uh, we'd love to fly you down and have you be a part of the event. Oh, okay

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:25.340
Okay, sure, uh, wow, maybe you never know i'm not joking. You never know. This is a good time

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.940
You never know. Maybe kansas city is growing. Yeah, maybe I will

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:34.780
Fibers down there just have to uh hit me up a little while beforehand next next year and uh,

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.580
You just never know because I do want to turn more

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.620
Can I can I plug a couple things real quick? Yeah, sure

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.740
So that all right

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:47.260
So for those of you who feel like you're in a bubble out in the middle of the midwest and missouri kansas or nebraska

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.740
Um, feel free to check out kansas

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:52.560
uh kansaslinuxfest.us or openkansas.us

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.060
Or just reach out to me, uh

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.180
Uh, and i'll put i'll try to give my information to chris

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.780
um or follow me on twitter ryanleecypes and just

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:09.180
I try to post as much as I can about what's going on in the midwest as far as linux open source is concerned

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:13.660
And i'd love to help anybody who feels like they're they're a lonely geek

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:18.460
Find a community here in the midwest to be a part of and contribute to that's great

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:25.500
Yeah, and if you feel like I know that feeling and uh, it's not true. There are others out there. You can find them

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.220
You're not alone. You're not alone. Yeah

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:33.260
All right, very good. So I think we'll wrap it there. I had a discussion piece around so good to know

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.980
I feel so much better now. I had a discussion piece around distribution coverage

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.580
But you know, I can bump that to a future episode because I liked getting some coverage there

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:45.420
The kansas linux fest. I just love these linux fest. There's so much fun

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:51.180
So also i'd like to point out that I contribute to evolve os and it hasn't gotten some play on here really that much

01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.260
Yet chris, you're right. You're right. If you could

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.500
I can hook you up with all the developers and and we can talk about all right

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.300
You know what?

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:03.020
We should we should probably get an evolve os dev on the show here and talk to him and see what's up because you're right

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:07.740
It is something we have not given a lot of time to which was the topic of our discussion piece

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.740
Uh, and that's a little teaser I guess, you know

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:13.020
I'll try to remember to put it in next week's episode because it's you know

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.700
We're getting boy. I don't know if we want to start another 20 minute conversation at this point in the show matt

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.540
You know what? I mean like I feel like we should probably save it for next week

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:24.300
But it might be worthwhile I guess maybe i'll here i'll tease the topic

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.220
And then maybe you can join us next week and oh this we should do this more often actually now

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.300
I think about it. I should why don't I always do this?

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.940
Uh, okay, so because I don't always know what the topic's gonna be. That's why yeah, I know my I know that

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:39.900
Uh, I want to talk next week about the amount of coverage. We've given to certain distributions, uh,

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:45.840
specifically arch and fedora and ubuntu in comparison to other distributions like evolve os

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.680
mandriva

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.960
mint and open susa and uh part of it is because my sense and uh

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:59.120
The production staff sense and matt's sense of where the interest lies in the audience part of that is our own internal

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.720
Interest and part of that is the relevance that we saw those distributions to have

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:08.720
All of those factor into what we cover, but I think it's always worth reevaluating that because things change over time

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:12.080
And uh, that would be a discussion i'd like to have next week

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.160
Um not to do too much navel gazing

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:20.240
But really to kind of say what what are things that are truly distinguishing about these distributions that deserve our attention

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.040
What should we be focusing on and are we focusing too much on the wrong thing?

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:28.400
Uh, so that's a conversation i'd like to have with our lug next week an episode 86 of linux unplugged

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.160
So, uh join us we do the show live over at jblive.tv on tuesdays

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.640
at specific time 2 p.m

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.120
But if you go to jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar, you can get that converted to your local time zone. We've got robots

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.840
And the only thing they do is patiently wait

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.600
To convert that but I pay them in freaking bitcoin by the hour

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.640
So go over to jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar. You can add to your own calendar

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.240
Also send us your feedback go over to jupiter broadcasting.com slash contact and then you might not have known about this

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.400
But we have a sub reddit

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.960
Who knew right linuxactionshow.reddit.com makes this show better submit topic ideas

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:06.240
There's feedback threads and usually unplug doesn't get much love because you guys are apparently just not very

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.600
Very talkative about linux unplugged in there, but there is well actually last week

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.480
We got it quite a bit

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:13.600
But there is a discussion thread in there for every episode of linux unplugged

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.360
And uh also stories and apps and all kinds of stuff that get linked there make their way into this show and linux unplugged

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.720
Love for life. That's right. That's right. Uh, so thanks everybody for being here. Thanks to the mumble room matt

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:31.200
Have yourself a great week. I saw that there's a new episode of married and amused out which yeah

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.880
After a bit of a hiatus, we're back

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.760
Uh, basically we had a look forward to that a little bit of a home illness kind of thing going on there for a while

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.920
But we're back and it happened. Yeah, it happens and it looks like a good game looked funny, too

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.920
I I watched a little bit of the intro and it had me laughing

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.360
Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Yeah, uh, and anywhere you want to send folks throughout the week

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.880
Uh as always, um, if you want to just kind of keep up in general

01:06:52.880 --> 01:07:00.400
Uh articles to video games to whatnot, uh, matthartley.com subscribe in any one of the uh options available email to social media

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.120
That's just put all in one spot. That's a great idea. Yeah. All right, everybody

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:23.280
Well, thanks for tuning this week's episode of linux unplugged. See you right back here next tuesday

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.120
So

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.360
Yeah, that's true it's better than married and abused that would not be a good show yeah, that's a that's a private show

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.480
That's usually when it's i'm in the doghouse and I did something stupid married and abused

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.560
All right, well that was a fun show thanks you guys

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.720
Uh, we uh, we had a light turn out during the pre-show and then it really filled out during the show, which is awesome

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.120
And ryan, thanks for uh, making it in here at the end. We gave a little we had a little chat about uh,

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.880
Kansas linux fest towards the top and I think I got your blog post already in the show notes

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.000
Oh, that's awesome. That's awesome. I'm, sorry. I missed it

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.120
I'm i'm actually at work and I thought man. I really need to get in here and plug kansas linux fest

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:20.960
You did good. He's forgotten about it. Good work. It was good work. You jumped on it. It was nice

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.280
Uh, yeah. All right, jbtitles.com. Let's boat this sucker. Let's boat it up boat boat a boat a boat it up

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.480
So yeah, have you guys noticed that uh, since the day?

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:37.940
It was announced that bq may have uh gpl compliance issues poppy hasn't showed up. Hmm coincidence

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.480
I think not. I think um poppy's recording another show this evening. I'm sorry

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.460
It's all right. I I tease I tease but come on wimpy. It's a much better conspiracy

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.880
Yeah, it's yeah, we gotta keep up our blame so we can

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.320
Yeah, you know what we ought to do is we ought to live stream, you know

01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:01.120
We should do we should live stream the show he's doing right now. So that way we could uh boost their audience for them

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.840
Here's my question. Can I ask a question?

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.320
This is for ubuntu people who might be listening to this

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.640
where is

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.320
My phone for north america. That's what I want to know. I know i'll buy one

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.080
I just I just need you guys to you know, get that get that to me

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.600
Yeah, I think i'm getting I would totally say the same thing. I think i'm getting an s6

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.280
I mean, I might get the mules or whatever it is when it comes out, but I think i'm getting the s6

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.360
Well, I want that myzu phone the mx. Yeah. Yeah myzu. That's what it is. Yeah

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.720
But it doesn't have the uh, I guess it doesn't have the bands for the us. So what do you guys so, uh,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.800
So there's there's several different suggestions these days to uh, sort of get the entire last catalog online

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:47.360
The uh tried and true one would be archive.org. Of course their sync thing is also uh possible. Um,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.420
And uh also get annex could be a possibility

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.780
So, uh, do you guys have any thoughts of like a way to do a massive online archive?

01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:01.780
Well, I have one idea although it's a little retro you get yourself these red envelopes yeah, I know and then you mail out these cd's

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:07.540
Charge i'll just put them on disk and i'll just you can do it on subscription 50 bucks for it. Yeah, that's a good idea

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:15.780
um, I have uh something that sort of plays into the education thing my my school district is

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:17.920
like

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:19.120
extremely

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.700
anti

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.700
Unix, especially lately

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.420
Like like they want nothing to do with anything. That's not windows like a few years ago

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:32.980
All of the school websites were like powered by wordpress on apache servers

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.580
and

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:41.220
On like linux apache servers and now they're all running on iis servers and they're all static web pages

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.620
Which is terrible in the first place. I have no idea why they're doing that

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.540
but and then and then like also the

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:51.700
um

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.380
Like we had we have like several hundred max

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:03.780
That used to be like like, you know, just like a couple months ago. They were all running like mavericks or whatever and

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:08.660
Then the school district just just decided that they didn't want it to be running mavericks anymore

01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:12.260
So they blew all of them away and installed windows 7 on them

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:18.420
Um, nice. Oh, isn't that? Oh, I hope they're using group policy and active directory. Oh, I hope they are

01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.900
and the other thing is

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:21.860
none of the

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:27.480
They the group policy they have set up does not like it doesn't force them to install updates

01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:30.180
And none of the teachers bother doing it

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:36.900
So every computer in our school is still vulnerable to that exploit that was talked about on on coder radio

01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:43.780
Oh good a few months ago. That's fantastic. So before everybody runs off. I kind of wanted to talk about that and just elaborate

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.780
but i'll make it really brief the

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:50.580
The place that changes guys is is not so much with the teacher itself

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.460
But with the the staff, you know

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:59.300
The tech staff of like the school or or even at the board the school board here in lawrence

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:03.460
You know, we had to go we tried to go through the board of education or not the board of education

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:10.100
But the school board uh to try and get you know some linux machines into school and get open document

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:12.260
You know formats being used

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:17.620
And I work for the library system here at the at the regional level

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.000
And you know when we want to get something into a library

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.460
A lot of it comes down to convincing

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:29.140
You know the other tech guys and then ultimately also showing how it saves money and how it you know

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.180
Is is a better solution and it can be done, but it has to be done from that point of view

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:38.420
Because you're trying to convince people who are like, why can't we just stick with what we have?

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:40.420
No

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:45.220
the thing is though I totally get that it's it it it is more with the

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.340
administration that that has to change because like my my uh, my

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.620
Teacher like the teacher in my school that does all the computer stuff

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:59.140
Uh, he actually instructed me to install ubuntu on one computer

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.380
Just because he wanted to mess with it and try it out

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:08.820
The first time that someone like a higher up from the it department came in the room and noticed ubuntu running on that computer

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:15.300
They they got like super pissy and they were like, you know, that computer should be running windows 7 and

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:21.460
Like the computer was cold and that's the thing the computer was too old to actually run windows 7

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:28.900
All it could run was windows xp. And so I had installed ubuntu on it and and the the it administrator did not like that

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.340
Oh boy, colton you you change the network one funeral at a time

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:51.140
That's that's true
