1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
So let me tell you about the, uh, before we just start, uh, actually maybe I'll save it

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,240
for the show.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
I'll save it for the show.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,240
That could be how we start the show.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:27,080
Alright guys, this is Linux Unplugged episode 239 for March 6th, 2018.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's all over the world this week.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
My name is Chris.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
My name is Wes.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Hello, Wes.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,080
I miss, I miss being in the same studio with you.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,760
You know, I don't, I don't get to watch you, you know, stare at you as you talk in the,

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
I mean, what?

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,920
No, that definitely doesn't happen.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,920
We'll be reunited soon, but it's amazing that this isn't working at all and I'm very glad

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
to be here.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Yeah, yeah, it is.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,960
And we've got a great show.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,780
So we've got a couple of interesting things that I want to chew on today, like some big

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,960
picture stuff.

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,000
It does involve Microsoft and other companies and maybe what your company is doing wrong

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,160
in open source and how some of these other companies have figured it out, companies that

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
used to battle it.

23
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,860
Plus, we've got some interesting project updates, some weird things happening with Java Enterprise

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,060
and some Ubuntu news, some other things, as well as a few anecdotes from the road, Wes.

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,240
So I think it's going to be like a fun one.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,560
It's like the pre-scale storm now.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
Yeah, road check, road trip check in.

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,800
You know what's great about this is, so this setup right now that we're doing, I'm connected

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,280
to you through a microphone, a USB interface, and a box running Chrome.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,880
That's so lean.

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,280
It was going to be my XPS 13, but I ended up actually, I'm on the, you remember the

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,980
old MacBook that you set up running Arch?

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,980
How could I forget?

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,800
We've had such a tender relationship.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,040
Yep, yep.

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,840
So I've got that in here and so I have that running Chrome and connected to a MiFi and

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,840
that's how we talk now.

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Well, you sound great.

39
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
This is incredible.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,680
It's amazing what we can do in this modern day, and we haven't even turned this thing

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,480
up to 11 because we have remote controls into the studio so that way I can do things like

42
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
bring in the Mumble Room.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,320
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
What's up?

45
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Hello.

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Hey, hey.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Woo.

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
That was amazing.

49
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
That was good.

50
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Good job, Mumble Room.

51
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
That was really good.

52
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Yeah.

53
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
You guys are on point.

54
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,600
You know, Wes, I'm kind of missing out right now.

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,840
Levi and Hadir are out exploring Sacramento as I record.

56
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
That sounds way better.

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Yeah.

58
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
Maybe I'll just jump out of the studio, go join them and good luck on your own, Chris.

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,080
They're like, well, see you later.

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
I'm like, what?

61
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
And we're going to go explore the capital.

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,120
She got an Uber and they're out walking around Sacramento while I'm inside the RV and it

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,520
is surrounded by wasps.

64
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,560
Down in California, apparently there's bees already and they're like crawling all over

65
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,840
my mirrors trying to get in while I do this show.

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,840
That's my situation.

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Oh, okay.

68
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Wow.

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
Yikes.

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,360
I have no choice but to just sit here hunkered down and podcast.

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
So that's what we'll be doing.

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,040
Well, at least you have us to join you in your suffering.

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,980
So we're going to start with a couple of big meta topics that I think might come up later

74
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,260
on in the show.

75
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,160
First one doesn't really have anything to do with Linux other than, well, we're going

76
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,320
to get to it in a roundabout way.

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:19,780
Jeff Bezos has spent $42 million building a clock that will run for 10,000 years.

78
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,120
This is part of the Long Now Foundation.

79
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,800
It was created in 1996 in the hopes to provide a counterpoint to today's accelerating culture

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,560
and help make long-term thinking more common.

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,400
One of its initiatives is the Clock of the Long Now, which is designed to run for 10

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,200
millennia without any need for human intervention.

83
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,680
And Bezos took interest in it six years ago and has invested $42 million.

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,280
Think about trying to build a system that could last 10 millennia without any human

85
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
intervention.

86
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
You can do that with Linux, right?

87
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
You can do that, Wes?

88
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Come on.

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,120
I mean, I certainly wouldn't try to do it with Windows.

90
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,440
I suppose not.

91
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,080
The heart of the clock is a titanium pendulum that beats once every 10 seconds.

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Now the falling weight that powers the clock can be wound by hand, but it is otherwise

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,680
kept wound by solar power.

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,880
It shines into an aperture in the 500-foot deep chamber in which the clock sits.

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, that's great.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,400
It then strikes the air-filled cylinder.

97
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,040
The expansion of the cylinder provides enough energy to lift the falling weight slightly

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,480
and also provide some correction for solar noon timing.

99
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,240
And one key feature of the clock, and this is kind of weird if you think about it, the

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,480
displays are not active until a human enters the clock chamber and fully winds the mechanism.

101
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Interesting.

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,600
So it's still keeping time, but it doesn't display time until there's a human there to

103
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
observe it.

104
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,360
But yet it's built to last 10 millennia without humans, but if there's no human there to observe

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,680
it, it never displays the time.

106
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,840
Just sits there in silence, displaying nothing, keeping time.

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
That's so weird.

108
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,640
That is so weird.

109
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,560
And he spent $42 million on this.

110
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
What do you think?

111
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,720
10 millennia, 42 million, you think that like dollars per millennia is a pretty good deal

112
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
for this or no?

113
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Well, actually.

114
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,320
I mean, it kind of does seem like it's a decent deal, doesn't it?

115
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,600
I got to be honest with you, Wes.

116
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
It does actually seem pretty legit.

117
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,280
Also, I imagine the people designing this have had a lot of fun.

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,400
It seems like a great project, just in that it's weird and kind of interesting.

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,080
So it's neat that the, you know, crazy rich can fund one-off projects like this.

120
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,000
Now I know that this isn't going to appeal to you, but some of you out there are on Windows.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,200
Now don't deny it.

122
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,200
I know it's true.

123
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,000
I've seen the download numbers.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,640
A good number of you are on Windows, and it just may be getting a little bit easier to

125
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
run Ubuntu.

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,160
We talked about this on Linux Action News, and now with only three mouse clicks, once

127
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,040
this is completed, you'll be able to get an Ubuntu VM that offers full clipboard integration,

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,680
drive redirection, and enhanced display performance.

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,720
Right there, three clicks in the Hyper-V Gallery, boom, Ubuntu 18.04, ready to go.

130
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,040
You know, some of the really cool stuff that they've done, and I don't know a lot about

131
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:24,400
this, but they've worked with the open source XRDP project to bake in communication to Hyper-V's

132
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,080
communication bus, which there's already like a socket that's been upstream to the Linux

133
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,800
kernel to enable this communication.

134
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,900
So it goes from the kernel socket to the Hyper-V socket, and they talk, well, XRDP to transmit

135
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,000
the graphics, and it makes it a really fast interface and really low latency for the remote

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
graphics of the VM, which are not actually remote, depending on how you're using it.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Anyways, when you combine it with drive integration, clipboard integration, and XRDP integration

138
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,120
over this HVhook or HVsock system, this is going to be a pretty compelling step up from

139
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
the Windows subsystem for Linux on a Windows 10 machine.

140
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,520
You know, you're sitting there, you're hacking away on something under the subsystem, ah,

141
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
screw this.

142
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
What's left?

143
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,480
Well, now three clicks and you have this really hyper-integrated Ubuntu VM.

144
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,400
What do you think about this, Wes?

145
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,720
Is this the death knell for a virtual box on Windows?

146
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh, yeah.

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,200
Yeah, you know, I was going like, what does this mean for people switching from Windows

148
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,440
to Linux?

149
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,640
My brain's been racing with that.

150
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,200
I hadn't thought about the competitors.

151
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,720
This is like home turf advantage.

152
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,160
I also know a lot of people who haven't yet been able, for enterprise policy reasons or

153
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,260
otherwise been really able to work the subsystem into their workflow, but are already using

154
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
virtual machines.

155
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,720
So it seems like this rolling out when it does will have an immediate impact there as

156
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
well.

157
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,700
I can also imagine developing, you know, as you're saying in the subsystem, but then still

158
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,520
having a fleet of, you know, development servers running locally in these VMs and be able to

159
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
test there.

160
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,000
I almost don't need a Linux laptop, and that's a little scary.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I mean, there's two ways to look at it.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, that is scary.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're right.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Because it is, it could potentially mean less Linux switchers.

166
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,220
That's definitely a possibility, but there's another way to look at it.

167
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,560
It's possible that now more people will be using Linux.

168
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah, the barrier to entry now is a lot lower.

169
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,240
They get hooked on the good sauce, right?

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,760
And they're like, why am I running this in a virtual machine?

171
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
First taste.

172
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Yeah, yeah.

173
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,240
Yeah, once they get the first taste for free, right, and then they'll go out and buy.

174
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
How insidious.

175
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Yeah, no.

176
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,920
Also, speaking of this kind of stuff, oh, does somebody else have something they want

177
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
to add from?

178
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,960
By the way, I think they just added Debian and Kali Linux support in the Windows Store

179
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
as well.

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,280
Yeah, that's what I was just going to mention is Kali Linux is in there now as part of the

181
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,480
subsystem, I guess.

182
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,680
Or is this part of the Hyper-V stuff?

183
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
I don't really know.

184
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
It's a subsystem.

185
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Hmm.

186
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
And it doesn't have the hacking tools.

187
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,960
Like, you have to install that separately.

188
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,800
So I mean, I'm sure it's pretty easy to do that.

189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:14,840
Yeah, well, this is what Kali Linux is one of those tools that, you know, Windows administrators

190
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,800
still end up using because it's just a really good tool to test yourself.

191
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,400
And it has everything and often it often comes with a lot of things pre-configured, perhaps

192
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
not in this case.

193
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,480
Yeah, but if it has scripts to set that stuff up, that's probably legit.

194
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Yeah, I could be legit.

195
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I don't know.

196
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm not super jazzed up, but yeah, yeah, we're all kind of like, man, man, it's good to see

197
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
it.

198
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
And it means more users for Kali.

199
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,240
But they probably might just run it in one of those fancy new VMs anyway.

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,280
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

201
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
You could.

202
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
You could.

203
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,240
If that XRDP stuff goes upstream, which Microsoft did submit it upstream, and the HV hook stuff

204
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,860
is already upstream and it's integrated into kernel 4.15, then any distro could really

205
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,180
take advantage of that.

206
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,360
So yeah, you're right.

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,960
That would probably be a great way to use Kali because then you would have the full

208
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Kali.

209
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm just trying to think if there's any network stuff that wouldn't work because of the virtualized

210
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
card because that could be a possibility.

211
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,080
You would have to configure that depending on what you're trying to do.

212
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
That's for sure.

213
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Yeah.

214
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Yeah.

215
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
I don't know, Wes.

216
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,960
You know what the only way to find out would be for you to get a Windows 10 machine and

217
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
test it.

218
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
I guess you have to.

219
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
You're right.

220
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Oh.

221
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,800
You know, I want to take a moment and thank Ting.

222
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,520
Why don't we do that right here?

223
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,640
Go to linux.ting.com.

224
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,880
I was really, really impressed yesterday when I sat down, I compared all the different carriers

225
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,960
that I had with me and the Ting CDMA was the fastest, but more importantly, the lowest

226
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
latency.

227
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,760
And sure enough, sure enough, here I am now in Sacramento, same thing.

228
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,840
I would have sworn it would have been the GSM network.

229
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,880
That's what I love about Ting is they have both and I just turn these devices on when

230
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,720
I'm traveling because it's $6 for the line.

231
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,200
And so honestly, if you have a backup line or a data device you need to use occasionally

232
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,800
or a phone that you can just be kind of savvy about using Wi-Fi, well then $6 a month.

233
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
That's nothing.

234
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
That's nothing.

235
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,460
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get started and you get $25 off a device or if you bring

236
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,560
one that's compatible, just check their BYOD page, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

237
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,680
Now your average Ting bill is going to be around $23 all in, probably before Uncle Sam's

238
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
cut.

239
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,120
$23 for your minutes, your messages and your megabytes and the $6 for the line.

240
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,000
So a $25 credit will probably pay for more than your first month because that's how Ting

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
rolls.

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Linux.ting.com.

243
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,360
Go there and then check out their blog post about comparing their Wi-Fi, I mean their

244
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,700
internet connection with Wi-Fi.

245
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,200
So their LTE with Wi-Fi and the differences there.

246
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,640
I was super impressed.

247
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,920
I was just talking to Wes on the pre-show, I pulled up, I was getting 22 down, even got

248
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,600
as high as 28 up and I was getting, yeah, I know, it was just nuts.

249
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,240
Those are some numbers.

250
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,520
But the thing was that really rocked is I was getting around 18, 20, 15 millisecond

251
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,960
ping time to the different servers.

252
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,160
And right now where I'm at, I'm getting around 30 milliseconds, which is still really, really

253
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
outrageously great.

254
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,240
That puts it in that territory where you start thinking about differently, right?

255
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,400
It's not just this shaky Wi-Fi connection, it's a real first class internet connection.

256
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,080
We can use it for broadcast, which is great.

257
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,360
In fact, I'm thinking about when we get to the next story, I'm tempted to try turning

258
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,120
up the broadcast quality another notch because I haven't turned down right now because I'm

259
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,120
also remote team viewer into machines in the studio.

260
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,520
I'm thinking about just pushing Ting to the limit and turning it up another notch.

261
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,200
I don't even know what the software would do, but damn if it isn't tempting.

262
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
So you know what?

263
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm going to do it.

264
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Go to linux.ting.com.

265
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
One way this is going to work or another.

266
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
So I would imagine this is going to disconnect Wes and then reconnect.

267
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Okay, we'll hang tight here.

268
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,920
Finish up, you tell people to go to linux.ting.com and then we can go over to the Ubuntu story,

269
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
but I'm going to hit the button.

270
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm going to go up another notch.

271
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,920
I don't know, in three, two, Ting save me.

272
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
See we can't do it without Ting.

273
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
That's it.

274
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Oh really?

275
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Was that it?

276
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
That's it.

277
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Wow.

278
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
It did it.

279
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Wait.

280
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Oh, I bet you I have to refresh.

281
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
I bet you it hasn't kicked in yet until I refresh.

282
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,160
I'm still tempted to try it, Wes.

283
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I know.

284
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
All right.

285
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I'm going to hit refresh.

286
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
You ready?

287
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
Okay.

288
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Wish me luck.

289
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Here I go.

290
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Good luck.

291
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Oh, okay.

292
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Well, there we go.

293
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,560
Now we know it was real.

294
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,640
It's all possible with Ting.

295
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,600
Head on over to linux.ting.com so you can be as impressed and satisfied.

296
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,320
And now we're happy to welcome Mr. Chris Fisher back to the Linux Unplugged program.

297
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
That's awesome.

298
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
That is great.

299
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
That was a lot of fun.

300
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Oh, that was great.

301
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,840
That's like living on the edge.

302
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Talk about adrenaline rush.

303
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,680
Real time doing it live.

304
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,280
Now we're up a whole other notch.

305
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
We're at 128 kilobits now.

306
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
So I don't know.

307
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,080
Are we going to start talking about the big exciting news that will probably happen just

308
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,560
a little bit after this show?

309
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Jump right in.

310
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Okay.

311
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,280
So I may just take a back seat and actually let Simon jump here in a moment, but as we

312
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:01,240
record this, if things go as planned, going by the schedule here on the Ubuntu Wiki, we

313
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:08,600
should see beta 1 for 1804, if not tomorrow, probably the day after or somewhere around

314
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,960
there, March 8th.

315
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,520
And then the Optin flavors as well.

316
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,480
But right before the show started, Simon started telling us about this and I said, wait, wait,

317
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
save it for the show.

318
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,640
So Simon, pick back up where you left off.

319
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,940
What's sort of the story that you had to share with the 1804 beta release?

320
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,200
So with the 1804 beta, we just, this is something that we are sort of working on today, actually.

321
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,520
And I've been working with Dustin Krysek, who's also here.

322
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,240
We were just sort of gauging interest because for the first two alphas of this release,

323
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,320
it ended up being bad timing because we had the Spectre and Meltdown stuff that went on.

324
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,040
So they disabled all the Launchpad builders, so we couldn't build anything.

325
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,020
And then after that beta or alpha 2, we also had some other difficulties in it.

326
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,320
This is the first 1804 milestone.

327
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,460
So you're going to see a couple of different things that you would usually see in like

328
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,800
a daily build.

329
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,360
Like just today, for example, we landed a new point release for Qt.

330
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,200
That's something that I was working on specifically, otherwise the flavors that I know of participating

331
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,480
right now in this are Lubuntu, where it's just general bug fix.

332
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,720
Lubuntu Next is also participating in this release, which Lubuntu Next is going to see

333
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,040
a huge overhaul of things with different applications coming in and different theming and that sort

334
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,080
of thing.

335
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,520
Then there's Ubuntu Budgie, Zubuntu is participating, all different sorts of flavors.

336
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:45,000
But this is really a sort of a community release because the Ubuntu desktop, they don't participate

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,260
in any milestone besides the final beta.

338
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,160
So this is a really good time, I think in my opinion, to go and see what's going on

339
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,280
in each of the flavors because this is really the first milestone of the 1804 release.

340
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,720
So it's really, like I said, it's a really good way to see what people have been working

341
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,280
on thus far.

342
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,640
Yeah, and I am tempted to do it.

343
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,320
It's funny, 1804 is sort of like 1710, although not quite as strong because it's not the switch

344
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
to know.

345
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,360
But I have a lot of people in my circle of friends and family that I take care of their

346
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,720
computers and they're all kind of due now.

347
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,800
Some of them weren't on 1604, like Dylan, he's on, I think he's on Loki Elementary OS

348
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,800
and Hadia, I think is on the last LTS, before 1604, I can't remember, but she's due for

349
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,940
two of her machines to get replaced.

350
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,600
And my dad has a system, I don't even know if he's using it anymore that I got to contact

351
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
him about.

352
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,440
1804 is going to be one that I think a lot of people in my circle are going to end up

353
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,640
using that I maintain their computers for.

354
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,160
People have been waiting, letting things bake.

355
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Yeah, you're right.

356
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,240
It will be kind of how 16 felt like a similar moment in some ways, it will get wide deployment

357
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,320
and suddenly everyone will be on the latest Ubuntu.

358
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,240
Including probably Westpain, huh?

359
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
Are you sticking with the plasma?

360
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Including me.

361
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
What's going on?

362
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Oh.

363
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Including JJ too.

364
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Yeah.

365
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
What's the plasma status?

366
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,040
I so far have stuck with it.

367
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,640
Yes, I have been sticking with it as well.

368
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,880
It's been really smooth.

369
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,920
I think I got enough configuration down.

370
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,240
I know a little bit more about how to tweak the things that I actually care about where

371
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,040
I think I could replicate that pretty quickly on a new install.

372
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,320
I'm actually thinking about paving and doing that just to make sure that I'm right there.

373
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,640
And with that down, I feel a lot more comfortable with it.

374
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,560
Before it was just that, you know, GNOME had defaults that I really liked and worked really

375
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,560
well for me.

376
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,000
Now that I have that on KDE, it's great.

377
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:54,760
I think the thing that's helped me set up the Neon workstation was I did all KDE Neon,

378
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
so it's all the same distro.

379
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,760
It wasn't a mix this time of Ubuntu and Arch, which is what I've done in the past a lot.

380
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
That could be more complicated.

381
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,660
And I also just sat down once, and the first time I launched Dolphin, I went through and

382
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,580
changed all of the defaults I don't like.

383
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,880
The first time I logged in, I changed all of the desktop environment settings that I

384
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
don't like.

385
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,240
And so I just, each time, just said, OK, there's going to be a slight tax each time.

386
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,640
But then once I've done it once, they stay.

387
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,680
I've gone now for weeks, and I haven't had settings revert, windows reopen where I want

388
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
them.

389
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,360
The console stays the same size I had it last time.

390
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
I know.

391
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,280
It's so simple, but it's so nice.

392
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,400
And you know, you're sitting down there using AirMaster, and you haven't had to reboot it

393
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
before.

394
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,760
You could use it like we were having with Unity 7, which means none of the...

395
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,800
So when you do have to reboot it, say, for an update or something, it's better at remembering

396
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,120
the display output options into the OBS capture.

397
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,080
That is such a tiny thing, but it's like killer for our use case.

398
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Yeah.

399
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Yeah, it really is.

400
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
It's one of those nice little things.

401
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,120
So hashtag Rodden was right.

402
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,040
It's a great professional desktop.

403
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,640
And I think if a company came along, even a company like, oh man, I really shouldn't

404
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
go down this rabbit hole.

405
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:18,600
But a company like System76, you know what would make Pop OS 10 times more compelling?

406
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,280
Is if they were doing something that wasn't Gnome.

407
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,460
Because really what people could do is, right?

408
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,520
You could just go get their theme on Gnome, on stock Ubuntu and call it good, and then

409
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,880
you're close to mainline, you're close to what you're running in production, and you

410
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,700
still have their design aesthetics.

411
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,700
But if they were taking their design aesthetics and applying it to the Plasma desktop and

412
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,440
really just sort of getting down those rough edges, man, that would be, I would be a really,

413
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,740
really compelling distro.

414
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,040
And it'd really stand out, you know, be something that's different.

415
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,240
Yeah, you know, there's not a lot of that shipping, and there might be a lot of value

416
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,440
add they could have in just having it really well configured from the start.

417
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,000
Now what do you think, Simon, we don't give enough love to Kubuntu?

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,080
Yeah, I think it's going to have a nice release because no, the 1604 really, really wasn't

419
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,640
that good of a release for Kubuntu.

420
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,880
The 1804 is going to be interesting because it's going to be the latest LTS Plasma on

421
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,440
top of the latest LTS cubes, and it's going to be baked in with the LTS Ubuntu.

422
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:28,400
So while you do have KDE Neon, with them sunsetting the user edition, or the LTS edition, it might

423
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,800
be a good opportunity if you want to try Kubuntu, if you want a really rock-solid, stable KDE

424
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Plasma experience.

425
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:42,280
Are we calling it sunsetting, is that what we're calling it, of the LTS edition, because

426
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
it's still there.

427
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
It's still there.

428
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,640
No, it's gone.

429
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,640
It's going away.

430
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Okay.

431
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
So it's sunsetting.

432
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,840
It's not able to download, but it's going away.

433
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,720
It's just like right now you can still use it, and the repos are still there, but they're

434
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,920
focusing away from the LTS version of Neon because there's really no reason for it to

435
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,200
be there, because the majority of the time they put their effort into the regular user,

436
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,880
and that was kind of like the original point of Neon in the first place.

437
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,240
They just kind of made the LTS version because it made sense at the time, but now with Kubuntu

438
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,600
providing an LTS solution on an LTS base with a solid LTS release of Plasma, there's really

439
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
no need for it.

440
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Yeah, okay.

441
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I can see that.

442
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,480
I don't think Kubuntu is going to have a lot of interesting updates for the release of

443
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,040
1804, because I'm participating in making those updates.

444
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,640
Oh, can you get any teases, any hints of what we should look for?

445
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,760
Well, I mean, if you just boot the Kubuntu 1804, you will notice a change immediately

446
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,680
with the theming much different.

447
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,560
So one of the things that I did not like about Plasma, like there's a few things

448
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,640
that Plasma doesn't do good by default.

449
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,960
I'm trying to fix those, and Kubuntu are very receptive to those, so that's really awesome.

450
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,400
One of the biggest things that I've convinced them to change is that the default breeze

451
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:18,640
theme is super bright, and it's kind of awkward for the panels and widgets and menus and stuff.

452
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,480
So they've switched it so that you have the dark theme breeze for the panels, the menus,

453
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,320
and the widgets with a bright theme for the windows.

454
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,680
So it's like a hybrid approach.

455
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Okay, nice.

456
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Well, good on you.

457
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,320
I like that sound, Ron, because I got to tell you, yeah, I got to tell you guys, I have

458
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,560
light sensitivity in my eyes, and that's why I wear glasses.

459
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:45,600
So one of the reasons why, other than my stigmatism, and I got to tell you, light themes just hurt

460
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
the heck out of my eyes.

461
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,440
So this is a good notice for me, as well as another thing I wanted to mention was Xfce

462
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:01,280
and especially Xubuntu, I've been waiting like hell for good Xfce high DPI support.

463
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:10,720
So I'm thinking of until that happens to have Kubuntu installed and have this with my MacBook,

464
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,640
because I got to tell you, I hate that Xfce doesn't have good high DPI support right now.

465
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
And that's a ways out.

467
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,680
So I'm thinking of switching to Kubuntu for this, man.

468
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,680
That's a ways out.

469
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,040
Switching to Kubuntu, because I know that they have decent high DPI support, so I'm

470
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,800
thinking of going to Kubuntu instead.

471
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,360
Well, I'll tell you this, Ben, is if you try it out, you're not going to go back.

472
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
That's what's going to happen.

473
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
You won't go back once you try it.

474
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,680
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of doing is downloading Kubuntu 18.04 and just chucking

475
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
that on there instead.

476
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
You're going to like it.

478
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah, that's my plan.

479
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Yeah.

480
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,240
People tweeted last week or the week before and said, hey, how come you guys didn't talk

481
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
about the plasma update?

482
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,720
It's just sort of now we're there.

483
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,280
We're using it and we're not switching.

484
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,520
And it's stuck.

485
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,760
And I really, really like it.

486
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,680
Yeah, it is the new normal.

487
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,760
So I'm going to transition from that and I'm going to mention why I'm on the road just

488
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,640
because people probably already know.

489
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,480
But just in case it's your last chance, Scale16x, the 16th annual Southern California Linux

490
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Expo.

491
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,720
It's going on at the Pasadena Convention Center March 8th through the 11th.

492
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,960
So it's starting in just a couple of days.

493
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,400
I will be in the Pomona area Wednesday evening.

494
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,360
And Wes, it's funny, when I get into California, because I've got the live tracker going at

495
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
the jupyterbroadcast.com.

496
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,640
I was going to ask.

497
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
That's perfect.

498
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,960
We can all creepily follow along.

499
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,060
Well, people do.

500
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
And I totally encourage it.

501
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:39,440
It's great because what happens is as soon as I get into California, it's New York, California

502
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,320
and Salt Lake City.

503
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,240
When I'm in either one of those areas, it goes from like, yeah, let's go out and get

504
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,240
a bite to eat.

505
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah, that sounds cool.

506
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,600
Let's meet up and get a bite to eat.

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,480
And it goes from, well, OK, we've got a big group.

508
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
So we're going to have to go do a meet up.

509
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,600
Where can we go where we can fit like seven people?

510
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,960
It's just way more people because everybody's so densely packed in here in New York and

511
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,800
in California and apparently Salt Lake City.

512
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,480
And so I may potentially be going out to dinner with five different listeners.

513
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
That's incredible.

514
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
I know.

515
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,200
After driving like a madman.

516
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,060
We got on the road before sunrise, before 6 a.m. and drove, drove, drove, drove to get

517
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,080
here so that way we could sit and park somewhere and do the show.

518
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,640
And I've just been getting telegrams and tweets.

519
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
It's great.

520
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,600
And I've already got listener Jeff on the way to meet up after we get off the air with

521
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,880
Unplugged here at the RV.

522
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Oh, wow.

523
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
So do you think you're ready?

524
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
I mean, does the scale starts on Thursday?

525
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,880
Is that right?

526
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Pumped.

527
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,880
Yeah, I'm pumped.

528
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
I'm pumped.

529
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,920
I have some listener Ryan, a tech guy who a couple of years ago helped us out by letting

530
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,920
us borrow his Cadillac when we got into Pomona because it's about 45 minutes between Pomona

531
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,720
and Pasadena, which is Pasadena is where scale's at.

532
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,160
And so Ryan's like, well, you're not planning to drive your RV in there, are you?

533
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,160
And we're like, no.

534
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,740
He's like, I don't think you realize how expensive that's going to be on Uber.

535
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,320
Why don't you borrow my car?

536
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,800
And we're like, OK.

537
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Whoa.

538
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
OK.

539
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:11,280
So he shows up and it's a Cadillac and which I just have an affection for because my grandparents

540
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,360
always had Cadillacs and so it was, you know, it's pretty great.

541
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,200
So Ryan reached out to me again this year and said, hey, you need another ride?

542
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,840
I could I could meet you Thursday morning and bring you into scale.

543
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,240
So yeah, Ryan and I are going to be meeting back up again and riding the Cadillac into

544
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,320
town and going to scale Thursday morning.

545
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,440
I think Noah is going to arrive in town like Thursday evening.

546
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,600
So I'll be there in the morning to get like the beginning, do the meet and greets with

547
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,960
with folks and meet a few people, get some interviews lined up, all that kind of stuff.

548
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
And I don't know.

549
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
It just go.

550
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,960
You know, this is the scale.

551
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,000
So scale was talking to us and they're like, so do you do you want the booth?

552
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,760
And we're like, no, we don't want the booth.

553
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
You don't want a booth?

554
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
Nope.

555
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,200
But how are you going to do a live show?

556
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,320
We're like, well, maybe you could give us a room somewhere that's quiet.

557
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
What?

558
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,600
Like, yeah, that's how we want to do it this year.

559
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
No booth.

560
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Totally different.

561
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,480
We're just going to go enjoy ourselves and try and really try to get a sense of where

562
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Linux is going in 2018 because you got a lot of good projects there, a lot of different

563
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,840
industry representation.

564
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,440
That's one of the reasons I'm taking all this effort to go to scale is because it's like

565
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,240
the biggest event in the States.

566
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,040
And so I wish it was Linux Fest Northwest, which because that's up there.

567
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,800
That's a big one, but it's not as big a scale.

568
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,120
And in fact, the folks from Linux Fest Northwest usually go to scale to represent.

569
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,000
And so I got to go to scale if I want to go to like the big community event.

570
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The big community event.

571
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,040
And you know, it's another side of the community.

572
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,560
There's different people that can make it there.

573
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,320
So I'm sure it's a lot of fun.

574
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,360
Yeah, I am so, so, so looking forward to it.

575
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,640
I'm trying to document bits of the journey too as we go down in Tech Talk today.

576
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:59,480
I just published episode 264, Parking Lot Podcaster yesterday and kind of captured the

577
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,760
first bit of the trail and the trek down here.

578
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,720
Tech Talk dot today is where you can go to get that.

579
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,080
And if you want to track me live as I'm making my way down to scale, Jupiterbroadcasting.com

580
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,840
slash Rover, that tracker is in the RV, not in, not on me.

581
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,360
So people like people show up at the RV and they're like awkward about it and they're

582
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,040
like hanging out around the RV and I'm not there.

583
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,680
I'm not there.

584
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
It's not on me.

585
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,960
Like, you can get to the RV by watching that, but you got to telegram me or tweet me to

586
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,520
actually find where I'm at.

587
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
But if it's during scale...

588
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,120
Oh, so you move around outside of LadyJubes?

589
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,680
Turns out I leave LadyJubes.

590
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,100
Yeah, I know.

591
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,080
People have asked me, well, could you just put the tracker in your pocket?

592
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,200
And I feel like that's the line where that's too far.

593
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
That's too far.

594
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
It's like, no, it's installed in LadyJubes.

595
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,120
I've considered it.

596
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,080
When we were in New York for a short period of time, we did remove it from LadyJubes and

597
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,680
we installed it into Dia's car.

598
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:57,000
But yeah, well, I love this app that you found, Wes.

599
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,800
It's like a, it's like salvation for Slack users.

600
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,200
Not that anybody ever uses Slack.

601
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,320
No, certainly not.

602
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,840
I wouldn't.

603
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,880
Nobody on this show, nobody in the mumble room uses Slack, nobody in the IRC or Discord,

604
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,320
nobody listening ever uses...

605
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,120
We only use what mattered most.

606
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Yeah.

607
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,080
Yeah, and there is some.

608
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
There is definitely some of that.

609
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,240
I think the same value is Slack at work.

610
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Do you?

611
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Yeah.

612
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,200
Is it pretty entrenched into the workflow?

613
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,240
Actually yes, because we use it for most of our communication, especially my department

614
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,800
when we're away from each other or inter-campus, that kind of thing.

615
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,440
Yeah, and I know, Wes, I know you use it with the network, but you also have a day job use

616
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
for it too.

617
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,960
So you're pretty heavy into Slack, just for work reasons, right?

618
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,520
Yep, definitely it's on all my devices just for that.

619
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,240
If not also the network, you're absolutely right.

620
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,480
So I want to try to find different ways to use Slack that are quick and easy and low

621
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
bandwidth.

622
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,920
And so that's why I love this app that you found, Wes, Slack Term, which is a Slack client

623
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,640
for your terminal.

624
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,800
And it's simple, install away, and you just download a binary for your system and run

625
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
it.

626
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I think it's written in Go, yeah?

627
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Did you check and look?

628
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
I think it's a Go app.

629
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
I think it's a Go app.

630
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Let's take a look here.

631
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,320
And it's got a whole set of keyboard commands.

632
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Yep, it's a Go app.

633
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Yeah, it's written in Go.

634
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,440
So you get a nice static binary you can run, yeah.

635
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,880
And it really is, I mean, if you just look at the interface, it's pretty minimal.

636
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,080
I like that it may not have all the features that you want.

637
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,580
But if you just want to be able to reply quickly, not jump out of your terminal, this might

638
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,320
be the thing for you.

639
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,080
I love the idea of SSH sessions running with certain applications just omnipresent.

640
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,640
I don't know.

641
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,000
I do it rarely, and then it all falls apart, and I stop using all of it, and then I build

642
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,920
things back up over time, like torrent clients, and SSH, and IRC, and things like that.

643
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,200
And then I sort of tear it all down, depending on my use case.

644
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,440
But like a team up session where you could stick this in there and just come back to

645
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,080
it anytime you needed it.

646
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,600
Or I've done X2Go as well, which is also really nice, and just have it up in an X session.

647
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,120
But anyways, this is sort of like a low bandwidth way to take care of Slack.

648
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,260
But the point I was getting at here is you can build a set of tools like this.

649
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:27,080
So what I had set up was an X2Go session on a DigitalOcean droplet that was just always

650
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
running.

651
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,280
It's still running right now, which is great, because I'm on a MiFi connection, so maybe

652
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,000
something really big and intensive comes up.

653
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,240
The MiFi connection is fast enough to do an X2Go session.

654
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
And that's secured over SSH, right?

655
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,720
And so then I'm working on a machine that's on a DigitalOcean droplet that has a 40-gigabit

656
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,540
connection, digitalocean.com.

657
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:52,540
Go over there and create your account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

658
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,440
And for a limited time, depends on engagement, there's a great deal.

659
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,560
And Wes, do you have the paper there?

660
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
There's like a URL.

661
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,560
It's like do.co slash unplugged, I think.

662
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,520
There's like an email somewhere on the table there.

663
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,120
There's a note there.

664
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,760
Okay now, here's why I wanted to make sure he got that, because that's the email where

665
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,440
DigitalOcean is informing us that for a limited...

666
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Yeah, that's great.

667
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
Nice.

668
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
That sounds good, Wes.

669
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,680
It's a limited time $100 credit for your DigitalOcean account if you're a new customer.

670
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
Wow.

671
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Because honestly, the $10 credit is more than enough because you could run the $10.

672
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,680
Pretty great, yeah.

673
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah.

674
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,080
So $100 credit, that's insane.

675
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,440
And the reason is because they've got new systems.

676
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,600
They've got mix and match droplets where you can mix and match the different resources

677
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,200
that you need for your application.

678
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,400
They've really improved the competitive pricing on their standard droplets too.

679
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,840
Basically all my rigs just got an upgrade.

680
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,800
My $0.03 an hour rig is just unstoppable.

681
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,600
You didn't do anything, and now they're better.

682
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
And you were there.

683
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Weren't you there?

684
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
We were doing something for...

685
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
We did it live.

686
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
It was beautiful.

687
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Yeah, we were doing something for TechSnap.

688
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
We were doing an experiment.

689
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,760
This is a great use case that we do with DigitalOcean all the time is Wes and I are about to talk

690
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,720
about something on TechSnap, and we had a question functionally about how it worked,

691
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,280
and we wanted to be able to speak from a position of experience, so we spun up a droplet.

692
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,360
In this case, it was a droplet that I already had some of the tools installed on, so I upgraded

693
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,920
the droplet, installed the applications I needed within seconds, and within 10 minutes

694
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,320
total we had run through different scenarios.

695
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,720
We had tested the application, and we were able to incorporate that into our notes for

696
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,160
the TechSnap program.

697
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,040
And it's that kind of flexibility when you're trying something out, when you want to learn

698
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,880
something, or when it's just time to build something and put it in production.

699
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,720
There's all kinds of great uses for DigitalOcean.

700
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Go over there.

701
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,600
They have great documentation, do.co slash unplugged, simplicity at scale and unbelievably

702
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,240
easy to use interface.

703
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,960
That's why companies like Slack and Tesla and Jupiter Broadcasting and many, many others

704
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:59,840
and lots of open source projects use DigitalOcean, do.co slash unplugged, and go check out their

705
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,640
documentation as well.

706
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,000
Thank you, DigitalOcean, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

707
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,200
So let's talk about Java just for a moment because I don't know what the hell is going

708
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
on here.

709
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,040
Oracle has handed over Java Enterprise Edition to the Eclipse Foundation, and now that the

710
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:23,280
Eclipse Foundation has taken over Java Enterprise, they're renaming it to Jakarta, and they're

711
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,000
dropping the Java trademark stuff.

712
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,800
There's no Java trademarks now.

713
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,600
They're calling the new Java Enterprise Jakarta, and it's under the guise of the Eclipse Foundation.

714
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,160
Did all those words I just said make sense to you?

715
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,040
I think so at a high level.

716
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
They barely did.

717
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Yeah.

718
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,440
But it's, I'm still not clear, will Oracle still be publishing their own version?

719
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,660
Will people start actually calling it Jakarta?

720
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,800
What's actually happening here?

721
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:59,880
I think it is a handover, and the thing that screwed me up is that Jakarta isn't a new

722
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,640
name.

723
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,200
The Apache Foundation used the name Jakarta, which was their open source Java efforts in

724
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,480
the late 90s, till recently, at least till 2011.

725
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,480
So that was an Apache thing.

726
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,920
So then this thing comes along, and it's really confusing, but my understanding is that essentially

727
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,640
it's a group of Java experts, including the Java creator, James Galsling, and others that

728
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,240
wrote Oracle and said, hand it over to us.

729
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:38,000
And they wrote a long list of reasons, and I think Oracle has complied.

730
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,240
This is all news to me, and I barely, barely care.

731
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:46,480
But it seems like we may have a new product on the market called Jakarta EE, which is

732
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,180
Java, but now under the Eclipse Foundation.

733
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,160
So that's my takeaway story from this.

734
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,960
Is that thick or what?

735
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,480
Yeah, I mean, of course it is.

736
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,960
We're talking about Oracle here, and so there's obviously going to be a lot of details that

737
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,440
have to be argued over and then lawyers involved.

738
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,560
Is there any chance somebody in the Mumba Room has a better breakdown of the story,

739
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:11,520
and perhaps could summon some bit of courage to actually care a bit more than I could?

740
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
I just...

741
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
No?

742
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
Nobody?

743
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
Okay.

744
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,760
We'll get the Well Actually email, and they'll set us straight, I'm sure.

745
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
They'll tell us.

746
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,400
That's why we love you, audience.

747
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,040
Now, Mr. Foray couldn't join us today, and it's my bad, because I believe he's in my

748
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,100
neck of the woods right now.

749
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,260
So I should have caught a hold of him and said, why don't you come over to LadyJuice

750
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
and have...

751
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,260
Oh, that would have been amazing.

752
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:38,960
Yeah, I could have shared this pineapple cider with him, which is prickly pineapple.

753
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Prickly pineapple?

754
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,800
Say that 10 times fast.

755
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,960
And he could have told us about Juno, which they're now actually starting the hype machine

756
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,960
on.

757
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,240
And they don't talk a lot about their future releases, but we're starting to see some updates.

758
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,720
And there is a couple of things that jumped out at me.

759
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,840
Number one, besides just an overall refinement to almost all aspects of the user interface

760
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,840
and the photos app and the terminal, but they have a new nightlight function.

761
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Nightlight?

762
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Which you probably...

763
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah, you probably can guess what that is.

764
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,080
It's a nightlight tab under the new display settings area that there's a new function

765
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
there.

766
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,040
And you can set the temperature and the schedule.

767
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,200
And then there's a really nice dropdown indicator where you can set there and adjust the shade

768
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
from a dropdown indicator.

769
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
They just really...

770
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,440
I don't know if you've seen the screenshot of this, Wes, but they've really done a good

771
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,800
job of taking a feature that I rely a lot on.

772
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,480
This nightshade feature combined with dark user interfaces is sort of my trick to using

773
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,800
my computer late at night.

774
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,280
Sometimes I just don't sleep.

775
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,260
And what happens is, don't tell her I said this, but I go to bed and I get a real good

776
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,260
sleep going.

777
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,260
You know what I mean?

778
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
Like a solid sleep.

779
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
One of those, oh yeah.

780
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Mm-hmm.

781
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,320
I'm out.

782
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:02,480
And then Hadia comes to bed or gets up and does something or the kids or the dog wakes

783
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,160
me up like 20 minutes into this nice sleep and I never fall back asleep for the rest

784
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,280
of the night.

785
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,360
And so what I have learned is after about an hour or so, maybe two hours, I just give

786
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
up and I go work.

787
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,120
You might as well get something done instead of restlessly sitting there.

788
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,280
I'm cracking open that XPS 13 in the middle of the night.

789
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,000
Sometimes it's like 2 a.m. or whatever when I've finally given up.

790
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,520
And if Redshift isn't kicked in just right or whatever, it's a blast of blue light that

791
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,120
almost guarantees I'll never go back to bed.

792
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,000
And this functionality sometimes can be too much when I'm editing and I need to turn this

793
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,240
down or turn it off.

794
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,080
And so it's really just a slick implementation they've done.

795
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
There's all kinds of things.

796
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,280
I really like the work they've done with the terminal too.

797
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,840
It's those little tweaks that often I think set elementary apart just in that, you know,

798
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,140
for you and I, it's not a problem.

799
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,920
We can install any of the tools that exist to do similar things, but to just have it

800
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
right in the OS that you've installed with that came on your computer, have it be a first

801
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,080
class in the UI and in the settings menu, that makes a big difference, I think, especially

802
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,720
people coming from Mac or other fancier platforms.

803
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,320
Yeah, I almost wish I wasn't all in on Plasma now.

804
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,840
It's looking so good.

805
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,440
But the Plasma hype beast has me hard right now.

806
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
There's just no way.

807
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,240
You know, once it's out, I won't blame you if you want to flirt around for a while.

808
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
That's okay.

809
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,480
You know, what we need is somebody in the mumble room to be like a third party arbiter

810
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,400
because, you know, Dan's going to say it's great if he shows up.

811
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,680
And I'm not trying to right now because I'm all in on Plasma.

812
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,880
So we need somebody from the mumble room to step up and be our elementary OS ambassador

813
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,920
and try this out and let us know how it's going and be like our 1804 on the scene reporter.

814
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
It could be you.

815
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
Somebody's got to do that.

816
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
It could be.

817
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
So if you want to do that, let us know.

818
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,640
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact or hang out in our mumble room, mumble.jupytercolony.org

819
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,520
for info on that and be part of the virtual log because it's going every Tuesday.

820
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:02,040
We do the show at, we try to start around somewhere in like the 1.30 to 2 o'clock time

821
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,400
range Pacific and then we go until Noah's done with Ask Noah.

822
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
So it's a good time to hang out.

823
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,480
A wonderful afternoon of Linux.

824
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Heck yeah.

825
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,440
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for the lifetime for that.

826
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
There you go.

827
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,600
If you want to see Daniel's post on that, they have a update for the last couple of

828
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,960
months and it's looking really good.

829
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,440
It's looking like they're really putting some serious work into that and you can go check

830
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
that out.

831
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,840
There's all of our links, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

832
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,120
Go over there and then find the episode.

833
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,040
This is episode 239 and you'll have links to everything in there.

834
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
I don't know, Mr. West.

835
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
What do you think?

836
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,080
Do you think, oh, you know what I was going to mention too is I'm going to try to, well,

837
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
you know what?

838
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
I'll save it.

839
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
I'll save it.

840
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
You are a tease today.

841
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
We'll tease it.

842
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
We have this.

843
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Actually, okay.

844
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Let's get into this.

845
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Let's do this.

846
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:57,640
So just really quickly, earlier in the show, we talked about Jeff Bezos' clock and Microsoft

847
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:05,480
making Hyper-V friendly version of Ubuntu, also Kali Linux coming into the subsystem.

848
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,360
I went down to Microsoft.

849
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,860
I had some interesting conversations with them.

850
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,840
It's almost quaint now to just kind of like, what's Microsoft doing with open source?

851
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:20,000
There's something I actually want to talk about in this area and the topic that Tech

852
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:28,360
Republic ran with was what Microsoft understands about open source that your company doesn't.

853
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,720
It's an interesting post, so I want to talk about that for a moment, but before we do,

854
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,920
let's thank Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

855
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,820
Thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the show.

856
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,260
It's a platform for you guys to go to, to learn more, to get more out of your career,

857
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,320
to maybe advance it, or to just challenge yourself, whatever you think might help build

858
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
the resume.

859
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,280
It's a full-featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills, self-paced,

860
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,240
in-depth video course on every cloud and DevOps topic, hands-on scenario-based labs that give

861
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,480
you experience on real servers, and if you ever need help, they have full-time instructors

862
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,640
that are there to advise and answer your questions.

863
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,600
And they have learning paths, which are a series of courses and contents planned by

864
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,960
instructors for specific career tracks.

865
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Are you ready to either switch track or go deeper?

866
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Really recommend that.

867
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,060
And now, a lot of you ask about certifications, and yes, they have courses created specifically

868
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,440
to prepare you for certification exams.

869
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,560
They also have practice exams and quizzes to prepare you.

870
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,740
They have flashcards, which use custom randomized decks of cards to help you study.

871
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,600
They get forged by the community and made better all of the time.

872
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,600
They have iOS and Android apps so you can study on the go, and they have a deep content

873
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
library.

874
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,800
They have staff that are adding to that and also going back and keeping it relevant all

875
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,720
the time, so that way your subscription is always valuable.

876
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,960
And if you're ready to learn AWS or OpenStack or even Azure, they have great courseware

877
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
and all of that.

878
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,500
They're really becoming the leader with all of that stuff, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

879
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,640
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and

880
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,060
a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

881
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:07,320
So the sub-headline is, Microsoft understands that its future depends upon contributing

882
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:14,640
to open source, not just using it, and your company needs the same strategy.

883
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:24,320
And when I was talking with Jeffrey, the technology fellow at Microsoft from the Azure group,

884
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:31,360
he talked about, well actually let me reframe this, I told him the reason why it's hard

885
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,160
for us to understand what Microsoft's overall strategy is, is because from the outside we

886
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,220
just see these big code drops.

887
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,920
So.NET Core, boom, code drop.

888
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,640
Visual Studio Code, boom, just code drop.

889
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,160
And then all of a sudden PowerShell Core, boom, code drop.

890
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,960
And it just looks like this sporadic, like now we're doing this is open source because

891
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,120
developers, and now we're doing this is open source because developers.

892
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:06,680
And it feels like it's an attempt to just take a shotgun approach to solving a problem.

893
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:15,140
But what I realized, which is obvious if you have any kind of insight inside a company,

894
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:22,300
what I realized is these are the manifestations of three or four year long processes.

895
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,920
Like Joey, who was in some of our interviews a couple of weeks ago, he was hired like four

896
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:34,120
years ago to help specifically begin the snowball effect of this process, which involved training

897
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:41,640
the team on using Git, which involved getting people on Mac and Linux, which quite frankly

898
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,600
involved firing people who weren't on board with the new program and were always Windows

899
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
first.

900
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:56,700
And it was this realignment that they have been doing internally to not just make money

901
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,040
off of open source, which is what they're doing, but the way they're making money off

902
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,320
open source is by trying to contribute to open source and get legitimate...

903
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,400
Get legitimate, I don't know if standing is the right word.

904
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,400
So I'll give you an example of where I'm going with this.

905
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:22,720
They talked at length internally about how the open source community would react to them

906
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:29,520
open sourcing PowerShell and what they could do to sort of appease that reaction, to sort

907
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,080
of address some of those concerns.

908
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:38,280
And they specifically had to jump into action when the developer of Curl was one of the

909
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,760
first people to submit a bug and it was, hey, you've got to remove your alias of Curl so

910
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,380
people can actually use real Curl.

911
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,000
And then they have this big conversation, like, okay, now we've got to make sure we're

912
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
responding.

913
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
This is what we're doing now.

914
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,440
This is what we're doing here.

915
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:01,120
And it wasn't just like our PR department's doing this now, our developers are working

916
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
internally.

917
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,200
It was the people actually touching the code had to get involved.

918
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:11,040
And there was some sort of shift that they had, some sort of mind shift that they had.

919
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,960
And I wouldn't be surprised if it was perhaps just watching how Red Hat does it and figuring

920
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,660
out how Red Hat's making money and going, well, geez, they're actually contributing

921
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,700
code upstream.

922
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,760
They're actually writing that stuff for their competitors to use and they're still making

923
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,320
money on it and they're being taken serious and they're considered legitimate.

924
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,680
Well, maybe we should do that.

925
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,160
So it's not like there wasn't somebody out there for them to look at, but they actually

926
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
got it.

927
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,560
And so what we're seeing today is sometimes something that's been in the works for four

928
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,420
or five years now that they're just getting around to dropping on us.

929
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:49,640
And so the key point that this Tech Republic article makes is if you actually want to be

930
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,040
taken serious at like a platform level or at a tool level, you've actually got to go

931
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,040
all in.

932
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,840
You can't just be like the PR division or a part of it.

933
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:04,360
And I kind of take some of this and I kind of direct some of this at Dell right now.

934
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:11,240
Like Dell is pretty all in on Linux on the server side and on the Sputnik line, but,

935
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,200
you know, I mean, it feels like there's more they could do.

936
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,560
They do contribute source code upstream, but I feel like there's more, like there's further

937
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,560
steps for Dell to take.

938
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,880
And I don't know exactly what they would be.

939
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,320
I mean, they still, they will definitely still, quote unquote, recommend Windows 10 for the

940
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,160
laptop that they're trying to sell you.

941
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,160
Yeah.

942
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,160
Yeah.

943
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,400
And I guess, yeah, I guess that's understandable for business.

944
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Absolutely.

945
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,400
No, it absolutely is.

946
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,040
But it doesn't, you know, there's a lot of conflicting feelings.

947
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,560
You're not quite sure like, well, how, how much, how invested in this are you?

948
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,960
So you and I talk about a lot of, on TechSnap, a lot of tools that people can use to manage

949
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,680
their server infrastructure and their crazy container sprawl and all that stuff.

950
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,520
And can you think of any of those tools that are really serious, like what are the big

951
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,920
ones in that space that are completely commercial where they don't have like a, like half the

952
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
tools open source?

953
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,040
Like what, like, is Ansible all open source?

954
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,040
What's the...

955
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,520
You know, the Ansible tower component didn't used to be, but it is now.

956
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,600
It really has been the trend.

957
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,400
There still are, you know, some like enterprise focused proprietary systems for monitoring

958
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,760
and configuration management, but they're definitely not the things that you end up

959
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,220
seeing at big tech companies or a lot of startups or, you know, maybe if you've been paying

960
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,680
for them for 20 years and it's part of your workflow, sure.

961
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,080
But it's not, it's not where the momentum is.

962
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,680
The only thing I could think of that's server based is web server cPanel.

963
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,680
Yep.

964
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
Yeah.

965
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,680
Yeah.

966
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,680
I was thinking cPanel is definitely something that's more consumer facing, but yeah.

967
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,320
Is cPanel still strong?

968
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
Is it used much?

969
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Yeah.

970
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
It's one of the top ones.

971
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Still, huh?

972
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,320
What a nightmare.

973
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,320
That and Plask.

974
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,320
Yeah.

975
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
Oh yeah.

976
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Wes, when's the last time you used cPanel or Plask?

977
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,160
Thankfully quite some time, but I definitely have friends, you know, or people in unfortunate

978
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,440
situations and you're right.

979
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,480
They're still, they're definitely still out there.

980
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
Yeah.

981
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
Yeah.

982
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,960
It seems though like if you want to be like a legitimate platform player, you have to

983
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,960
open source.

984
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,440
I mean, look at Apple with Swift.

985
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,240
You had to open source Swift to be taken seriously anymore.

986
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,560
I think it's a pretty big statement right there.

987
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:20,440
And Apple is an example of a company who's like half in with open source.

988
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,160
They obviously use a lot of it, a lot of the BSD tools, CUPS, a lot of that stuff is open

989
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,840
source in the development chain.

990
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,720
Even Darwin itself is open source, but it feels like that's more of an open source out

991
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,720
of convenience where there is a different type of commitment level to open source coming

992
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,280
out of Microsoft now.

993
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,600
And you can, you know, you can be listening to this and be skeptical and say, oh, Chris

994
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,040
has bought into the Kool-Aid, but I went down there and I talked to the people and they,

995
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,040
they said the things that you say when you're legitimately trying hard and you're a large

996
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,040
company.

997
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,700
And I think that that formula that they've cracked is going to be one that other companies

998
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:02,680
are either going to have to try to try to copy or they're going to be just perceived

999
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,680
as disingenuous.

1000
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,680
Yeah.

1001
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,680
I mean, it was like a legitimate.

1002
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,560
It feels like almost like you almost have to assess it from that perspective in terms

1003
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,540
of open source is just what you have to do now.

1004
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,840
So even if you don't trust Microsoft, still don't like Microsoft, whatever, they're smart

1005
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,120
enough, savvy enough, at least it appears that even if they didn't genuinely believe

1006
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,520
these things, they're willing to do so just in their own interest.

1007
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,920
You know, what's going to be, you know, what's going to be weird is to see where Google goes

1008
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,800
in the next few years with open source because they've got Project Fuchsia.

1009
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,320
They've got Android One.

1010
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,600
It's a little bit different of a thing.

1011
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:45,360
But there's also today there is news that Google has unveiled a 72 qubit Bristol Cone

1012
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:54,080
processor, which they say brings them to quantum supremacy in the quantum computing race.

1013
00:50:54,080 --> 00:51:00,400
Now it's not like we're not talking like they're cracking Bitcoin crypto codes yet, but that

1014
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,080
is going to be a really interesting thing to see where this all goes with Google and

1015
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,960
where where they still continue to contribute to open source and where they become more

1016
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,600
Apple to try to stay competitive with Android, you know, that line that they walk.

1017
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Very much so.

1018
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,720
And it's funny you mentioned that because just the just the other week to Microsoft

1019
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,280
released their quantum development kit, including support for Linux.

1020
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,640
So it's they're all they're all playing in these spaces.

1021
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,660
I think it will matter like, how genuine do they believe it?

1022
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:31,900
Is it a Google style kind of it is open source, but all the good stuff gets put proprietary?

1023
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,200
Or will it really be first class open source?

1024
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,320
That seems to be the way it's going to it's like these big centralized obviously, because

1025
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,880
of just the cooling requirements and all this crazy stuff when they build these quantum

1026
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
computers.

1027
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
IBM is doing that, too.

1028
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:44,880
Did you see that there?

1029
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,400
There's like some IBM Center down in Texas.

1030
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,840
If you're a local, you can go use IBM's quantum computer.

1031
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,840
Yeah.

1032
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,080
And then they have an API you can use over the web as well.

1033
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,080
Really?

1034
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,080
Yeah.

1035
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,080
Oh, my gosh.

1036
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,600
Well, there you go, Wes.

1037
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,560
Maybe we could encode some podcasts on there.

1038
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,560
Let's give it a shot.

1039
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,880
I don't think so.

1040
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:02,880
No, I don't think so.

1041
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,880
No, I don't think so.

1042
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,880
All right.

1043
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,720
If you want to contribute something to the show, go to linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1044
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,880
That is our subreddit linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1045
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,220
Yes, we have a subreddit.

1046
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,960
We don't mention it very often.

1047
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,400
But it's over there.

1048
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,720
I'm not big on Reddit these days.

1049
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,960
So I just shut down our Jupiter broadcasting subreddit.

1050
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,920
Because I was in there and I was like, this is a fuck.

1051
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,380
This is, I shouldn't swear, but this is a dumpster fire is what my thoughts were.

1052
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,080
But the unplugged subreddit still seems to be chugging along just fine.

1053
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:39,280
And there is a post in there that was submitted an hour ago by Mr. Motang about Skype bragging

1054
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,200
that their maintenance updates could be easier because of snaps.

1055
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:53,400
Now, I think there's also the possibility that we could see more things coming down

1056
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,400
this channel.

1057
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,400
I don't know how much I can say.

1058
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Yeah.

1059
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,560
I don't think I can actually say what I know.

1060
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Do you remember we talked about it?

1061
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,480
It does seem like there's some momentum behind the scenes that we aren't, I don't get to

1062
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,480
be privileged to, but just quiet releases of things.

1063
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
That's got to be building.

1064
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:14,680
Well, see, here's like, I'll tell you, there's a capability when you have a confined application

1065
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,640
and you ship with its own libraries, if it's using, if the application is typically doing

1066
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,400
something wrong, there might be a way via packaging to solve it.

1067
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,980
So say you had an application like Skype that was broken into two pieces.

1068
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,960
You had an electron version of Skype and then inside Skype, you still had like a C plus

1069
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,000
application to do like all of the voice calls that actually was the voice engine.

1070
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,400
Let's say this is theoretically new Skype is set up.

1071
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,040
Well, new Skype uses electron wrapper for like the chat and all of that.

1072
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,880
And of course, because it's new Skype, that's using pulse audio.

1073
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,760
But core Skype that's like embedded in that electron app that's doing all of the management

1074
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,720
for the voice calls, that's still using ulsa.

1075
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,720
Fun.

1076
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,720
Okay.

1077
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,240
I totally believe that that would happen in this theoretical Linux universe.

1078
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Exactly.

1079
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:09,280
And it's possible that perhaps one is communicating at ulsa with one rate and it's communicating

1080
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,960
and then the electron apps communicating to pulsa with a completely different rate.

1081
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
You see what I'm saying?

1082
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:19,240
I can't, I mean, I don't, I certainly can't hear what you're saying because that sounds

1083
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,040
like an audio clusterfuck.

1084
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
Sorry.

1085
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:27,680
I would, are you talking about sample rate or yeah, yeah, we might be, we might be, we

1086
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,720
might be talking about sample rate, not bit rate.

1087
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,720
That might be what we're talking about.

1088
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,160
Maybe you're talking like 44 Hertz versus 48 Hertz.

1089
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,160
You know what I'm saying?

1090
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,160
That kind of thing.

1091
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,440
Like perhaps the electron app is at 44 Hertz and perhaps the C plus plus or the C plus

1092
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:47,100
apps at a 48 you saw, you know, who knows, I'm just spitballing here and via packaging,

1093
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,480
you might be able to have some libraries in there that solve this problem and fix this

1094
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,240
problem for the vendor that, that doesn't require them doing a complete rewrite of their

1095
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
application.

1096
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:00,560
And so that vendor may be very excited about the packaging format because of the possibilities

1097
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,280
of solving problems for them on the Linux platform.

1098
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,160
That could be potentially what we're dealing with here, but I don't know.

1099
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,160
I'm just speculating.

1100
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,160
You see what I'm saying?

1101
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,160
Yeah.

1102
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,720
I could see a sample rate mismatch, but not so much a bit rate mismatch because that would

1103
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,520
just make a compression sound weird.

1104
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,720
A sample rate mismatch would actually speed up or slow down the audio.

1105
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,720
Yeah.

1106
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,720
Yeah.

1107
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,240
Hadea just got back from, uh, from the Capitol with Levi.

1108
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,440
Levi, welcome in little buddy.

1109
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
Yeah.

1110
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Levi is now here.

1111
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,440
He's here.

1112
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,440
Come here, Levi.

1113
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,440
Come here.

1114
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,440
Come say hi to the unplugged program.

1115
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,440
Come here.

1116
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,440
Come up here.

1117
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Come here.

1118
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
Come here.

1119
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,440
So yeah, he's nice and warm here.

1120
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
Lick the microphone for me.

1121
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
There you go.

1122
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Yeah.

1123
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,700
He likes to sit and he likes to sit up here and look out the window.

1124
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,700
But how was that?

1125
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,700
Was that good?

1126
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,700
Yeah.

1127
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,700
Yeah.

1128
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,700
Is it warm?

1129
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,700
Yeah.

1130
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,700
It looks pretty warm out there.

1131
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,700
I'm getting pretty warm in here.

1132
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,700
Did you just turn on the air?

1133
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,700
Okay.

1134
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,700
Nice.

1135
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,700
Yeah.

1136
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,700
All right.

1137
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,700
Well, so, uh, Mr. West, I have just a couple of parting bits to talk about before we get

1138
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,700
out of here.

1139
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,700
Let us in on your secrets.

1140
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,440
Do you have, do you have any secrets you want to share with the people?

1141
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,480
Maybe like a Twitter place they could check out something like that.

1142
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,660
You can find me over at, uh, at West Payne.

1143
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,660
Very good.

1144
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,720
You can follow me at Chris LAS and why not check out the Instagram.

1145
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,720
I'll post a few pictures.

1146
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Yes.

1147
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,720
I said it.

1148
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,720
Do it.

1149
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,000
As long as, as long as there's Levi pictures, I will be there.

1150
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
You know what?

1151
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,800
I'll make sure I put a Levi picture up there just for you.

1152
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Okay.

1153
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
Just for you.

1154
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Um, Insta Chris LAS on there.

1155
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,580
I'll be posting some pictures on the road to scale tech talk dot today for the story

1156
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,200
as we get to scale.

1157
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,920
And if you're in the Pasadena area, let me know at Chris LAS on the Twitter or on the

1158
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
telegrams.

1159
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,800
I'd love to talk to you guys and Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar for our live time.

1160

1161
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:48,160

1162
00:56:48,160 --> 00:57:00,920
All right, well, now we just got to pick a title and then we're out of here.

1163
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,560
Let's get that titles on everyone.

1164
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,440
Noah may be stopping in a little bit too.

1165
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Noah that dog.

1166
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
I know, right?

1167
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,440
I know.

1168
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,440
Boom, JBtitles.com.

1169
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,960
Go get your vote heard right now.

1170
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,280
The only election that matters, JBtitles.

1171
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,480
I shall be back after game the kid.

1172
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,480
What'd you say?

1173
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,940
We'll just put quantum in there a whole bunch?

1174
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,440
That's probably what we want.

1175
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,760
We were, you know, we have, uh, it's funny how you notice how like the mumble room attendance

1176
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,720
is pretty decent today, but it could be double this some weeks, you know, and it just sort

1177
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,720
of ebbs and flows.

1178
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,720
It really does.

1179
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,720
We should get some graphs on that.

1180
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,600
That would be really interesting.

1181
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:44,200
On Twitter, check out the trends in the US player one is trending and it seems to be

1182
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:52,440
all retro, um, movie titles and or, uh, retro characters feeding, um, being, uh, subbed

1183
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,480
in with a ready player one.

1184
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,480
Oh really?

1185
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
It's right.

1186
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,440
When's ready player one coming out?

1187
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,440
I'm ready.

1188
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,440
My body is ready.

1189
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
My booty is ready.

1190
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,600
All right, Wes, I'm going to go find a Levi picture for you right now.

1191
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,800
Wow, what a dear.

1192
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,720
How about, uh, we call, here's one that we call, uh, Levi the Copi.

1193
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:20,440
Levi the Copi.

1194
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,260
He's so cute.

1195
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,480
Now he's been to California.

1196
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,480
Look at that.

1197
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,080
Uh, he may have before because, uh, you know, he's from Texas.

1198
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,440
We had, uh, we parked somewhere where the people that parked next to us, they had a

1199
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,240
rescue dog from Texas too.

1200
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,240
Nice.

1201
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,240
Did they get along well?

1202
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,240
They did.

1203
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,240
You know, you know Levi.

1204
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,240
Yeah.

1205
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,240
You know.

1206
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,240
He just wants to be everyone's friend.

1207
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,240
Yeah.

1208
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,720
There ain't nobody Levi don't get along with.

1209
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,720
Know what I mean?

1210
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,720
Yeah.

1211
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,720
Right.

1212
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,720
And if so, I don't trust that person.

1213
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,320
They've clearly done something wrong.

1214
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:58,160
It'll release on the 29th of March.

1215
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,640
Oh man, that's, that's forever.

1216
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:06,680
That is forever, dude.

1217
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,680
Yeah.

1218
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,680
Could be worth the wait.

1219
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,680
Plus it, I think, uh, Spielberg is directing.

1220
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,400
There you go, Wes.

1221
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,400
Just for you.

1222
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
Posted Levi the Copilot.

1223
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
Oh.

1224
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
Boom.

1225
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:30,160
Um, all right, so we got to name this thing.

1226
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,400
This is going to be a, this is going to be a weird Poe show.

1227
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
Yeah.

1228
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,200
This is a weird Poe show, but that's just what happens sometimes, you know?

1229
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,300
Yeah, it is.

1230
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,640
It's a weird week because it's a low mumble attendance.

1231
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,720
It's kind of a light news week and-

1232
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,400
Everyone's too excited about scale.

1233
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,120
How are you going to-

1234
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,160
And yeah, yeah.

1235
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:51,040
And also this is put kind of put together at the last minute because, you know, road

1236
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
trip.

1237
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:55,280
Well, you're not supposed to reveal that part.

1238
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,280
Okay.

1239
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
All right.

1240
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,640
Scaling, unplugged, remote access, unplugged, unplugged on the road, uh, unplugged road

1241
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:11,000
show, um, what about, uh, what about, uh, what about Jeff's clock or something like

1242
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,320
that?

1243
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,960
Or cleaning, cleaning Jeff's clock.

1244
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,080
Oh, cleaning Jeff's clock, huh?

1245
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,640
Uh, millennium Linux.

1246
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,640
Microsoft strategy.

1247
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,640
Microsoft strategy.

1248
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,640
Microsoft strategy.

1249
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,640
Because it wasn't-

1250
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,640
That was too bad.

1251
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,960
And it has, we have, we had two stories at least.

1252
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:35,240
Uh, the Microsoft, uh, the Microsoft millennium, the Microsoft, uh, Microsoft millennium.

1253
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:40,080
The uh, let's see, really what you got here is, you know what I was going to go with?

1254
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,760
You know what I forgot to, you know what I forgot to put in there was where I was going

1255
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:48,640
to go is both Microsoft and Amazon are really powerfully positioned to, uh, just dominate

1256
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,280
for a couple of years and, uh, Amazon more so I think.

1257
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,880
And I wanted to kind of work that into the segment because that's kind of where this

1258
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,880
is headed.

1259
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,420
It just, it didn't work.

1260
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,420
There's too much going on.

1261
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,420
I don't know.

1262
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,420
We didn't get there.

1263
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:08,120
But, uh, that's where this is all going is Amazon is going to become like the titan of

1264
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,960
our industry because look at, they already run the internet with EC2, um, they're gonna,

1265
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,680
they're gonna turn our own homes into stores with ring video doorbell and the echo devices

1266
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,220
and the security products they're about to launch and then home delivery of prescriptions.

1267
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:27,360
They're going to just own our home completely or our own, they're with the echo tubes and

1268
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,800
dash buttons and all these other things.

1269
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,960
They just turn your, they don't need a store because your house is the store.

1270
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,800
Um, and then they have amazon.com and, uh, then they're going to have their media section

1271
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:44,960
with the prime stuff, the prime video stuff and, uh, they're opening up another headquarters.

1272
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,680
So do you feel like a little pawn being bounced back and forth between like three big tech

1273
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,360
companies kind of deciding what your life is like?

1274
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,360
Yeah.

1275
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:57,800
Did you guys mention about the, uh, gaming, uh, service that they just bought?

1276
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:06,200
No, no, no gaming, game streaming service.

1277
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,560
So the future is theirs.

1278
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:13,120
The future is like, what do we, what can we, where can we go with a title from this?

1279
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,120
Microsoft millennium.

1280
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:22,080
Um, the next Microsoft millennium, the next Microsoft decade.

1281
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,080
Yeah.

1282
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:31,960
I don't know about you guys, but I'm not allowing any Amazon echoes into my, uh, this, uh, residence.

1283
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:32,960
Next Microsoft.

1284
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:33,960
It's kind of long.

1285
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,960
I don't know.

1286
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,960
People just think it's about Microsoft.

1287
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,960
Yeah.

1288
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,960
Right.

1289
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:42,960
Um, the future is open source.

1290
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,480
Uh, hmm.

1291
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,040
That's closer.

1292
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,040
That's not bad.

1293
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,880
It's not great.

1294
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,880
It's kind of generic.

1295
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:58,040
It's probably more in the direction, um, open source millennium by the way, can we check

1296
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,720
the IRC discord poll?

1297
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,520
Oh yeah.

1298
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,520
Yeah.

1299
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,720
Uh, yeah, it is.

1300
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,720
It's in the, it's in the show notes from two weeks ago.

1301
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,800
If you want to check it while we, while we tile it up, uh, there you go.

1302
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,120
Levi, the co-pilot picture posted just for us.

1303
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,120
Boom.

1304
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
Yep.

1305
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
Look at that.

1306
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
It's beautiful.

1307
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
Got it up here on the stream.

1308
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,120
Isn't he a dog?

1309
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:21,120
Oh yeah.

1310
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,120
He does get very sleepy.

1311
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,120
Yeah.

1312
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,480
He, he does get very sleepy.

1313
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,280
You're on the road a long day traveling.

1314
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,400
It takes it out of a little pup.

1315
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,200
It does.

1316
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,200
Poor little guy.

1317
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:38,720
Oh gosh, he's so cute with his little sweater too.

1318
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,000
He probably hardly needs it in your warm California air.

1319
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah.

1320
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
It's off now.

1321
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
That was earlier this morning when it was up in the twenties.

1322
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Okay.

1323
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,160
What else do we got here?

1324
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,160
Anything new?

1325
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,160
Unplugged on the road.

1326
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:02,600
I've been unplugged everywhere.

1327
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,720
Hashtag rotten was right.

1328
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,720
That's great.

1329
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:15,520
Um, plasma millennium, well we only really talked about plasma just as the check-in.

1330
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:21,800
Let's see here.

1331
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,800
Okay.

1332
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,760
It looks like IRC is winning over discord with 77%.

1333
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,760
Yeah.

1334
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,760
Yeah.

1335
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,760
Yeah.

1336
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,760
Yeah.

1337
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,760
That is surprising.

1338
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,960
I think 77 is down from 79 from last check.

1339
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,960
Correct?

1340
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,960
Oh, it is.

1341
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,960
Huh?

1342
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
Oh, there you go.

1343
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,320
Uh, diddle it, did it, did it, Morty.

1344
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,120
Just use an external USB sound card.

1345
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Don't use the sound card built into your laptop.

1346
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,120
Yeah.

1347
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,120
For hiss.

1348
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,120
So, okay.

1349
01:04:48,120 --> 01:05:00,760
Um, something about Jakarta, um, no, selling, selling, selling out for open source.

1350
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:04,400
Oh, that's kind of, that's actually not bad.

1351
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,400
Yeah.

1352
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,160
It's kind of, it's kind of nuanced.

1353
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,840
There could be multiple interpretations.

1354
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,760
It's got open source in there.

1355
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,600
Let's say Microsoft, but it's obviously what we're talking about.

1356
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,600
Huh.

1357
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,240
I kind of like it.

1358
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,240
I like it too.

1359
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,240
You're making me like it.

1360
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,240
You're making me like it, Wes.

1361
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,240
I could, I could live with that.

1362
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,240
All right.

1363
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,240
Okay.

1364
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,240
Maybe we'll do that.

1365
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,240
Hmm.

1366
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,240
Selling out.

1367
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,240
I mean.

1368
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,920
Well, who are we talking about?

1369
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,920
We may not be.

1370
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,920
Yeah.

1371
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:38,320
We may be talking about, um, Apple, I don't know.

1372
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Oracle.

1373
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
Yeah.

1374
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,320
That's, that's who we're talking about.

1375
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,320
Yeah.

1376
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,320
I like that.

1377
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,320
Yeah.

1378
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,320
I don't know.

1379
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,120
Dumpster fire.

1380
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:53,720
If I had, if I had, if I had better connections at Microsoft and more time, I would be tempted

1381
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,160
to go to build this year and see how much they're talking about open source at build.

1382
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,160
That would be fascinating.

1383
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,160
Because that's their big developer conference.

1384
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
Yeah.

1385
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,880
Speaking of Microsoft connections, did you get a contact with anybody significant yet?

1386
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,680
Um, well, what do you mean?

1387
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:16,040
Because I sent your email over to the contact I have, uh, at, uh, who's a co-host of twight

1388
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:19,560
who's from, who is a Microsoft development head of the graph.

1389
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,560
Oh, Lou.

1390
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,560
Uh, no, but I've been talking to other people.

1391
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,560
Yeah.

1392
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,560
Yeah.

1393
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,560
I've been talking to other people.

1394
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,560
Yeah.

1395
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,560
Yeah.

1396
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,560
Yeah.

1397
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,560
Lou would be a good perspective to have on, uh, on the show with regards to the Microsoft

1398
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,560
graph.

1399
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:37,000
So, and he runs a Linux on occasion.

1400
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
How dare he?

1401
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
How dare he?

1402
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,480
Well, I mean, it is open now with such an Adela.

1403
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
No, we're just teasing.

1404
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,480
We're just teasing.

1405
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,480
Sorry.

1406
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,480
I see that sense of humor.

1407
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,480
Oh, there he is.

1408
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,480
There he is.

1409
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,480
The moment we've all been waiting for.

1410
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,480
Yeah.

1411
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,480
Welcome.

1412
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,480
Hallelujah.

1413
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,480
Hi there guys.

1414
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,480
You saw today.

1415
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,480
Hooray.

1416
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
Did I, did I sound bad before?

1417
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,480
I don't know.

1418
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,480
There was a, there was a week ago or something.

1419
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:12,480
There was that one live stream where your audio was garbage and then we had to, yeah,

1420
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:13,480
we had to ruin that.

1421
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,480
We had to bail on the pre on the post show cause it was so bad.

1422
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,480
Yeah.

1423
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,480
Yeah.

1424
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,480
That was last week.

1425
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,480
Yeah.

1426
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,480
That was, well, no, that was, to be fair, that was not, that was my studio audio.

1427
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,480
I was, I was on my laptop or something like that.

1428
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,480
Not my fault.

1429
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,480
It's not my fault.

1430
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,480
I love you though.

1431
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,480
Yeah.

1432
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,480
I wouldn't go that far.

1433
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,480
It wasn't my fault.

1434
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,480
It just, you know, you know.

1435
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:39,580
So you're at, you're in your regular old Graham Forks studio, you know, just old boring studio

1436
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,200
that's been custom built for you.

1437
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,200
Just old boring.

1438
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:46,280
Well actually, so I, I don't know how, I know you get excited more on the studio side of

1439
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,640
things than the transmitter side, but we got a new transmitter and this, it's a transmitter

1440
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,640
made for Chris.

1441
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,640
Chris.

1442
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,640
Oh yeah.

1443
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,640
Yeah.

1444
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,840
The whole thing is a web UI.

1445
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,960
So you log in and you can set the power and you can turn it on and off.

1446
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,600
It's got, it's got so many bells and whistles on the stupid thing.

1447
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:06,520
I get emails from my transmitter now telling me your audio is a little bit low and it's

1448
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,560
not modulating quite as much and it's not quite as loud as the, as this station that

1449
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:10,560
I'm listening to.

1450
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,520
And so you might want, it's crazy.

1451
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:13,520
Ooh.

1452
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,800
It's like, like, what do you mean, what do you mean like it, like the software emails

1453
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,800
you?

1454
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Like it's not a human.

1455
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
No.

1456
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,800
Yeah.

1457
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,920
It's, it's actually, it's a little arm computer that's inside of that process.

1458
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,400
It's inside of that transmitter and monitors for a bunch of different things.

1459
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,280
And like, even, even like when I show you the interface, even though you're not much

1460
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,240
of a, you're, you're not like, I don't, I don't think you, at least I don't think you

1461
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,840
get gung ho over like the, the RF side.

1462
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,360
You'd look at it and be like, man, that is cool.

1463
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,120
I don't even know what that is, but I want to play with it.

1464
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,280
Oh, that's a, that's a strong selling point.

1465
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,280
Yeah.

1466
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:44,280
I could see that.

1467
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,280
I could totally see that.

1468
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,760
So what's coming up on the show today?

1469
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:50,000
Oh, we are doing some, we are doing some really exciting things.

1470
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:57,280
We are talking today about all of the tools and software packages and stuff that people

1471
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:03,720
self host on their home servers, on their business servers, and how those tools work,

1472
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,200
what the best ones are, what are ones that you might want to stay away from.

1473
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,680
And if you don't want to host them yourself, what are some of the alternatives you can

1474
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,680
go to, to get some, to, to, to pay somebody to host that stuff, is there a managed provider

1475
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,680
that provides that?

1476
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,680
Yeah.

1477
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,680
Yeah.

1478
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,120
I, I've been wanting to do a home server hoedown on the Unplugged program for a few

1479
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,120
weeks.

1480
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,680
That's, that's, I think I love, I love that topic, something, you know, you can self host

1481
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,920
or not.

1482
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,920
It's exploding in the industry, which is why it's so interesting to me.

1483
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,920
Whoa, really?

1484
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,920
Really?

1485
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,920
Yeah.

1486
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,080
I was, you know, I get monthly sales reports of where we make the most amount of our money

1487
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:46,080
and this month, the only, the one thing that I can say has, that brought in the most money.

1488
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,440
If I was to categorize something, it is maintenance support or installation of self hosted services.

1489
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,440
Huh?

1490
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,440
Good.

1491
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,440
I know.

1492
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,440
I know.

1493
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,440
I know.

1494
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,000
That's also good longterm too, for you.

1495
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Yeah.

1496
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yeah, it really is.

1497
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah.

1498
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,560
I just, you know, there, there are some trends in the IT industry that they got me worried

1499
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,560
sometimes.

1500
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,560
Yeah.

1501
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,560
Yeah.

1502
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,560
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1503
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,920
I'm looking forward to it.

1504
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
Now what else?

1505
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,920
Come on.

1506
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:14,920
What else?

1507
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,920
Get us excited here.

1508
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,920
This is your space.

1509
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,920
Give us a tease.

1510
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,440
Oh, well, here's the thing.

1511
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,920
I can only go so far with, but before, oh, you don't want to reveal live.tv and tune

1512
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,920
in.

1513
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,560
I'll give you a little bit of a tease.

1514
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,000
So have you, have you played with C file yet?

1515
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,920
Is that, is that maybe that, that has to be a thing.

1516
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,920
You got me close.

1517
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,240
You've, you've got me close.

1518
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,240
Yeah.

1519
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,000
We should do a little demo during Linux Fest.

1520
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,360
I think the best way to sell you on C, I think the way to do it, knowing what I know about

1521
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,480
you, I feel like I, so first I think I should make the disclaimer, like I'm going to manipulate

1522
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,480
you.

1523
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,240
I think that's how I excuse myself from the manipulations I talked about.

1524
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:53,600
If I tell you, then you can't be like, oh, he's no, I'm just being upfront.

1525
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,600
All right.

1526
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,680
So that'll be our, that'll be our, that'll be our system.

1527
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:03,480
I think the way to do it is to just offer it to you as, as if it is a hosted thing that

1528
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:10,720
you could just go sign up for, you know, because you think that's what it takes a service to

1529
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,720
get them.

1530
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,720
Yeah.

1531
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,720
Go ahead.

1532
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,720
Now, now say like the thing that's going to trigger me.

1533
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,080
So no, I think I will really, what I thought, I think it is, is if I were to put words to

1534
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,400
it, I think the words are Chris wants all the benefits of self hosted stuff, but he

1535
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:28,080
doesn't necessarily have the time or the, or the, or the luxury of being able to have

1536
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,920
to figure that out unless it's something that he relies on.

1537
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,020
So I feel like if you were going to, if you're going to go all in and like base your business

1538
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,120
off of it, no doubt you'd host it yourself.

1539
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,560
But I feel like for just like, I'm going to try this, not really sure.

1540
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,000
I feel like the way you do that is to say, here's a given instance, go play with it,

1541
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
see what you think.

1542
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,040
And then if it works, then you say, okay, now how do I move this onto for myself?

1543
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,040
I'm looking forward to that.

1544
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:54,920
And I'm definitely willing to try it because honestly I, you've really kind of sold me

1545
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,920
on it.

1546
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:56,920
That, what was it?

1547
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,920
Two weeks ago you did an episode on there.

1548
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,240
I can't remember, three weeks now.

1549
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,240
And you were talking about it.

1550
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,240
Oh yeah.

1551
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,720
And you were talking about it when we were in person too.

1552
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,320
And so that really kind of got me, that really kind of got me sold.

1553
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,960
All right, I'll give it a go.

1554
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:08,960
I'll give it a go.

1555
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:09,960
You know, I'm not married to Dropbox.

1556
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,240
I just, I think it's done pretty well, but it's expensive and you know, I would imagine

1557
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,080
things are going to be changing there now that they filed for an IPO.

1558
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:23,120
Yeah, and the other thing is too, is when I look at the, when I look at the cost and

1559
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,360
I start saying, man, the amount of flexibility that you would have with this software thing

1560
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,320
over here and the amount of flexibility that you have that I know exists with Dropbox.

1561
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,600
And I'm like, I'm looking at some of this stuff and I'm like, man, from a production

1562
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:39,960
standpoint for what you have to do with file syncing and it's just, I don't know, it's

1563
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,960
pretty amazing.

1564
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:47,040
Well, isn't, isn't the limitation of self-hosting servers, don't get me wrong.

1565
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:52,560
I love the idea as sort of a hacker, hacker mindset, but isn't the limitation if you need

1566
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:58,360
to access that from outside the, your network, you're limited by your upload speed connection.

1567
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,520
Yeah, of course.

1568
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:06,040
But we have ways we've partnered up with some, with some managed hosted providers that I

1569
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:12,440
can, we can get servers now for 25 bucks, two terabyte, four terabyte storage arrays,

1570
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:17,920
you know, eight gigs of RAM and dedicated Xeons for 25 bucks a month.

1571
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,040
Like when you start getting to there and you can start putting those servers all over the

1572
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:24,840
US and then you start hooking them together so that one talks to the other and so that

1573
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:29,200
your data starts to basically set up your own little mini CDN, you start getting to

1574
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:33,440
that point and all of a sudden it's like, man, how is Dropbox going to compete with

1575
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:52,060
us?
