00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
So you hear all the hype about mechanical keyboards, but they're really expensive, let's be honest.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.860
So that's where the Buckle Spring project comes in.

00:11.860 --> 00:18.440
It's nostalgic keyboard sounds that emulate the sound of the old faithful IBM Model M

00:18.440 --> 00:21.180
keyboard.

00:21.180 --> 00:25.620
The author of the project has painstakingly captured the sound of each key.

00:25.620 --> 00:32.800
This is a real conversation that I typed up to Westpane, and this is what it sounds like.

00:32.800 --> 00:38.880
And it runs on your machine, in the background, and as you type, it makes these sounds come

00:38.880 --> 00:39.880
out your speakers.

00:39.880 --> 00:44.300
Finally an answer for that problem where I'm at the coffee shop, but no one knows how nerdy

00:44.300 --> 00:46.840
I am, and now I can bother all of them.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.360
It's on-demand Model M typing.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
You're welcome.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.480
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

00:52.480 --> 01:02.120
A lot of fun.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.160
Hello friends, welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
My name is Chris.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.160
My name is Lance.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.680
And this episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader in hands-on learning.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.600
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.760
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs for Cloud Linux servers and much more.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.640
Get your hands cloudy at a CloudGuru.com.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.600
Coming up on this week's episode, we're finally doing it.

01:23.600 --> 01:28.400
We have gotten so many requests into the show, and it seemed like now, at the beginning of

01:28.400 --> 01:36.280
the year, when there's so much left to happen, it was the time to try out OpenSUSE.

01:36.280 --> 01:41.640
We gave it a go, essentially wrapped up last week's episode, and Wes and I loaded it up.

01:41.640 --> 01:46.920
Been running it on some metal directly, and I think we both opted for the tumbleweed route.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.880
Wes and I have not been telling each other much about our experience to save it for the

01:49.880 --> 01:50.880
show.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.880
Secret, secret.

01:51.880 --> 01:52.880
You went tumbleweed though, right?

01:52.880 --> 01:53.880
I sure did.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.640
Yeah, I mean, our kind of thought here was, we feel like there's a lot in the air for

01:57.640 --> 01:58.640
OpenSUSE.

01:58.640 --> 02:03.360
Like, some stuff's going to happen this year, and there's also a lot of momentum behind

02:03.360 --> 02:09.880
rolling distributions, and Arch is always the go-to example that's cited.

02:09.880 --> 02:16.240
But SUSE has been at this for a while now, and is it a viable Arch alternative?

02:16.240 --> 02:19.320
Is it a workstation rolling OS?

02:19.320 --> 02:24.600
So we wanted to give it a go and relay our experiences to you with OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed,

02:24.600 --> 02:26.000
and we'll do that in a little bit.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.200
But of course, we also have some really great community news.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.960
We have a pick that's fantastic, it's going to make you way more productive, and a lot

02:33.960 --> 02:34.960
more.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.160
So to help us get through all of this, we have to turn to our crack team.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.160
Time appropriate greetings, Momorub.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.160
Hello.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.160
Greetings.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.160
Howdy.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.380
Buenos tardes.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.480
Happy New Year, everybody.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.080
Here's a New Year's taco for you.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.780
And thanks for being here.

02:50.780 --> 02:53.060
We have some community news to start with.

02:53.060 --> 02:57.040
And I don't know what's going on here, so I just wanted to have an open conversation

02:57.040 --> 03:04.080
in the show, because I bet a lot of you have seen the recent news about Steam data.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.280
It appears that Linux market share has slid badly over the holiday period.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.840
And one of the reasons I wanted to talk about this is because the numbers are so dramatic,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.840
it's going to kind of make its rounds.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.040
And I think we can explain what's happening.

03:18.040 --> 03:23.320
Steam published their annual, or no, monthly, whatever it is, their frequent survey that

03:23.320 --> 03:27.360
I never seem to get ever, ever on my Linux box.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.760
Have you ever gotten a Steam hardware survey, Wes?

03:30.760 --> 03:32.760
Actually for the first time ever this year.

03:32.760 --> 03:36.800
I mean, I've gotten it a ton of times on my Windows gaming box that I seldom mention,

03:36.800 --> 03:39.560
but on all the Linux ones, no, never, except this one.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.120
So I was glad, and of course, I immediately filled it out.

03:42.120 --> 03:46.840
Yeah, well, so I think maybe once ever in all of the years, but according to the published

03:46.840 --> 03:51.240
numbers from Valve, this came out on January 1st, so it was like a real kick in the stomach

03:51.240 --> 03:56.880
at the beginning of the year, the Linux market share on Steam had a pretty significant drop.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.560
It was just 0.5%.

03:59.560 --> 04:01.920
We were hoping to get to 1% soon.

04:01.920 --> 04:06.400
It was a drop of 0.33%, which is pretty major in these numbers.

04:06.400 --> 04:12.520
And Windows picked up a pretty decent market share, just over 1.6% additional market share.

04:12.520 --> 04:18.720
Mac OS didn't do so well either, but the first round of numbers out of Valve looked kind

04:18.720 --> 04:21.640
of devastating just because, you know, over the holiday period, you hope more people are

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
playing video games.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.840
Yeah, and there's been some updates there, Valve's updated those numbers, but they still

04:25.840 --> 04:29.280
point to Linux regressing, really doesn't look great.

04:29.280 --> 04:35.000
After being at 0.9% for the month of November, Valve's revised December 2020 numbers, put

04:35.000 --> 04:42.680
the Linux gaming market share at 0.74%, or a drop of 0.16%.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.680
Yikes.

04:43.680 --> 04:49.200
Yeah, so not as significant, but still not good, and kind of hard to understand when

04:49.200 --> 04:52.800
Proton is making it possible to play more games than ever.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.400
The library of available Linux games is greater than it's ever been, and the compatibility

04:57.400 --> 04:59.400
is greater than it's ever been.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.280
But I think you have to consider, I could be wrong because who really knows here, but

05:03.280 --> 05:10.080
you have to consider Cyberpunk 2077 came out around the time that the survey was conducted.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.680
That is true, yeah.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.640
And I think, although people could confirm in the chat room, but I'm pretty sure that

05:15.640 --> 05:19.000
you're more likely to get the survey on a new install.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.600
So perhaps people were setting up Windows 10 machines or reloading Steam after not having

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
it for a while.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.360
Oh, that is interesting, you know, I did get mine on a fresh Pop OS setup for gaming that

05:28.360 --> 05:29.360
I recently set up.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.360
Hmm.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.360
Mm hmm.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.360
Mm hmm.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.400
There's an increase in Chinese users that are running pirated versions of Windows 10

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
on Steam.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.400
So that makes a difference as well.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
I'm not kidding.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.020
That's actually one of the one of the things that's been attributed in here.

05:42.020 --> 05:45.460
And then you have to kind of just think that just increased usage in general.

05:45.460 --> 05:50.440
So people that maybe weren't normally online, but are on Windows came online to play Cyberpunk

05:50.440 --> 05:51.440
2077.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.000
I mean, it was the most hyped game of the year.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.100
Well, and even just over the holiday periods, I know I've seen some friends I don't always

05:57.100 --> 06:01.200
or even frequently see on Steam suddenly popping back up with, you know, a little time over

06:01.200 --> 06:04.040
the holidays to boot their Windows box back up.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
100%.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
Same here, Wes.

06:06.040 --> 06:10.320
You know, I'm on Steam a couple of times a week at the most really just to play games

06:10.320 --> 06:12.160
with my kids.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.320
And I see more people on there than ever playing Cyberpunk and other games right now.

06:16.320 --> 06:21.680
I've been trying it out on Stadia, figured put my Stadia subscription to use.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.960
And I've been playing it on the Koda radio pre show for about three weeks straight.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.520
And it's been fine, you know, just fine, really.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.800
Stadia has actually done a pretty decent job.

06:32.800 --> 06:37.000
You're almost making me want to check Stadia out again, just because I mean, I'm not probably

06:37.000 --> 06:42.440
not going to build a rig just right now for Cyberpunk, but I could play it on Stadia.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.440
No problem.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.040
Yeah, especially if you can get like a Stadia credit like I had or something.

06:46.040 --> 06:49.480
So you're not paying full price for the game, because remember, you can't use it off of

06:49.480 --> 06:50.480
Stadia.

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
Right.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.480
Oh, yeah.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
Yeah.

06:53.480 --> 06:58.120
But yeah, so as things now point, it looks like the Linux market percentage on Steam

06:58.120 --> 07:01.480
is around 0.74%.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.680
So we were at, we were really close to 1%.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.920
We've now slid back to 0.74%.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.800
And Mac OS is at 2.74%.

07:08.800 --> 07:16.480
And Windows 96.51%.

07:16.480 --> 07:17.880
We're coming for you, Windows.

07:17.880 --> 07:18.880
We are.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.680
And it does make me wonder, how do the folks over at Valve actually view this?

07:22.680 --> 07:25.780
You know, because we're looking at it from one direction, surely there's a bunch of folks

07:25.780 --> 07:30.400
over in the, you know, Windows gaming camp laughing at us as usual.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.400
But it doesn't seem like Valve has really slacked off on continuing to build and work

07:34.400 --> 07:36.120
on Proton and continue those things.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.880
I just hope that, you know, some of the folks there internally get the sense that I think

07:40.880 --> 07:44.600
we've had on the show and in the community that it's a better time than ever to be a

07:44.600 --> 07:45.600
Linux gamer.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.480
I'm gaming way more than I have in like the past five years.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.040
And I just hope that momentum continues.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.160
Great points all around.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.740
I'm gaming more on Linux than I ever have in a while too.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.280
My kids are as well.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.160
And I think your point is well taken.

07:59.160 --> 08:03.440
The reason why we care about this number, even though it is, I mean, let's be honest,

08:03.440 --> 08:06.880
it's a rather insignificant number, I think maybe that's why we care about it so much

08:06.880 --> 08:13.420
is it clearly has made such a difference that Valve has invested as much as it has into

08:13.420 --> 08:15.240
gaming on Linux.

08:15.240 --> 08:20.120
And we are trying to understand the logic, justification and likelihood that it will

08:20.120 --> 08:21.120
continue.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.800
That's what we're doing here with these numbers.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.960
That's the conversation that's not being had is we are just trying to piece together what

08:26.960 --> 08:30.540
is Valve's motivation here and my God, will they please keep doing it?

08:30.540 --> 08:35.640
And if these numbers go the wrong way, I think the unspoken worry here is that Valve will

08:35.640 --> 08:43.820
just give up and say, Jesus, look at this 96.5% of our user base is on Windows.

08:43.820 --> 08:44.940
We're kidding ourselves here.

08:44.940 --> 08:46.840
They never built that store that put us out of business.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
Right.

08:47.840 --> 08:51.080
You got to hope that, you know, Gabe's involved in that there's not some bean counters somewhere

08:51.080 --> 08:54.720
that looks at that and then looks at the amount they're spending on engineers or contracts

08:54.720 --> 08:57.560
working on it and say, this doesn't add up.

08:57.560 --> 09:02.680
And Eric, you're pointing out that they could do a better job at just answering some of

09:02.680 --> 09:04.680
these questions around how the survey works.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.440
Yeah, I've always been kind of frustrated when you see these surveys out there.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.760
But I did like Knochel's approach back when Will Cook was on the desktop team and they

09:12.760 --> 09:17.200
did that nice blog post on kind of the metrics that they got at a glance.

09:17.200 --> 09:22.960
But as a numbers guy, I do wish there was a bit more information on how they exactly

09:22.960 --> 09:27.040
identify which, say, Linux user they send the survey to.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.640
Like you said, Chris, you didn't get one forever, it seems like.

09:30.640 --> 09:35.160
I mean, what's their policy or what's their procedures around that?

09:35.160 --> 09:36.400
It just would be nice to know.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.400
Yeah.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.200
And it's definitely not just if it's a new install or not, because I install Steam on

09:42.200 --> 09:45.000
just about every laptop or machine I review.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.840
And that's about one a month or somewhere around there, right?

09:47.840 --> 09:51.440
And I'm doing that 12 times a year, and I'm still not getting the survey.

09:51.440 --> 09:55.200
So yeah, I agree, Eric.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.200
Some transparency there.

09:56.200 --> 10:00.640
We at least have to answer some questions about how that all works.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.100
All right.

10:02.100 --> 10:05.080
We can probably cover the rest of that if you guys have any other comments from the

10:05.080 --> 10:11.120
Mumble Room in the post show, because I think people probably care more about this next

10:11.120 --> 10:12.720
story to tell you the truth.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.680
Because I got fired up when I read this.

10:14.680 --> 10:20.880
I agree with Linus, ECC RAM matters, error correcting code memory.

10:20.880 --> 10:26.560
And he says it quote, absolutely matters in a fun holiday mailing thread.

10:26.560 --> 10:32.360
As ever, Linus was happy to share a little more detail around his opinions and said that

10:32.360 --> 10:38.520
Intel has been instrumental in killing the whole ECC industry with its horribly bad market

10:38.520 --> 10:39.520
segmentation.

10:39.520 --> 10:44.640
Intel has been detrimental to the whole industry into users because of their bad and misguided

10:44.640 --> 10:47.720
policies with respect to ECC.

10:47.720 --> 10:54.000
Seriously, the arguments against ECC were always complete and utter garbage.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.240
Now even the memory manufacturers are starting to do ECC internally, because they finally

11:00.240 --> 11:04.280
owned up to the fact that they absolutely have to.

11:04.280 --> 11:10.040
And the menu memory manufacturers claim it's because of economics and the lower power.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.880
But they are lying bastards.

11:12.880 --> 11:18.320
Let me once again point out Row Hammer and how these problems have existed for several

11:18.320 --> 11:20.780
generations already.

11:20.780 --> 11:26.840
But these effers happily sold broken hardware to consumers and claimed it was an attack

11:26.840 --> 11:30.760
when it was always just we're cutting corners.

11:30.760 --> 11:35.120
Man, this is a classic brutal Linus take down.

11:35.120 --> 11:40.120
He went on to say in this rather lengthy post, the modern DRAM is so reliable that it doesn't

11:40.120 --> 11:47.400
need ECC was always a bedtime story for children that have been dropped on their heads a bit

11:47.400 --> 11:48.400
too many times.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.040
Yeah, I'm pissed about it.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.400
You can find me complaining about this literally for decades now.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.800
I don't want to say I was right.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.360
I just want this fixed and I want ECC.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.360
AMD did it.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.360
Intel didn't.

12:01.360 --> 12:09.560
Wow, man, like I thought, OK, here's what I really liked about why this happened is

12:09.560 --> 12:16.560
I thought I was the jerk that was just going on about ECC all the time and that it really

12:16.560 --> 12:21.400
was just like in my head that my systems with ECC were way better because obviously, if

12:21.400 --> 12:27.000
ECC RAM actually made your system more stable, this is what I thought, obviously, if that

12:27.000 --> 12:29.520
actually worked, it would be everywhere.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.880
It'd be in our phones.

12:30.880 --> 12:31.880
It'd be in our desktops.

12:31.880 --> 12:32.880
Right.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.880
Here's this better way to do it.

12:34.880 --> 12:35.880
Why are we doing it?

12:35.880 --> 12:39.960
But I always like, gosh, you know, I've had workstation desktop workstation machines and

12:39.960 --> 12:45.160
servers with ECC RAM, and I've had lots of desktops and laptops and even servers that

12:45.160 --> 12:47.320
don't have ECC RAM.

12:47.320 --> 12:51.880
And unquestionably, in my personal hands-on experience, those systems with error correcting

12:51.880 --> 12:54.720
code are more reliable.

12:54.720 --> 12:59.560
I like this reminder of Linus's deep hardware background and interest here.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.520
And the whole history is kind of interesting.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.320
I know there was a lot of stuff being discussed around Google's rise as suddenly the data

13:06.320 --> 13:11.240
center was taken over by, you know, just cheap Intel boxes and some of these bigger companies

13:11.240 --> 13:15.760
just sort of trying to handle all these corrections in software and sort of preaching like, look,

13:15.760 --> 13:17.560
you can save on your hardware budgets.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.640
Don't bother with the fancy ECC stuff.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.520
You know, just make sure you've got redundant calculations and that you're handling these

13:22.520 --> 13:25.080
sorts of sometimes failures in software.

13:25.080 --> 13:31.240
But especially these days, it just seems like if we need our computers to work right, security

13:31.240 --> 13:33.160
is more important than ever.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.520
Everything's interconnected and online.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.640
And we've already solved this, right?

13:36.640 --> 13:39.800
I mean, why can't you just buy it for the machine that you want to run your software

13:39.800 --> 13:40.800
on?

13:40.800 --> 13:41.800
Yeah.

13:41.800 --> 13:48.440
And it also, I think, really gives us kind of insight into some of the blame that Linus

13:48.440 --> 13:52.720
puts on Intel for harming the industry.

13:52.720 --> 13:58.520
You and I were just doing a review of a lot of the stories for 2020 on the latest Linux

13:58.520 --> 13:59.920
Action News.

13:59.920 --> 14:05.120
And when we were going through those, you see several times where Linus is pinning something

14:05.120 --> 14:06.560
directly on Intel.

14:06.560 --> 14:11.440
And I think you might agree, although I'd be curious if you don't, when you kind of

14:11.440 --> 14:16.860
go through what Linus has said about Intel over 2020 chronologically, the more the year

14:16.860 --> 14:20.400
goes on, the more hostile towards Intel he seems to be getting.

14:20.400 --> 14:25.400
And then you start to see even Greg Kh starting to take shots at Intel as the year wraps up.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.400
Oh, yeah.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
No, I definitely think that's true.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.840
And it's interesting because obviously they've got, you know, a long history, both in the

14:31.840 --> 14:35.640
industry at large and, of course, just working together because Intel's, you know, contributes

14:35.640 --> 14:39.620
a whole bunch of great open source work to the kernel and to the Linux and open source

14:39.620 --> 14:42.120
community generally.

14:42.120 --> 14:47.400
But I think we're all really starting to feel some of their missteps that they really aren't

14:47.400 --> 14:50.640
on a solid course or at least haven't been.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.640
Yeah.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.640
Yep.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.640
And that's starting to hurt.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.840
I know we have AMD, but it's interesting times ahead for Intel.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.920
It's clear that the pressure is on like never before.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.120
So you have Linus laying this pressure down.

15:02.120 --> 15:08.040
He even goes on later in the post to compliment and commend AMD for their more broad support

15:08.040 --> 15:11.400
of ECC RAM, even on consumer desktop hardware.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.900
You have Apple, of course, with the M1 chip.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.420
Even RISC-V applies pressure.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.200
You have all of these pressures that are getting applied.

15:18.200 --> 15:23.680
And then you bring in AMD, who is compatible with the x86 platform.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.160
It's a tremendous amount of pressure.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.640
You have to figure something's going to give.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.080
It'll be interesting to watch anyway.

15:29.080 --> 15:35.440
I mean, there's even more pressure from like investment advisors and capital groups who

15:35.440 --> 15:39.200
maybe even are pushing for Intel to sort of abandon their own system of having their own

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
fabs.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.080
Now, I don't know that that's going to happen anytime soon, but probably the next two, three

15:44.080 --> 15:47.720
years will be very instructive for what's next.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.200
I have thoughts about where Intel's going right now with their current processors.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
But we'll get to that later.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.400
I'll mention that maybe in a bit in the show.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.640
There's so much really, boy, you look at it from a New Year's perspective.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.080
It's kind of exciting how much is going to, you can tell there's a lot that's going to

16:01.080 --> 16:02.080
shift this year.

16:02.080 --> 16:06.600
It's going to be a big year for this kind of stuff.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.800
lino.com slash unplugged.

16:08.800 --> 16:15.720
Go there to receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account and you support the show.

16:15.720 --> 16:19.720
And $100 in like Linode terms is a lot.

16:19.720 --> 16:24.400
You can really build out some significant cool projects, try things out, do a test migration

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
of Nextcloud.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.240
I mean, you name it.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.520
We right now are using Linode for everything.

16:30.520 --> 16:35.160
The show notes now that we're doing this on, we've recently spun up, thanks to Alex's help,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.780
a new instance of HedgeDock.

16:37.780 --> 16:40.160
If you're not familiar with that, it used to be called Code EMD.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.200
It's a real-time markdown collaboration tool.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.200
Just dominates.

16:44.200 --> 16:49.560
Anything like Google Docs, if you're doing real-time markdown collaboration.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.440
And you can self-host it on Linode in seconds.

16:51.440 --> 16:54.760
Just get started by going to linode.com slash unplugged.

16:54.760 --> 16:59.080
You know, I was just looking at our Matrix server that we have on Linode.

16:59.080 --> 17:03.260
And Matrix is an interesting use case because there's some scenarios, like when a user connects

17:03.260 --> 17:11.040
that has a lot of rooms and stuff, that initial login can put a significant load on the Matrix

17:11.040 --> 17:12.040
server, Synapse.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.040
Yeah, there's some work to do over there.

17:14.040 --> 17:19.400
I'm just reviewing the CPU usage from the last few days.

17:19.400 --> 17:24.320
You can even see as the shows are live, the things spin up, the disk I.O. rate spins up.

17:24.320 --> 17:30.280
The way Linode makes it possible to view all of this in their dashboard is really, really

17:30.280 --> 17:31.280
smart.

17:31.280 --> 17:34.000
It's laid out in a way where you get all the information you need right away.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.240
So it's kind of in these sections.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.640
The first section up on the screen, and by the way, it's all beautifully designed.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.320
But the first section up's like, it's your details you need to know.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.320
How many cores?

17:42.320 --> 17:43.320
How much RAM?

17:43.320 --> 17:45.240
What's your IP?

17:45.240 --> 17:46.920
And what's your SSH access?

17:46.920 --> 17:51.200
Like you hit this button, copy it to your pasteboard, copy it to your clipboard, and

17:51.200 --> 17:53.760
log right in using this.

17:53.760 --> 17:58.720
And then you scroll down and you get all of the CPU and disk and network information.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.880
And we actually get a fair amount of IPv6 traffic too, but nothing like we do on the

18:02.880 --> 18:05.760
IPv4 side.

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
But you get all of this.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.720
And I can see, you know what, we're doing really well.

18:08.720 --> 18:13.040
We've proportioned this when this system burst during the start of a live stream.

18:13.040 --> 18:19.760
We're getting up there in usage, 85%, maybe 90% on a really busy day, but we're not maxing

18:19.760 --> 18:20.760
this box out.

18:20.760 --> 18:25.180
And I can tell that, yep, we have specced this one just right for what we're doing.

18:25.180 --> 18:31.040
And it makes it so simple to see that or add storage or tweak things or do backups, which

18:31.040 --> 18:36.640
again, because this is a community server, as a responsibility to our community, we want

18:36.640 --> 18:40.420
to make sure that we have a backup of this thing if something goes wrong.

18:40.420 --> 18:44.840
So I can go over to the backup tab and I can see, yeah, three minutes and 17 seconds ago,

18:44.840 --> 18:47.140
there was a backup.

18:47.140 --> 18:48.200
It's really great.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.940
You can also take manual snapshots, like we might do that before a big matrix upgrade.

18:52.940 --> 18:56.760
There's all kinds of things you can do through the dashboard that make managing a cloud server

18:56.760 --> 18:59.000
really simple, even if you're not an expert.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.120
And if you are an expert, things are just a click away to really take it to the next

19:02.120 --> 19:03.120
level.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.800
And the node costs 30% to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or

19:07.800 --> 19:08.800
Azure.

19:08.800 --> 19:14.000
So it's a nice balance of technology for the price with the optimal machines, SSD storage,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.720
40 gigabit connections, 11 data centers all over the world.

19:18.720 --> 19:23.220
And they're true Linux users, like as a company, like they're fans of Linux and God, I just

19:23.220 --> 19:24.600
love that about them too.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.280
And they're independently owned.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.540
They've been around forever.

19:29.540 --> 19:32.040
They started three years before AWS.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.360
They're independent and they're the largest independent cloud provider.

19:35.360 --> 19:42.200
So go check them out at linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100 credit, support the show.

19:42.200 --> 19:46.360
And it lets Linode know that, yeah, we're getting some investment when we support open

19:46.360 --> 19:49.860
source media, when we support independent media, and they can then turn around and make

19:49.860 --> 19:50.920
that for free.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.740
We get a return on that investment and everybody wins.

19:53.740 --> 20:00.220
So thanks for supporting our sponsors, linode.com slash unplugged.

20:00.220 --> 20:04.280
So I have a story in here that I think at first pass.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.900
It's like, why is this on Linux Unplugged?

20:06.900 --> 20:11.920
Because the story headline is Microsoft is building a new Outlook app for Windows and

20:11.920 --> 20:15.240
the Mac powered by web technologies.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.880
Chris, this is a Linux show.

20:17.880 --> 20:18.880
You know that, right?

20:18.880 --> 20:19.880
Right.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.900
And you know what's also funny is how the tech press doesn't know what this stuff is.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.480
They don't just say electron, right?

20:25.480 --> 20:27.840
This is windowscentral.com.

20:27.840 --> 20:29.100
Microsoft owns electron.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.760
Why not just say they're going to use electron?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.880
Why say web technologies?

20:32.880 --> 20:36.320
But the idea is that they're going to build a universal Outlook client for Windows and

20:36.320 --> 20:40.520
Mac as far as the press calls it, that also replaces the default mail and calendar apps

20:40.520 --> 20:42.240
on Windows 10 when it's ready.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.520
That's how far they're going to go.

20:43.520 --> 20:49.580
The new project is codenamed Monarch, and it's based already on the Outlook web app.

20:49.580 --> 20:55.840
So if you're familiar with Outlook web app, which I am roughly familiar with, that's essentially

20:55.840 --> 20:56.840
what it's going to be.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.840
Yeah.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.060
And I mean, this kind of makes sense.

20:59.060 --> 21:04.240
Outlook Monarch is basically the end goal for Microsoft's one Outlook vision, which

21:04.240 --> 21:10.000
aims to build a single Outlook client that works across the PC, Mac and the web.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.640
They really just want to replace existing desktop clients with just one app built with

21:14.640 --> 21:19.480
the same technologies that they already have to use to leverage those web versions.

21:19.480 --> 21:23.020
And I don't know about you, but even on the platforms I have that have that native Outlook

21:23.020 --> 21:25.800
app, I end up just using the web one anyway.

21:25.800 --> 21:30.240
Yeah, it is a lot better than the battle days of Exchange.

21:30.240 --> 21:35.120
It's gotten a lot better, and it works just fine on Linux in a browser.

21:35.120 --> 21:40.240
Microsoft told Zach at Windows Central that they will do native integrations where possible.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.840
They're going to try to make it feel like a native application, look like a native application,

21:43.840 --> 21:47.720
offer offline storage, notifications and more.

21:47.720 --> 21:53.080
But you have to figure, like they are doing now with some of their other applications,

21:53.080 --> 21:58.200
VS Code, which is also an Electron app, they're probably going to release the sucker for Linux

21:58.200 --> 21:59.480
too.

21:59.480 --> 22:05.480
And I think it will totally freaking dominate on Linux when they do.

22:05.480 --> 22:11.640
I think it will destroy the Thunderbird market share for anyone who's in a corporate environment

22:11.640 --> 22:17.040
that needs solid calendar integration with the rest of the company, be it Google Apps,

22:17.040 --> 22:20.860
Microsoft Exchange, Office 365, whatever it might be.

22:20.860 --> 22:26.000
If you are in the corporate world, and I think this even applies to you, Wes, imagine if

22:26.000 --> 22:31.480
you could have an Outlook client that ties in perfectly with the day job, it does good

22:31.480 --> 22:34.920
with the reminders that you can accept meeting invites, you can create meeting invites, you

22:34.920 --> 22:40.400
get the directory, everything works as a full-fledged client like your coworkers on Windows and

22:40.400 --> 22:43.360
Mac, you'd probably be compelled to use that.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.080
Yeah, I definitely would, especially if you've got some of those nicer features.

22:47.080 --> 22:51.080
The web version works well enough, but yeah, there's some nice desktop integrations you

22:51.080 --> 22:53.840
get if you go the full Electron route.

22:53.840 --> 22:54.840
Yes.

22:54.840 --> 22:58.920
And I have a ton of old school nostalgia love for Thunderbird.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.440
I still think it's a great personal email client.

23:01.440 --> 23:02.520
I have it installed.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.520
I have it.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.520
Totally agree.

23:04.520 --> 23:08.080
I like that's like all the family like, happy holidays and Merry Christmas emails that I

23:08.080 --> 23:12.900
sent out, did them all from Thunderbird, you know, connected to my Gmail account.

23:12.900 --> 23:20.680
That's great, but for the two years that I was an employee at a company that had lots

23:20.680 --> 23:25.840
of meetings and did everything by calendar, it was a big part of the company culture,

23:25.840 --> 23:31.440
I spent that entire two years struggling on a daily basis trying to make things work.

23:31.440 --> 23:38.480
I tried MailSpring, I tried applications that house web apps inside a giant local application.

23:38.480 --> 23:45.880
I tried Kmail, Thunderbird, Evolution, Geary, everything, MailSpring got abandoned, which

23:45.880 --> 23:50.040
was already a mail Electron app that sort of had the best integration and made it really

23:50.040 --> 23:53.760
easy to work with calendar invites, but MailSpring was abandoned.

23:53.760 --> 24:01.940
And to this day, I've just kind of resigned to using the Google Gmail web app whenever

24:01.940 --> 24:07.840
I am working on any kind of serious correspondence, even just serious correspondence and where

24:07.840 --> 24:11.320
I want my address book and I want calendar abilities and all of that, I just use the

24:11.320 --> 24:12.320
web app.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.320
Yeah.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.320
Same here, right?

24:14.320 --> 24:15.320
I mean, the web email, basically.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.320
Yeah.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.480
And I pine for a local email client.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.120
I prefer local email.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.560
I prefer a local window.

24:23.560 --> 24:28.040
I like actually having as few applications in my browser as possible.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.680
And I would absolutely give this a try.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.760
I'm at that point.

24:32.760 --> 24:37.040
I wonder, too, if this might be, you know, just one more bolster sort of to reassure

24:37.040 --> 24:41.080
corporate IT departments, you know, sure, like you can have your Linux desktop maybe

24:41.080 --> 24:45.280
and you've gotten some special permission or you've just set it up without asking.

24:45.280 --> 24:48.760
But suddenly, one weird thing doesn't work and they're like, well, you know, we were

24:48.760 --> 24:52.360
tested just fine in the desktop app on Windows and Mac and I don't know what your problem

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
is.

24:53.360 --> 24:56.840
But if suddenly there is this, you know, single blessed web powered version and it runs on

24:56.840 --> 25:02.580
Linux, I mean, I remember less of four years ago and I had to run Windows VM just for Outlook

25:02.580 --> 25:07.280
integration because there was some stuff that OWA still couldn't do.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.800
That future, I mean, that looks like we're way beyond this.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.520
I bought every version of Crossover Office.

25:13.520 --> 25:19.240
I bought every release of Xandros OS, which was a Debian based KDE desktop environment

25:19.240 --> 25:27.240
that shipped Crossover integrated so you could even put the Office 98 or whatever it was,

25:27.240 --> 25:33.040
2003, probably into the CD-ROM drive and it would even recognize the autostart file and

25:33.040 --> 25:35.000
just give you the full install experience.

25:35.000 --> 25:40.380
But think about this Wes, for better or for worse, think about the complete picture once

25:40.380 --> 25:47.000
Outlook is released, Fedora and Ubuntu out of the box during the installation offer Active

25:47.000 --> 25:49.040
Directory integration.

25:49.040 --> 25:53.600
You log in, you've got Microsoft Edge to browse your corporate intranet.

25:53.600 --> 25:58.160
You've got Microsoft Teams to do all of your team collaboration Slack style chat.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.320
You've got Microsoft Outlook to do all of your corporate email correspondence.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.580
You see where I'm going with this, VS Code, et cetera.

26:05.580 --> 26:07.020
Don't forget.NET Core, right?

26:07.020 --> 26:08.160
That's available too.

26:08.160 --> 26:12.640
And let's be honest, they're not going to stop with Outlook.

26:12.640 --> 26:17.160
Microsoft didn't add Electron to their arsenal of technologies that they own so that way

26:17.160 --> 26:20.920
they could just let it piss off in the corner.

26:20.920 --> 26:24.800
They're starting with Outlook because Outlook is the high bar.

26:24.800 --> 26:29.200
They're starting high and they're going to knock out Outlook and they're coming for Word,

26:29.200 --> 26:32.720
they're coming for Excel, they're coming for PowerPoint, they're coming for the entire

26:32.720 --> 26:37.240
Office 365 suite, which are already web apps.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.520
And then they're going to ship them on Linux.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.520
It's interesting too.

26:40.520 --> 26:45.800
It does sort of seem like it's a more reinforcement that the Windows side of the house really

26:45.800 --> 26:51.760
is no longer the dominant, you know, tastemaker internally because they've clearly aligned

26:51.760 --> 26:56.720
to the goal of like, we just want to get our stuff in the hands of as many people as possible,

26:56.720 --> 26:59.680
regardless of if they have to use our other platform.

26:59.680 --> 27:04.480
It's pretty wild to see this coming and it may not be until the end of the year until

27:04.480 --> 27:06.080
we really see anything materialized.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.640
And then it may be a while after that before we see the Linux support.

27:09.640 --> 27:15.300
Just like with Edge, I wouldn't be surprised that if Microsoft takes the approach of they

27:15.300 --> 27:20.440
focus on the Mac and Windows versions first because it's a narrower problem scope.

27:20.440 --> 27:24.320
And then once they have those shipping, they begin working on a Linux alpha and beta.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.320
Yes.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.600
And I mean, the same thing happened with Teams.

27:26.600 --> 27:29.200
It was quite some time before the Linux version came out.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.880
But hey, now it's here and seems to be working pretty darn well.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.560
Oh, live update from Popey in the IRC.

27:34.560 --> 27:38.000
He just checked around on their GitHub and it looks like the developer popped up 20 days

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
ago for Mailspring.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.840
Oh, thank goodness.

27:40.840 --> 27:41.840
So I'll be looking into that.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.720
So maybe Mailspring is still alive.

27:43.720 --> 27:49.160
It may save me yet from an outlook future, but yeah, they're not going to have anything

27:49.160 --> 27:54.440
until like maybe even 2022 is when you may actually see it start replacing the apps.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.680
They may have like an early version build client that you can get on Windows or Mac

27:58.680 --> 28:02.960
by the end of this year, but replacing the default application on the Windows desktop,

28:02.960 --> 28:03.960
that's a 2022 thing.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.880
So it's going to be a bit and the Linux beta will be somewhere in there, right?

28:07.880 --> 28:08.960
We shall see.

28:08.960 --> 28:10.520
We shall see.

28:10.520 --> 28:15.200
There's also just a couple of community things we want to touch on before we move on.

28:15.200 --> 28:22.360
Number one is Fosdom, which is a pretty significant conference every single year, Europe's largest

28:22.360 --> 28:24.360
free and open source conference.

28:24.360 --> 28:29.240
Thousands of people, I think last year it was nearly 9,000 people, take over a campus

28:29.240 --> 28:35.760
in Belgium for a weekend and turn it into quite the event, 800 talks, 50 tracks, hundreds

28:35.760 --> 28:36.760
of exhibitors.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.700
It's really intense.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.560
It's like I guess the most intense of all of them.

28:40.560 --> 28:45.560
I've always wanted to go and maybe this year I can because it looks like the Matrix project

28:45.560 --> 28:51.840
reached out to them and said, hey, we know you want to be virtual for February of 2021.

28:51.840 --> 28:54.000
I think we can facilitate that.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Isn't that interesting?

28:55.000 --> 29:00.960
I mean, Matrix has all kinds of great technology under the hood to make this happen and well,

29:00.960 --> 29:06.320
you know, thankfully Fosdom 2020 snuck in just a few weeks before this whole pandemic

29:06.320 --> 29:09.080
really got into full swing.

29:09.080 --> 29:14.560
Of course, with Fosdom 2021 happening just in February, this upcoming February, you got

29:14.560 --> 29:16.320
to start figuring this out right now.

29:16.320 --> 29:22.760
I don't think we're going to be in any state to, you know, do an in-person one yet.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.520
So they just have to start planning for it.

29:24.520 --> 29:27.880
But Matrix, Wes, I mean, it's brilliant, right?

29:27.880 --> 29:29.200
It's an open protocol.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.360
There's something great about that for an open source conference like Fosdom, but the

29:33.360 --> 29:39.020
video stuff and all of that is really still early on Matrix and really Elements the only

29:39.020 --> 29:42.280
client that has the most complete implementation right now.

29:42.280 --> 29:47.260
Yeah, I suppose in one sense, maybe that's risky or we'll see what parts all get adopted,

29:47.260 --> 29:48.720
how far the integration goes.

29:48.720 --> 29:52.680
But on the other side, that might be a really good sort of dogfooding stress test for some

29:52.680 --> 29:54.120
of those technologies.

29:54.120 --> 29:59.400
The other part that I like about this is it seems like more and more of the Matrix team,

29:59.400 --> 30:02.540
they're reaching out, they're pushing Matrix, they're trying to get it into places that

30:02.540 --> 30:05.880
make sense, whether that's, you know, various government things that are looking for protocols

30:05.880 --> 30:08.560
or open source conferences.

30:08.560 --> 30:12.160
And I both like that as a way to build Matrix.

30:12.160 --> 30:17.160
But I think it also speaks well to just the project structure and internal organization

30:17.160 --> 30:18.920
and they know they've got time for this.

30:18.920 --> 30:23.760
This is something they can take on and actively continue to develop Matrix.

30:23.760 --> 30:25.600
So it's just a good sign to me.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.960
Yeah, and I'll push forward certain things in Matrix.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.400
It looks like they're going to use a good helping of Jitsi in here to handle some of

30:31.400 --> 30:33.040
the video heavy lifting.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.040
Of course.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
That's brilliant.

30:35.040 --> 30:42.540
So what you're going to see from this is a notch up in the network effect of Matrix.

30:42.540 --> 30:46.600
And that I'm particularly excited about because I think you're going to see several projects

30:46.600 --> 30:52.240
over this next year switch their chat and collaboration infrastructure over to Matrix.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.440
There's some that are in conversations about doing it right now.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.520
That's going to increase the amount of Matrix users.

30:57.520 --> 31:02.280
An event like FOSDEM taking place on Matrix, that's going to increase the number of Matrix

31:02.280 --> 31:03.280
users.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.800
And we're going to start to see this network effect where something that's based on an

31:06.800 --> 31:13.440
open standard that has open source implementations that is really kind of this next generation

31:13.440 --> 31:19.680
protocol for the web or its own layer on the internet, it's going to have more users now.

31:19.680 --> 31:23.560
And that's going to be a net win for free software just in general.

31:23.560 --> 31:29.120
So by FOSDEM doing this, I actually think the contribution is more significant than

31:29.120 --> 31:30.380
just their event.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.720
It's actually fairly significant.

31:31.720 --> 31:36.220
And even if the effect just has the Matrix team and the element team work a little bit

31:36.220 --> 31:40.100
harder in more of a sprint style to get ready for February to have some of these features

31:40.100 --> 31:46.520
more polished, even that is a great net benefit for all of us.

31:46.520 --> 31:54.080
And then last, rounding out the community news, just a brief mention that KDE Plasma 5.20.5

31:54.080 --> 31:55.720
shipped today.

31:55.720 --> 32:01.080
And it's just a real nice polishing of the 5.20 series.

32:01.080 --> 32:05.800
And this is, I think, a great indicator of the stage that the Plasma project is in right

32:05.800 --> 32:07.120
now.

32:07.120 --> 32:10.600
They announced today as we're recording this release, and it just fixes for visual glitches

32:10.600 --> 32:18.560
that maybe impacted GTK3 apps or System Tray had an arrow problem that was hiding some

32:18.560 --> 32:19.560
things.

32:19.560 --> 32:24.040
And the one that is the most significant that drove me fricking batty, and I'm very happy

32:24.040 --> 32:29.480
to see it patched, is there was an issue with the Plasma Network Manager applet that would

32:29.480 --> 32:30.980
jump to a different network.

32:30.980 --> 32:35.360
So as you're searching and it's finding the networks of Wi-Fi networks, you click Connect

32:35.360 --> 32:40.640
and start entering the password, and then it jumps and the connect registers for a different

32:40.640 --> 32:41.760
wireless network.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.140
And then you go through it over and over again.

32:44.140 --> 32:45.400
It was infuriating.

32:45.400 --> 32:48.960
And it actually struck me while using OpenSUSE of Tumbleweed, and at first I thought it was

32:48.960 --> 32:53.040
some weird bug, but I quickly figured out it was a Plasma thing.

32:53.040 --> 32:57.600
So nice to see that fixed, because if you've been using recent Plasma and you've run into

32:57.600 --> 32:59.600
that, you know how painful that was.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.520
It was really bad.

33:01.520 --> 33:06.960
I was also pretty pleased to see better support for WebRTC-powered meetings and screencast

33:06.960 --> 33:11.200
and stuff like that if you're using the Plasma Wayland session, which I know not a whole

33:11.200 --> 33:14.720
bunch of people are, but it's exactly the kind of thing that needs to get solved if

33:14.720 --> 33:16.760
we're going to have more Plasma Wayland adoption.

33:16.760 --> 33:21.520
Yeah, if you're using Plasma for your day job and you're on Wayland, you sometimes need

33:21.520 --> 33:24.000
to participate in meetings where you're sharing your screen.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.560
And so to see that kind of stuff get plumbed in is really nice.

33:27.560 --> 33:35.040
So 5.21, so the next big release of Plasma, which is scheduled for February, has a new

33:35.040 --> 33:37.280
system monitor app in it.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.480
And I gave it a go because it's available already for some distributions.

33:40.480 --> 33:44.400
It's just Plasma System Monitor, and it's going to replace ksysguard.

33:44.400 --> 33:49.840
Now these are the tools that let you look at memory usage, process usage, CPU usage

33:49.840 --> 33:55.280
on the Plasma desktop, sort of like akin to Task Manager on Windows.

33:55.280 --> 33:58.680
And it's getting a really nice upgrade in Plasma.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.960
I'll leave the link in the show notes for you guys to go check it out, but it's a completely

34:01.960 --> 34:07.040
rewritten UI, and you can now also easily create and edit pages where you can put your

34:07.040 --> 34:11.200
own items on this dashboard, sort of akin to Perfmon on Windows.

34:11.200 --> 34:15.840
Just tons of categories of stuff in there, and you can put a nice heads up display.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.880
It looks good.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.920
And this, in my opinion, Wes, these types of system monitor apps where you get an insight

34:20.920 --> 34:24.200
into what your box is doing, they can never be good enough.

34:24.200 --> 34:27.160
Like there's always more work to be done, and this thing's sharp looking.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.280
Yes, it is.

34:28.280 --> 34:33.160
And actually, as noted by Nate Graham, who we just had on the show in episode 385, notes

34:33.160 --> 34:37.120
that it's been in development for almost two years.

34:37.120 --> 34:42.800
And hopefully, it will eventually replace ksysguard once it's a little more tested out

34:42.800 --> 34:44.040
in the wild.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.680
But for now, it stays independent.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.680
But you're totally right.

34:46.680 --> 34:50.280
I mean, even Windows, they've improved a lot of their resources.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.280
They've got pretty graphs now.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.960
If you want to go just pull up your task manager and check out what your system is doing.

34:54.960 --> 34:59.680
And even though we're going to promote all the next latest top replacement tools in the

34:59.680 --> 35:05.040
shell, of course, or just talk about NetData, I think for users who just, you know, are

35:05.040 --> 35:09.040
into Linux, are starting things up, or just want to have a native app that shows what

35:09.040 --> 35:11.760
their system is doing, it's important that this works well.

35:11.760 --> 35:15.000
Because the kernel in our user space, we have all the tools there.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
It just needs the plumbing and a little bit of prettiness.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.080
All right, we have a spot of housekeeping this week, a few things to mention.

35:25.080 --> 35:27.580
Number one, I just kind of referred to it earlier.

35:27.580 --> 35:32.880
But if you have not yet checked out Linux Action News 170, there was a lot of open source

35:32.880 --> 35:36.200
development in a very crazy 2020.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.180
And we recap some of the standout moments that you should know about.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.960
And there's a few items in there you may have missed.

35:40.960 --> 35:45.640
So it's a great episode to get caught up on some of the things that happened in 2020.

35:45.640 --> 35:51.000
With linuxactionnews.com slash one seven zero.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.660
Also, I'm going to encourage you to check out this week's coder radio episode 395 coder

35:56.660 --> 35:58.240
dot show slash 395.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.160
It's not out as we record yet.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.700
But I've already recorded it with Mike.

36:02.700 --> 36:10.000
And I was sent the XPS 13 developer edition that comes pre installed with Ubuntu.

36:10.000 --> 36:16.520
And it has the 11th gen Intel CPU with XE graphics.

36:16.520 --> 36:20.660
And I think you're going to be really surprised by my review of that laptop.

36:20.660 --> 36:25.960
And we're going to talk about more specifically the XE graphics aspect in next week's episode.

36:25.960 --> 36:30.260
Wendell from level one techs is scheduled to join us and geek out on the XE graphics

36:30.260 --> 36:31.540
under Linux.

36:31.540 --> 36:36.800
So it'd be good context if you check out coder radio 395 to get an idea of what I was able

36:36.800 --> 36:41.500
to do with that laptop and sort of the situation I find myself in now.

36:41.500 --> 36:46.020
So that'll be coder dot show slash 395 later this week.

36:46.020 --> 36:51.100
And then that brings us to Sunday, where you can join the love plug every single Sunday

36:51.100 --> 36:55.400
at noon Pacific three p.m. Eastern, you can get the mumble information at linux unplug

36:55.400 --> 36:56.540
dot com.

36:56.540 --> 37:00.840
And mini Mac, you wanted to put a word out to an upcoming special love love.

37:00.840 --> 37:01.960
Yes, indeed.

37:01.960 --> 37:06.280
So first, I hope you all had a good start in 2021.

37:06.280 --> 37:11.820
And yeah, we had our first love love meeting for this year last Sunday, and we scheduled

37:11.820 --> 37:14.980
a new recording session.

37:14.980 --> 37:19.780
So the subject will be access accessibility features in Linux.

37:19.780 --> 37:25.280
So we are talking about assistive tools like screen magnifier, screen reader, and so on.

37:25.280 --> 37:30.180
And the recording will most probably be the 24th of January.

37:30.180 --> 37:34.560
We have a community member that would like to share his experience with us.

37:34.560 --> 37:40.000
And he also contacted a special guest whose name I will not yet reveal.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.860
All I can say he is a developer for a well known desktop environment project.

37:45.860 --> 37:51.900
Now what I would like to do is a call for participation for that talk.

37:51.900 --> 37:57.080
If you have some experience with accessibility features in Linux and want to be a speaker

37:57.080 --> 38:02.980
during that talk, please contact me either on IRC, Telegram or matrix.

38:02.980 --> 38:09.460
So just send a message to Minimac or even simpler, just join the next love love session

38:09.460 --> 38:13.280
next Sunday and we can talk about that.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.280
So that's all for me.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.280
Thanks, Chris.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.280
Yeah, great.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.280
That sounds like a fantastic topic.

38:17.280 --> 38:21.480
Again, that's going to be held on the 24th.

38:21.480 --> 38:24.600
And there is a love love matrix channel.

38:24.600 --> 38:28.300
If you'd like to get involved in chat there, you can find our matrix info on the website

38:28.300 --> 38:29.300
as well.

38:29.300 --> 38:38.320
matrix unplugged.com Okay, so after the show last week, Wes and I looked at each other

38:38.320 --> 38:43.440
and said, What are we going to do about open suits?

38:43.440 --> 38:47.520
Because we get a lot of requests into the show to try it out because it's not a distribution

38:47.520 --> 38:51.680
we cover very often because neither one of us run it on the regular.

38:51.680 --> 38:56.640
But we we know there's a lot in the works for open suits over 2021.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.760
And we feel like it was time to check in.

38:59.760 --> 39:05.100
And I am intrigued by the idea that I could throw tumbleweed the rolling release on my

39:05.100 --> 39:06.640
laptop.

39:06.640 --> 39:12.080
And we could do something like leap on the server, which is the more LTS release.

39:12.080 --> 39:13.320
Isn't that a nice thought?

39:13.320 --> 39:17.400
Because there's so much you know, I know we both love arch running that.

39:17.400 --> 39:21.280
But even though we do have a server with arch, we acknowledge that probably you wouldn't

39:21.280 --> 39:23.840
want to have a whole bunch of servers that are arch, right?

39:23.840 --> 39:25.280
Why would you do it that way?

39:25.280 --> 39:28.660
But it's nice to stay in the same ecosystem, we don't have to suddenly switch things out

39:28.660 --> 39:32.080
or get used to all the little differences between things.

39:32.080 --> 39:36.960
If you could have just one system that could run everywhere, including all those pies that

39:36.960 --> 39:37.960
you have.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.840
I mean, wouldn't that be the dream?

39:39.840 --> 39:40.840
Yeah.

39:40.840 --> 39:44.200
And it it does run I'm told, although I have yet to test it, although I think I will put

39:44.200 --> 39:45.880
it on the pi 400.

39:45.880 --> 39:52.560
Just to give that a go, I was running it on a Dell laptop that I had in for testing.

39:52.560 --> 39:55.400
And I went with the DVD release.

39:55.400 --> 40:00.220
So they still kind of like old school style, I love it, offer various sizes.

40:00.220 --> 40:06.040
And then they even offer like an i 586 image if you want, along with the arm and x 64.

40:06.040 --> 40:10.560
And then you pick like DVD or net install and as you as the name implies, net install

40:10.560 --> 40:13.880
is just what you need to get the live environment up and then the packages are pulled down from

40:13.880 --> 40:14.880
the repo.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.320
And if you have a fast internet connection, I think that's probably the way to go.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.640
You tried the live version though, Wes, and that was kind of different.

40:20.640 --> 40:25.860
Well, I was confused from the start because I mean, you go over to the you know, the get

40:25.860 --> 40:29.880
tumbleweed page, and they've got some tabs, if you want to go get you know, you can get

40:29.880 --> 40:33.420
their cubic stuff, you can get the installation and they do have a they have a live tab with

40:33.420 --> 40:35.800
live images.

40:35.800 --> 40:39.740
But right at the top, they say please be aware of the following limitations.

40:39.740 --> 40:45.760
They should not be used to install or upgrade tumbleweed, please use the tumbleweed media,

40:45.760 --> 40:49.360
which I think they mean the installation media for that instead.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.420
And they also note that these have limited package and driver selection, so they can't

40:53.420 --> 40:57.500
be considered an accurate reflection as to whether tumbleweed will work on your hardware

40:57.500 --> 40:58.500
or not.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.000
And you know, that's a fair point and can probably be said of all live CDs.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.760
But it was a little strange to me that although I could kind of try it out, I had to then

41:06.760 --> 41:10.840
go get a totally separate installation media just to get things installed.

41:10.840 --> 41:14.080
So I ended up just downloading the net install and doing it that way.

41:14.080 --> 41:22.640
Well, see, that's just as confusing as it was for me, because I think about 97.5% of

41:22.640 --> 41:28.280
the reason I would get a live disk would be to test how that distribution works with my

41:28.280 --> 41:29.880
hardware.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.880
And then if it works, I run the installer.

41:31.880 --> 41:35.960
Now once it's once it's a distro that I know works great, and I'm just going to deploy

41:35.960 --> 41:39.180
it all the time, I prefer having something that just boots right to the installer like

41:39.180 --> 41:42.120
their primary media does.

41:42.120 --> 41:46.080
But I just thought that the wording around limited package and driver selection, that

41:46.080 --> 41:49.640
could just be implying, you know, there's no Nvidia driver here.

41:49.640 --> 41:53.400
Or it could be implying that like it's some sort of super slimmed down kernel, it was

41:53.400 --> 41:54.400
very confusing.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.680
And I'm like, but that's why I use a live CD.

41:57.680 --> 42:00.560
I've also kind of just been spoiled over the years of you know, okay, maybe it doesn't

42:00.560 --> 42:03.440
matter right now when you've got like a test machine that you're using, you still got your

42:03.440 --> 42:04.440
desktop.

42:04.440 --> 42:08.880
But if you're someone who just has the one Linux machine, it's really a luxury that unlike

42:08.880 --> 42:13.280
in the Windows world, I can still browse the internet with Firefox from the live CD while

42:13.280 --> 42:15.560
I'm installing these new OS on my machine.

42:15.560 --> 42:18.000
And it kind of sucks to not have that option.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Yeah, yeah.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.560
Yeah, that I remember how cool that used to like Linux is so powerful.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.920
I can I can play solitaire while I'm installing the OS.

42:25.920 --> 42:32.520
But so you know, you had to hang around while I'm sitting here downloading the 4.6 gigabyte

42:32.520 --> 42:37.640
or 4.28 gigabyte DVD image, which is kind of quaint.

42:37.640 --> 42:41.980
I remember DVDs, but I wanted the full offline experience because I was going to take my

42:41.980 --> 42:47.160
laptop home after the show and just do everything from home where I'm on a pretty limited connection

42:47.160 --> 42:50.080
and I actually I want the DVD stuff.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.520
So I sit down and I you know, after the download completes, I write to my media and you know,

42:53.520 --> 42:54.960
you and I go our separate ways.

42:54.960 --> 42:59.160
I sit down at home, and I boot off the live media.

42:59.160 --> 43:03.800
And I've always really liked the SUSE grub boot screens.

43:03.800 --> 43:10.040
I've always thought they just have always looked the best beyond like any other distro.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.480
And I think that still holds true.

43:11.480 --> 43:14.760
They're just they really get that first power on experience nice.

43:14.760 --> 43:15.760
No kidding.

43:15.760 --> 43:20.160
I definitely have that written down in my notes of just this feels slick and professional

43:20.160 --> 43:21.920
and wow.

43:21.920 --> 43:28.720
Things kind of then took a bit of a tumble, if you will, but when the installer loaded

43:28.720 --> 43:36.520
up and I'm on a 4K screen system and the UI for the installer was so tiny that the entire

43:36.520 --> 43:39.840
EULA fit on my screen.

43:39.840 --> 43:40.840
There was no scroll bar.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.480
The entire EULA fit.

43:42.480 --> 43:50.140
It was absolutely teensy weensy and I couldn't see a way to magnify, you know, to double

43:50.140 --> 43:51.520
it or whatever during the installation.

43:51.520 --> 43:56.400
But I powered through and the installer got to the point where it seemed like this was

43:56.400 --> 44:00.440
the opportunity for me to put it on Wi-Fi if I wanted to do that.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.720
And boy is that an experience.

44:02.720 --> 44:06.960
It's really old school because you set like you first have to set the encryption type

44:06.960 --> 44:10.560
and it's like default to web and that's on one tab.

44:10.560 --> 44:15.520
But then you on a different screen tell it to go scan for SSIDs and then on a different

44:15.520 --> 44:19.520
tab you you set the IP settings and so on and so forth.

44:19.520 --> 44:24.120
I mean it was a very strange experience and I wasn't even sure if I was connected to Wi-Fi

44:24.120 --> 44:25.400
after all was said and done.

44:25.400 --> 44:26.400
Did you experience this?

44:26.400 --> 44:27.400
No.

44:27.400 --> 44:31.520
You know thankfully I was installing from an ethernet cable old school so I didn't run

44:31.520 --> 44:32.520
into that.

44:32.520 --> 44:37.880
Although I did actually install a few other times in a virtual machine and had some similar

44:37.880 --> 44:40.640
problems getting things connected which surprised me.

44:40.640 --> 44:45.840
I obviously did have it connected because later on in the installer I got a prompt that

44:45.840 --> 44:49.320
came up and it said the installer has detected a network connection.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.480
If anybody's installed SUSE you've seen this.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.240
Would you like to enable online repos?

44:53.240 --> 44:56.920
And I thought well what are they asking me here?

44:56.920 --> 44:59.640
Like the you know Ubuntu will phrase it would you like to pull down the latest packages

44:59.640 --> 45:01.920
or that is that what they're asking me here?

45:01.920 --> 45:07.080
Or they asking me that should I do I just want to make sure I add additional repositories

45:07.080 --> 45:08.880
which I did.

45:08.880 --> 45:12.480
So I said yes and then I saw which ones are checked and I said okay.

45:12.480 --> 45:17.120
But then during the install it seemed like it was clearly pulling down packages from

45:17.120 --> 45:21.240
the repository even though I had implicitly decided to use the offline media and it just

45:21.240 --> 45:27.760
seems by opting to have online repositories I then started getting packages from the repos

45:27.760 --> 45:31.640
during the installation which is fine except for I was again on a limited LTE connection

45:31.640 --> 45:33.420
and would prefer to save the bandwidth.

45:33.420 --> 45:35.540
You had planned to not do that.

45:35.540 --> 45:40.960
You know interestingly on my you know the Netver install version it asked me the exact

45:40.960 --> 45:44.600
same question and I didn't try this maybe I will after the show.

45:44.600 --> 45:48.140
I don't know what happens if I would have said no because there weren't any other package

45:48.140 --> 45:49.680
sources to use.

45:49.680 --> 45:53.680
Yeah that's a good question right yeah especially on the net install and then the other thing

45:53.680 --> 45:59.120
that seemed particularly challenging with the large Dell trackpad is it was registering

45:59.120 --> 46:00.120
clicks weird.

46:00.120 --> 46:03.500
I had to get really far down in the corner of the trackpad in a way I don't normally

46:03.500 --> 46:07.760
have to do on any other Linux distribution and to kind of make the situation a little

46:07.760 --> 46:12.680
more frustrating although yet helpful at the same time every time I would try to like click

46:12.680 --> 46:18.560
next and I wasn't in the precise bottom of the of the far left corner of the trackpad

46:18.560 --> 46:23.400
I would get a dialog box that came up by Yas that says you seem to have misclicked would

46:23.400 --> 46:28.280
you like to swap the buttons but the way the dialog is stated is not actually really clear

46:28.280 --> 46:32.520
I wasn't sure what what I'd be swapping and how and I didn't actually mean to do it so

46:32.520 --> 46:36.200
then I had like a dialog I had to clear and then I had to go try to click my next button

46:36.200 --> 46:40.320
again and I have never had this with this trackpad happened before and I'm not quite

46:40.320 --> 46:44.560
sure what was going on there it felt like it was acting like a ps2 mouse but again not

46:44.560 --> 46:49.040
really a deal breaker it just made it not quite as smooth as maybe setting up fedora

46:49.040 --> 46:53.360
or Ubuntu but you know at the end of the day it was easy to get through I think that's

46:53.360 --> 46:56.920
another version where you're not in the same environment right you're not on just a regular

46:56.920 --> 47:01.960
desktop that has a program that runs and installs you're in a dedicated installation environment

47:01.960 --> 47:07.200
which is simpler it might work really nicely especially at scale but you don't know how

47:07.200 --> 47:11.360
it works or have any of the tools to go fiddle with like display settings I do feel like

47:11.360 --> 47:16.180
you get a lot of nice user choice and if that's your thing and it is my thing that's something

47:16.180 --> 47:20.280
I love about the openSUSE install I mean you can get access to something like six different

47:20.280 --> 47:24.200
desktops depending on how you what options you choose but you get presented with plasma

47:24.200 --> 47:28.800
or gnome or other desktop and that's where you get access to more or you get things like

47:28.800 --> 47:32.920
transactional server which is really neat and they give you a little brief descriptions

47:32.920 --> 47:37.600
of all of that but once you make your final decisions I really like that it's just it's

47:37.600 --> 47:41.720
just it goes man and then I stepped away to go get a snack and came back and I was at

47:41.720 --> 47:48.040
my desktop it was just done because I chose to use auto login for the test and it was

47:48.040 --> 47:51.440
kind of nice to be honest it like the computer just took care of itself and just finished

47:51.440 --> 47:54.440
the installation and brought me to my desktop and I thought that was a slick experience

47:54.440 --> 47:58.320
yeah no that waiting for you to remove the USB drive or any of that other stuff that

47:58.320 --> 48:02.000
you you figure out and you know I was I was kind of impressed with the installation in

48:02.000 --> 48:07.280
general it it did feel kind of enterprising I mean like one of the first things that

48:07.280 --> 48:11.720
it said to me was searching for available products yeah probing the source type and

48:11.720 --> 48:15.440
I was like okay what's going on here and of course as you sort of skipped over a little

48:15.440 --> 48:18.940
bit there's also a license agreement that you're prompted with right at the start which

48:18.940 --> 48:23.520
is not something I'm always used to when I'm installing Linux but the flip side of that

48:23.520 --> 48:28.800
is that it felt mature there's a ton of translations available and as someone who loves to complain

48:28.800 --> 48:33.400
about Anaconda more than I should I was really impressed with the disk setup tooling the

48:33.400 --> 48:37.600
partitioning yeah especially how I could go into expert mode and it gave me a choice of

48:37.600 --> 48:41.320
do you want to start fresh or do you want to keep things how we've set them up and then

48:41.320 --> 48:45.120
just tweak them a little in expert mode and I thought that was really well done and I

48:45.120 --> 48:48.840
liked its suggestions I thought they were solid and I wasn't sure what it would do since

48:48.840 --> 48:52.560
I had an existing distro on there and it took care of just tidying it all up for me and

48:52.560 --> 48:57.120
doing a nice you know better fs setup which is part of what I wanted to play with I was

48:57.120 --> 49:01.000
disappointed to see that the Wi-Fi setup that I did in the installer didn't hold over to

49:01.000 --> 49:04.320
the installed OS so then I had to go through setting up Wi-Fi again which is where I got

49:04.320 --> 49:10.720
bit by that current plasma bug of the menu jumping around so like oh I always think that's

49:10.720 --> 49:15.160
nice you know when you get like a like on Ubuntu or something you get the live environment

49:15.160 --> 49:18.920
on the Wi-Fi network and then you reboot into the installed OS and it still has all the

49:18.920 --> 49:23.000
Wi-Fi stuff like I just think that's slick and I'd love to see them be able to do that

49:23.000 --> 49:32.000
if they could but I was plagued immediately with performance issues on the plasma desktop

49:32.000 --> 49:37.440
on open Zeus a tumbleweed on this Dell with an NVIDIA graphics card and the easiest way

49:37.440 --> 49:44.520
you'd see it manifest was I'd fire open krunner which is the plasma application launcher it's

49:44.520 --> 49:47.760
such like a muscle memory thing that I do alt space and I start just typing the command

49:47.760 --> 49:54.160
I hit enter but on this installation I hit alt space and I'd start typing I hit enter

49:54.160 --> 49:59.120
and then I'd see like my web browser or whatever I'm using freak out because all of the input

49:59.120 --> 50:04.400
had gone into my active window and then even after after I'd come to that realization of

50:04.400 --> 50:09.440
what had just happened then the krunner menu came down and it was consistently laggy like

50:09.440 --> 50:14.940
this throughout the system so I thought well this has to be a video acceleration issue

50:14.940 --> 50:21.240
because this is a ginormous 4k display and it's doing it all in software right so or

50:21.240 --> 50:25.900
whatever whatever the whatever it does I better install the NVIDIA driver do you have any

50:25.900 --> 50:31.660
systems where you tried to do the video driver Wes you know actually not yet it's on my list

50:31.660 --> 50:37.040
to try I think I'm gonna be leaving the tumbleweed around on at least one system for a while

50:37.040 --> 50:41.600
but on on the Intel systems I was testing it on no no problem I was I was yeah I was

50:41.600 --> 50:47.000
really pleased with performance yeah works great now I don't mean any disrespect to the

50:47.000 --> 50:54.200
project but holy shit this is bad oh my god I cannot believe it's still in this state

50:54.200 --> 51:01.040
so I found some great documentation that even as a 20 plus Linux user your user Linux user

51:01.040 --> 51:05.800
I can I can kind of understand what they're saying but I essentially have to use a series

51:05.800 --> 51:13.240
of tools to figure out what type of NVIDIA card I have and then I have one of two options

51:13.240 --> 51:17.640
to install for an NVIDIA driver but none of their documentation covers the use case of

51:17.640 --> 51:23.340
using a quadro video card so I was completely left on my own to assume what I'm supposed

51:23.340 --> 51:28.740
to do and then once I even get the process of adding the NVIDIA repo and then going through

51:28.740 --> 51:33.640
yes to find the different NVIDIA package options for a 50-50 shot of which one might apply

51:33.640 --> 51:40.100
to my video card yast would hang during the installation the first time around 64% I'm

51:40.100 --> 51:47.120
legitimately long enough that I stepped away came back sat with it for a bit and pondered

51:47.120 --> 51:51.880
well I guess do I reboot my system even though it's 64% through installing the NVIDIA driver

51:51.880 --> 51:56.320
and got up came back again still there sat down thought hmm yeah I think I'm gonna have

51:56.320 --> 52:02.040
to reboot it and then it finished so I reboot my computer and after I installed apparently

52:02.040 --> 52:07.440
what was the wrong of a 50-50 shot driver I tried the newest driver there seems to be

52:07.440 --> 52:12.960
like a version 400 series and a version 300 series I installed the 400 series because

52:12.960 --> 52:19.760
it's a fairly modern quadro video card apparently that was the wrong one so I reboot no video

52:19.760 --> 52:25.400
everything's on the Intel still still running real choppy real laggy and and yast helped

52:25.400 --> 52:29.040
me uninstall it but I wasn't sure if it cleared up everything or not and so then I installed

52:29.040 --> 52:34.280
the older driver and I mean at this point I'm kind of desperate to get the NVIDIA GPU

52:34.280 --> 52:38.500
working because the performance is basically unusable the input leg was brutal I was screwing

52:38.500 --> 52:42.440
stuff up I just found it to be kind of an awful experience then you combine that with

52:42.440 --> 52:47.360
just the newness of having to set up a desktop environment and it's not working right it's

52:47.360 --> 52:52.720
it's a frustrating experience and so I thought okay I'll clear out what I installed I'll

52:52.720 --> 52:56.800
install the older driver I install that I reboot I mean I'm following the instructions

52:56.800 --> 53:03.400
that are on the wiki and I reboot and it still does not work I've got no real errors that

53:03.400 --> 53:07.480
I can follow up on and to this point to this day I just kind of gave up on it so fear I'll

53:07.480 --> 53:12.840
come back to it and I wanted to test out other things on the system but that that experience

53:12.840 --> 53:18.800
of the process I had to go through feels like it's barely evolved from what it was like

53:18.800 --> 53:24.160
seven or eight years ago on desktop Linux to get proprietary graphics working when it

53:24.160 --> 53:30.240
was a legit exercise in system administration to get a driver enabled on your box and now

53:30.240 --> 53:35.280
we live in an era where it's a checkbox on Fedora and Ubuntu and every other desktop

53:35.280 --> 53:39.400
environment or on arch it's a single package you install or a series of packages a meta

53:39.400 --> 53:44.360
package some folks even you know some distributions and projects even have dedicated media for

53:44.360 --> 53:47.480
that if you already know that's what you want you know comes with it right there and it

53:47.480 --> 53:54.200
was painful it was I remember thinking how this used to be and how it just doesn't need

53:54.200 --> 53:59.720
to be like that anymore and I was shocked at the experience was that bad and that that's

53:59.720 --> 54:03.080
not something people talk about a lot more but there's other things that it just seemed

54:03.080 --> 54:07.520
like off that nobody talks about both Wes and I on different systems couldn't get the

54:07.520 --> 54:11.720
ISOs to download using Chrome that particular day we were doing it I don't know why you

54:11.720 --> 54:16.080
should go try it see if it downloads on Chrome for you we had to switch to Firefox I actually

54:16.080 --> 54:20.120
switched to it just a dedicated downloader to get the ISO to download nobody's talking

54:20.120 --> 54:24.080
about that it was weird because it was clearly a link right I could right click and copy

54:24.080 --> 54:27.640
the link and I did the same I just pasted it and you know curled curled it down to my

54:27.640 --> 54:32.820
file system but it was it was strange and you it's surprising to me maybe it's a new

54:32.820 --> 54:37.280
bug I haven't downloaded open source especially tumbleweed for quite some time I will admit

54:37.280 --> 54:44.360
but not ideal so then things really went wrong when I tried to get slack working so there's

54:44.360 --> 54:50.440
obviously a pretty significant lead that the snap store has in SEO when you search for

54:50.440 --> 54:56.240
getting slack on open Sousa because the first like three or four results for me who are

54:56.240 --> 55:02.080
all like do it with snaps but when you go beyond there you discover and maybe you had

55:02.080 --> 55:04.740
a different route on this I don't know if you tried this but when you Google around

55:04.740 --> 55:10.200
you can find that there are different community repos that are hosting slack for you and this

55:10.200 --> 55:14.380
is kind of like PPAs to the next level because instead of it just being a simple straightforward

55:14.380 --> 55:19.360
process to add a personal package repository you have to go through this process through

55:19.360 --> 55:24.920
yast where it asks you all of these questions and I chose the community repo that looked

55:24.920 --> 55:29.620
the most legitimate based on absolutely nothing and then went through the yast process where

55:29.620 --> 55:38.000
it had to add five additional repos to make it work and of course it aired out on adding

55:38.000 --> 55:43.000
the third out of the five repos and the process never completed and I never got slack installed

55:43.000 --> 55:47.560
on the machine oh no that is interesting I did I um I kind of cheated there and I went

55:47.560 --> 55:51.040
the easy route and I installed it via flat back yeah that's what I'm gonna do that's

55:51.040 --> 55:55.400
what I'll have to do and honestly I did that because that's kind of been my go-to for a

55:55.400 --> 56:01.320
while now there's just that sort of set of applications that I just rely on having in

56:01.320 --> 56:06.080
you know these sort of containerized universal package formats now just because I know that

56:06.080 --> 56:10.380
they're there and I'm pretty sure they'll work wherever I'm gonna run them but you're

56:10.380 --> 56:14.760
right you know software availability was one of the things we were wondering as a can I

56:14.760 --> 56:20.240
run tumbleweed in place of arch sort of meta question because with arch and you know that

56:20.240 --> 56:26.920
it's probably just in the AUR and the AUR might not be simple you should acknowledge

56:26.920 --> 56:30.160
that right you're learning more about how the ecosystem works here whereas you're already

56:30.160 --> 56:35.720
familiar with arch in the AUR but this sounded a bit more complex.

56:35.720 --> 56:40.280
I think it just kind of it really feels like the experience is downgraded when you begin

56:40.280 --> 56:44.900
managing software via yast and I know that's probably the opposite opinion that every every

56:44.900 --> 56:47.880
user that's listening to the show that loves to use sues probably has the opposite opinion

56:47.880 --> 56:51.520
of me and I'm sure the development community for your open sues has the opposite opinion

56:51.520 --> 56:58.960
for me but in my using it and mind you I've had sues enterprise server in production I've

56:58.960 --> 57:04.040
used yast extensively in production years ago and I think one of the reasons I was first

57:04.040 --> 57:09.240
drawn to SUSE when I was new to Linux and I was deployed in production was because I

57:09.240 --> 57:13.920
felt like yast was sort of an insurance policy for me.

57:13.920 --> 57:16.880
I knew there were certain things I was always going to be able to configure on these Linux

57:16.880 --> 57:23.120
boxes because yast gave me that option and I could do it in yast and that as a configuration

57:23.120 --> 57:30.840
tool is powerful and it it it also breeds a lot of loyalty by the user base but now

57:30.840 --> 57:37.800
having been away from SUSE for a long time and coming back to it my experience dies every

57:37.800 --> 57:47.080
time I go inside yast it it is arduous, tedious, slow, it feels bloated, it never feels native

57:47.080 --> 57:53.120
and the software management has to be the absolute slowest and most clunky and require

57:53.120 --> 58:00.400
the absolute most user input of any package management system of any popular Linux distribution.

58:00.400 --> 58:06.600
It's an absolutely paper cuts experience at every point and I think people that use SUSE

58:06.600 --> 58:10.800
and that have used this for so long are just so used to it being this way or perhaps like

58:10.800 --> 58:15.520
the benefits of of what yast brings that they just don't even see it but for me coming from

58:15.520 --> 58:19.560
the outside it's a deal breaker for me with this distribution.

58:19.560 --> 58:24.360
I kept debating how to feel about it because on one hand I'm kind of really impressed like

58:24.360 --> 58:29.560
it's almost a different style of how you interface and manage like a Linux system and there's

58:29.560 --> 58:33.120
a lot in there that I like I mean they've thought about a lot of things it's been a

58:33.120 --> 58:36.840
project that's been around for a long time there's clearly areas where it's very mature

58:36.840 --> 58:41.280
sophisticated and I could really see if I was deploying this in a corporate environment

58:41.280 --> 58:45.700
or some sort of you know I was trying to administer all these boxes I needed sameness yast would

58:45.700 --> 58:52.980
be killer but as someone more used to assembling arch systems yeah it was kind of a weird black

58:52.980 --> 58:58.280
box and I didn't feel it felt like a rogue agent on my machine that left me more confused

58:58.280 --> 58:59.500
than enlightened.

58:59.500 --> 59:03.680
And I don't think it's just the pro user like coming from arch angle I also thought about

59:03.680 --> 59:09.380
it from a skill set that's applicable to the wider market and when you learn how to do

59:09.380 --> 59:13.920
things in yast and you learn how to do it the SUSE way the open SUSE way you're not

59:13.920 --> 59:18.880
you're not really learning a skill that's directly translatable to CentOS, RHEL or

59:18.880 --> 59:24.260
Ubuntu and early on in my career I think I would have really have disserviced myself

59:24.260 --> 59:30.380
had I only learned how to do things the yast way I initially started with Red Hat servers

59:30.380 --> 59:35.320
and I just did everything on Red Hat and then when Ubuntu started coming along with their

59:35.320 --> 59:40.360
LTS releases I heavily advocated that for my clients because I really liked apt back

59:40.360 --> 59:43.440
then I remember this is a long time ago and apt was a significant competitive advantage

59:43.440 --> 59:50.600
in my opinion for managing a distribution and I was able to take by four or five years

59:50.600 --> 59:58.000
of only using RHEL to Ubuntu because I understood what I was doing in RHEL and I could translate

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.080
that to essentially almost everything that was the same on Ubuntu with maybe a few things

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.040
in different places or a config file that's in a folder instead of directly in Etsy or

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:12.080
you know small differences and so it made the skill set that I learned on RHEL applicable

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.200
to other platforms which made me more employable and it was a net plus that way but I don't

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.760
feel like you would get that with yast so not only is it not appealing for people who

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.440
are used to managing their systems from the ground up like an arch user might be but I

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:31.240
think that people that want to participate professionally in the industry unless they're

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.900
in a niche that serves applications that run on SUSE servers which in that case this is

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:41.100
an obvious non-problem you kind of are limiting yourself because you're learning how to do

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:45.720
it the yast way and not the way that every other single distribution might be doing it

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.680
even if yast is just pulling those same levers for you under the hood and so I think it's

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.760
a bigger problem than just the power user perspective and I know this is going to sound

01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:00.200
crazy to anybody who might be listening from the project because yast is kind of like their

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.520
you know competitive differentiator but from where I'm sitting at it feels like something

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:10.600
that when Linux needed everything set up for you when everything out of the box needed

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.800
to be configured like your X config file and all of your devices and your printers and

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:20.640
your USB scanners wouldn't just work or your SCSI devices like it made so much sense back

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.960
then but today outside of maybe managing things like boot managers and snapshots and stuff

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:34.000
like that I just feel like it's a brutal experience that really kind of turns me off the distribution

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.160
completely like I'm never going to want to be dependent on that tool I'm never going

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.840
to want to just isolate myself to one distribution and one way of doing things and I guess I

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.440
find it I find it really kind of disappointing that I couldn't get over that because I can

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.440
see how appealing it would be to people to have tumbleweed on your daily driver and leap

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:57.560
on your server and leap on your raspberry pies like I can really see the appeal of having

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.000
it all with one distro and one community and I really wish that could have worked for me

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.680
but at the end of the day it just doesn't I'm wondering did you have any fun or not

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.000
notice at all butter fs by the default you know didn't really get a chance to dig into

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
a great question I feel like that's another thing I need to spend a little more time with

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
so I'm going to keep it on the box I'm going to try to get the Nvidia card working I'm

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.560
sure I'll get some tips on how to do that and I want to try it on the Raspberry Pi 400

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.120
as well I think that's an important note we should add really just to be clear about in

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:32.160
this you know it's it's this is not an assessment of fact around hope ensues tumbleweed who

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:36.580
it does or doesn't work for anything like that really this is just us getting our toes

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:41.040
wet again in this ecosystem and yeah like you Chris I'm going to keep it around for

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.880
a while keep playing with it keep it on one of my machines and just see what it feels

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.480
like to live the lizard lifestyle for a bit live the lizard lifestyle I like it I want

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:56.960
to I want to make a kind of an important announcement moving on our unplugged core contributors

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.520
we had a bit of a snafu with the founders promo code a learning moment you could call

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:07.460
it that I think may have run afoul of a platform bug I'm not sure so I had to remove the founders

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:14.220
promo today as we're recording however the platform support folks are at memberful are

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.840
trying to see if they can figure out who was in the founders discount and just get it reapplied

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.680
to you that may happen but if that doesn't happen if you notice like you got a price

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.840
bump or you just want to get in and become a core contributor at the beginning of 2021

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.760
and get the whole year in I have a new promo code that will take two dollars off the price

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:37.800
I I'm never really doing this anymore because honestly you know it it's a big discount but

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.880
with this oops and the founders promo code getting removed I wanted to make it right

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.800
and so the new promo code that anyone is welcome to use if you want to get this locked in at

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:52.360
the beginning of 2021 is just 2021 so if you go to unplugged core.com and you apply the

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:58.040
promo code 2021 you'll get two dollars off the membership and that should remain on your

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.540
account for the entire time you're a member I apologize for the snafu with the founders

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:06.480
stuff I think I'm just gonna probably get to the bottom of it in the next couple of

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.920
days I'm working actively with the memberful support who has been awesome and super responsive

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.760
about the situation but it got kind of gnarly and this really sucks it resulted in like

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:24.680
a lot of our OG core contributors not renewing by mistake so 52 percent of you have been

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:31.840
accidentally unsubscribed it's just it really stinks so if you could double check on your

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.320
membership and if you've been unsubscribed or it's not the right price you can put that

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.960
promo code 2021 on there I think I'm gonna leave it open for a couple of weeks and you

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:46.520
can support the show that's unplugged core.com and then you get access to a limited ad feed

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.280
if you'd like the show with the same full production but just limited ads we make that

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.640
available as a perk additionally we have a bootleg feed it's the full live stream all

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.000
of our screw-ups all of our resets the stuff that never makes into the show with much larger

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.880
pre and post show that's essentially a whole other show that's also available to you as

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:09.040
a member and I mean two dollars off the membership price is pretty pretty great so unplugged

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:14.520
core.com and my bad I'm actually not 100% sure it was my fault but I'm taking responsibility

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:22.400
for it I'm making it right so use the promo code 2021 all right Westpain we have a really

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.200
great pick this week and I believe you and I are both Todoist users for a little over

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:34.480
a year so maybe you even longer yes we are and Todoist has released like an electron

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:41.800
version of their to-do tracking application but you know me I like something local so

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:46.920
if you want to keep track of your projects your tasks your goals in a local app that

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:52.780
looks really really nice I do I do that sounds like you will then check out planner at use

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:56.520
planner.com it's a it's an example of one of the beautiful apps that's been designed

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.860
for elementary OS that I mean because it's based on native local Linux technologies as

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:06.120
impossible it's possible to get another distros I'm I'm running it on on a plasma box and

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.520
if you're on arch you want you want the the version of the package that has elementary

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.320
in the name it's elementary dash planner there's two planners in the arch repo or in the AUR

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.520
you want elementary dash planner if you're on arch and the beautiful thing about it

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.280
is if you just want something super simple local it can do that you don't need any integration

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.720
with anything it'll just be a really nice local app it's a beautiful GTK app but it

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:32.680
looks just fine on plasma too then if you are a todoist user you can connect it to your

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:36.960
todoist account it will sync and import everything from todoist and then you don't have to use

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.660
their electron app that I was pretty impressed with it just worked right away no problems

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:48.560
had to you know log in like usual I like that now I installed the flat pack which there

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.480
is a flat pack available which made it really easy also on a plasma desktop I've got some

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:59.360
sort of strange black borders around mine but otherwise it seems to be working very

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.480
nicely and I think I'm going to keep it you can go into the preferences and change some

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.360
of the appearance options so you might want to play around with that you know like put

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.000
it in dark mode ops and then the other thing you might want to check on is what your GTK

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.120
theme settings are right now for plasma there might be something walka there because it

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:23.320
is a GTK application but hot damn is it great and todoist is admittedly not free software

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.960
um it's not an open source hosted solution but it has a lot of collaborative features

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:33.880
it has integration with freaking everything it's got an API for days and so I just sort

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.540
of eventually fell into using it because they have mobile apps they have web apps they now

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:42.820
you know have third-party client apps and that's that I like a lot and over the years

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:47.360
I've tried a lot of things but I keep coming back to todoist because of this kind of flexibility

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:54.600
and the idea that I can have this nice well-designed todoist client that's native on my Linux desktop

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.800
and then have a native app on my phone kind of puts it in the sweet spot for me so check

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:05.100
that one out it's it's worth it it's totally worth it so we have a bunch of feedback this

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:10.920
week mr. Westpain and it's hard to say if we could get to all of it but I did want to

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:17.320
get to the tuxes feedback because we've heard a lot from that I'm I'm really I'm really

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:22.040
happy that people seem to really enjoy the tuxes it's been really well received people

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.080
who won the tuxes are are excited and I it was a nice it was a nice way to say thank

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.040
you at the end of the year so Roy writes in regarding the award show he said you hope

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.640
for more people to vote I think you should have mentioned the voting on other JB shows

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.640
as well and I think he's absolutely right I I will attempt when my goal is for next

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:47.720
year's tuxes is by around Thanksgiving to have a URL that is just you go to a URL directly

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:53.560
that we maybe even launch a week earlier than we did this time around and that we do promote

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:57.920
it on other shows and if you're out there and interested in maybe helping me build like

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:07.240
a static website that we could use to also show who won because that was a request that

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:13.040
came in by some of the tuxes winners was hey we'd sure like to be able to share something

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.560
just to tell the team and that makes a lot of sense so a site that that could that could

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:24.040
hold the winners for every year and then maybe you could click on it and get like their individual

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:29.400
award page that says you know fedora project for this or or whatever who was a winner and

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.280
then maybe even an embed of the YouTube video with the time code and just something that's

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:41.080
easy simple fast that we could update every year with the tuxes I think would be great

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.000
and so if somebody's out there that wants to help me with that get ahold of me you can

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.420
use the contact form or you can email me directly Chris at you better broadcasting.com or probably

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:54.360
telegram or whatever too I I don't know if that's a good idea but you can you can give

01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:02.680
it a shot probably the show contact is the simplest for everyone yeah yeah so anyways

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:07.760
that is feedback we are taking in and we'll try to get like a visual representation of

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.620
that as well we also had a suggestion from Sandro about the tuxes you want to take that

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:19.760
one with yeah Sandro wrote in and actually a lot of advice for us but thought that it

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.160
might be overkill for the kind of contest we're doing but we could consider having a

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:30.760
nomination phase first and then a voting phase you know sort of accept proposals for each

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:37.000
category make a big list and then in the voting phase only allow entries from that list you

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.800
know that might make some of the tallying a little bit simpler but wouldn't mean we

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.520
need to get things started even earlier so like almost like a bracketing system where

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.620
you kind of like have a phase one that we take the submissions and then we have a debate

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:54.580
and discussion about that one and then move a subset of those to the final round yeah

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:59.440
exactly that's an interesting idea that I don't know how we would do that in a way that

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.620
wouldn't drag it out forever though yes Sandro even linked to some some voting theory and

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:09.440
some more technical resources that we can take a look at to see how we might actually

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:14.360
implement such a system thank you everyone for bearing with with us on this you know

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:18.480
I think it was a lot of fun and interesting but it was definitely a rough first year for

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:21.500
the tuxes but I'm already looking forward to the next year and I think there's lots

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:27.120
of stuff that we can do to improve it so if you do have further ideas suggestions tools

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.720
things we just shouldn't try again please do let us know yeah it was definitely a minimum

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:36.880
viable tuxes we weren't sure if the idea was sound we wanted to try it because it's something

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:42.580
that we've kicked around for years and um I think it showed that it was worth investing

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:46.720
more into and we're interested in doing that and it also could become a yearly tradition

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.480
that we get to look forward to kind of like the predictions and reviews that as a team

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.040
is kind of like it's it's almost the biggest indication that the holiday season is here

01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.200
is that we start working on those shows so it has some sentimental value it's not like

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.660
a milestone in the production year of the show like when we get to those shows we know

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:09.880
we have done a solid year of shows by that point and it's it's kind of a moment so it's

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.900
something we want to do and we would love to get your suggestions we'll take one last

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:19.920
email that comes in from five on gnome 40s impending changes it says happy new year's

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.080
I am a gnome user and gnome has a killer workflow for me that no other desktop offers without

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.040
a ton of customization I use the auto hide top bar as my only extension to create a clean

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.600
desktop I'm slightly nervous of the new changes proposed to my bread and butter activities

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:40.400
overview which if you're not familiar listener there is some significant work going into

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.040
how the overview section of gnome will work I'm sure the changes will be welcome but the

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.880
activities overflow is what I use most to move quickly to other applications it's much

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.240
quicker than sequential alt-tabbing and doesn't require crazy key combos or memorizations

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:00.980
I also like how I can easily manage my work and home workspace within the overview before

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:06.000
the pandemic I did a magic trick and replaced Windows 10 with Ubuntu at work my co-worker

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.340
quickly noticed how changing from Windows 10 the company standard to gnome desktop was

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.900
really key for my workflow and productivity that's interesting find that you had other

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:19.240
people's notice that as well yeah I think gnome users are sitting here a bit nervous

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.140
at this point with gnome 40 looming out there it's one of the things we're watching for

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:27.700
it's sort of the upside and the downside right if you if you click with gnome and the workflow

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:32.420
and the way it's set up it can be really really nice but because it is so specific it also

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:36.820
means that any changes to it are going to be way more noticeable than say on plasma

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:41.060
I want to believe that they've they've they've received and kind of internalized some of

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:47.540
the feedback over the years and I think really since the gnome 310 311 and 312 series we've

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:54.160
seen a a a more compromised approach to some of the design choices and some of the changes

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.640
and we've seen a real increase in performance and stability so it seems like the last the

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.380
last solid bit of gnome history has shown us that the developers are working in the

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:10.140
right direction and so it is possible that gnome 40 lands and people have a lot of strong

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:15.140
feedback about it but so far history has showed us that over time they'll work some of that

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:20.700
back they'll they'll modify some of it to meet user demand it may be jarring at first

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:24.900
and as a as a project they have to figure out okay what are people freaking out about

01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:29.180
because change is hard and it's jarring and what are people freaking out about that is

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:32.620
legitimate and we have to improve and they'll just have to have to sit with some of these

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:38.380
changes for a bit to be able to pick pick out the signal from the noise and as a community

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:42.300
I think we kind of have to give them some of that grace for a bit and we'll try it we'll

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.740
be honest about what works and doesn't work but at the same time we're not getting the

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:51.380
pitchforks over it you know they'll refine the process we hope just have to wait and

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:57.580
see we'd love to have you join the show live we do it Tuesday at noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:03.460
see you next week same bad time same bad station we'd love to have you join us because of course

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:08.120
we got the chat room the mumble room just gives us that live vibe but we like that too

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:14.340
but if you can't get the show live well then you're like 99.9% of the audience you can

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:19.540
get it every single week by going to linuxunplugged.com subscribe with all the links there our contact

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:24.080
form is linked there our matrix and mumble info and show notes for this week's episode

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.900
are all at linuxunplugged.com thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:35.380
unplugged program also should mention we're at Linux unplugged on Twitter I never do that

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:39.860
bad about that but you can get show announcements and stuff if Twitter's your thing either way

01:15:39.860 --> 01:16:06.620
whatever you do we'll see you back here next Tuesday

01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:25.580
okay everybody go vote JBtitles.com one of the meta themes about this episode that Carl

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:31.900
just started touch on before the show kicked off is how distributions sometimes do things

01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:38.060
differently you know can you have an Ubuntuism can you have a Seussism and there is different

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.940
that's maybe a little more local and there's a different kind and Carl you were just starting

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.020
to touch on and I said wait wait wait save it for the post show do you want to pick that

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:49.740
back up you remember what you were saying yeah I think the gist of it was is that every

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:55.180
package in the distribution is sort of like a soft fork in a way unless it's just a direct

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.300
build of the upstream software exactly how they intended which a lot of them are close

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:03.180
to that but you know there will be compile time options and other things like that but

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:08.580
most distributions will diverge each package slightly with patch files and you know some

01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:13.420
of those are just to adapt it to the build system other ones are to fix other bugs or

01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:16.820
fix features maybe it's something that's already upstream that isn't in a release yet that

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:22.460
they just want to back port to them most recent release but the key thing is is that every

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:29.100
patch that's applied it has a potential to cause problems a non-zero percentage chance

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:34.300
and if a distribution is adding patches that the distribution came up with that aren't

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:39.600
sent upstream if those patches cause problems it's up to that distribution by themselves

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:44.460
to fix it they don't have any help but if a distribution practices what we call upstream

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:50.460
first and they are working with the upstream developers that they don't they won't apply

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:55.620
patches that aren't at least proposed upstream and that way if some one of those patches

01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:00.760
does cause an issue that it's not just on the distro maintainers to fix fix those problems

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.660
they'll actually be able to collaborate with the upstream developers right it's kind of

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:09.860
where the upstream first mentality comes from i totally totally track and but at the same

01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:14.940
time i have to do that well but thing you know couldn't i mean doesn't that seem like

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:20.540
a little ideal scenario because you know for example this is a really small example but

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:27.220
i could totally see this hitting an outfit like canonical for example you hire a developer

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.820
to make some changes to an open source project they create the code they package it all up

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:35.780
and you submit it as a patch and then the upstream project says no we're not interested

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:41.020
in going that direction no thanks and then you're like yeah but i have use cases or end

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:47.540
users that do want this and you're kind of left well i can make the changes as open source

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:52.600
software i have the ability to fix it for my users i mean isn't that kind of in a way

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.080
what kind of drives some of this forking to begin with is just a difference in directions

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:02.020
for projects so people just have to do it themselves yeah absolutely i mean and that's

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:07.260
the thing is whenever whenever a distribution is evaluating whether or not to apply the

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:13.020
patch in the first place they need to weigh that risk so if there's a something proposed

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:18.780
upstream that the distribution you know doesn't have any idea if it would be fixed or merged

01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:22.900
then maybe that's not a good candidate to apply as a patch in the package yet but if

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:26.900
it's something that you know the upstream has already said like yes this is an obvious

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:32.220
fix we we you know thank you for the contribution we're we plan on merging this or we've already

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:36.020
merged it into the master branch and it'll be in the next release those are those those

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:39.820
are the things that are a slam dunk to go ahead and add as a patch to the package because

01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:45.020
you know that it's it's going to it's at least likely to be you know you'll be able to collaborate

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:48.940
with the upstream developers on it so it's a risk evaluation whenever you're first applying

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:52.540
that patch in the package yeah they got to do that math of like oh boy do we want to

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:57.140
take this on and be responsible for all the bugs and never really being accepted by by

01:19:57.140 --> 01:20:02.260
the upstream yeah i i agree every patch has that risk and has to be evaluated it's complicated

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:07.020
you know assembling all these different pieces from all kinds of different people organizations

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:11.020
and groups into what we view as one cohesive operating system
