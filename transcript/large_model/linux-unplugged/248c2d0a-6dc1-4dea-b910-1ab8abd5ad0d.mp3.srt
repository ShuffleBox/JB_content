1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
Look at this cool toy that Wes found.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,500
It's a bootable CD and a retro game,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,480
and it all fits in a single tweet.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,700
How is this shenanigans possible, Wes?

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,540
Well, a little bit,

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,960
just by abusing the El Torito standard,

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,160
and being exceedingly clever,

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,360
and then also because the dark arts,

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,500
you use a little pearl.

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,600
Yeah, it's a little pearl

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,240
with a long string of characters,

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,840
and then you pipe that through Base64,

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,040
and then you output that result to an ISO image.

14
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,920
Yeah, exactly.

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,760
And then you can,

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,240
I just tested it out here,

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,960
boots right up in QEMU,

18
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,680
and you've got yourself a little retro game.

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,100
The game may be not super fun,

20
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,520
but the write-up about how this all works is a lot of fun.

21
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,360
Back in the day,

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,120
you used to try to fit an entire bootable environment

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,880
on a floppy disk.

24
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,680
Now, in 2018, it's fitted in a tweet,

25
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,560
and it's actually possible.

26
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,580
God, I love Linux.

27
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,940
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 260,

28
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,940
for July 31st, 2018.

29
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,920
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged,

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
your weekly Linux talk show

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
that is surrounded by machines,

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,680
trapped in a hot room,

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,400
and jacked up on caffeine.

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,240
My name is Chris.

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,080
My name is Wes.

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
Hello, Mr. Payne, and of course,

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
back again, like every week,

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,500
is Mr. Brent.

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,340
Hello, Brent.

40
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,180
Hello, guys.

41
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,020
How's it going?

42
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,320
Fantastic, always doing well

43
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,880
when we're all together to do a podcast,

44
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,040
and we have a great episode today.

45
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,120
One, Mr. Barton George from Dell

46
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,380
will be stopping by the program

47
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,400
to update us on the Sputnik program,

48
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,960
how things are going,

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,640
the challenges that Chromebooks may pose

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,400
to the Sputnik program,

51
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,360
and much more,

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,240
including a little looking forward.

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
So I'm really looking forward to that chat.

54
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,560
He's coming up in just a little bit,

55
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,600
but before we get there,

56
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,800
we're gonna do a bunch of community news,

57
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,520
some big news for us neon fans.

58
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Microsoft is switching to a service model,

59
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,280
and we wonder how that's gonna affect Linux,

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,100
and then we need to talk about security,

61
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,600
and where it really begins,

62
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,840
and that's at your home router,

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,560
and some open source projects

64
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,680
that can help you achieve better security on your edge.

65
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,560
Then Corita's got some great news,

66
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,500
but you'll never guess

67
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,140
where some of their money's coming from,

68
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,360
and then later on in the show,

69
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,880
after we chat with Barton,

70
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,680
we're gonna wrap it up with not one,

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,000
not two, but yes, my friends, three great app picks,

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,040
because I don't know, sometimes we just go crazy.

73
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,880
You can't stop us.

74
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,560
We were just finding great stuff throughout the week,

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
and we're like, we gotta put that in the show.

76
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,020
We gotta put that in the show.

77
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,520
So there's so much to cover,

78
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,700
and the only thing left to do before we can get into it

79
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,840
is bring in that mumble room.

80
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,760
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

81
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,160
What's up? Hello.

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,080
Good evening.

83
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,560
Hello, good evening, good afternoon, good morning.

84
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,240
As I always say now, time approves,

85
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,360
because it's different for all y'alls,

86
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
and I'm very happy to start the show off

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,820
with some news about one of my favorite,

88
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,900
don't call it a distributions, distributions,

89
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,160
and that's KDE Neon,

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,960
and we've all been kind of wondering,

91
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,880
when's this thing gonna land on an 18.04 base?

92
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,520
KDE Neon, if you're not familiar,

93
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,360
is a rebasing of Ubuntu LTS,

94
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,920
and then they take the latest upstream

95
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,680
plasma desktop components,

96
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,680
cute components, and put it on top of 16.04.

97
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,520
It's great.

98
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,720
So it's just everything that you might want

99
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,440
if you had 16.04 and didn't wanna go through

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
the rigmarole of getting that plasma desktop

101
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,680
set up for yourself.

102
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,400
Yeah, I mean, and its main appeal really is

103
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,880
that you have a stable, predictable 16.04,

104
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,840
or soon 18.04 base, which is kind of boring,

105
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,960
doesn't really change a lot.

106
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
But that good kind of boring.

107
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, exactly, the right kind of boring,

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,160
with a really aggressive, fresh desktop environment,

109
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,600
where the desktop level applications are kept pretty fresh,

110
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,040
and that is a super appealing approach to me,

111
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,280
and now that I'm all in on the plasma desktop,

112
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,080
Neon really fit well in that spot for me.

113
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
But I do admit, since Kubuntu came out based on 18.04,

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,640
really haven't been installing much Neon anymore.

115
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Too little, too late?

116
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,040
Well, no, it's just, if I'm gonna be building systems

117
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,760
that I wanna last for five years,

118
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,840
I would like to base them on 18.04, not 16.04.

119
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,920
Plus, I've been waiting for them to make this transition

120
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,160
to 18.04, so that way I don't really have to weather it.

121
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,480
I still have two Neon systems left in production,

122
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,440
one of them is the one I'm reading this off of right now.

123
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,680
And one of them, the other one is my XPS 13,

124
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
which I've been using extensively on these road trips

125
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,200
and other trips that I've been on.

126
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Do you notice any difference in stability

127
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,440
or upgrade problems or any other maintenance issues

128
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,280
between the two?

129
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,360
I remain to have, actually I have it on three systems

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,480
now that I think about it.

131
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,840
And on one of the three, I have issues

132
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,040
where my background, my desktop goes away,

133
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
certain things break for a little bit,

134
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,160
and then I have to log out and log back in

135
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
to get it to work.

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,820
Nothing major.

137
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,660
Still not great.

138
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,640
Doesn't come up on Kubuntu,

139
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,200
only manifests itself on my Neon systems.

140
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,480
It's not a big deal, it's not the end of the world.

141
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,680
But I am looking forward to them making that transition

142
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,060
to 18.04, and Jonathan Riddle posted over on his blog,

143
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,720
that we'll have linked in the show notes,

144
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,120
that they're getting really close to that now.

145
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,100
They really just have a few things to work out.

146
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
They're testing the ISOs, and then it's some tidying,

147
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,940
and they're done.

148
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,760
They already have a bunch of things

149
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,960
that are kind of working.

150
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,900
Some of it just has to be done a little more officially

151
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,200
instead of like a hack or a script or something.

152
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,460
But it looks pretty good for the Neon distribution,

153
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,720
and 18.04 could be just around the corner.

154
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,160
Then you've got elementary OS,

155
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,200
which is just around the corner with its base on 18.04.

156
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,280
And you now have 18.04.1 that's recently shipped.

157
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,360
So it's a good cycle right now for 18.04.

158
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,820
And in six months, that will start to slow.

159
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,200
In a year, we'll be out of cycle a little bit,

160
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,120
starting to get a little old.

161
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
But right now, it's really in that sweet spot.

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,680
And if you're building a system to last for a few years,

163
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,140
there's not a lot of distributions

164
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,760
that offer a ton of desktop application availability

165
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,640
and five years of support.

166
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,160
So they're really in a powerful position,

167
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,720
more so than they've been in a long time.

168
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,040
And that's not to downplay the competitors,

169
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,240
who are also in a really great position,

170
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,140
and offer a lot of the same functionality

171
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,560
now that Canonical is switching back to GNOME.

172
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,640
But when you combine it with the overall network effect,

173
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,920
the application availability,

174
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,800
the increasing Snap Store availability,

175
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,960
and then these other really nice flavors,

176
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,200
like Kubuntu and Ubuntu Mate, and even Neon,

177
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,720
don't call it a flavor, don't call it a distribution,

178
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
all offer essentially this Ubuntu base

179
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,860
that we all know and understand

180
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,080
with their own fresh takes on it

181
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,120
in a way that I still don't really see happening

182
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,040
in the rest of the Linux distribution world.

183
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,000
Do you agree with that assessment?

184
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Yeah, it's kind of hard to put your finger on,

185
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,960
but when you have that level of consistency

186
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,920
on that far end of just your main core of your system,

187
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,880
it's a part of your mind

188
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
that gets to go to sleep for a while.

189
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,240
You don't have to think too hard about it.

190
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
You kind of focus on everything else

191
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,960
because you don't have to fight like,

192
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,060
oh, nope, on that system I have Phish,

193
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,360
and this system I have Apt, and that one is Pac-Man.

194
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,200
None of it.

195
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,640
I'm not even really saying this as like,

196
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,740
I'm not trying to sell anyone on Ubuntu.

197
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm not trying to advance the Ubuntu agenda here.

198
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,380
It's just an observation that I seem to have realized

199
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,960
is that they have a really strong market here

200
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,240
where they have this LTS base

201
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,100
that these other flavors or derivatives even

202
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,680
that aren't official can base off of,

203
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,600
and as an end user, that's a known quantity.

204
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
It's like a brand almost.

205
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,160
It's like the Ubuntu base is a known brand

206
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,280
that you can recognize as an end user.

207
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,880
It makes you maybe a little more comfortable

208
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,440
in other degrees of uncertainty or customization

209
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,280
because you're like, okay,

210
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,360
well, they're not going to mess it up so bad.

211
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,760
It's still going to be a great Ubuntu LTS base.

212
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,600
That's what I was, yeah,

213
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,440
that's exactly what I was trying to get to.

214
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
Again, I don't say that to detract

215
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,060
from like what the work Fedora is doing

216
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,000
or OpenSUSE and Arch, and look at Antigros.

217
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,040
I love Antigros.

218
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,440
Or Manjaro, all of that's really kind of the same thing,

219
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,800
but nothing has the market penetration that Ubuntu has.

220
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,520
And in my personal opinion,

221
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,240
if you're going to go with one of these Ubuntu derivatives,

222
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,120
Ubuntu, Monte, Elementary, and KDE Neon

223
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,620
are like the best of the best, really.

224
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,800
Not to take away from the other flavors,

225
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,040
but man, if I don't just-

226
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,960
You get some pretty unique setups and experiences

227
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,280
even being in this one family.

228
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,120
Yes.

229
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,680
I find it funny that you don't mention Ubuntu,

230
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,160
you know, main classic, whatever you want to call it,

231
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,720
just known, like you're all about the flavors.

232
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,160
I think when you're talking about trying to get a unique

233
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,960
kind of interesting take on the Linux desktop

234
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,640
that's truly different than anything you see other places,

235
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,080
that's where these other flavors or derivatives come in.

236
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
Not to take away from the great work

237
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,760
that's happening in mainline Ubuntu.

238
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,120
I got love for it all today, I really do.

239
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,120
But it's hard to beat those three

240
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,320
kind of standout derivatives or flavors,

241
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,800
whatever you want to call it.

242
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,560
This is all kind of academic though,

243
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,960
compared to what the Windows world may be going through

244
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,600
in the next couple of years.

245
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,640
Microsoft is making some big changes

246
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,400
and they're getting ready, I should say,

247
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,400
to replace Windows 10 with the Microsoft Managed Desktop.

248
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,920
This will be a desktop as a service offering.

249
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,160
Instead of owning Windows, you would rent it by the month.

250
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,780
The acronym for this is DAS, D-A-A-S,

251
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,280
and it's not really new.

252
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,480
Citrix has been doing this, VMware has been doing this.

253
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
I think Amazon offers, yeah.

254
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,100
But the Microsoft Managed Desktop is a new take on it.

255
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,680
It avoids the latency problem

256
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,160
of other desktop as a service offerings

257
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
by keeping the bulk of the operating system on your PC.

258
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
But you would no longer be in charge of the PCOS

259
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,800
or the hardware itself.

260
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,360
Instead it would be automatically provisioned by Microsoft

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,580
and then maintained by Microsoft.

262
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,160
Now that is very vague,

263
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,800
so I wanted to get some more details on this.

264
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,960
So I went over to Mary Jo Foley's blog

265
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,840
and she actually got a Microsoft representative

266
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,660
on the record.

267
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,500
Really?

268
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,540
So this is some serious stuff here.

269
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,360
This isn't just like hearsay.

270
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,840
Let's see, let me see the name of this guy.

271
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,800
Do you see the name of this guy here in this article?

272
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,520
I think that's probably relevant,

273
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,620
but I'll read it and then if we see it, I'll call it out.

274
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,280
But it turns out, she says,

275
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,160
Mary Jo Foley writes,

276
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm hearing that Microsoft Managed Desktop

277
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,880
is basically the Microsoft version of desktop as a service.

278
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,520
It will provide customers with the ability

279
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,440
to lease Windows 10 devices

280
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,800
that automatically are provisioned for them

281
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,160
and have the operating system kept up to date

282
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,080
for more than a single monthly fee,

283
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,680
up to date for no more than a single monthly fee

284
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,000
or something like that.

285
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,920
Now here's what she writes

286
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,320
that I think is the more insightful bit to this article.

287
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,360
Oh, and by the way,

288
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,320
the contact that she spoke to at Microsoft

289
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,440
was the director of the Windows Insider Program

290
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
and OS Fundamentals team,

291
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,960
Bill Kagarugas or something.

292
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,080
It looks like Kangarugas,

293
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
but do you see that, do you see that name?

294
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,400
K-A-R-G-O-U.

295
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,040
K-A-R-G-O-U-N-S maybe, I don't know.

296
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,680
But he's the director of the Windows Insider Program

297
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,860
and OS Fundamentals team.

298
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,480
So that's where she's getting this from.

299
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,800
And so she says, here's the thing to think about,

300
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,080
is Microsoft already has a number of the pieces in place

301
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,120
to make this happen.

302
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,800
This past year, Microsoft has been broadening availability

303
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,680
of its Windows Autopilot Automatic Device

304
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,240
provisioning service.

305
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,280
It's been honing its device financing skills

306
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,960
with programs like Surface Plus

307
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
and Surface Plus for Business,

308
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,760
so there's a leasing aspect of the hardware there,

309
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,520
as well as Surface as a Service leasing program.

310
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,880
I didn't even know they were offering Surface as a service.

311
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,720
Me either.

312
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,120
Boy, they love their acronyms.

313
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,960
And it currently offers Windows 10, Office 365,

314
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,560
and the Intune device management and security products

315
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,600
from the Microsoft subscription bundle,

316
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,280
all for one low monthly price.

317
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,300
They've been working to put all of this together

318
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,820
into a new service.

319
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,600
This is what the director of Windows Insider Program

320
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,860
talked about, he said,

321
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,160
they're in charge of what's being called the Microsoft

322
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,120
Managed Desktop.

323
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,800
That's what he's been, he's been put in charge of that.

324
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,800
And they're bringing these existing sort of separate

325
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,080
programs that they have together under one umbrella program

326
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,920
and then offering it to consumers.

327
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
So this is a lot of Microsoft news, Chris.

328
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,600
What does it mean to me, the Linux unplugged listener

329
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
who was trying to escape?

330
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,220
That's the big, big question is,

331
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,000
do we just have a whole new value story now for Linux?

332
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,600
Did Microsoft just give us a whole new value proposition

333
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,360
in that you download a free desktop,

334
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,520
and you install it on your hardware,

335
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
and then you get free updates for life.

336
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,440
No subscription required, you know, you can use,

337
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,520
you can use Dropbox with your LibreOffice,

338
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,980
you could use your Google Drive, you could use NextCloud,

339
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,480
like whatever syncing service you want to use.

340
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,720
The only thing is, these people that will be buying this

341
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,220
are paying for convenience.

342
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,360
That's the market, right?

343
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,320
I mean, it's like leasing a car, you know, you're like,

344
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,360
I want the abilities that you're offering,

345
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,160
and I don't want to have to think about how you implement it

346
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,440
or how it happens under the hood.

347
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,880
Yeah, and they want it to just work.

348
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,160
They want the device to show up on their desk and just work.

349
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,880
So the problem with the Linux approach

350
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,580
is you can argue on the money side,

351
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,240
but then you can't really successfully argue the tool side

352
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
because if the user has to implement

353
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,680
their own cloud syncing service,

354
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,520
if the user has to implement their own office suite,

355
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,080
if the user has to implement their own email client,

356
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,880
and they have to set all these things up.

357
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,400
You're going to have to offset it with training

358
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,120
or dedicated staff or...

359
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,280
Contractors or something.

360
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
And so what they're offering here is,

361
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,560
well, you'll use Office 365, obviously.

362
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
Of course you will.

363
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
You'd use our Edivirus product,

364
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,960
you'd use our mail services,

365
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,240
you would use our...

366
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,520
You probably get a couple of Azure credits

367
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,360
to get you set up there too.

368
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,200
Why not?

369
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,160
I think for some markets, it'll make Linux more attractive,

370
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,080
but I don't think for all of the markets we'd hope.

371
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,360
I wonder, I feel like we've been talking about it

372
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,560
maybe from a lot of the enterprise use case,

373
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,880
but is there a security angle for people running it at home

374
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,680
that maybe might have a better experience with Windows?

375
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
I wonder if we shouldn't flip the question around

376
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,040
and propose it to Brent as this.

377
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,040
So if I could come to Brent and say for $45 a month,

378
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,920
ah, let's make it 50.

379
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,280
Let's make it kind of hurt a little bit.

380
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,840
So for 50 bucks a month, you get a fully managed,

381
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,280
fully set up, fairly high-end Ubuntu 18.04 device

382
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,760
that you choose what kind of screen, that kind of stuff.

383
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,200
If you set some of the basic parameters

384
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,800
and that sets your monthly billing.

385
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,480
With that is included Google Drive storage,

386
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,880
all access to Google apps

387
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
that are all branded under this initiative.

388
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,000
So you pay 50 bucks a month, Brent.

389
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,440
Every two years, you get a brand new Linux 18.04 machine

390
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,200
with every cloud service pre-provisioned,

391
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,120
pre-paid for, pre-setup.

392
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Would you do something like that

393
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,320
or would you prefer to buy the machine once

394
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,760
and then set all that stuff up yourself

395
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,380
and pay for the individual services ad hoc?

396
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,120
I love that question because I was gonna ask you,

397
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,200
I was just gonna comment, well, in the Linux case,

398
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,220
we can say that you actually own your hardware

399
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,620
and your software in a way

400
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,080
because you have control over it, right?

401
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,880
But now that you asked me that question,

402
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,800
it kind of changes my outlook on it

403
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,180
because actually I think the convenience

404
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,180
to having a monthly fee to just have everything taken care

405
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,520
for you from hopefully someone you trust, right?

406
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,280
I think that's a big one.

407
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,200
Yeah, I was thinking like, imagine like it's system 76

408
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,080
running this program or something.

409
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,640
I think it reduces the barrier to entry for Linux,

410
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,800
first of all, if you had that kind of option,

411
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,840
but also just for technology, period.

412
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,080
Because if all of these services are already

413
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,240
all configured for you and updated,

414
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,960
then there's a real security benefit there

415
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,400
and a hands-off that might be nice for the end user.

416
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,240
Like we're already used to paying for various services,

417
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,480
like phone stuff and things like that.

418
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,780
There's obvious markets for it

419
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,820
if they have a surface as a service program.

420
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,240
And this is a big appeal to Chromebooks.

421
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,580
Let's not forget how successful Chromebooks have been.

422
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,080
They're essentially a managed device

423
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,200
in a less structured form than Microsoft is offering here.

424
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,240
And thinking about it, when Brent was answering,

425
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,360
I was thinking to myself, well, why wouldn't I do that

426
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,500
for my studio systems?

427
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,440
Imagine if I could just have these

428
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,120
three or four Kubuntu systems.

429
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,200
Well, okay, one, two, three, yeah,

430
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,040
four, five Kubuntu systems.

431
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,880
I mean, I'd still consider paying 50 bucks a month

432
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,120
if it meant I could get decent new hardware

433
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,760
that had a consistent support contract all the time.

434
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
I think I might do that.

435
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,160
I don't know for sure.

436
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,880
But for the business case, I can totally see it.

437
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,800
I would definitely be compelled

438
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,760
to at least run the numbers, don't you think, Brent?

439
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,200
I think you'd be silly not to consider it.

440
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,280
I do wonder, and maybe the Mumble Room

441
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,520
has something to say about this,

442
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,000
but I wonder if we think that Linux

443
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,720
would be ready for something like this.

444
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,800
Yeah, and who would deliver that?

445
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,260
And how would you deliver it?

446
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,160
I would like a ThinkPad as a service.

447
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,120
Well, I mean, as a small business owner,

448
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,140
I've really been considering something like this.

449
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,320
And I've been educating myself on SaltStack.

450
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,120
And with everything being in a file in Linux,

451
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,680
you can take something like Puppet or SaltStack

452
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,920
or something like that, and you can deploy a desktop

453
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,800
just as easily as you could deploy a server.

454
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,240
And then you're just restoring users' configuration files

455
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,900
in their home directory and their.files.

456
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,320
So this is actually something I've been considering

457
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
as a potential way to grow my business

458
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,400
into something self-supporting.

459
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,240
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,200
That does make it so much nicer to support end users

461
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,400
when compared to something that has like a registry

462
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,360
or something like that.

463
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,080
It's just a totally different level.

464
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,360
Well, and then when your user goes

465
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,080
and breaks their system inevitably,

466
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,920
then you just rerun your recipe

467
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,480
that redeploys their desktop.

468
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,940
And within five minutes, they've got a brand new

469
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,600
working image that's already connected

470
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,080
to their network drive,

471
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,320
because no one saves anything onto their local disk, right?

472
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,520
Yeah, yeah, I can tell they do.

473
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,280
But going back to the Microsoft story,

474
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,800
my gut, here's why I think it's gonna be a good thing

475
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,900
for Linux, because my gut wants it to happen.

476
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,080
Because I think like, deep down,

477
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,120
like it feels like that's a win for Linux somehow.

478
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,320
Like anytime you make Windows more ongoing expensive,

479
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,960
I feel like you're making people constantly

480
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,720
reevaluate its worth.

481
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,840
Whereas if I just buy it like once every five years,

482
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,680
like say I'm a corporate IT environment,

483
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,920
I'm either subscribing to the large bulk licenses,

484
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,320
the volume licenses, or I'm refreshing my machines

485
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,960
if I'm aggressive every few years,

486
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,720
but probably more likely every five to 10 years.

487
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,960
And that's when I'm addressing the license problem.

488
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,840
As a business, that's not an unmanageable expense,

489
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,720
especially because they are productivity tools,

490
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,120
like they're necessary for the job.

491
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,800
Right, and you can probably find a good quarter

492
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
where it makes the most sense,

493
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,720
and okay, yes, we'll buy a big bulk here,

494
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,480
we didn't spend as much elsewhere.

495
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,200
But when it's a line item every month that you're...

496
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,280
You're looking at that going,

497
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,560
well, what are we paying for?

498
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,340
Because that's what we're paying for all the time now,

499
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,160
and it's a per head cost now.

500
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,400
And that adds up, that makes a difference.

501
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,960
You can write monthly costs off as OpEx rather than CapEx,

502
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,120
so that's better for tax purposes.

503
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,080
Yeah, there are advantages.

504
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,920
Plus, if you wrap in licensing and you wrap in cloud storage,

505
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,840
it's probably likely to be cheaper,

506
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,400
but that bundling only gets you so far,

507
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,840
like the cable industry knows that too.

508
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,360
So I think, I mean, it also really depends

509
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,440
on just how easy is it to administer,

510
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,400
what's the customer service aspect like?

511
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
I wonder if this isn't the real cost

513
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
of Windows 10 being free.

514
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,520
I have thought this from the moment they announced it

515
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,640
as free, I always thought this.

516
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,080
And why they've encouraged it,

517
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
why they've called it the last version of Windows.

518
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,200
I think this has been in the works

519
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,440
since Balmer was running the place.

520
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,760
And now they've just kind of figured out

521
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,560
how to put it all together by having different experiments

522
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,400
with the Surface Books and their different services

523
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,360
that have given them some experience.

524
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,280
They managed to do it pretty well with Office 365.

525
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,160
So it's just another checkbox on a feature list.

526
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,440
I was just about to say, we're gonna move on,

527
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,040
but then it dawned on me too, as a Linux user,

528
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,480
what if the price was legitimately affordable?

529
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,160
So let's just say for a moment, it's like,

530
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,520
I mean, it's not gonna be this,

531
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,640
but let's just say for $25 a month,

532
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,440
you could get like a pretty decent Windows 10 device

533
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,600
in your home.

534
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,080
As a Linux user, I might consider that

535
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,640
just so I have a Windows machine from time to time.

536
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,720
And to be honest with you,

537
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,960
that's dropping whatever it is,

538
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,160
100, 200 bucks on Windows 10 Professional,

539
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,080
has been a barrier for me.

540
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,920
I just don't wanna do it.

541
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,480
I just can't bring myself to do it.

542
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
Well, look at cell phones.

543
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,680
Yeah, exactly.

544
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,120
You pay, I don't know how much in the states,

545
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,720
100 bucks a month, but that includes cell connection.

546
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,920
So if you're paying half that for your connection

547
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,080
and half that for the device every month,

548
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,000
a laptop probably costs the same or less

549
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,120
to make than a phone.

550
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,080
So yeah, it's possible, definitely.

551
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
Yeah, it could be.

552
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,920
All right, all right.

553
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,760
I saw JJ had some more thoughts,

554
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
but we'll save them for the post-show.

555
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,800
Let's move on.

556
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,160
We don't need to talk about Microsoft that much more.

557
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,440
I think that's probably good.

558
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,320
And I wanna talk about security for a moment.

559
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,120
I wanna talk about something that has been very apparent

560
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,680
on the TechSnap program for a while.

561
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,600
This is a very TechSnap program topic.

562
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,640
So if you're into this kind of stuff,

563
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,920
check out TechSnap.systems.

564
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,160
But in recent days, the VPN filter malware

565
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,320
has been attracting a lot of attention,

566
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,680
much of it in the wake of the May 25th

567
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,040
public service announcement by the FBI

568
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,800
that was also covered by a number of announcements

569
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
from vendors and security companies

570
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,880
around routers being susceptible to an issue.

571
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,240
You might recall the FBI issuing a recommendation

572
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,200
to need to be rebooted.

573
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,440
They were susceptible to runtime malware.

574
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,360
And if you restarted and they reinitialized from the ROM,

575
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,160
the malware would be gone, but they may remain vulnerable.

576
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,200
So Cisco's threat blog posted on VPN filter a while ago.

577
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,120
We covered it in TechSnap,

578
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,760
but they do provide some good details

579
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,480
on devices' impact by this vulnerability,

580
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,760
which affected around 500,000 networking devices worldwide.

581
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,360
Yeah, it works a lot in the way like the Mirai,

582
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,040
Marie, Mirai botnet,

583
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,560
where it specifically goes after home routers.

584
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,480
It also uses several zero-day exploits

585
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,560
that the lazy vendors just haven't patched

586
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,680
that have been known about now.

587
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
Turns out that works really well.

588
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah, among the reported vendors impacted by VPN filter

589
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,360
are Linksys and Netgear,

590
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,520
which is 77% of the home router market just right there,

591
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,040
Linksys and Netgear. Wow.

592
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,400
Yeah, and by just exploiting typical vulnerabilities,

593
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,240
you can get access to a lot of stuff

594
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,560
on these two devices in the wild,

595
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,200
including redirecting your DNS to their DNS servers

596
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,720
and all kinds of really kind of nasty things

597
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,880
that you can do when you're in a trusted position

598
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,960
on the edge of the network.

599
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,560
It's the new holy grail too,

600
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,600
because so many of you bastards out there

601
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,760
are using Linux and Android devices,

602
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,960
and you're not using Windows XP and Windows CE devices,

603
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,040
and they can't keep writing malware for Windows

604
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,880
and get to everybody.

605
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,920
You're just making it too hard.

606
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,760
Jerks.

607
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
Especially you Mac users and you iOS users.

608
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,080
Don't even get me started.

609
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,960
So why not go after the thing

610
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,920
that y'all have to route through?

611
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,680
And that is the router.

612
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,320
And that's whenever you want to talk out to the internet,

613
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,640
you got to go through that little bastard.

614
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,280
So that's the thing they're going after now.

615
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,840
And so we should talk about security right at that spot,

616
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,440
at the edge of your network.

617
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,280
That's where security has to begin.

618
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,800
And that's why open source at that part of your network,

619
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,480
I think is maybe one of the most critical spots.

620
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,480
If nothing else, then as a remedy to vendor negligence.

621
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,160
I think that's fairly,

622
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,840
because with these open source projects,

623
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,200
as long as the project's alive, they're issuing updates.

624
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,840
It's at least an escape hatch in a world of...

625
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,800
For a long time,

626
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,640
it's gotten a little bit better perhaps these days,

627
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,920
but for a long time, just not very many great options.

628
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,800
No.

629
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,800
So OpenWRT 1806 has just come out today.

630
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,800
And it's a significant release because it's the first one

631
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,520
since the OpenWRT and LEDE projects decided to merge.

632
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,560
Wow, that is a big deal.

633
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,400
Yeah.

634
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
And so now this is their combined effort

635
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,200
under the OpenWRT umbrella.

636
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,040
We're back together.

637
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,200
Yeah, that is great, right?

638
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,320
It's been, we talked about this two years ago.

639
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,160
Wow.

640
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,000
That's how long it's been,

641
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,720
which it doesn't feel like it's been that long, but yeah.

642
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,200
So the Linux Embedded Development Environment

643
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,200
and OpenWRT came together and now we have OpenWRT 1806,

644
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,200
which is replacing 1505.

645
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,440
So it's a pretty big jump there

646
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,000
because it's a combination of LEDE 1701 and OpenWRT 1505.

647
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,680
So they just went right to 1806.

648
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,200
It adds support for network flow offloading,

649
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
which is bad ass,

650
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,120
modernizes support for some of Atheros chipsets,

651
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,480
a bunch of kernel updates and package updates

652
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,840
among other areas of improvement.

653
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,000
And we'll have links in the show notes

654
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,080
so you can check it out.

655
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,000
This is the kind of thing where it's a simple step.

656
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,640
I mean, if you've got a good hardware vendor

657
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,920
who's updating your firmware

658
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,560
and you feel pretty comfortable in it,

659
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,920
then more power to you.

660
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,320
That's great.

661
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,840
But this has been the solution I've taken in the past.

662
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,960
You and I were also recently talking about

663
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,040
maybe checking out some more Microtech stuff,

664
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,880
but this is really nice.

665
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,560
And they have a wide range.

666
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,920
It really comes down to the chips in your box.

667
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,760
So you got it.

668
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,440
I think you can also sometimes find a nice middle ground

669
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,360
where like, if you can set up an OpenSense or PF sense box,

670
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,000
great if you know how to set up your own router

671
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,200
from running whatever Unix-like

672
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
or Unix-based operating system,

673
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
also great if you know how to do that,

674
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,680
but you might just be someone who's already invested

675
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,560
in one of the common router brands,

676
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,400
but you know someone who listens to this show

677
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,240
or whatever else,

678
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,000
and you can go through, spend a Sunday,

679
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,840
get that on there,

680
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,040
and then not have to buy a new device,

681
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,480
but have more control

682
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,720
and have a better, more secure platform.

683
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,240
You should be able to be completely done

684
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,400
by the time you've finished a Linux Unplugged podcast,

685
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,280
I think.

686
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,800
So try that out.

687
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,760
Like Wes said, maybe help out a family member.

688
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,200
There's other solutions, obviously.

689
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,680
We could list so many other possibilities.

690
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,120
You guys know I'm a big fan of PF sense,

691
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,720
but if you've got hardware

692
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
that is one of these devices,

693
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,040
one of these 77% of the devices in the market

694
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,880
that is possible to load OpenWRT on,

695
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,160
maybe it's just time.

696
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,720
Because these, like on Tech Snip,

697
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,160
we're constantly talking about back doors

698
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,040
and all this stuff that even with Linux on there

699
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,880
or BusyBox on there,

700
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,480
they still just screw up the basic implementations.

701
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,600
It's not enough that it's based on Linux.

702
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,640
It has to be well implemented.

703
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,480
For some reason, they just,

704
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,160
the firmware developers just don't feel comfortable

705
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,240
unless you've got a unsecured telnet port open

706
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,080
at all times.

707
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,520
And it's just like baked in, baked in usernames and passwords.

708
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,160
One of my favorites that we talked about on Tech Snip

709
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,640
was the root password was just the MAC address

710
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,520
of the network card.

711
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,600
So if you knew the MAC address of the router

712
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,440
and then you just copy and pasted that,

713
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,960
say from your terminal,

714
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,200
and you could just paste that in the password

715
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,520
and log right in, is root.

716
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,360
Makes it easy.

717
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,160
And there's, but there's even ones where there's like,

718
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,720
no, no password necessary.

719
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,960
Absolutely no password necessary.

720
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Just knock on the door.

721
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,920
There has literally been some,

722
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,320
it's like you knock on this port

723
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,400
on a certain amount of times

724
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
and you just get telnet root access.

725
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,320
Have that at Haas.

726
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
It's really something.

727
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,760
So yeah, you gotta go replace these things.

728
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,760
But you really do still have to keep them up to date.

729
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,760
You do still have to implement best practices.

730
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,360
It's not just a matter of the firmware,

731
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,120
but getting something open source,

732
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,160
supported by a community that gets frequent updates

733
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,440
is a good first step.

734
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,160
That's how I look at it.

735
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,600
Corita is getting some decent funding

736
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,680
and it's allowing for one of their developers to go,

737
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,400
if not full-time, near full-time.

738
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,160
Now, Corita's been publishing,

739
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,920
wow, this is another Microsoft story, really,

740
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,760
if you think about it.

741
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,000
Corita's been publishing to the Windows Store

742
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,200
for quite some time.

743
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,480
Not quite a year,

744
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,760
but they've updated their store listing almost 20 times.

745
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,360
And by far, the majority of users get Corita

746
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,200
from the website,

747
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
about 30,000 downloads a week from their website.

748
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,800
Nice. Yeah.

749
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,880
The store downloads from Microsoft's store

750
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,640
are about 125 a week.

751
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,440
Still though, the income that has been generated

752
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,680
by the Windows Store makes it possible

753
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,240
for the Corita maintainer to work on Corita full-time,

754
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,440
which would never have been possible otherwise.

755
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,680
Interesting.

756
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,600
30,000 downloads from their website

757
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,680
and they couldn't make enough money to go full-time.

758
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,760
125 downloads a week from the Microsoft store

759
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,240
and they're going full-time.

760
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,680
It's an interesting different philosophy

761
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,800
when you're in that app store idea, right?

762
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,040
I mean, you can easily send donations

763
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,240
through their main website,

764
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,920
but I guess you're just in that mindset of ready to...

765
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,280
Well, it's price per download, right?

766
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,960
So in the Windows Store, you pay a little bit.

767
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,920
And you expect to.

768
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,760
Yeah.

769
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,680
And it makes open source development

770
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,200
of a pretty important open source application

771
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,880
that is competitive with things from Adobe possible.

772
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,680
I just wonder if we should just take a moment

773
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
and reflect on that.

774
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,160
Because to me, it seems like there's a big lesson

775
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,520
to learn from that.

776
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,800
And I think about what the App Center,

777
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,520
what elementary OS is doing with the App Center.

778
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,360
I think it's also interesting

779
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,920
because the article goes on to discuss

780
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,440
some of the problems they've had in that environment.

781
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,520
And maybe that is why we do need

782
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
more open source friendly things

783
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,400
like the App Store and other efforts.

784
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,240
Yeah, they talk about being powerless.

785
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,680
They talk about all the rules that are made by the store.

786
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,120
And if there's one particular store rule

787
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,560
that gets interpreted the wrong way,

788
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,760
the curators can just decide,

789
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,280
you know what, no good.

790
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,040
And if you're not native English,

791
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,760
then it makes it even harder

792
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,360
to then communicate with the store curators.

793
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,240
And sometimes things can be just simply misunderstood

794
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,560
because of a language barrier.

795
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,040
So what's the answer then?

796
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,840
If you have an uncurated store,

797
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,080
like the AUR or like the snap repositories, et cetera,

798
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,080
you end up with crypto software in there.

799
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,880
I mean, there has to be somebody somewhere,

800
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,840
I think, verifying these packages

801
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,320
and maintaining that trust.

802
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,080
Is it that or is it there's a price?

803
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,760
You know, I mean, really.

804
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Nothing says that cryptoware doesn't sneak into these stores

805
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,320
from time to time that are curated.

806
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
But I think for Corita, the big difference here is

807
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,280
if you wanna download it from the Windows Store,

808
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,480
if you want that convenience, you gotta pay a little money.

809
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,680
I don't have the Windows Store on me.

810
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,920
So, oh, here it is, it's $9.79.

811
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,520
If you wanna download it from the Windows Store,

812
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,840
you have to pay $9.79.

813
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,400
And 125 a week, they can go full time.

814
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,520
That seems to be the crux of the issue.

815
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,920
That's an uncomfortable thing, I think,

816
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,760
because the numbers are devastating.

817
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,840
30,000 downloads, right?

818
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,480
I mean, if you look at this show, right?

819
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,600
This show will get that.

820
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,360
And then you look at our Patreon,

821
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,520
which this is just always how it works, right?

822
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,360
You look at the Patreon,

823
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,160
there's much less than that on the Patreon.

824
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,800
Totally understandable, because we're also ad supported.

825
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,640
But I think there is a massive difference

826
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,680
when something's free and just available online.

827
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,920
The return you get, I think,

828
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,800
is probably often less than a percent.

829
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,040
What do you think about this, Brent?

830
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,800
Trying to imagine for myself what would happen

831
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,520
if those 30,000 weekly downloads went through

832
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,200
a similar app store and gave them a similar revenue.

833
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,880
That would be huge for an open source project like this

834
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
who's trying to really break some ground.

835
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,800
Yeah.

836
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,120
Arthur, you were mentioning too

837
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,640
that there's an open source game

838
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,920
that sort of struggles with the same issue,

839
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,640
perhaps even on a larger scale.

840
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,240
There's actually several open source games.

841
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,880
I'm involved in one of them.

842
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,040
But recently I talked with a 080 developer.

843
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:33,040
And they have about 100K downloads a year.

844
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,120
But they only get about $90 per month in donations.

845
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,240
And they have $100 per month in server costs.

846
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,040
So they're going negative each month.

847
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,520
Yeah, boy, that is some bad math.

848
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,920
So 100,000 downloads a year

849
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,880
and they're making 90 bucks a month?

850
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,560
Yeah, that's not gonna work, is it?

851
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,440
They have some slack

852
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,680
because they did some donation drives a while ago.

853
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,680
But still, it's very discouraging for them

854
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,680
and for us with our game.

855
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,680
So, especially since there are so many people

856
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,040
happy to buy early access games for Linux,

857
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,000
but not happy to donate to a free game.

858
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,320
So this issue that we're touching on in part

859
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,120
is often why when people ask me,

860
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,440
why do you want more users on the Linux desktop?

861
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,520
Why do you want Slack on the Linux desktop

862
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,480
if it means a slow electron proprietary service application?

863
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,120
Then what's the point of having a free desktop?

864
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,480
Why have new users at the cost

865
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,360
of gaining proprietary applications?

866
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,080
And this is my answer.

867
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,600
Having a larger user base on Linux,

868
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
on the desktop in particular,

869
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,200
facilitates an economy to pay developers to do hard work.

870
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,000
And as a user base grows,

871
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,760
the demand for more sophisticated applications

872
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,920
that connect to more sophisticated services will also grow.

873
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,160
And if we don't have a way to facilitate financing this work,

874
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,480
the people that are capable of doing that work

875
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,440
are gonna go get paid to do it somewhere else.

876
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,120
And I think it's a bit of egg on our face

877
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,280
that the fricking Microsoft Windows store

878
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,400
is now paying to make creative development possible.

879
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,920
And I also can't sit here and say the solution

880
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,040
is that every developer should go to Patreon

881
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,680
or something like that because that's not gonna scale either.

882
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,080
We're getting patron out at this point.

883
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,560
Let's be honest, everybody is.

884
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm getting a little tapped out myself

885
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,480
and I'm still trying to support people.

886
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,400
The reality is we have to facilitate some mechanism

887
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,800
to reward hard work.

888
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,600
A value for value model has to exist

889
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,480
for free and open source software.

890
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,480
And I think that's in part why I follow

891
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,760
what Daniel and the team at Elementary OS

892
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,200
are doing with such interest

893
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,880
because that is at least a possible solution.

894
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,240
It might not be your favorite solution,

895
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,640
but they are definitely trying and innovating in that space.

896
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,880
It's an incubator of what could perhaps work

897
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,840
on a wider scale someday.

898
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,720
And I don't know if that's the right solution,

899
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,960
but maybe what's going on with Carita

900
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,880
gives us some perspective.

901
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,840
Especially exploring things of,

902
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,640
it's still open source, still free,

903
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,240
but maybe there's a few hurdles

904
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,080
or it's not the thing that you find the easiest anymore.

905
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,520
You're more encouraged to donate.

906
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,400
There's a lot of different angles

907
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,880
and I think we'll have to adapt to that

908
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,120
and the philosophy of it as a community.

909
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,960
Yeah.

910
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
So let's talk about how to grow that user base,

911
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,080
especially when it comes to the hardware side

912
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,360
with Mr. Barton George.

913
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,960
So let's bring Barton in just a moment.

914
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,840
But first, I wanna thank DigitalOcean

915
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,560
for making this episode possible.

916
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,000
Go to do.co slash unplugged

917
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,680
and get a $100 credit for 60 days over at DigitalOcean.

918
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,160
That's do.co slash unplugged.

919
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,480
So many great open source projects

920
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,480
are provided infrastructure by DigitalOcean

921
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,800
to take care of the hassle of the backend infrastructure

922
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,520
and just let them get work done.

923
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,320
And you can do the same thing.

924
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,480
It's easy to get set up, less than 55 seconds.

925
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,880
The dashboard's crazy great and easy.

926
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
They have an API that's well documented

927
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,760
and tons of open source applications

928
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,680
are already built around that you can just start using.

929
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,360
One click deployments for tons of great open source

930
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,920
entire stacks of applications

931
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,000
or just deploy the base rig.

932
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,440
They got just about every distribution

933
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,640
you'd wanna run in a server.

934
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,120
My favorite system has four gigs of RAM,

935
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,160
two CPUs, 80 gigabytes of enterprise grade SSDs,

936
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,120
three terabytes of them transfers for three cents an hour.

937
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,560
Now every system has enterprise grade SSDs.

938
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,200
They've all got 40 gigabit connections

939
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,160
coming to the hypervisors,

940
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,000
data centers all over the world,

941
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,120
cloud firewalls that block the traffic

942
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,040
at the network level

943
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,680
so they never even have to hit your rig,

944
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,920
monitoring and alerting built in and much, much more.

945
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,200
But instead of listening to me go on about it,

946
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,720
just go try it.

947
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,960
Just try it.

948
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,880
Maybe spin up a project

949
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,320
you've been wanting to work with for a while.

950
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,400
Something you wanna learn about

951
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,920
or something you wanna put in production.

952
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,080
dio.co slash unplugged

953
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,400
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

954
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,120
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

955
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,160
Wes and I often experiment with different things

956
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,000
on DigitalOcean,

957
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,200
just sort of like when we're prepping for a show.

958
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,400
Awesome, all the time.

959
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,960
I know, it's fun.

960
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,520
dio.co slash unplugged.

961
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,000
Also a huge, huge thank you to Linux Academy

962
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,080
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

963
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,920
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

964
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,760
You can sign up for a free seven day trial

965
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,000
and support the show.

966
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,400
This is a platform to learn everything about Linux

967
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,120
and the huge industry around Linux now.

968
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,080
Everything that runs Linux or Linux runs on,

969
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
they basically have coursework for that

970
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,160
from the essentials around Linux,

971
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,240
which just got a refresh today

972
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,760
or the big topics like AWS and Azure and OpenStack

973
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,160
and the nitty gritties

974
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,920
and now also really a lot of great content around security.

975
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,360
But something that I don't talk about very often

976
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,880
and maybe something you should be made aware of

977
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,960
is they have a really epic team system.

978
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,800
So if you're in an IT department

979
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,200
or if you're at a business that wants to train up new staff

980
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,360
or have staff get up to date on something

981
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,960
or just provide continuing education,

982
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,760
Linux Academy will work with your business

983
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
to set up a team plan for all of them

984
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
where there's metrics for you to look at

985
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,680
and all kinds of cool dashboard stuff for you

986
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,960
and you get to work hands-on with a salesperson

987
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
that can actually help you

988
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,040
get the right stuff for your business.

989
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,080
Like it's a full professional package

990
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,520
that I don't normally talk about

991
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,480
because normally I'm talking to you individuals out there,

992
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,280
but this is something to consider too

993
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,200
is if your work is interested in something like that,

994
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,840
you might pass that along to them

995
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,000
because that was a big area

996
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,880
that I didn't realize that they operate in,

997
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,560
but it makes total sense.

998
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,440
It would be awesome as an IT department

999
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,720
to have that as a resource.

1000
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,960
So today Linux Academy launched a whole bunch of new content.

1001
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,640
They've been doing this for over a month now,

1002
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,160
been releasing more and more.

1003
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,200
They were claiming 150 new bits of content.

1004
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,320
I think it's over 200.

1005
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
I mean, I think they just way overshot.

1006
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,880
They under-promised and over-delivered.

1007
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,760
Today they just updated the LPI DevOps tools

1008
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,440
engineer certification,

1009
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,800
as well as a ton of other Azure and other great things

1010
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,160
like just basic Chef courseware.

1011
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Nice. Yeah.

1012
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,160
I'm gonna link in the show notes the link to the video

1013
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,640
because I think they had like the chief community guy on

1014
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,560
from Chef on the live stream.

1015
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,280
And they just streamed this earlier today

1016
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,760
where they announced like the new Azure concepts courseware,

1017
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,000
the Microsoft Exam 705033,

1018
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,360
which is implementing Microsoft Azure infrastructure solutions

1019
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,640
and a whole bunch of Linux Essentials,

1020
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,840
certified Jenkins engineer courseware,

1021
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,360
just a ton of stuff.

1022
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,120
And like I said, the Chef community guy

1023
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,400
all got announced today.

1024
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,240
So check that out.

1025
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,800
I'll have a link in the show notes at Linux Unplugged

1026
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,680
slash 260 and get started at Linux Academy

1027
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,800
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1028
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,480
And a massive thank you to Ting

1029
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,760
for all of the years of keeping this show on the road,

1030
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,720
literally while I'm on the road

1031
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,760
and while I'm figuratively on the road,

1032
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,840
like, I don't know,

1033
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,360
maybe I'm just out of the office mentally,

1034
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,760
but they've still kept me on the road.

1035
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,600
You know what I'm saying?

1036
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,440
They're so good.

1037
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,260
They just know what's happening.

1038
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,280
They really do because it's smarter than unlimited wireless.

1039
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,020
If you use less, you pay less.

1040
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,560
And it's just $6 for a line.

1041
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,280
And then when you need it, it's there.

1042
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,600
Holy crap has that been useful.

1043
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,880
The average Ting bill is just 23 bucks per phone per month.

1044
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,080
Cause it's paid for what you use wireless,

1045
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,240
minutes, messages, megabytes, whatever you use,

1046
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,080
that's what you pay.

1047
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,080
$6 for the line and then just your usage on top of that.

1048
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,200
Like, well, I think I should probably also mention,

1049
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,920
sometimes depending on your area, Uncle Sam has a cut.

1050
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,760
You know what I'm saying?

1051
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,240
Like he's got a cut, Uncle Sam.

1052
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,000
That ain't Ting's fault.

1053
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They can't help that.

1054
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,440
He's got his hands in everything, Wes.

1055
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,280
Watch out.

1056
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,100
I know.

1057
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,360
No contracts, no early termination fees,

1058
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,120
and a great control panel to manage it all.

1059
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,980
Turn individual services off,

1060
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,160
get complete usage at a glance,

1061
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,660
take control of every aspect of your account,

1062
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,020
and turn things on or off.

1063
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,560
Like I've activated several devices

1064
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,520
just through the webpage.

1065
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,000
And they also have a bunch of great devices

1066
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,960
you can buy directly,

1067
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,680
including just getting a $9 SIM card.

1068
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,380
Is this?

1069
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,220
Oh, whoa.

1070
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,120
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1071
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,940
Don't tell me.

1072
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,400
Do not tell me they have a $1 sale.

1073
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,980
Oh, snap.

1074
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,080
They got a $1 sale going on the Ting SIM.

1075
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,920
What?

1076
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,740
No.

1077
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,580
At least the GSM SIM.

1078
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,420
I've been waiting.

1079
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,240
I'm gonna put a link in the show notes.

1080
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,040
That's the best deal of the year, right there.

1081
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,360
The $1 SIM is when no one,

1082
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,720
I'm gonna send a link to Noah too.

1083
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,880
You stock up on these SIMs.

1084
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,040
You just put them in your bag.

1085
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,920
And then when you need data somewhere,

1086
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,720
you pop it in there, you're good to go.

1087
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,840
It's $6 a month and you turn it off when you're done.

1088
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,120
And plus, when you get that SIM at a dollar,

1089
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,200
if you go to linux.ting.com,

1090
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,500
they'll give you $25 in service credit,

1091
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,080
which is probably gonna pay for more

1092
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,160
than your first month of using that thing.

1093
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,880
Maybe even the first two months of using that thing,

1094
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,120
depending on how much you use it.

1095
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,800
So go grab a $1 Ting SIM card.

1096
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,540
I'll have a link in the show notes.

1097
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,160
And then get started at Ting

1098
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,440
by going to linux.ting.com.

1099
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,280
That's awesome.

1100
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,280
That is like Christmas in July when that happens.

1101
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,040
Now you can be a cell phone hero.

1102
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,080
Friends are out of data,

1103
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,240
you have someone visiting from another country,

1104
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,560
boom, Ting's got your back.

1105
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,920
A cell phone hero, I love it.

1106
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,240
linux.ting.com.

1107
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,080
Big thanks to Ting

1108
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,280
and thank you everybody for supporting our sponsors

1109
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,420
and that helps keep us going too.

1110
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,520
All right, so every now and then

1111
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,880
I like to sit down with Barton George.

1112
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,120
You guys remember Barton.

1113
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,240
He was the guy that really kicked

1114
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,360
the whole Sputnik project off at Dell

1115
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,480
and was an advocate and used some internal funding they had.

1116
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,560
Like there was their own seed funding internally,

1117
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,800
if you will, that's not what they called it.

1118
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,100
But it's kind of like, it was like,

1119
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,320
here's some project money, see what you can do with this.

1120
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,460
It wasn't a ton, it wasn't a ton.

1121
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,580
But with that money, Barton assembled a small team

1122
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,800
and they begun working on the Sputnik project.

1123
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,220
Well, just a few months ago,

1124
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,600
they released the seventh generation of the XPS 13.

1125
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,760
And then last week, they just updated it unusually quick

1126
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,080
to 1804 and there's been a ton of excitement around that.

1127
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,040
So we brought Barton back to the show

1128
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,560
to do some high level talking about all this stuff.

1129
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,440
Well, a big hearty welcome back to the show

1130
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,820
to one Mr. Barton George.

1131
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,520
Barton, welcome back to the Unplugged program.

1132
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,800
My pleasure is always, Chris.

1133
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,080
This is one of the things I enjoy doing most.

1134
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,200
Oh, he says, with I'm sure 100% legitimacy.

1135
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,040
Of course.

1136
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,800
It's for all the podcasters, what?

1137
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,120
Yeah, right, yeah, right, of course.

1138
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,280
Of course, good on you, good on you.

1139
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,060
In fact, I'll have to tell you,

1140
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,940
there was another podcast I was going to be doing

1141
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,780
and I don't know,

1142
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,920
they heard through the grapevine I was doing this

1143
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,440
and they said, oh, why don't we push it off

1144
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,280
for a little bit?

1145
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,080
Once you come on one of the Jupiter broadcasting shows,

1146
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,800
you basically, you've met,

1147
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,420
you've reached all of the audiences,

1148
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,340
I think what that's about.

1149
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,600
Well, exactly, exactly, there's no more.

1150
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,960
Yeah, there's no competing.

1151
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,220
So of course, if you're here,

1152
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,080
that probably means there's some new things to talk about.

1153
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,900
And I wanted to just kind of recap

1154
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,120
with maybe a few of the general updates

1155
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,560
to the whole Sputnik line.

1156
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,400
Where have things changed?

1157
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,540
Where have things gone in the last few months?

1158
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,000
Maybe it's, what has it been, six months,

1159
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,200
almost a year since we chatted?

1160
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,720
What's changed, what's new?

1161
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,600
Well, I'm trying to remember,

1162
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,760
you guys came down here to Dell

1163
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,600
and you did the whole shebang

1164
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,280
as far as what are we doing with regards to Linux?

1165
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,160
And you did things like on the client side,

1166
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,120
the server side, you did our HPC stuff.

1167
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,240
That was last April, right?

1168
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,480
Yeah, and then you did, in fact,

1169
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,160
that you did also the coffee maker,

1170
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
which also runs on Linux.

1171
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,240
That's right, yeah.

1172
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,480
You covered the whole nine yards.

1173
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,040
Well, since that time, lots happened.

1174
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,040
We had, in November, we celebrated our fifth anniversary.

1175
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,300
And then we, in January,

1176
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,300
we launched the seventh generation of the XPS 13.

1177
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,080
Oh, wow.

1178
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,720
And that, at the time, launched with 16.04.

1179
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,760
Fast forward to now,

1180
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,120
and we, about a month or two ago,

1181
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,200
we launched, we're starting to refresh

1182
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,340
our whole precision line,

1183
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,080
which runs on the Precision Mobile that runs on Ubuntu.

1184
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,560
So there's four that make up that line.

1185
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,200
In fact, I think you have one from the last gen.

1186
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,120
There's the 3530, the 5330,

1187
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,680
the 7530, and the 7730.

1188
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,720
You gotta give these some names,

1189
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,960
like the Ferrari, you know,

1190
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,280
like these names that stick.

1191
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,040
No, they do, all internal code names

1192
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,920
that I never remember.

1193
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,640
In fact, yes, they actually do use like Testarossa

1194
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,440
and other various fast car names.

1195
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,260
That's great.

1196
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,400
So, but you have, which one did you get?

1197
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,120
Did you get the 7720?

1198
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,800
Yes, that is what it is, exactly.

1199
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,640
Okay.

1200
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,480
Yeah, I was just gonna say,

1201
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,300
it's almost within arm's reach,

1202
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,280
but yes, the 7720.

1203
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,720
And it's a beast of a machine.

1204
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:12,740
One of the things I love about it

1205
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,380
is I can throw just about any workload at that sucker,

1206
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,080
and it never fails.

1207
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,960
It just churns and churns through it.

1208
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,760
I've done literally almost 40 hours

1209
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,600
of straight encoding on that machine before.

1210
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,440
Wow.

1211
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,280
Yeah.

1212
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,100
Dang.

1213
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,940
It really holds up.

1214
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,000
Yeah, and it just keeps getting beefier.

1215
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So, and then just to decode the 77,

1216
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,100
the seven stands for 17 inch,

1217
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,720
the 75, the five stands for?

1218
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,920
I'm gonna say AMD.

1219
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,760
I don't know.

1220
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,680
I'm just taking a wild stab.

1221
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,000
No, it stands for 15 inches.

1222
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,840
But anyway.

1223
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,900
Oh, that makes way more sense.

1224
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,740
Yeah.

1225
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,560
Much better, yeah.

1226
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,400
Same.

1227
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,220
That's a good guess.

1228
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,060
Yeah, and I thought you were gonna Google it

1229
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,900
and find out.

1230
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:53,720
Oh, I should have.

1231
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,360
But we have the 35 is the one that's the value price,

1232
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,160
and then the 5530 is the one

1233
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,720
that most developers wanna get.

1234
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,720
So my favorite thing on Hacker News was somebody who wrote,

1235
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,400
Dell makes a better MacBook Pro than Apple.

1236
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,880
And I just thought, wow,

1237
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,280
that was the 5520 at the time was what he was talking about.

1238
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,480
And then he put, you know, didn't see that coming.

1239
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,440
So it's been great.

1240
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,600
That's just to get to wax nostalgic.

1241
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,120
When we launched originally now a little over five years ago,

1242
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,840
it was just the XPS 13.

1243
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,660
Right.

1244
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,360
And we just had one config.

1245
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,720
And what we got was a lot of people saying,

1246
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,160
well, that's cool, but that's not gonna do it for me.

1247
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,000
I need something big and beefy.

1248
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,520
And we kept sort of getting more and more of that feedback.

1249
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,120
And what we did was Jared Dominguez,

1250
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,840
who's our Linux OS architect,

1251
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,080
took one of the M3800s,

1252
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,680
that's the first precision mobile system.

1253
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,680
And in his spare time, he got Ubuntu up and running.

1254
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,960
So he posted that to his blog or to the Dell technical blog

1255
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,200
and got tons of excitement,

1256
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,960
but that didn't satiate the folks.

1257
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,400
They still wanted it to become real.

1258
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,140
And so the next year we were able to release that

1259
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,840
as a real system.

1260
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,800
So then from there it was one system.

1261
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,240
And then we did the current line, they went from 10.

1262
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,160
And then the next generation ends in 20,

1263
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,520
which is what you have.

1264
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,200
And as we said, now the next one is 30.

1265
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,760
Okay, so it does kind of make sense

1266
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
when you break it down.

1267
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,580
Oh yeah, yeah.

1268
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,120
Once you get the decoder rigged, it's-

1269
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, once you have the key.

1270
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,640
I was looking at the original specs,

1271
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,840
the original XPS 13 developer edition,

1272
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,520
wasn't, I mean, it wasn't bad.

1273
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,360
It was eight gigs of RAM, 256 gigabyte SSD.

1274
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,960
The biggest weak spot really was the screen

1275
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,840
compared to what you have now on the XPS 13.

1276
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,600
It was a 1280 by 720.

1277
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,600
We got a lot of nasty comments about that.

1278
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,400
My phone has twice that, et cetera, et cetera.

1279
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,200
Luckily we were able to fix that within two months.

1280
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,680
So we launched in the States,

1281
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,840
then two months later when we launched in Europe,

1282
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,820
we were able to get a higher resolution screen.

1283
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,300
The other thing too is when we first were doing

1284
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,200
the beta work, it was only four gigs.

1285
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,880
So when we got to release, it was eight gigs.

1286
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,120
So yeah, not so bad.

1287
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:24,080
But just to finish my linear story of what's happening,

1288
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,320
we announced the new Precision line,

1289
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:31,040
the 3530 was available first, that's the value one.

1290
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,440
And then the two super beefy ones,

1291
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,120
the 15 inch and the 17 inch, we announced two weeks ago.

1292
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,680
And as I said, that's the one that you have.

1293
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,560
And the other thing too is we're targeting the higher end,

1294
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,800
the 7730 at AI workloads.

1295
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,240
Ah, does that mean more GPU?

1296
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,360
What does that mean really?

1297
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,320
Yeah, it's the cards that go in there

1298
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,040
and you're gonna start getting me out of my depth.

1299
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,160
So I'll just say, I'll just have a dip.

1300
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,160
Yeah, but it's like the hard, I mean, people throw it around,

1301
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,080
but there is like a hardware, a software stack

1302
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,120
that like goes into it.

1303
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,640
And I find that to be really interesting

1304
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,960
because it's really a lot of it is starting on Linux,

1305
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,520
you know, like this whole AI workload

1306
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,880
and machine learning is so new.

1307
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,140
And it's, did you see, I mean, not to derail,

1308
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,320
but did you see that coming?

1309
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,520
I didn't really quite see it being so strong

1310
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,420
a few years ago.

1311
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,300
Well, I mean, I think that's sort of where it began, right?

1312
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,960
If you think of with data scientists

1313
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,580
and people in the educational space,

1314
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,560
that's what they're gonna start off with is Linux.

1315
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,780
And then they get used to it and they really like it.

1316
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,460
So it's carried over from there.

1317
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,000
And it's actually, so we've got one system

1318
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,320
on the mobile workstation,

1319
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,220
but then the four desk side ones we offer,

1320
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,480
those are also well-targeted at AI.

1321
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,300
I mean, it seems like a sweet spot where you can do,

1322
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,160
you have both a user-friendly desktop

1323
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,660
and a production machine that can run real workloads.

1324
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,500
Exactly.

1325
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,900
And so you can do stuff locally

1326
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,720
and then you can always push it to servers on the backend.

1327
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,880
I know you were kind of wrapping this up,

1328
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,060
but before, you touched on something

1329
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,140
to go back to your story a bit.

1330
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,440
You mentioned, you know, you shipped it with the one screen

1331
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,740
and then pretty quickly realized needs a better screen.

1332
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,320
Prototypes had four gigs of RAM,

1333
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,500
final version had eight gigs of RAM.

1334
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,660
There's something that kind of caught my attention

1335
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,100
with just the most recent cycle of machines

1336
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,100
is if I'm not mistaken, they launched with 16.04,

1337
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,580
but then within a couple of months now,

1338
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,340
we're seeing a Dell sanctioned upgrade path to 18.04.

1339
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,180
And I believe new units will be shipping with 18.04.

1340
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,020
What's that like?

1341
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,580
I mean, how does that happen exactly?

1342
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,580
Because the timing of the new XPS hardware

1343
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,180
and the timing of the 18.04 release

1344
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,100
were really close together.

1345
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,300
I'm imagining behind the scenes,

1346
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,800
there must've been some consternation

1347
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,140
over is it worth holding back

1348
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,900
and shipping 18.04 originally or what?

1349
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,740
I'm just curious, how did that transpire?

1350
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,420
Yeah, and I think sometimes we get luckier than others

1351
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,300
depending on, right?

1352
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,700
So it was the seventh generation that we're talking about.

1353
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,620
So within those seven generations,

1354
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,660
sometimes we get lucky with the timing

1355
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,020
so that if it's, I don't know, 14.04,

1356
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:06,940
it came out in, say, August or October.

1357
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,780
So it looks we're pretty close to that number.

1358
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,060
And then other times, unfortunately,

1359
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:13,500
this is where we end up on the wrong end

1360
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,540
of the lucky factor.

1361
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,740
Because first of all, after it's launched,

1362
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,500
then the OEM drivers and bits like that

1363
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,500
have to be finally put together by Canonical.

1364
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,540
And then we need to do the work

1365
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,700
and there's a certain amount of lead time

1366
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,020
so that if people think, well, gosh,

1367
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,900
your system came out in, let's just say, May

1368
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,700
and 18.04 obviously came out in April.

1369
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,980
What's the deal?

1370
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,220
What's the deal, man?

1371
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,020
Exactly.

1372
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:46,140
And so unfortunately, the way that the cycle works,

1373
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,860
it comes out with what fits in the time frame of getting

1374
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,380
the release from Canonical for the OEM

1375
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,820
as well as the whole lead time with the product.

1376
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,020
Yeah, that makes sense.

1377
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,580
So in the case of 18.04 on the XPS 13,

1378
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,100
we're the first large OEM to launch with 18.04.

1379
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,420
So what we did is we knew the timing was coming up.

1380
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,060
And one thing I learned too, because we were taking stock

1381
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:21,500
the other day, we have over 150 systems that run Ubuntu.

1382
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,740
And I had no idea it was that many.

1383
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,140
When you say systems, what do you

1384
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,860
mean, like servers, IoT devices, desktops, laptops?

1385
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,660
No, these are just clients.

1386
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:37,500
So it would be things like Precision Desktop and Mobile

1387
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,860
as well as Vostro, Optiplex, blah, blah, blah.

1388
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,180
And so just as an aside, the difference between,

1389
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,620
and we've done that now for over a decade.

1390
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:54,820
The difference in Sputnik is that when I pitched it,

1391
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,060
I said, you know what?

1392
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,380
Developers will really pay for our best-looking system

1393
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:02,460
running Ubuntu.

1394
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,140
And that was counterintuitive because we

1395
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,380
had done really well with Ubuntu on some

1396
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,580
of the lower-end systems.

1397
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,060
And they still sell extremely well.

1398
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,540
But the idea that somebody would be

1399
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,060
willing to pay for our highest-end system, which

1400
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:20,900
is the XPS 13, and then put a free operating system on it,

1401
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,820
why would they want that?

1402
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,900
So that was the difference.

1403
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,060
But anyway, if I get back to, but I digress.

1404
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,540
If I get back to that 150 systems,

1405
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,260
there's a bunch that would be launching

1406
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,740
within a certain time frame.

1407
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,820
And what we did was we said, because this

1408
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,580
is a big deal with 1804, let's pick our flagship Ubuntu

1409
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,060
product, which is indeed the XPS 13.

1410
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,660
And so let's go and let's recertify that.

1411
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,300
And so that's how we made the choice with this one.

1412
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:54,100
Because traditionally, it would be just you certify once,

1413
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,980
and that's the way you stay.

1414
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,700
Yeah, that's what I was expecting.

1415
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,620
And I'm curious if you have any initial impressions

1416
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,940
on the customer's reaction to the switch from Unity 7

1417
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:08,780
to the GNOME Shell environment now.

1418
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,820
Have you gotten any kind of signal

1419
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,340
on how people are receiving that,

1420
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,380
even with your own team internally or customers?

1421
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,460
You know, I haven't.

1422
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,700
I think internally, well, I won't speak for others.

1423
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,860
But I think just from my sort of high-level view,

1424
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,780
it seemed to make sense.

1425
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,820
They had gotten some traction with Unity,

1426
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,580
and it was a great idea.

1427
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:35,540
But at some point, when you're looking to focus resources,

1428
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,140
unfortunately, you look for something

1429
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,340
that you can leverage that's not something

1430
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,340
you have to put a ton of resources in.

1431
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,460
And so it's interesting in the blog

1432
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:52,980
I did for the launching of 1804, which was just last week,

1433
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,180
that I did what was relaunched with 1204.

1434
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,220
And I wrote what was going on just quickly

1435
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,940
with Ubuntu back then.

1436
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:04,460
And that's when they were saying that you had the HUD.

1437
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,940
But the other thing, too, is that's

1438
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:10,180
when people were saying Unity is actually gaining traction,

1439
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,460
and it looks like it might be pretty cool.

1440
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,580
Right, and just to be clear, what you're talking about

1441
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,500
is the original Sputnik launch back in 2012.

1442
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,380
Exactly, yeah.

1443
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:23,820
So yeah, 1204, which had the specs that you just

1444
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,420
quoted earlier on.

1445
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,260
But yeah, then as I say, fast forward to today,

1446
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,340
and you have the big switch over.

1447
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:38,020
So with that specifically, I haven't heard yet from.

1448
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,540
I suppose in a way, no news is also good news at your level.

1449
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,700
Yeah, I mean, I think there was one comment about it.

1450
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,300
Usually, either through comments on my blog or through Twitter,

1451
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,860
somebody, if they like or don't like something,

1452
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,940
they're pretty good either way of saying, oh, I'm

1453
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,180
so glad you did X, or why the heck did you do Y?

1454
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,580
And I haven't really heard anything.

1455
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,500
Good, I think that's probably a good thing.

1456
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,340
I have just a couple of more questions for you

1457
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,300
that I'm pretty much done, but the next couple questions

1458
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,940
are looking forward a little bit.

1459
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,220
I've been really kind of pondering this whole Chromebooks

1460
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,300
running Linux apps situations.

1461
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,860
It seems like all of a sudden, Google

1462
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,820
has figured out what you figured out more than five years ago

1463
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,060
with Sputnik, and that is that you can hyper-target

1464
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,100
this developer market with a reliable Linux workstation.

1465
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,460
And now they're adding the capability on Chrome OS

1466
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:34,100
to actually run Linux applications.

1467
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,260
So you could run things that you normally

1468
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,180
would have to have a full Linux desktop for.

1469
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,220
Do you perceive that as competition

1470
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,660
to the Sputnik line?

1471
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,580
And I guess another way to frame that is,

1472
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,060
why would I necessarily buy an XPS 13 over, say,

1473
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,140
a future Chromebook in a year or so from now

1474
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,140
that has pretty decent specs, maybe is $300,

1475
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,580
and can run Linux applications?

1476
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,740
Yeah, I think, well, it's interesting

1477
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,660
because they obviously took the idea from us because five years

1478
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,860
ago when we were looking to sanity check this,

1479
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,740
we went out and talked to them.

1480
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,820
So they stole the idea.

1481
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:07,980
They just waited five years to act on it, right?

1482
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,460
I mean, it was insidious.

1483
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,020
But I think at this point, I think

1484
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,940
you're talking about Fuchsia as opposed

1485
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,140
to Christine with the running of the Linux apps.

1486
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,540
And Christine is the one where, and I

1487
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,700
don't know a ton about this.

1488
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,460
I can just throw these names around,

1489
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,660
is the one that's more developer-targeted.

1490
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,460
And so I think there will be certain use cases

1491
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,780
that Chromebook will be fine.

1492
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,420
But there will also be, they're going

1493
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,380
to be different a year from now, as will we, right?

1494
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,180
We keep progressing.

1495
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,580
We're not standing still.

1496
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,980
And it will be interesting to see

1497
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,740
which areas in particular they'll target.

1498
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,100
I know, just anecdotally, my cousin

1499
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,780
works on back-end systems at Google.

1500
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,500
And so when he started there, he wanted

1501
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,540
to get an Ubuntu-based system.

1502
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,040
And then he found out that you really can't work locally.

1503
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,780
And so he just got a Chromebook.

1504
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:06,260
So it depends on what kind of a use case you're using.

1505
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,780
If all you're doing is connecting back-end,

1506
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,700
then you really don't need something powerful.

1507
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,020
But if you're doing a lot of hacking on the plane

1508
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,260
or on the train or conferences, then that's

1509
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,420
something like the XPS 13 makes a lot of sense.

1510
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,700
Yeah, and I think just like Mac OS,

1511
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,140
only more pronounced Chrome OS has

1512
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,180
walls that more technical users will run into pretty quickly.

1513
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,800
And that can be a source of frustration.

1514
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,260
And something like the XPS 13 is a tool to do your job.

1515
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,220
And it's worth investing in the right tool.

1516
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,060
So I don't think it spells doom for anything.

1517
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,380
But it is interesting to see Google executing

1518
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,220
on what is clearly a Dell idea.

1519
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,740
I mean, it just looks like it from just the outsider's

1520
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,260
perspective, even, which is fascinating.

1521
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,300
I wonder what took them so long, you know?

1522
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,540
Well, exactly.

1523
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,940
They were plotting, and they were trying to figure it out.

1524
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,380
And then one day, boom.

1525
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,340
They're waiting to see if you made any money

1526
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,980
and sold some units, and then they realized.

1527
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:05,980
Oh, there you go, yeah.

1528
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,980
Yeah, exactly.

1529
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,220
In the first couple of years, it looked like it wasn't.

1530
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:14,840
But yeah, we've all of a sudden, it's gone like a hockey stick.

1531
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,260
It's crazy with Sputnik.

1532
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:21,140
And I think it's because it's the network effect, right?

1533
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,940
So it's more of a word of mouth.

1534
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,260
We haven't bought any Super Bowl ads yet.

1535
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,060
Although, we will this year.

1536
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,860
That was a spoiler.

1537
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,100
I shouldn't have told you that.

1538
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,020
Really?

1539
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,660
Yeah, Sputnik Super Bowl ad.

1540
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,980
I'm paying for it out of my own pocket.

1541
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,580
No, you're joking now.

1542
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,660
No, no, totally.

1543
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,380
Totally, I'm paying for it.

1544
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,260
Gosh, you got me excited.

1545
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,380
You got me excited there.

1546
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,460
Well, we'll do a Kickstarter to go fund me.

1547
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,720
Well, that is exactly what it's going to say.

1548
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,140
So if you want to see us in the Super Bowl, please,

1549
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:52,860
it's under Barton George, move to Bermuda account.

1550
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,660
That's just sort of a way we've set it up.

1551
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,300
Yeah, it seems legit.

1552
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,420
Yeah, exactly.

1553
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,380
So again, I digress.

1554
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,980
But I was just talking about how things have done,

1555
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,540
how it's really going up, which is really nice.

1556
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,860
It's been really gratifying.

1557
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,980
I bet.

1558
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,940
And so to see that it's caught a lot of attention

1559
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,820
internally because I think at the beginning, I don't think,

1560
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,420
I know in the beginning there's quite a few people who

1561
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,660
saw this as a distraction because any company you've

1562
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,460
got X number of resources.

1563
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,480
And why are you going to put them on this niche market

1564
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,500
as they saw it with a group that Dell really doesn't target

1565
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,300
or work with, meaning developers?

1566
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:43,060
And then now it's the money we made,

1567
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:45,980
but also the amount of positive feedback

1568
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:50,380
thanks to the community, reviews and press, et cetera.

1569
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,180
It's been great.

1570
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,500
I mean, the things that people say on Twitter are just,

1571
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,220
they're awesome.

1572
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:57,020
It's really nice to know that there's

1573
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:01,620
a group that really was looking for something just like this.

1574
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:04,300
Yeah, and it has net positive brand effects for Dell.

1575
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,100
I think it really does, even outside the core market

1576
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,380
that the Sputnik is targeting.

1577
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:13,860
Yeah, I've seen comments where people saying that I

1578
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,420
didn't consider Dell's before, but now that you got this,

1579
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,740
I'm very interested in checking out Dell.

1580
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,180
So that's been great.

1581
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,980
It's also, because it's a net new area for us,

1582
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,540
we are cannibalizing Windows systems.

1583
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,420
Right, interesting.

1584
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,260
That's a good point.

1585
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,020
And that turns out to be pretty important politically,

1586
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:32,900
I imagine.

1587
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,040
Well, Barton, I always enjoy our chats.

1588
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,280
Is there anything else you want to touch on or mention?

1589
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,160
I'll have a link to your blog and your Twitter

1590
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,740
profile in our show notes, so people

1591
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,180
can get that pretty easily.

1592
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,220
Yeah, I think the one thing I would say

1593
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:52,140
is the interest in the 18.04 release on the XPS 13 developer

1594
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:56,260
edition, I had no idea it would generate this much interest.

1595
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,540
Because the platform itself has been around since January.

1596
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,900
It's 18.04, great.

1597
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,700
That makes sense.

1598
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,620
But I mean, this is, just for example,

1599
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:09,300
the first day I posted my blog, I got 8,000 views.

1600
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,540
The next day, I got 13,000 views.

1601
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:20,860
And the days before, I'm looking at 122 views, 73 views, 127.

1602
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:22,460
And this happens with anything Sputnik.

1603
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,660
I post, it's exponential compared to the others.

1604
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:29,980
But this in and of itself, just in these first few days,

1605
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,220
has put it in my top 10 blogs.

1606
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,100
And like I said, I didn't think this

1607
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,260
was going to be a big deal.

1608
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,300
I didn't think people were going to be that interested.

1609
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,700
So shows how much I know.

1610
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,460
There's something about the two combined

1611
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,260
that just makes it a hot pair.

1612
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,860
Yeah, there's been a lot of interest

1613
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,700
we've seen in the audience from 18.04 as well.

1614
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,420
And I follow with a lot of interest too.

1615
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,860
I think a lot of people right now, I don't know,

1616
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:54,740
maybe I'm projecting, but I think a lot of people

1617
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,100
are looking at their next few years

1618
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,240
and wanting to get work done.

1619
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,460
And 18.04 kind of landed right in that window

1620
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,380
for a lot of folks.

1621
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,180
Yeah, and then we obviously standardized

1622
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:08,100
on the enterprise, the LTSs, as it would make sense.

1623
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,300
Because particularly if you're selling to enterprises,

1624
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,180
they're not going to want the interim releases

1625
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,340
and have everything change every six months.

1626
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,340
Yeah, exactly.

1627
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,740
And plus, this is why 18.04 is still kind of the freshest.

1628
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,220
It's still new, so it's still competitive features

1629
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:21,460
wise and all of that.

1630
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,180
And it's had time to bake a little more now

1631
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,180
that it's stable and most of the bugs are ironed out.

1632
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,500
Yeah, the dot one shipped.

1633
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,180
Yeah.

1634
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,300
Yeah, exactly.

1635
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,620
And so because the timing wasn't kind to us,

1636
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:36,380
we were able to recertify, particularly given,

1637
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,700
like I said, we're the first to certify in 18.04

1638
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,020
and this is our flagship.

1639
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,620
So we really went out of our way.

1640
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,500
We could have put it on one of the ones that was more

1641
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,820
likely to ship at this point.

1642
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,300
So we've got one coming up soon.

1643
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,700
But we said, let's make a real effort

1644
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:58,180
to go a little bit before that and do it on the XPS 13.

1645
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,060
Very good, Barton.

1646
01:01:59,060 --> 01:01:59,580
Very good.

1647
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,420
I really enjoy our chats and I'm really pleased

1648
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,180
to see the continued upward trajectory of the project.

1649
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,260
Well, that's great, Barton.

1650
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,340
Have a great rest of your day, sir.

1651
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:08,860
And thank you very much for coming on the Unplugged

1652
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:09,380
program.

1653
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,060
Well, thanks for the opportunity, Chris.

1654
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,060
Keep on keeping on.

1655
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:14,860
We will, Wes.

1656
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,540
Are we sure?

1657
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,340
He can't stop us.

1658
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,340
No, he can't stop us.

1659
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,020
Now, we have so many other things to talk about,

1660
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,260
but I do kind of want to keep the show a little bit shorter.

1661
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,700
I've been trying to keep it under an hour and 15 or so.

1662
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,660
So we'll probably leave a few things for the show notes.

1663
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,420
But it was a super great chat with Barton.

1664
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,740
And I'm really pleased to see the progress

1665
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,500
of their project.

1666
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,820
Now, we need some balance in the show for next week.

1667
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,380
So if somebody from Red Hat wants

1668
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:41,020
to come on and talk about, I don't know, CoreOS

1669
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,140
or something, let's just balance it out a little bit.

1670
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,580
Because we had a lot of Ubuntu this episode.

1671
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,540
And while it's fine, it's a great product, obviously.

1672
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,340
Here's the platform.

1673
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,980
I feel like we've got to, yeah.

1674
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,740
Or maybe we should have somebody come on here and talk about,

1675
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,260
not Gentoo.

1676
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,300
We've done that plenty.

1677
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:56,900
I don't know.

1678
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,580
But it's something we'll think about.

1679
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,700
In the meantime, let's talk about some app picks.

1680
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,140
We've got a couple for you that we wanted to cover

1681
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,380
before we get out of here.

1682
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,540
And what is more fun than stressing the hell out

1683
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,220
of your system?

1684
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:08,380
So we've got an app for you.

1685
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:12,900
I'm going to call it S2E, S-T-U-I?

1686
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,740
The stress terminal UI.

1687
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,540
Yeah, and you've got it installed on your machine

1688
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:18,380
over there.

1689
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,220
It is a super slick looking.

1690
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,820
Is it technically a terminal app?

1691
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,940
Yeah, it runs right in that there terminal.

1692
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,740
It's a terminal app.

1693
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:27,740
It's a Python terminal app that runs right in your terminal.

1694
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:30,660
And it's going to be some of the coolest looking visuals

1695
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,500
to visualize out the utilization of your system,

1696
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:38,660
like CPU frequency, temperature, overall clock utilization,

1697
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,620
and the power it's drawing in this really tight looking UI.

1698
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,140
How would you?

1699
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,380
I mean, you almost describe that as pastel colors.

1700
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,660
I don't really know how to describe that.

1701
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,620
Yeah, the color scheme is lovely.

1702
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,300
Yeah, it's nice.

1703
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,980
And it's not going to bombard you

1704
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,740
with a whole ton of information about just

1705
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,660
every little process on your system.

1706
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,540
It just gives you a nice, easy to interpret holistic view

1707
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,300
of what's happening.

1708
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,620
And it kind of works best with a companion tool, right?

1709
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:03,380
Yeah, if you also have stress testing tools available,

1710
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,580
then you can stress test your system

1711
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,300
and then watch how it responds.

1712
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,060
And that sounds like the most fun, right?

1713
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:12,540
Is when you get a new box, which I have fantasies of.

1714
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,740
I could also see maybe you have a couple boxes you're

1715
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,020
evaluating, maybe for a big enterprise buy,

1716
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,900
or just because you're a picky consumer.

1717
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:20,620
Heck yeah, man.

1718
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:21,740
You got to try it out.

1719
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:22,860
You got to try it out.

1720
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,620
This is a simple tool that Joe found

1721
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:26,200
that we're going to include in the show.

1722
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,300
It's called Odeo.

1723
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,700
And it does one job, and it does it pretty well.

1724
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,180
You copy a YouTube URL, you paste it in the terminal,

1725
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,260
you run this program, and it extracts the audio from it.

1726
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:37,820
And that's it.

1727
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,740
So if you've got like MP4 audio you want to get from it

1728
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,220
or something like that, Odeo will download your favorite

1729
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,260
music to the current working directory of your terminal.

1730
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,340
And try to get the highest quality audio version

1731
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:48,980
it can off of YouTube.

1732
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,820
It does depend on your favorite YouTube DL and FFmpeg

1733
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:54,160
utilities, but it's pretty nice.

1734
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,100
And you could just install those from the repo

1735
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,420
and then go get Odeo.

1736
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,820
This looks like, I mean, I'll be honest,

1737
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,060
that's definitely a common workflow for me.

1738
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,700
Oh, I do it all the time, yeah.

1739
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,740
Mostly for Unfilter, but absolutely I do it all the time.

1740
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,380
Now we're rocking it here.

1741
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,340
I think we may overshoot, but we're moving right along.

1742
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,420
Last but not least, this is a really cool tool

1743
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,380
that Joe also found.

1744
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:21,460
And it's not going to work for all of our shows yet,

1745
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,660
but it may work if you want to go pretty far back for our shows

1746
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,780
and a bunch of your favorite podcasts.

1747
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:29,540
It's called rewind.website.

1748
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,460
And speaking of top level domains, there's a good one.

1749
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,100
And it is a really cool concept.

1750
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,980
You go back in time and listen to a podcast

1751
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,620
from its very beginning.

1752
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:43,940
You can also put an iTunes URL in there or a SoundCloud URL

1753
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:44,780
in there.

1754
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:46,620
So the whole idea, and by the way,

1755
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:48,740
the core code's up on GitHub, which

1756
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,060
we have linked in the show notes.

1757
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:53,660
The whole idea is start with a podcast

1758
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:55,420
from the very beginning and then choose

1759
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,940
a frequency in which you would like new versions

1760
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:01,060
of that episode to be delivered to you.

1761
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,260
So you sort of re-experience it as if you

1762
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,340
were listening during the time those episodes are

1763
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,300
being released.

1764
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,780
So you can set a wait frequency of daily, weekly, and monthly.

1765
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,900
And then it will deliver you a new episode

1766
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,780
from the back catalog of your favorite podcast.

1767
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,740
Oh, that's super handy.

1768
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:20,260
Yeah, and I love that it's AGPL.

1769
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,100
You can go find it.

1770
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,420
You can go run it yourself if you don't want

1771
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,620
to trust them to run it for you.

1772
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,100
Yeah.

1773
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:28,820
Yeah, the rewind.website is sort of like a demo, really.

1774
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,020
I mean, it's up and running.

1775
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,860
It appears they're offering it as a service.

1776
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:34,340
But you can get CastRewinder for your own system

1777
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,860
and then get it up and running.

1778
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,220
Again, another Python app.

1779
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,420
It's the best of all worlds.

1780
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:38,900
Look at us.

1781
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,380
We're all Python for the app pics.

1782
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,340
Just about.

1783
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,540
So that's a neat idea.

1784
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,220
You can check it out, rewind.website,

1785
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:47,900
or go to the GitHub page and throw it up on your own box

1786
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,260
if you're comfortable with Python.

1787
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,000
And yeah, like Wes said, it's AGPL version 3

1788
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,580
if you want to host it yourself.

1789
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,740
And I think that is such a neat idea

1790
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,500
to re-subscribe and re-listen.

1791
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,540
It's, oh, man, is it painful.

1792
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,540
You know, when you're used to marathoning something

1793
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,660
and you listen to it weekly, you're like,

1794
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:05,060
how do people do this?

1795
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:05,580
I know, right?

1796
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,340
But in that suffering, there is some amount

1797
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,660
of gain and appreciation.

1798
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:11,460
And you won't just take it for granted.

1799
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,100
Yeah, yeah.

1800
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,260
So anyways, you can check those out in the show notes,

1801
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:18,140
linuxunplug.com, slash 260.

1802
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:19,100
And yeah, there we go.

1803
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,340
We're going to get out of here on our own imposed deadline,

1804
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,380
not because we want to do less show,

1805
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:27,380
but simply because we know you have a lot of podcast options.

1806
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,260
And sometimes it's good to get a little tighter in here.

1807
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,460
So I'm pretty pleased.

1808
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,760
I think it's a good place to end.

1809
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,900
There's a lot more to talk about.

1810
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:34,560
There's more to do.

1811
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,020
We may put it all in the post show.

1812
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:39,180
But in the meantime, go get yourself some more Wes Payne.

1813
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,060
Where are you at, Wes?

1814
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,420
TechSnap.systems or at Wes Payne.

1815
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:44,020
There you go.

1816
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,100
There you go.

1817
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:48,100
You can also get more of me at chrisles, the whole network

1818
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:49,460
at Jupiter Signal.

1819
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:51,860
And check our website for links to Brent's page.

1820
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,360
I think we're going to start putting other folks on there

1821
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,580
from the community as well.

1822
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,620
So if you want to get more of them,

1823
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,180
find out what they're up to, what their websites are,

1824
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:01,820
that's all going to be posted at linuxunplug.com as well.

1825
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,700
So it's going to be a pretty great resource,

1826
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,140
because we also have links to all that stuff

1827
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,060
that we talked about.

1828
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:07,640
Hey, did you know you can join us live?

1829
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,700
You can participate in that virtual lug.

1830
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,020
You just need a working microphone, some headphones,

1831
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,500
pass the audio check, and then you can join us.

1832
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,300
Check it out.

1833
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:22,300
And we'll see you in the next one.

1834
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:50,580
Oh, next Tuesday.

1835
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,660
There, I got it in there.

1836
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:51,980
Nice.

1837
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:52,900
How's that, Brent?

1838
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,180
Thank you.

1839
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:56,620
That and a bell ring would be, yeah, make the show for me.

1840
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,740
Oh, OK, right.

1841
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,700
There you go.

1842
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,260
Thank you.

1843
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,780
You got the actual bell, too.

1844
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,260
So yeah, all right.

1845
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,260
Boy, I'm really glad it worked out with Barton,

1846
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:07,180
because he has meetings and peoples and things like that.

1847
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,780
Important laptop-related business.

1848
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:09,900
Yeah, all that kind of stuff.

1849
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,860
And they're in the middle of prepping the next release,

1850
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,660
so that was cool.

1851
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,980
Yeah, I loved how he talked about the community feedback,

1852
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:17,420
how he was so, so positive.

1853
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,500
And that was a bit opposite to what

1854
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,140
we heard last week about that hearing stuff,

1855
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,740
so that was good to hear.

1856
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:23,700
Very good point.

1857
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,820
Would you like me to put the word out,

1858
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:28,500
asking for somebody from CoreOS?

1859
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,700
Or anybody in the area.

1860
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,580
Yeah, they would like to come on and get some representation,

1861
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:32,780
talk about something they're working on,

1862
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,580
or anything like that.

1863
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,060
Absolutely, I would love that.

1864
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,100
I will drop a message in one of the internal mailing lists

1865
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,100
and let you know what happens.

1866
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:40,620
Thank you.

1867
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:40,860
Yeah.

1868
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:41,540
Amazing.

1869
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:44,580
And you could say, I mean, legitimately,

1870
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,780
Canonical and Ubuntu are a big part of the discussion

1871
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,380
because they're showing up.

1872
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,020
And that is.

1873
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,500
Hey, you got me, bro.

1874
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,300
I know, and I really appreciate that, really,

1875
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:55,500
in part because of that.

1876
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,740
Because there's not an inherent intent

1877
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:02,100
to cover one company or distribution more

1878
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:02,780
than the other.

1879
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:05,180
Yes, the Ubuntu action show up in here.

1880
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:08,260
Well, it's always going to be balanced on its dominance

1881
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:09,780
in the market and the news making.

1882
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,940
I mean, if it's legitimately making news and dominating

1883
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,100
markets, then it's going to get coverage regardless.

1884
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,860
But if there was other folks here,

1885
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,180
like yourself, that are representing other distributions

1886
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,340
and other community projects, I think

1887
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,540
it would be good for the show.

1888
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:21,820
Yeah.

1889
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:23,580
Thing is, we're not as enterprisely focused

1890
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:27,740
on this show, are we, as Red Hat's core is going to be.

1891
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:28,860
Yeah, I appreciate that.

1892
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:47,300
But that doesn't mean that we can't make something work.
