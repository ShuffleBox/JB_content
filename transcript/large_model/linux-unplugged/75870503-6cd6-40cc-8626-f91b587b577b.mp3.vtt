WEBVTT

00:00.760 --> 00:02.160
Big CES week.

00:02.160 --> 00:05.040
And Michael over at Ferronix said not as big of a deal

00:05.040 --> 00:06.320
for Linux as it was last year,

00:06.320 --> 00:07.880
and he may or may not be right,

00:07.880 --> 00:10.000
but I was sure spotting a lot of Linux

00:10.000 --> 00:11.980
in NVIDIA's live demo.

00:11.980 --> 00:14.520
So NVIDIA today announced the PX2,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.120
which is the second generation of what they call

00:17.120 --> 00:21.240
their computer, their mini supercomputer for a car.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.400
That's what they call it.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.320
And it's a big, massive NVIDIA box that is liquid cooled

00:27.320 --> 00:29.160
for this new version, the PX2.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.440
It's a big box with an ODB2 connector,

00:31.440 --> 00:33.200
and it's meant to go in your computer

00:33.200 --> 00:35.200
and power these self-driving cars.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.120
We talked a little bit about it,

00:36.120 --> 00:38.640
Poppy and I did today, actually, in Tech Talk today.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.080
Like one of the nice things is it can process

00:40.080 --> 00:41.480
2800 images a second.

00:41.480 --> 00:42.400
Wowee.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.080
Yeah, it's got eight teraflops of processing,

00:46.080 --> 00:51.080
12 CPU cores, and it is a pretty neat beast.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.240
And we talked more details in Tech Talk,

00:54.240 --> 00:57.160
but check out the demo here, how cool this is,

00:57.160 --> 00:59.560
and then I wanna show you where the Linux is involved.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.720
Like you were saying, there's millions of points

01:01.720 --> 01:02.880
per second coming in.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.720
We can't just throw all of this at the driver

01:05.720 --> 01:06.560
as they're going down the road.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.220
They won't understand what's happening.

01:08.220 --> 01:11.040
So we need to distill and refine the localization

01:11.040 --> 01:14.280
of where the vehicle is into both the lane.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.960
The Here HD maps help us draw these lanes perfectly.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.080
Every vehicle that's coming past that's noticed

01:20.080 --> 01:23.520
by the LIDAR or by the cameras,

01:23.520 --> 01:25.680
refined and placed properly in their lanes.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.160
So all of these cars that I see around us right now,

01:29.160 --> 01:30.720
they're real cars.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.480
I mean, they're not some kind of imaginary cars.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.360
They're real cars that we've detected.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.960
And we know where they are in 3D space.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.160
We know how fast they're traveling.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.360
We know how fast we're traveling relative to it.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.040
And we know what lanes they're all in now

01:42.040 --> 01:44.320
because we've identified everybody,

01:44.320 --> 01:45.920
we've localized everybody.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.080
And we know the path that we're gonna be taking,

01:48.080 --> 01:50.720
optional paths that we might be taking.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.360
All of this information we can present

01:52.360 --> 01:54.880
in a very refined fashion so that somebody can relax,

01:54.880 --> 01:56.280
have a serene ride down the road.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.280
But how do we know that this isn't just a mock-up,

01:59.280 --> 02:01.160
some kind of a demo?

02:01.160 --> 02:03.800
You know, I think one of the best things that we can see

02:03.800 --> 02:06.000
is actually what it looks like going down the road

02:06.000 --> 02:06.960
with real information.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.000
So if we look at it with the video.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.760
Unfortunately, we don't have a windshield in front of you,

02:10.760 --> 02:14.000
but let's put a virtual windshield up here.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.160
Yeah, so this is the actual information driving down 101

02:18.160 --> 02:19.680
with the vehicles passing.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.480
All of this is being computed in real time.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.400
This is not a video down below.

02:23.400 --> 02:24.240
This is-

02:24.240 --> 02:25.280
Look at that, it's just changed lanes.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.920
The car in front of me has just changed lanes.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.200
Two cars just come up next to us.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.920
We don't need rear view mirrors anymore.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.160
All right, so that's a little bold there.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.000
Just get rid of them.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.200
Yeah, just a little more.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.600
There's no reason to ever have to look around you.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.800
Yeah, you can just loop there

02:42.800 --> 02:43.800
is all it's doing right there.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.280
And because our sensors are so robust

02:46.280 --> 02:48.700
and because we have so many redundant sensors,

02:48.700 --> 02:50.020
it is possible for us to detect

02:50.020 --> 02:51.680
all of these different cars.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.240
And we talked more about the image processing

02:53.240 --> 02:54.480
and recognition in Tech Talk,

02:54.480 --> 02:57.040
but if you look at the presentation,

02:57.040 --> 02:58.080
during the presentations,

02:58.080 --> 02:59.560
one of the things you would have noticed

02:59.560 --> 03:01.180
showing up on screen over and over again,

03:01.180 --> 03:03.440
Popey, do you know what it is?

03:03.440 --> 03:04.260
Did you catch it?

03:04.260 --> 03:05.100
Oh, I know this.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.200
What is it, what is it, what is it?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.560
No, no, I don't.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.400
Oh, you don't?

03:09.400 --> 03:10.680
Oh, well, it's fedora.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.160
No, actually it's a lots of Ubuntu.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.240
There are demos like last year,

03:15.240 --> 03:17.400
we run on Ubuntu, the machines are running Ubuntu.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.760
It's Ubuntu all over the place.

03:19.760 --> 03:20.660
All right, they're up on stage

03:20.660 --> 03:22.520
during the video presentation at CES.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.200
You knew that because they did it last year

03:24.200 --> 03:25.020
and the year before,

03:25.020 --> 03:26.320
but I still think it's pretty damn cool.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.160
It is cool.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.880
This self-driving supercomputer car thingy.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.760
You know it's cool because of that leather jacket.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.040
That leather jacket, it was one of the best investments

03:34.040 --> 03:35.400
that CEO has ever made.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.120
That dude wears it up on stage every single event.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.520
And you know what, I like him.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.000
He seems to kind of actually,

03:41.000 --> 03:42.960
he seems like a CEO that actually knows his stuff.

03:42.960 --> 03:43.800
So you gotta respect that.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.040
Actually, now you come to say it,

03:45.040 --> 03:48.960
I can't think of any car automation demos

03:48.960 --> 03:50.920
that I've seen in the last year or two

03:50.920 --> 03:53.360
that don't have Ubuntu on them somehow.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.000
At some point in the development, right?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.080
Yeah, like either the computers

03:56.080 --> 03:57.960
that are connecting to the in-car system

03:57.960 --> 04:00.520
or the computers that are developing the sensors, yeah.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.880
In fact, I think, you know what?

04:02.880 --> 04:05.360
It's almost, it would be more shocking

04:05.360 --> 04:06.920
if they were doing it on Windows.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.640
Yeah.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.880
That's what we'd be talking about.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.480
Wow, now that is your story right there, everybody.

04:13.480 --> 04:19.480
This is Linux Unplugged episode 126 for January 5th, 2016.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

04:33.320 --> 04:35.880
that's for people who like to mess with computers.

04:35.880 --> 04:36.720
My name is Chris.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.560
And my name is Wes.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.120
Hey there, Wes, happy new year.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.160
Happy new year to you, Chris.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.000
Oh, thank you.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.040
You know, after today's episode,

04:42.040 --> 04:43.760
I'm going to go ride a horse.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.280
Really?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.160
Yeah, happy birthday.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.480
It's my daughter, Abby.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.680
She turned five today.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.640
Happy birthday, Abby.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.480
Yeah, so after this, we're going to go ride horses.

04:50.480 --> 04:51.520
That sounds great.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.040
Hopefully, it's not raining.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.080
Great, it sounds great.

04:54.080 --> 04:54.920
No, it's indoors.

04:54.920 --> 04:55.400
Oh, OK.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.160
I thought, come on.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.400
I thought you were not much of an equestrian there, Chris.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.160
No.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.920
Well, I used to be back in the day, long story.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.760
Make sure someone films this, and I think

05:02.760 --> 05:05.760
it would make great Patreon content.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.560
All right, well, coming up on today's episode,

05:07.560 --> 05:09.840
hopefully, we've got some great content for you.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.960
We're going to get an update on the new Linux

05:11.960 --> 05:15.520
update from the Mycroft project, straight from Ryan's mouth,

05:15.520 --> 05:17.600
a.k.a. the horse's mouth.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.360
Also, later on in the show, every single year,

05:20.360 --> 05:23.640
this chap out there puts out the big list of all of the things

05:23.640 --> 05:25.280
that are super wrong in Linux.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.920
Major Linux problems on the desktop.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.960
The 2016 edition is out, and the list is extensive,

05:31.960 --> 05:32.760
to say the least.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.480
We're going to go through the list.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.220
Wes and I read the whole dang thing.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.720
We picked out the important bits that we need to respond to,

05:38.720 --> 05:39.720
and we're going to do it right here in the show

05:39.720 --> 05:41.820
with the whole virtual lug.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.520
There are some pain points the guys got us on.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.480
Oh, yeah, for sure.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.920
And they're helpful observations.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.400
Yeah, and if you're thinking about switching to Linux,

05:48.400 --> 05:50.280
there are probably things you should know about going in.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.120
So we're going to talk about that.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.960
But there's also a few points.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.000
Kind of misses the mark on.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.120
Kind of misses the mark on.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.840
And then, towards the end of the show, I'm going to do it.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.160
I'm going to own up to what I thought

05:59.160 --> 06:00.400
was going to happen in 2015.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.560
We made our predictions of Linux action show up, so 345.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.200
I hope you look this scared during it.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.200
I know.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.640
And I went through and pulled out

06:07.640 --> 06:09.840
some of the predictions I made, and now I'm

06:09.840 --> 06:12.440
going to play them back and see how I did for 2015.

06:12.440 --> 06:12.960
Yeah.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.080
I just get to watch.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.560
Yeah, it's going to be a little painful for me.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.440
But you know what?

06:17.440 --> 06:18.720
It's on record, so I got to do it.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.520
It's not like I can hide it.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.560
So I'll go through it.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.060
We'll do it.

06:21.060 --> 06:26.040
But, you know, Wes, before we get into all of that stuff,

06:26.040 --> 06:28.520
you and I, just a moment before the lug comes in here,

06:28.520 --> 06:31.000
let's take a moment and talk about this rather outstanding

06:31.000 --> 06:31.800
beer you brought in today.

06:31.800 --> 06:32.480
Oh, do you like it?

06:32.480 --> 06:32.960
I do.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.900
This is like, we're going to call this the beer is tasty

06:34.900 --> 06:37.080
segment, because you brought in a beer last week and this week.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.600
And I think it's worth talking about.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.180
You brought in the Sierra Nevada Celebration.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.800
And it's a fresh, fresh IPA.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.520
And I was looking on Beer Advocate.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.680
It's got a BA score of 93, which is pretty amazing.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.440
6.8% by volume.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.040
Yeah, yeah.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.720
And you know, that 6.8 is kind of high for a beer.

06:54.720 --> 06:55.560
It's kind of high.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.040
I like a little, you know, the higher.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.440
It's definitely hoppy.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.360
It's pretty good.

06:59.360 --> 06:59.960
So what do you think?

06:59.960 --> 07:00.440
I like it.

07:00.440 --> 07:00.800
I like it.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.720
But you know, it is hoppy, but it

07:01.720 --> 07:03.680
doesn't have too much of the bitter hop finish.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.120
Right.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.560
It has a nice, you know, it's there.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.200
It's tasty, but it's not.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.400
Yeah, there is a bit of a finish that's like.

07:07.400 --> 07:07.920
It's not too cloying.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.280
Yeah, it stays on the tongue, but not too bad.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.600
Yeah, so there you go.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.240
If you're listening to this episode and you have a Sierra,

07:12.240 --> 07:13.200
you should crack one open.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.160
It's a crucial element that makes this show work.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.360
And also makes me a little belchy sometimes.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.480
But I'll try to avoid that.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.480
I got a mute switch right here.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.000
Maybe I can take advantage of that.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.260
Hey, let's get into our updates of the week.

07:24.260 --> 07:26.520
And to do that, let's bring in our virtual log,

07:26.520 --> 07:28.360
time appropriate greetings, Mamba Room.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.120
Hello, world.

07:29.120 --> 07:29.620
Hello.

07:29.620 --> 07:30.120
Hello.

07:30.120 --> 07:30.620
Hello.

07:30.620 --> 07:31.120
Hello.

07:31.120 --> 07:31.760
Hey, everybody.

07:31.760 --> 07:36.160
So it's here, the final episode of The World Without Linux

07:36.160 --> 07:37.800
put out by the Linux Foundation.

07:37.800 --> 07:38.800
It's finally arrived.

07:38.800 --> 07:39.960
And I haven't seen it yet.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.840
I've been saving it.

07:40.840 --> 07:41.720
Oh, I haven't seen it either.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.920
We've watched like three or four of these on the show.

07:43.920 --> 07:47.200
And this is a series to market Linux at the Linux Foundation,

07:47.200 --> 07:49.240
the people behind a lot of great initiatives

07:49.240 --> 07:51.800
and the funders of Linus Torvalds' paycheck and Greg

07:51.800 --> 07:53.960
and others that are super important to Linux kernel.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.680
They have been putting these videos out

07:55.680 --> 07:58.280
to help the average person understand what the world would

07:58.280 --> 08:00.560
be like if Linux didn't exist.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.840
So let's watch it and then do a little Mystery Science Theater

08:02.840 --> 08:03.340
on it.

08:03.340 --> 08:12.560
Hello, and welcome home to Freeburger,

08:12.560 --> 08:18.480
where the message of the day is free, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.240
Oh, hey, Annie.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.400
Sam, what's up?

08:20.400 --> 08:21.680
I didn't know you worked here.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.320
Yeah, I started here in 91 just as a hobby.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.800
Nothing professional, but here I still am.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.760
I do it just for fun.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.040
Anyways, what can I get you?

08:33.040 --> 08:35.440
Wow, this menu is huge.

08:35.440 --> 08:36.480
What's good here?

08:36.480 --> 08:39.480
Well, I like the Sloppy Joe Distro, the Pseudo Menudo,

08:39.480 --> 08:43.280
the Wild Cherry Binary, mm, bomb, the Raspberry Pie,

08:43.280 --> 08:44.440
the Soussai Souffle.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.960
Oh, the Helsinki Drinky, you should get that on the side.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.320
And of course, there is the world famous Freeburger

08:50.320 --> 08:51.880
and Kernel Fries.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.520
What are Kernel Fries?

08:53.520 --> 08:57.240
They're just like regular fries, only monolithic.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.640
So where are your ingredients sourced from?

08:59.640 --> 09:02.200
Actually, thousands of chefs from around the world

09:02.200 --> 09:04.080
contribute ingredients and recipes,

09:04.080 --> 09:06.920
so the menu is constantly evolving and getting better.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.000
Oh, you should try the gooey chocolate chip cookie.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.880
It's brand-gnu to the menu.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.400
You mean brand-new?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.480
No, brand-gnu.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.880
What's gnu?

09:16.880 --> 09:17.680
Beats me.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.280
I thought you gnu.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
Just kidding.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.000
I don't know.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.320
They just make me say it.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.080
I'll just have the Freeburger and Kernel Fries.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.240
Oh, and I need that to go.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.720
So you want that in a container?

09:27.720 --> 09:28.800
I guess.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.120
So how much do I owe you?

09:30.120 --> 09:30.760
Nothing.

09:30.760 --> 09:31.280
It's free.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.180
What, seriously?

09:32.180 --> 09:32.680
Yeah.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.560
The owners give everything away for free.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.760
And since so many people around the world contribute,

09:36.760 --> 09:39.040
the recipes are free for everyone to check out, too.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.040
It's pretty cool.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.400
That's why they call it Freeburger, dude.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.440
Oh, right.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.880
Hey, Linus?

09:45.880 --> 09:47.440
Wait, is it Linus?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.600
Anyway, I need you to release the Freeburger and Kernel

09:49.600 --> 09:53.000
Fries, and make it snappy.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.480
Users are so demanding.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.000
Hey, that's really him, isn't it?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.280
And it says I'd rather be diving on his shirt.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.760
Hey, world without Linux is hard to imagine.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.160
Thanks to the hundreds of thousands

10:04.160 --> 10:06.160
of new individuals and companies who support Linux,

10:06.160 --> 10:08.280
we don't have to.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.400
Hashtag world without Linux.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
Let's see.

10:10.400 --> 10:14.120
There's also the Bash Sour Mash, the config pig.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.600
Mm, mm, mm.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.600
There's the shells and cheese.

10:17.600 --> 10:19.600
Echo Prosecco, very smooth.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.100
Wow.

10:20.100 --> 10:22.400
Or you can get the seedy paranoia

10:22.400 --> 10:23.800
with a side of chowing down.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.300
Mm-hmm.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.040
If you're thirsty, there's grep juice.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.320
For sweets, we've got gummy boots, jelly beans,

10:29.320 --> 10:32.800
cinnamon buns, yum extenders, ice cream sandwich,

10:32.800 --> 10:34.240
gingerbread.

10:34.240 --> 10:39.080
You could have some Java with gnome foam, if you're into that.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.360
All right, that was a pretty good one.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.280
That was the best one, wasn't it?

10:41.280 --> 10:42.440
That probably was the best one.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.640
They saved the best for last, and they got a Linus.

10:44.640 --> 10:45.440
I wonder, though.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.440
I feel like a lot of those jokes you'd already

10:47.440 --> 10:49.480
have to know and like Linux to understand.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.280
That doesn't seem like a world without Linux, did it?

10:51.280 --> 10:53.120
Well, or at least it doesn't mark as well.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.840
Look at you calling out the premise.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.000
I mean, I'm glad they're making it.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.680
I like the catchy music.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.000
You're right.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.280
That was playing to the base, wasn't it?

10:58.280 --> 10:59.200
Right, which is fine.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.840
I feel played, too, which makes me feel good.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.320
But I don't think I could show that to my parents.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.600
Java with gnome foam could be a title, Jumba.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.880
You should bang suggest that.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.840
I don't know.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.960
What do you guys think in the Mumble Room?

11:10.960 --> 11:12.600
That was a valiant effort, right?

11:12.600 --> 11:14.040
I think they did pretty good.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.920
And I'm imagining how they did this,

11:15.920 --> 11:19.080
and I think it was probably a worthwhile effort.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.680
Yeah, definitely appeals to the Linux old school, doesn't it?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.200
Yeah.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.320
Right.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.200
I think it's the least worst one so far.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.560
Yeah.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.520
That's kind of you.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.560
Reminds me of watching a Quentin Tarantino movie

11:31.560 --> 11:33.320
for all the references.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.320
Oh, just in the sense of making callback references,

11:36.320 --> 11:38.400
or in the sense of Kill Bill cutting off heads?

11:38.400 --> 11:39.320
Oh, OK.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.560
All right.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.760
Yeah, OK.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.080
Yeah, iMacon doesn't like it.

11:43.080 --> 11:44.360
You guys are a bunch of critics.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.040
You know, the Linux crowd is a hard crowd.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.520
It's a hard crowd.

11:47.520 --> 11:48.880
We're not a nice community.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.320
Oh, yes, we are.

11:50.320 --> 11:50.820
We are.

11:50.820 --> 11:53.760
In fact, if you want to prove it, just attend scale.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.000
You'll actually see how nice we are.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.600
It's just we're much nicer in person,

11:56.600 --> 11:58.160
and that's the truth of it.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.920
So we're going to scale, and I'm crapping my pants

12:01.920 --> 12:03.440
as I talk about this.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.600
It is not something I intended to do.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.880
Damn it, Chris.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.240
And I know, I'm sorry about that.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.000
It's kind of smelly.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.880
I have to be here for the rest of the show.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.360
Go on.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.560
You know, I'm not like Mr. Fancy Pants

12:15.560 --> 12:20.160
Popey in the mumble room here, where my company will send me.

12:20.160 --> 12:20.680
You know?

12:20.680 --> 12:21.800
Well, you are your company.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.880
Yeah, exactly.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.080
And I just, the thing is, I have to be there.

12:27.080 --> 12:27.920
I have to go.

12:27.920 --> 12:32.000
And not only because I think it's extremely relevant for two,

12:32.000 --> 12:33.560
at least, of the shows on the network,

12:33.560 --> 12:35.720
if not three shows on the network,

12:35.720 --> 12:38.680
but really, there is something to what Wes just

12:38.680 --> 12:41.080
said, that joke you just made about how we're

12:41.080 --> 12:44.300
kind of a rough community.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.600
I was looking back at some of the stuff

12:46.600 --> 12:51.920
we did to do the last retrospective of 2015,

12:51.920 --> 12:55.040
and it just kept coming up over and over again, like community

12:55.040 --> 12:56.920
drama and community issues.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.840
And then I was doing the retrospective on LUP.

12:58.840 --> 12:59.520
Same thing.

12:59.520 --> 13:05.040
All of this crap about how the kernel mailing list is

13:05.040 --> 13:07.160
handling interacting with people.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.120
There was a period of time in the devian community

13:09.120 --> 13:10.120
during the system D stuff.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.440
Excuse me.

13:14.440 --> 13:20.560
It is like, it is a bad, we have a bad stereotype going now.

13:20.560 --> 13:23.800
It is like, it's kind of getting, it's like,

13:23.800 --> 13:27.160
well, I don't know if I should say this,

13:27.160 --> 13:30.000
but you know how there's communities online that

13:30.000 --> 13:33.880
are known for being kind of a hard community to get into?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.720
That's the Linux community.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.240
We're that community now.

13:37.240 --> 13:41.720
And it's totally unfounded, because I

13:41.720 --> 13:44.040
think there are legitimate problems like there

13:44.040 --> 13:45.920
are in any large scale community.

13:45.920 --> 13:46.560
FreeBSD.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.640
Some people have a bad time, but that doesn't

13:48.640 --> 13:49.600
mean it's the majority.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.600
Even the gentlemen, as they like to call themselves,

13:52.600 --> 13:55.360
over at FreeBSD are going through this right now.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.240
The FreeBSD Foundation just released a statement

13:58.240 --> 13:59.960
about harassment.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.680
There's back and forth going on.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.000
If you want to follow that drama,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.440
you can try to look into it.

14:04.440 --> 14:08.600
No community is isolated from this,

14:08.600 --> 14:12.200
because these are worldwide communities that are,

14:12.200 --> 14:13.620
it's not just gender issues.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.520
It is complete and different culture issues.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.160
There are different cultures working together

14:18.160 --> 14:20.120
that see things completely differently.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.920
And so there are flare ups that happen.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.600
And the thing is they happen out in the public,

14:23.600 --> 14:25.480
because these are open mailing lists, not

14:25.480 --> 14:28.940
behind some closed commercial private meeting

14:28.940 --> 14:31.160
where everybody can yell at each other and nobody ever knows

14:31.160 --> 14:32.080
about it.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.120
I think Greg Cage touched on that very well

14:34.120 --> 14:35.520
in that same retrospective.

14:35.520 --> 14:35.800
Yeah.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.440
And that's why I actually chose one of the reasons

14:37.440 --> 14:39.640
I chose that clip, because I felt like it addressed

14:39.640 --> 14:41.640
that issue at a meta level.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.400
And so I don't know how else to say this,

14:45.400 --> 14:48.760
but if you don't go to these events in person,

14:48.760 --> 14:51.040
you don't get to see the other side of the coin.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.180
You only get to read the online experience, which

14:53.180 --> 14:55.080
is very, very skewed, because there's

14:55.080 --> 14:58.160
some money to be made in the headlines and to generate clicks.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.160
And people love drama.

14:59.160 --> 14:59.760
Yeah.

14:59.760 --> 15:05.080
So if you can, I really think going to an event like this,

15:05.080 --> 15:06.680
it's a special experience.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.680
There's not a lot of things that,

15:08.680 --> 15:10.160
if you're as passionate about Linux,

15:10.160 --> 15:12.280
even half as passionate about Linux as we are,

15:12.280 --> 15:13.440
and it's something you follow.

15:13.440 --> 15:14.680
You're listening to this show, so you probably are.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.000
It is really a unique and fun experience.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.040
And I think Linux Fest Northwest, I just love it.

15:20.040 --> 15:24.160
It feels organic and genuine, and I've never

15:24.160 --> 15:26.240
been to a scale before.

15:26.240 --> 15:30.400
I've literally been avoiding it for the entire run of the show.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.880
But I'm going to go to my first scale,

15:32.880 --> 15:34.760
and I don't know what it's going to feel like.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.400
I'm going to tell you, but I don't want to get there.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.320
But I don't know yet.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.880
But there are a lot of events that go on in the industry,

15:40.880 --> 15:43.760
and these are some of the events that are really the good ones.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.160
And if you're passionate about Linux,

15:45.160 --> 15:47.040
it's a pretty cool opportunity.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.360
And we have a promo code, last40.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.960
We don't get any kickback for that at all.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.440
There's no financial agreement to offer you that.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.680
It's just they know we're going to be talking about scale,

15:55.680 --> 15:57.260
and they want to get more people there,

15:57.260 --> 15:59.920
and they gave us a promo code, last40.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.520
And I guess I get the distinction

16:02.520 --> 16:04.800
of having sent some people if you use that promo code.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.840
So I guess in that sense, it helps the esteem of the show.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.160
But I don't get any money for it.

16:09.160 --> 16:12.080
Last40, you get a 40% discount, and it's

16:12.080 --> 16:13.840
January 21st to the 24th.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.480
And there's a couple of days there

16:15.480 --> 16:17.440
where Ubicon will be overlapping scale.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.480
It's going to be a track at scale that you can attend.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.360
So you can go to both.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.200
Ubicon's free.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.120
They'd like you to register, though.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.240
We'll have links in the show notes to do that.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.920
And we're planning to do a tentative brunch on Friday.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.120
Brunch, you say?

16:30.120 --> 16:32.460
I do an action power brunch, actually.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.720
I've already set up the meetup,

16:36.720 --> 16:38.140
so we're starting to organize now.

16:38.140 --> 16:40.000
I just kind of plugged in a temporary location,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.280
which may or may not be the final location.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.440
So if you want to join us,

16:43.440 --> 16:45.840
go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.840
Here's why.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.240
This is why we're doing this.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.020
There's only going to be a short period of time

16:50.020 --> 16:52.340
where both Noah and I are at scale.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.440
I'm coming in to cover Ubicon

16:54.440 --> 16:56.440
and the first couple of days of scale,

16:56.440 --> 16:58.800
and then I'm leaving on Friday.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.040
And I'm going to try like hell to get back here by Sunday.

17:02.040 --> 17:02.960
I don't know if it's possible.

17:02.960 --> 17:03.800
I'm going to try.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.640
That is a mad dash.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.460
It might not work.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.680
I don't know what's going to happen.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.800
So I'm going to try to get back here by Sunday

17:09.800 --> 17:13.000
and do last from here with Noah doing it live from scale.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.060
So Noah's going to be there from Friday to Sunday

17:15.060 --> 17:16.280
to cover the latter half.

17:16.280 --> 17:17.840
And I think it's going to be big on the weekend.

17:17.840 --> 17:19.360
But the only day both Noah and I are going to be there

17:19.360 --> 17:21.520
is Friday so far, as is planned.

17:21.520 --> 17:22.940
So we're scheduling a meetup

17:22.940 --> 17:26.120
in the kind of morning before scale really kicks off.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.600
The idea being people always got stuff going on

17:27.600 --> 17:28.440
in the evening.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.280
Right.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.800
So anyways, and I'm going to be leaving.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.440
So I just put the meetup link in the chatroom.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.400
It's also in the show notes.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.640
And Mr. Popey, rumor has it there's also

17:37.640 --> 17:39.640
kind of like a little gathering before Ubicon

17:39.640 --> 17:41.120
that kicks off on Wednesday.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.420
Do you know anything about that?

17:43.420 --> 17:44.260
Maybe.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.320
I've kind of messed up.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.520
I'm getting out there really early.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.400
I'm getting on the, I think I'm leaving here on the 18th.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.600
So I'm going to be there around and about like a tourist.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.440
On Tuesday.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.280
Yeah, I think so.

17:58.280 --> 17:59.120
Yeah.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.360
So I may or may not.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.200
So here's what I'm planning to do

18:02.200 --> 18:05.000
is I'm planning to leave on the 16th

18:05.000 --> 18:08.080
and take one of the most beautiful drives

18:08.080 --> 18:10.440
in the United States of America is Highway 101

18:10.440 --> 18:12.200
because from Washington to California,

18:12.200 --> 18:13.880
it's the coast the entire way.

18:13.880 --> 18:14.880
Highly recommend.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.560
Yeah, and I've just been,

18:16.560 --> 18:18.400
I've been reading people talking about it on blogs.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.240
They're just raving about it.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.080
It's beautiful.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.080
Yeah, and lots of like really nice,

18:22.080 --> 18:24.000
you know, small towns and stuff like that.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.440
So I'm planning to take that drive down to California.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.680
So we'll get some more Rover log.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.160
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

18:29.160 --> 18:32.260
And I'll probably arrive on the night

18:32.260 --> 18:34.280
of the 19th or the 20th, I'm not sure.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.240
I'm not quite sure when I'll arrive

18:35.240 --> 18:36.680
because I'm going to take my time getting down there.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.280
And then I'm going to haul balls getting back.

18:39.280 --> 18:40.120
So.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.240
I mean, you've seen it all before.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.080
Yeah, yeah.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.980
So I'd love to have you guys at the,

18:43.980 --> 18:45.300
anybody that's attending, you too, Popey,

18:45.300 --> 18:46.140
anybody who's attending,

18:46.140 --> 18:48.800
I'd love to have you at the brunch if you can make it.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.920
And we may change all the details.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.880
All the details may change depending on Noah's flight

18:52.880 --> 18:53.920
because he hasn't locked in flights yet

18:53.920 --> 18:55.640
because his wife's birthday is right in there.

18:55.640 --> 18:56.900
But right now it's tentatively scheduled

18:56.900 --> 18:59.760
for Friday the 22nd at 9.30 a.m.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.240
And I just figured we'd do lunch at a cafe right by the,

19:03.240 --> 19:06.200
look, I found a nice cafe right by the event center,

19:06.200 --> 19:07.180
the convention center.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.440
But if people have a better suggestion

19:08.440 --> 19:10.320
that are more familiar with the area, I'm all ears.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.980
So there is a Linux action show subreddit thread

19:12.980 --> 19:15.400
where we're already organizing.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.680
And P4P3R has been kicking ass.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.200
He's been updating it with new details as I release them.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.400
So hopefully he'll update the post

19:21.400 --> 19:22.460
with a link to the meetup.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.080
I would prefer that this be where the discussion is had.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.920
I don't really check the meetup forms very often

19:28.920 --> 19:31.320
because honestly I got to check all these different places

19:31.320 --> 19:32.160
and I'm driving.

19:32.160 --> 19:32.980
So it's not super convenient

19:32.980 --> 19:34.600
to check the crappy meetup page.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.080
So we can organize and discuss right here in the subreddit.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.680
And this is a great thread that's already going.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.960
And if you can attend, just join the meetup.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.840
Otherwise, you get to just watch from afar

19:45.840 --> 19:48.200
as we kill ourselves to get this content to you.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.460
Hey, you know what I should do is I should mention

19:51.460 --> 19:53.720
we have a shirt that we're selling.

19:53.720 --> 19:56.240
Teespring, it's funny, you see I didn't even plan for this,

19:56.240 --> 19:58.560
but teespring.com slash last400.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.160
You're a natural seller, Chris.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.240
Well, it's because this whole scale event

20:03.240 --> 20:08.240
is, well, I mean, really, to be honest with you,

20:08.800 --> 20:10.460
is sort of at the worst time ever

20:10.460 --> 20:13.240
because not only did Christmas just finish up

20:13.240 --> 20:15.580
and not only is my daughter's birthday today,

20:15.580 --> 20:18.020
but on a personal side, I'm just finishing up a divorce,

20:18.020 --> 20:19.120
which-

20:19.120 --> 20:21.080
I've heard those make you more wealthy.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.320
Is that accurate, Chris?

20:23.280 --> 20:24.260
Because I have three kids

20:24.260 --> 20:25.940
and they're staying with Ange in that house,

20:25.940 --> 20:27.600
I'm giving them everything.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.080
So I'm moving out on my own

20:29.080 --> 20:31.640
and I literally am buying everything

20:31.640 --> 20:33.400
from toothbrushes on up.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.680
And so I can't really personally afford to finance this.

20:36.680 --> 20:39.960
Traditionally in the past, whatever the gap is,

20:39.960 --> 20:41.520
I just pay for it personally,

20:41.520 --> 20:43.360
is how I've done it for 10 years now.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.080
I can't really afford to do that anymore

20:45.080 --> 20:45.920
and not for a while.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.360
So the idea is we have a couple of things

20:48.360 --> 20:49.200
that are coming up.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.640
I'd love to celebrate last400 at that power brunch we have.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
I'd love to have cameras there.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.180
I'd love to be able to afford to bring the gear there

20:56.180 --> 20:57.020
to record it.

20:57.020 --> 20:58.940
But in order to just get to scale,

20:58.940 --> 20:59.960
we're gonna need to get funding.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.240
And then to be able to do something like last400 video.

21:02.240 --> 21:05.120
I wanna make a video for last400 while we're all at scale.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.200
That's my intention.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.840
And I would like to get all of that funded

21:07.840 --> 21:10.400
as much as we can without it going on my credit card.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.240
That's the base.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.320
I mean, I'm just being 100% honest with you.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.280
The idea was this is something

21:16.280 --> 21:18.560
that we recognize we wanna do.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.460
And I believe there is long-term value

21:20.460 --> 21:22.240
to the open source community by going there

21:22.240 --> 21:24.680
and documenting it the way that our shows do it.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.760
So I think there is value to the open source community

21:26.760 --> 21:28.280
and I think it's also value to the show

21:28.280 --> 21:29.160
to make the show something

21:29.160 --> 21:30.320
that continues to be relevant

21:30.320 --> 21:32.320
and covers relevant Linux things.

21:32.320 --> 21:36.740
And so at the end of it all is what I wanted to do

21:36.740 --> 21:39.840
was once again, when we can, have you guys help us out

21:39.840 --> 21:41.260
but also get something in the process.

21:41.260 --> 21:42.880
And these are all very nice items.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.040
They're not cheap.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.080
We don't make a huge margin on them.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.560
The quality is very good.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.160
We've worked with Teespring now for years.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.480
So we have a relationship with them

21:52.480 --> 21:54.640
that allows us to call them up and say,

21:54.640 --> 21:55.600
hey, this doesn't work for us.

21:55.600 --> 21:56.520
You've gotta fix this.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.260
And they've been very responsive.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.580
I really like the spot we're in now

21:59.580 --> 22:01.560
because now we're able to really do some great stuff.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.480
The one thing we don't have the leverage to do,

22:04.480 --> 22:06.680
which means the guys in the EU get a better deal,

22:06.680 --> 22:09.760
is over at teespring.com slash last400EU.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.640
We have a t-shirt, we have a hoodie,

22:15.160 --> 22:16.360
but they also have a tote bag.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.760
Oh, I want that tote bag.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.600
I think I'm gonna buy one.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.440
Maybe two. I am.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.560
I actually told Ansh today to get me

22:20.560 --> 22:21.400
like three different ones

22:21.400 --> 22:22.980
cause you know, we can order from the EU,

22:22.980 --> 22:24.320
we just have to pay more in shipping.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.160
Right.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
So, but the EU guys don't have to.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.040
So at teespring.com slash last400EU,

22:29.040 --> 22:30.260
you get the EU shipping,

22:30.260 --> 22:31.100
cause they have a different,

22:31.100 --> 22:32.800
they have a different, like,

22:32.800 --> 22:34.160
they set up another shop over there,

22:34.160 --> 22:35.560
so they do the printing locally.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.920
Right.

22:36.920 --> 22:37.760
Tote bag.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.680
Tote bag at conferences is a no brainer.

22:39.680 --> 22:40.800
It's a no brainer.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.480
So that is, we are like,

22:42.480 --> 22:44.080
you need to bring that to the US.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.760
So we've been talking to them,

22:45.760 --> 22:47.940
but they're like, yeah, we can't do it for this campaign.

22:47.940 --> 22:50.180
Anyways, I would love to get your support,

22:50.180 --> 22:51.280
and I'd like you to get something too.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.240
These shirts are great.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.080
These hoodies are killer.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.080
We have a bunch of different colors.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.320
You got the ladies fitted tee.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.000
And what we're gonna do is,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.160
so right now we've probably sold 26 or so,

23:01.160 --> 23:03.760
and a few other on the EU side.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.560
We're getting close to covering the gas to get down there,

23:05.560 --> 23:06.380
which is great.

23:06.380 --> 23:07.220
Right.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.360
You know, but we're not really covering any shipping

23:09.360 --> 23:11.320
to get the equipment, the big equipment from NOAA,

23:11.320 --> 23:13.120
and we're not really covering anything

23:13.120 --> 23:14.520
to really do at the party.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.240
But we're getting close to covering the gas,

23:16.240 --> 23:17.800
which is great.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.000
But we definitely are not there,

23:19.000 --> 23:20.480
so we could use a lot more support.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.480
And, you know, really, I appreciate the fact

23:22.480 --> 23:24.040
that I can just sit here and tell you guys,

23:24.040 --> 23:25.880
honestly, why I'm doing it.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.160
I hope that you understand that,

23:27.160 --> 23:28.480
from a business standpoint,

23:28.480 --> 23:31.100
this is sort of our best way to keep doing this

23:31.100 --> 23:36.100
in a way that allows us to sustainably produce these shows.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.920
Because if I overextend for events as they come up,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.800
that's not a sustainable approach.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.740
You could put the network in jeopardy.

23:43.740 --> 23:44.580
Yeah.

23:44.580 --> 23:47.360
But at the same time, I also,

23:47.360 --> 23:49.760
and I am willing to consider,

23:49.760 --> 23:50.920
I am definitely willing to,

23:50.920 --> 23:53.400
and this is not like you have to do this or else,

23:53.400 --> 23:55.960
I am willing to consider that maybe the better option is

23:55.960 --> 23:57.400
to go to a commercial sponsor

23:57.400 --> 24:00.160
and have them just sponsor the hell out of an event.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.680
But I don't know.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.760
I don't know if it is or not,

24:02.760 --> 24:03.960
and I'm willing to experiment with it,

24:03.960 --> 24:06.180
but I also really like the idea of,

24:06.180 --> 24:08.720
as best we can, crowdsourcing it,

24:08.720 --> 24:11.640
because not only does that save me time

24:11.640 --> 24:13.300
when having to line up deals,

24:13.300 --> 24:14.880
but it also just sort of lets you guys know

24:14.880 --> 24:16.120
I'm going there really for you

24:16.120 --> 24:17.980
not to go promote somebody else.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.280
Anyways, teespring.com slash last 400,

24:20.280 --> 24:22.200
or patreon.com slash today.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.040
And don't forget meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

24:25.040 --> 24:26.440
for the meetup.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.000
And I got a link to the Ubicon stuff

24:29.000 --> 24:31.360
where they say Wednesday, January 20th,

24:31.360 --> 24:32.560
one night before the event,

24:32.560 --> 24:34.240
there'll be a meeting around 1900

24:34.240 --> 24:36.540
for an informal gathering to get to know each other.

24:36.540 --> 24:40.080
And I have a link to the whole Ubicon conference schedule

24:40.080 --> 24:41.840
in the show notes if you guys are gonna be able to attend

24:41.840 --> 24:42.680
both.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.880
And it looks like there's gonna be a Thursday night party.

24:46.100 --> 24:48.160
Which I don't know if I'm registered for.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.300
Poppy, you and I need to talk.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.580
Maybe you can get me in contact with somebody,

24:50.580 --> 24:53.360
make sure I'm already in for all this stuff, okay?

24:53.360 --> 24:55.360
Cause I wanna go to that Thursday party.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.640
Maybe after the show you and I can little wink-wink.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.160
That's nice.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.520
A party, that sounds good.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.760
Get drunk with Mark Shuttleworth, right?

25:02.760 --> 25:03.720
Yep. Right.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.880
Plus you know- Body shots, I think that's-

25:04.880 --> 25:05.720
Plus you know,

25:05.720 --> 25:07.440
Poppy's drinking that watered down beer over there.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.240
So when you're here drinking the Sierra,

25:11.240 --> 25:12.160
the Sierra, what is it here?

25:12.160 --> 25:14.200
The- Celebration.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.040
Yeah, yeah.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.760
Yeah, you know he's gonna get a little tipsy.

25:17.760 --> 25:21.200
So you're gonna have to coax me off of dry January first,

25:21.200 --> 25:23.160
which won't be that hard to be honest.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.120
Dry January?

25:24.120 --> 25:24.960
Tell us more.

25:25.820 --> 25:27.200
Have you never heard of this?

25:27.200 --> 25:28.400
Oh, it's just like, you know,

25:28.400 --> 25:31.040
stop drinking for a month after the excess of Christmas.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.120
Oh, really?

25:32.120 --> 25:34.000
Oh, well I don't think that'll be too hard.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.840
No, it won't.

25:35.840 --> 25:36.680
It really won't.

25:36.680 --> 25:38.480
It doesn't count if you're in another country.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.260
Yeah, first of all, it's a way different area code.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.440
So that doesn't count.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.760
And second of all, it's like the end of January.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.180
So it's, you pretty much did it.

25:47.180 --> 25:49.640
Just have to make sure nobody tells my wife, all right?

25:49.640 --> 25:50.800
No problem.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.520
As long as she doesn't listen to the show, we're good.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.320
Which I think we're probably good.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.840
Everyone tweet at the real Popey.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.760
I thought you had to drink to recover from Christmas

26:01.760 --> 26:03.720
and the time you spent with the family and everything.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.920
Popey, alls you have to do is just think of a line

26:05.920 --> 26:06.760
that the wife will buy.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.600
I don't know if she has any anti-American sentiment in her,

26:08.600 --> 26:10.160
but just say, honey,

26:10.160 --> 26:11.960
I was down there around all those Yankees.

26:11.960 --> 26:13.400
It was just the worst.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.120
They smell bad.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.600
They don't drink any tea.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.680
And they drive on the wrong side of the road

26:18.680 --> 26:19.760
like a bunch of assholes.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.240
I needed something to soothe my nerves.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.080
And then she doesn't-

26:23.080 --> 26:24.640
Have you been listening in to my conversations

26:24.640 --> 26:25.480
with my wife?

26:25.480 --> 26:27.440
That's exactly what I would say.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.640
So there you go.

26:29.640 --> 26:32.360
So you just say you got problem solved.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.480
I'm a problem solver.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.680
People ought to consult me for relationship counseling

26:35.680 --> 26:37.520
as somebody who's going through divorce.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.780
I think I could make some money at that.

26:38.780 --> 26:39.920
Let me tell you something.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.400
All right, let me tell you another way.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.640
Maybe it's not the counseling.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.120
Here's a way you could save some money.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.400
Switch to Ting.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.800
That would probably be a better way.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.120
Maybe my counseling skills should wait

26:49.120 --> 26:50.360
and you should just switch to Ting.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.400
And this would be a good time to do it

26:51.400 --> 26:52.240
at the beginning of the year.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.520
Linux.ting.com.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.480
That's where you go to support this here show.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.040
Also get yourself a discount off some Ting gear,

26:58.040 --> 26:59.720
which is all unlocked and you own.

26:59.720 --> 27:03.120
Or get a credit if you bring a device.

27:03.120 --> 27:04.380
And they have a lot of devices

27:04.380 --> 27:06.440
because they have a CDMA and GSM network

27:06.440 --> 27:07.760
that you get to pick from.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.320
And some of these devices like the Nexus Eye devices

27:10.320 --> 27:11.580
and some of the nicer ones,

27:11.580 --> 27:14.920
they have the capability of running on CDMA or GSM.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.320
Now that's cool.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.360
Now you can get kinda picky.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.480
Now you can sort of say, well,

27:20.480 --> 27:23.000
I mean, for me, when I'm out in the Rover

27:23.000 --> 27:24.520
and I go somewhere over the weekend,

27:24.520 --> 27:26.280
sometimes I have better CDMA coverage

27:26.280 --> 27:28.640
and sometimes I have better GSM coverage.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.160
It just depends on the location.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.800
So I can be kinda savvy about that.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.480
And Ting has an incredible dashboard

27:33.480 --> 27:35.160
that lets you manage all of this stuff.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.220
It works on all of your devices.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.680
But it's actually good.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.320
It's actually useful.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.860
I don't really know how else to describe it.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.600
It is, you know, you can go in there

27:43.600 --> 27:45.280
and you can set nicknames for your devices.

27:45.280 --> 27:46.660
You can go in there and set alerts

27:46.660 --> 27:48.680
and you can set maximum thresholds.

27:48.680 --> 27:51.280
You can turn off individual level services

27:51.280 --> 27:53.560
that allows you to really get granular control

27:53.560 --> 27:55.200
over your account.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.800
You can do things like transfer to another line

27:58.800 --> 28:00.140
from the control panel itself.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.720
You don't even have to call customer service.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.800
But it's not to get you to avoid using customer service

28:05.800 --> 28:07.400
because they have fanatical customer service

28:07.400 --> 28:10.160
that sticks with you until the problem is solved.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.180
So it's a really nice setup.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.120
So go to linux.ting.com to see more.

28:14.120 --> 28:17.400
They have great devices at great prices.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.480
And they also have a great blog.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.600
We covered this in Linux Action Show this Sunday.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.560
Kyra just posted her top five apps

28:24.560 --> 28:26.560
over the last 12 months.

28:26.560 --> 28:27.400
Pretty good video.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.160
And they also have done some recent holiday cord cutter

28:30.160 --> 28:34.320
posts that are really useful if you need to cut the cord.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.200
And they've also even got the sports.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.760
Which I know, Wes, you're a big sports guy.

28:39.760 --> 28:40.600
You're a huge.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.520
It's hard to find those college football.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.080
Playoff games on the internet.

28:45.080 --> 28:45.920
Sports ball.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.040
You know, I actually got a couple good ideas

28:48.040 --> 28:49.960
from reading the blog post even though I'm not a sports guy.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.000
Because I just am really interested in getting live TV

28:52.000 --> 28:53.160
on the internet and things like that.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.000
And that was actually, it was a good post.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.440
IPTV the future.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.520
You know, Ting really seems like they're made up

28:57.520 --> 28:58.620
of people like us.

28:58.620 --> 28:59.460
They really are.

28:59.460 --> 29:00.280
They really are.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.120
Which is awesome.

29:01.120 --> 29:01.960
It is kind of cool.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.720
And you know, so because they're owned by Two Cows,

29:04.720 --> 29:05.880
which has been around forever,

29:05.880 --> 29:07.640
and they're like one of the original internet companies

29:07.640 --> 29:09.040
that figured out how to survive the dot com boom

29:09.040 --> 29:09.860
and do things right.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.840
So there's certain things that they just really,

29:11.840 --> 29:13.360
like they just follow by law.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.960
It's just like their own personal law.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.160
Linux.ting.com.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.840
Go there, support the show and get $25

29:17.840 --> 29:20.480
off your first unlocked device and go own it.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.380
Linux.ting.com.

29:21.380 --> 29:25.320
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.160
I love it.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.720
All right, Ryan, I hope you are back here, sir.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.120
Because I would love to talk to you

29:30.120 --> 29:32.360
about what's going on at the MyCraft project.

29:33.880 --> 29:34.720
Ryan?

29:34.720 --> 29:36.040
Did he make it back?

29:36.040 --> 29:37.120
No.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.240
Oh yeah, oh sorry.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.080
There you go.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.720
Okay, Ryan, go ahead.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.120
Well, I'm here and I've got a lot to talk about.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.200
Well, now hold on, let's tease it a little bit.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.840
So Ryan emails me and we're talking back and forth

29:47.840 --> 29:49.600
about a couple things that you guys probably hear about

29:49.600 --> 29:51.160
more down the road.

29:51.160 --> 29:54.400
And there was a tease that there might be something

29:54.400 --> 29:57.200
landing that people, a tangible thing people

29:57.200 --> 29:59.960
can go get their hands on online and look at

29:59.960 --> 30:01.960
and sort of maybe even contribute to.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.800
I don't wanna say anymore.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.640
I'm excited already.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.040
But I'm just saying something interesting

30:05.040 --> 30:07.680
could be dropping very soon from the MyCraft project.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.500
You think I have teased properly, Ryan?

30:09.500 --> 30:10.340
Yeah, that's perfect.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.600
Okay, so what's going on?

30:12.800 --> 30:17.800
Tomorrow at three o'clock PM, central standard time.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I don't know what it is in UTC.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.440
Ha ha ha.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.280
Okay.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.880
We are releasing the Adapt Intent Parser.

30:24.880 --> 30:25.720
Hey!

30:25.720 --> 30:27.960
Which is our software library that we use

30:27.960 --> 30:30.040
to convert natural language into machine

30:30.040 --> 30:31.680
readable data structures.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.840
So what that means, yeah.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.240
So it's the Intent Parser you said?

30:37.240 --> 30:38.080
Yeah, that's right.

30:38.080 --> 30:38.900
Okay.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.520
And this is kind of some of the secret sauce of MyCraft.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.480
So we're really releasing probably one of our

30:43.480 --> 30:45.640
most powerful tools right out of the gate.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.560
That's high.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.440
Ryan, I might have you check your input a little bit

30:48.440 --> 30:50.240
because you're clipping a little bit.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.200
I think this sounds like, and I'm gonna ask you

30:53.200 --> 30:55.080
if I'm right or not, but this sounds like this is

30:55.080 --> 30:57.120
sort of like the critical decision maker piece

30:57.120 --> 30:59.800
that once I've been given input, I have to decide

30:59.800 --> 31:01.100
what the intent of that input was.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.480
Are they looking to do a thing?

31:02.480 --> 31:03.720
Are they asking about a thing?

31:03.720 --> 31:04.920
Do I have that right?

31:04.920 --> 31:08.060
That's exactly correct.

31:08.060 --> 31:11.400
What it does is it looks at your sentence or your query

31:11.400 --> 31:16.400
and parses it and it decides what the person is trying to do

31:17.240 --> 31:19.200
and then turns it into an action.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.480
Or turns it into at least a JSON little data set

31:22.480 --> 31:25.320
that an application can use to take an action.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.920
That kind of seems like that's a core thing

31:26.920 --> 31:29.920
that makes Siri and Google Now useful is they know

31:29.920 --> 31:31.840
when I say, what's the weather like today?

31:31.840 --> 31:33.760
They're able to grab the context out of that and say,

31:33.760 --> 31:35.680
well today is this, like they get the intent

31:35.680 --> 31:38.880
of what I'm doing, like that seems like the thing

31:38.880 --> 31:41.040
that makes these things actually smart.

31:41.040 --> 31:41.880
Yeah, that's right.

31:41.880 --> 31:46.800
And since we had, actually when we began

31:46.800 --> 31:50.120
after the Kickstarter, we had received a lot of attention.

31:50.120 --> 31:55.120
And Josh and I, the founders had, we had a,

31:55.160 --> 31:57.620
what we call Mycroft Legacy now.

31:57.620 --> 32:01.080
And we were using a variety of tools

32:01.080 --> 32:03.760
in order to perform this action.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.760
And then Sean Fitzgerald, who was formerly

32:06.760 --> 32:10.040
one of the developers at Siri and on the Amazon Echo,

32:10.040 --> 32:11.880
came over and he brought this with him.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.720
Oh wow.

32:12.720 --> 32:13.680
An earlier version of this.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.560
And he was like, hey, I've been working on this,

32:15.560 --> 32:17.800
I was gonna open source it, but it seemed like

32:17.800 --> 32:19.720
it would be a good fit for your guys' project

32:19.720 --> 32:22.200
considering I had spoken on multiple occasions

32:22.200 --> 32:26.440
about wishing that I didn't have to rely on outside APIs

32:26.440 --> 32:28.120
to do this type of task.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.160
Ah, so this is huge in the sense too

32:31.160 --> 32:34.120
that you're now less reliant on third-party services?

32:34.120 --> 32:34.960
Yeah, that's right.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.040
And so we immediately, once I realized

32:38.040 --> 32:40.240
what he'd brought with him, I was like,

32:40.240 --> 32:42.080
we need to put some resources into this

32:42.080 --> 32:44.080
and get this as polished as we can

32:44.080 --> 32:45.840
and then share it with the world.

32:45.840 --> 32:50.840
And so we've put some polish on it.

32:51.360 --> 32:55.040
It's still early days, but our release is in July

32:55.040 --> 32:56.800
of everything.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.800
And so we're just opening it up now

32:59.800 --> 33:01.760
so the community can get in there and hack it

33:01.760 --> 33:04.240
and use it for other things other than

33:04.240 --> 33:05.480
what we've used it for.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.440
I actually got some ideas laid out here

33:07.440 --> 33:09.160
because I wanted to share them with your audience

33:09.160 --> 33:11.320
because I'm really excited for people to use it.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.720
Yeah.

33:12.720 --> 33:14.920
What is, could you tell us what's the license gonna be?

33:14.920 --> 33:16.000
What is it written in?

33:16.000 --> 33:16.840
Oh yeah.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.040
It's gonna be, it's Python, it's all written in Python.

33:19.040 --> 33:19.880
Oh great.

33:19.880 --> 33:24.880
It's being released under the LGPL version three.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.320
Wow.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.920
We were originally going to release it

33:28.920 --> 33:30.960
under the GPL version three,

33:30.960 --> 33:33.560
but we realized that some people wouldn't be able

33:33.560 --> 33:35.400
to use it in their applications

33:35.400 --> 33:38.560
because of the nature of the GPL.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.240
So the one limited sort of negated that.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.080
Yeah.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.840
And so the LGPL can be used with other licenses

33:45.840 --> 33:47.020
a lot easier.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.520
And that was a conversation that I had

33:49.520 --> 33:52.120
with the community on mostly on Google Plus.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.600
I just asked, I was like, hey,

33:54.600 --> 33:56.840
we're gonna release this new project.

33:56.840 --> 33:59.960
I want to know what you guys think we should release it

33:59.960 --> 34:04.200
under and the overwhelmingly they said LGPL.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.880
So not to get too down into the weeds, Ryan,

34:05.880 --> 34:08.440
but does this intent parser kick in before

34:08.440 --> 34:10.200
or after a call out to a remote service?

34:10.200 --> 34:12.580
Where is this fall in sort of the decision chain

34:12.580 --> 34:14.180
that a MyCraft device follows?

34:15.080 --> 34:17.960
So right now what happens is it kind of depends

34:17.960 --> 34:22.040
on the device because adapt sometimes has to live

34:22.040 --> 34:24.800
on our servers with our testing with really small

34:24.800 --> 34:27.560
embedded devices that don't have any processing,

34:27.560 --> 34:31.040
real processing power on board, but it's super lightweight.

34:31.040 --> 34:36.040
We've run it on the original Raspberry Pi and the B plus.

34:36.720 --> 34:38.340
And it was just fine.

34:38.340 --> 34:40.280
It was fast and responsive.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.360
And it lives on our current MyCraft stack.

34:44.360 --> 34:45.880
If you're using the embedded device,

34:45.880 --> 34:47.400
so if you're using the MyCraft unit

34:47.400 --> 34:49.800
that we raise money for in the Kickstarter,

34:49.800 --> 34:51.720
it actually does live locally.

34:51.720 --> 34:56.720
So the query goes out, the STT,

34:56.960 --> 35:00.520
whatever we're using for STT in this case would be with AI

35:00.520 --> 35:05.520
or Google STT would come back with the text.

35:05.660 --> 35:09.200
So what you said, and then the adapt intent parser

35:09.200 --> 35:11.260
sitting on the unit would look at it

35:11.260 --> 35:13.200
and turn it into actionable data,

35:13.200 --> 35:16.840
which then MyCraft would take the next action,

35:16.840 --> 35:20.700
whether that be calling out to an API to get the weather

35:20.700 --> 35:24.280
or casting something to the Chromecast.

35:24.280 --> 35:29.280
So now this piece is sort of been pre-developed.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.080
Are you concerned at all about anybody

35:32.080 --> 35:36.200
that's gonna claim things like intellectual property patents

35:36.200 --> 35:37.040
or anything like that?

35:37.040 --> 35:39.000
Is this a minefield for you guys?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.800
Or are you feeling safe?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.240
We're feeling pretty safe.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.080
It's a different approach than...

35:46.260 --> 35:47.960
So there's two things.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.840
There's nothing like this out there

35:50.840 --> 35:53.040
that's open source right now,

35:53.040 --> 35:58.040
which is just a giant hole that's missing in the world.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.960
And it could be used for so many other things

36:00.960 --> 36:05.160
than what we're using it for, like chat bots, IRC bots.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.240
I actually keep thinking of studio automation tasks

36:07.240 --> 36:08.520
that I could use.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.520
And robots and video games.

36:10.520 --> 36:11.840
Video games would be so cool

36:11.840 --> 36:14.640
if you could type something to a character

36:14.640 --> 36:19.640
and have them understand your intent, or like a phone system

36:20.760 --> 36:22.800
or analysis of large amounts of data.

36:22.800 --> 36:27.280
Like if you were analyzing a whole bunch of tweets,

36:27.280 --> 36:28.360
this could pick out.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.760
Really?

36:29.760 --> 36:33.040
Various things about what they're doing and things like that.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.520
You mean there's wide applications

36:34.520 --> 36:37.560
outside of even AI devices like this?

36:37.560 --> 36:38.800
You mean there could be server-side

36:38.800 --> 36:41.160
background analysis applications for something like this?

36:41.160 --> 36:42.080
That's exactly right.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.840
And to answer your question,

36:44.840 --> 36:47.040
because I kind of sidestepped there,

36:47.040 --> 36:49.840
we're not worried about copyright infringing

36:49.840 --> 36:50.680
or anything like that,

36:50.680 --> 36:55.560
because we kind of have so many people now from backgrounds

36:55.560 --> 36:57.240
who have worked on projects like this before

36:57.240 --> 37:00.160
that a lot of people say that our approach

37:00.160 --> 37:04.400
is a lot different than those of the other existing companies

37:04.400 --> 37:07.440
and that they don't think that it's really necessarily

37:07.440 --> 37:09.400
going to be a problem.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.240
But we'll see.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.080
I mean, we'll see.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.440
It seems like, it seems,

37:14.520 --> 37:15.640
one of the things, Ryan,

37:15.640 --> 37:20.000
that has always struck me about these personal assistants,

37:20.000 --> 37:22.080
be it Amazon Echo and today,

37:22.080 --> 37:24.120
I talked about it in Tech Talk today, Ford announced,

37:24.120 --> 37:26.620
they're looking to integrate with the Amazon Echo,

37:26.620 --> 37:28.660
so that way you can give it commands from your car.

37:28.660 --> 37:30.640
It seems like what you really need for these things

37:30.640 --> 37:33.640
to ever be useful is ubiquity.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.220
So like I would need one in my home,

37:35.220 --> 37:36.480
I would need one in my office,

37:36.480 --> 37:37.640
I might need one in my car,

37:37.640 --> 37:41.400
and I would maybe need one in different areas of my house.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.720
And I think the only way to truly make that possible

37:44.720 --> 37:47.660
is to have the device be different types of devices

37:47.660 --> 37:48.600
for different scenarios.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.160
Maybe in my studio, it's all running on a computer.

37:51.160 --> 37:55.580
Maybe in my RV, it's on a little Mycroft appliance box,

37:55.580 --> 37:57.520
and in my kitchen, it's a Mycroft appliance box.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.160
But maybe in my studio,

37:59.160 --> 38:01.440
it's something that's on just a Raspberry Pi

38:01.440 --> 38:02.840
that I've implemented myself.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.060
It seems like the ability to have the stuff behind this,

38:05.060 --> 38:06.720
the open source software behind this,

38:06.720 --> 38:09.940
run on a server in a different form of implementation,

38:09.940 --> 38:13.480
actually gives the possibility of true ubiquity

38:13.480 --> 38:17.080
in this kind of artificial assistant.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.000
So I don't have to have just my phone.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.720
I don't have to have just the Mycroft device.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.520
I don't have to be in just this room.

38:22.520 --> 38:26.640
And if I have even a little a DIY inspiration,

38:26.640 --> 38:27.560
I could roll it myself,

38:27.560 --> 38:29.560
or somebody could make a product that does it.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.360
I could even have it running on my server

38:31.360 --> 38:33.640
that's checking my email in some degree.

38:33.640 --> 38:38.640
It seems to me that open source isn't just a licensing thing,

38:38.840 --> 38:41.480
but it actually makes like this truly

38:41.480 --> 38:46.480
an Internet of Things capable device or set of software.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.640
Yeah, you nailed it on the head.

38:50.640 --> 38:55.040
The idea where a lot of people are too siloed

38:55.040 --> 38:57.800
and they're thinking about what this type of technology means

38:57.800 --> 38:59.460
and where it's going to live.

38:59.460 --> 39:03.720
Mycroft, the thing that I keep saying in interviews

39:03.720 --> 39:07.400
is Mycroft is not just going to live on the Mycroft unit.

39:07.400 --> 39:12.280
Mycroft in the world that we envision lives on the computer,

39:12.280 --> 39:16.280
it lives on the phone, it lives on the freaking dishwasher.

39:16.280 --> 39:20.240
Maybe it's on a droplet working on something I gave it.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.080
Yeah, exactly.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.740
And these parts, and the thing that was the most frustrating

39:24.740 --> 39:27.480
when we took up this task was none of this was there.

39:27.480 --> 39:32.480
There were some projects that were kind of, you know,

39:32.680 --> 39:35.960
tackling maybe a little bit of one part of what we're doing.

39:35.960 --> 39:40.360
But the thing is, in order for us to actually make a dent

39:40.360 --> 39:44.440
and compete with the proprietary applications

39:44.440 --> 39:46.320
that are coming out, we have to,

39:46.320 --> 39:49.800
we've found ourselves having to tackle various parts

39:49.800 --> 39:51.080
of this project, which is fine.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.240
They need to be tackled.

39:53.240 --> 39:57.720
And so this is one part, you know, the adapt engine

39:57.720 --> 39:58.560
is one part.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.540
So I guess in day to day, here's to bring it all

40:01.540 --> 40:03.360
to a sort of like a point, a relevant point,

40:03.360 --> 40:06.840
is I could see myself having a Mycroft AI unit

40:06.840 --> 40:09.280
in my kitchen and then I go upstairs to work in my office

40:09.280 --> 40:11.640
and instead of having another hardware that I spent 100

40:11.640 --> 40:15.560
or 200 or whatever it is, I have Mycroft on the desktop.

40:15.560 --> 40:19.640
And it also is using my desktop mic and it is also aware

40:19.640 --> 40:21.940
of the same things my kitchen version is,

40:21.940 --> 40:24.120
but in the kitchen I have in a self-contained appliance unit

40:24.120 --> 40:27.240
and up in my office where I have my nice powerful desktop,

40:27.240 --> 40:29.560
I'm just running the Mycroft software.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.380
Does that seem like a feasible implementation to you?

40:32.380 --> 40:33.220
Yes, it does.

40:33.220 --> 40:35.560
In fact, I'm running it on my desktop right now.

40:35.560 --> 40:37.000
Yes, earlier.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.320
What else can you tell us about that?

40:39.320 --> 40:42.760
Well, we did release a video just a couple days ago

40:42.760 --> 40:44.640
about Mycroft on the desktop.

40:44.640 --> 40:49.040
But the other thing is, I, yesterday,

40:49.040 --> 40:50.320
or was it the day before, I don't know,

40:50.320 --> 40:52.600
Aaron's sitting next to me, he knows, I'm sure,

40:52.600 --> 40:56.720
I launched every application I could on my computer

40:56.720 --> 40:59.440
via Mycroft and my fan was kicking up

40:59.440 --> 41:00.840
and making all sorts of noise

41:00.840 --> 41:02.240
because I didn't close any of them,

41:02.240 --> 41:05.720
I just kept asking him to open more and more and more.

41:05.720 --> 41:10.720
And it was crazy what accuracy was and I realized,

41:11.920 --> 41:15.200
yes, you could just go and pick through your applications

41:15.200 --> 41:18.200
and open that random one, but it is so convenient.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.440
Are you using Mycroft on an Oryx Pro?

41:21.480 --> 41:23.440
There is, yeah, there's an Oryx Pro next to me

41:23.440 --> 41:24.280
that has it on it.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.160
What's a mitochondria?

41:26.160 --> 41:30.020
Mitochondria, an organelle containing enzymes

41:30.020 --> 41:32.760
responsible for producing energy.

41:32.760 --> 41:36.960
Hey Mycroft, what is 31 divided by six?

41:36.960 --> 41:39.360
5.16 repeating.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.520
It kind of sounds like Wimpy.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.520
Are you telling me, are you telling me

41:42.520 --> 41:45.120
that System76 gave you Oryx Pros for this video?

41:45.120 --> 41:46.200
Are you telling me that?

41:46.200 --> 41:48.640
Because I wanted an Oryx Pro real bad.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.440
They didn't give us one.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.280
You bought it?

41:51.280 --> 41:52.200
That's Aaron's, yeah.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.160
They're always, okay.

41:53.160 --> 41:55.640
I got back from System76 and I was talking about

41:55.640 --> 41:57.800
what the nice build quality was and everything

41:57.800 --> 42:01.080
and he broke down and bought it and a frenzy.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.320
I want one so bad I was about to get super jelly

42:03.320 --> 42:06.360
because you know what, I got to say,

42:06.360 --> 42:08.800
I want to be first in line if they're giving them away.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.080
All right.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.200
I want to say one thing about the Oryx Pro real quick.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.440
Okay.

42:13.440 --> 42:16.120
The keyboard on that is the best keyboard I've ever used.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
Yeah.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.360
I just put, yeah, I got to use it for one night

42:19.360 --> 42:20.200
and I fell in love.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.880
So I'm inferring from the video here

42:22.880 --> 42:24.840
that this is a working thing.

42:24.840 --> 42:27.320
Is this something I can get my hands on yet?

42:27.320 --> 42:28.600
Not yet, April.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.360
April is when, I mean, you,

42:31.360 --> 42:33.280
maybe we can work something out, but.

42:33.280 --> 42:37.640
But like I keep saying, we're really just trying

42:37.640 --> 42:39.840
to ensure that our first,

42:41.440 --> 42:44.200
each of these projects around Mycroft,

42:44.200 --> 42:46.040
we're trying to make as solid as possible

42:46.040 --> 42:49.040
before we release it to be contributed to

42:49.040 --> 42:53.160
because part of that is not does this run well,

42:53.160 --> 42:55.960
but it's how, what's the,

42:57.200 --> 42:59.680
what's it look like when someone wants to contribute

42:59.680 --> 43:00.960
back to this project?

43:00.960 --> 43:04.760
Are they able to do that in an easy way?

43:04.760 --> 43:07.600
Are they able to, do they have the documentation they need?

43:07.600 --> 43:10.880
Do they have the tools they need in order to develop for it?

43:10.880 --> 43:13.920
And so people just want me,

43:13.920 --> 43:16.720
a lot of people ask me like to just throw everything

43:16.720 --> 43:19.920
out there in one big release party,

43:19.920 --> 43:21.920
but I'm like, if I throw it out there

43:21.920 --> 43:23.640
without enough documentation,

43:23.640 --> 43:25.760
this is actually a problem that people aren't used

43:25.760 --> 43:29.640
to dealing with this artificial intelligence

43:30.600 --> 43:34.640
or in the event of like natural language processing.

43:34.640 --> 43:38.640
And so I've tried, I've set people in front of it

43:38.640 --> 43:40.920
and said like, hey, look at this.

43:40.920 --> 43:43.680
And they're like, I'm not familiar with any of these terms.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.240
I don't know how any of this works.

43:45.240 --> 43:49.200
And it's because we're used to creating applications

43:49.200 --> 43:51.200
where you point and grunt.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.680
You know, you're not used to parsing what people say

43:54.680 --> 43:56.200
and turning that into actionable.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.040
Is this your way of letting me know

43:58.040 --> 44:01.060
that you're not gonna bring a demo unit to scale?

44:01.060 --> 44:03.360
I am bringing a demo unit to scale.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.480
Oh, all right, nice.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.560
Yes, I was hoping so, I wanna see it.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.360
Yeah, I've heard you're giving out demos

44:09.360 --> 44:10.720
and I'm hoping to see one at scale.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.600
Watch Chris's hands, he will steal it.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.780
Ryan, what is your hope?

44:13.780 --> 44:17.000
I mean, aren't you at least a little concerned

44:17.000 --> 44:19.740
that the noise of the convention floor

44:19.740 --> 44:23.540
will make the audio interaction impossible with the thing?

44:23.540 --> 44:28.540
So I'm concerned about that, but I'm also planning on,

44:28.680 --> 44:30.020
I already talked to Jono

44:30.020 --> 44:32.240
cause I gave him a demo earlier today.

44:32.240 --> 44:34.760
And we talked about stealing a side room

44:34.760 --> 44:36.880
in order to show people so that we weren't,

44:36.880 --> 44:40.400
cause yes, just like when you're talking to a person,

44:40.400 --> 44:42.960
if lots of people are yelling around it,

44:42.960 --> 44:46.120
sometimes it picks you up, sometimes it's like hey,

44:46.120 --> 44:46.960
I don't know what you said.

44:46.960 --> 44:47.800
That's gotta be the worst case scenario

44:47.800 --> 44:49.360
is a convention floor for a device.

44:49.360 --> 44:50.440
So if it even works at all,

44:50.440 --> 44:51.440
then you're probably good.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.480
Make sure you grab me or Noah

44:53.480 --> 44:55.120
and let's get a little video of it

44:55.120 --> 44:57.280
cause that'd be amazing when we're down there.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.120
So Ryan, what else do we need to talk about today?

44:59.120 --> 45:00.960
Cause I feel like there's other things,

45:00.960 --> 45:03.600
but I don't, nothing comes to the top of my head.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.440
Well, I just really wanna remind people

45:05.440 --> 45:09.120
that what's coming out tomorrow, Adapt and Temp Parcer,

45:09.120 --> 45:12.360
and we are so excited to see

45:12.360 --> 45:16.040
what people will be using Adapt for,

45:16.040 --> 45:18.320
what ideas they have,

45:18.320 --> 45:20.600
where right now I've been spending all day

45:20.600 --> 45:22.000
working on the documentation,

45:22.000 --> 45:23.520
trying to make it as easy as possible

45:23.520 --> 45:26.280
for people to get up and use it for something.

45:26.280 --> 45:31.080
And this, if you start with this

45:31.080 --> 45:33.160
and you really gain an understanding of this,

45:33.160 --> 45:34.760
you'll be able to, on day one,

45:34.760 --> 45:38.440
probably write various skills from Mycroft.

45:38.440 --> 45:41.200
So it's not a waste of time to pop in

45:41.200 --> 45:42.400
and learn a little bit about this.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.080
And what I want to see

45:44.080 --> 45:47.440
are really, really intelligent IRC bots.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.520
Like that seems like a perfect match for this.

45:49.520 --> 45:50.520
It does, it really does.

45:50.520 --> 45:53.360
And JBot gets an upgrade in 2016.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.880
Yeah, and you know, like I said,

45:55.880 --> 45:58.200
robots would be a really good match for this.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.200
And video games, video games are the clearest one to me

46:01.200 --> 46:04.400
because you could have characters who understand

46:04.400 --> 46:06.320
the simplest of phrases.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.480
This very well may be the originator

46:09.480 --> 46:12.720
of the intended parser for the frickin' holodeck.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.560
Yeah. That could be, right?

46:14.560 --> 46:16.640
Oh, I know what we should talk about, Chris.

46:16.640 --> 46:17.480
Yeah.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.600
And I haven't committed to this, but-

46:19.600 --> 46:20.440
It's in the back of your mind,

46:20.440 --> 46:21.760
something you got kicking around?

46:21.760 --> 46:24.160
Yeah, I keep, I shouldn't commit to things on here.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.080
No, this isn't a commitment.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.920
This is a brainstorming session.

46:27.920 --> 46:28.880
Oh, a brainstorming session.

46:28.880 --> 46:32.320
So I told Chris this so everybody knows,

46:32.320 --> 46:36.960
that we should totally pimp the RV with Mycroft units.

46:36.960 --> 46:37.800
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.000
The Rover's gotta be upgraded with Mycroft AI.

46:40.000 --> 46:41.920
I'm not kidding, that's gotta happen.

46:41.920 --> 46:42.760
I just don't-

46:42.760 --> 46:44.280
Not just one, not just one.

46:44.280 --> 46:46.720
You don't want the unit at the front of the RV.

46:46.720 --> 46:49.440
No, you gotta have one in the back

46:49.440 --> 46:51.040
where the business is too, because-

46:51.040 --> 46:52.080
In the bathroom too.

46:52.080 --> 46:53.640
Oh, oh yeah, yeah.

46:53.640 --> 46:54.480
Just everywhere.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.320
That's a good point.

46:55.320 --> 46:57.860
You basically nailed the three sound isolation zones

46:57.860 --> 46:59.800
where I would need mic coverage.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.400
Yeah, yeah.

47:01.400 --> 47:05.240
So can you hook Mycroft up to accelerometers

47:05.240 --> 47:06.080
and things like that?

47:06.080 --> 47:08.600
So it can say to Chris in the middle of the night,

47:08.600 --> 47:10.920
stay calm, it's just an earthquake.

47:10.920 --> 47:14.080
Well, you know, this is something

47:14.080 --> 47:18.280
that we don't talk about enough anymore,

47:18.280 --> 47:20.720
but remember the actual units themselves

47:20.720 --> 47:23.640
are with the exception of the Raspberry Pi,

47:23.640 --> 47:25.080
which, you know, some people are like,

47:25.080 --> 47:25.920
that's not open hardware,

47:25.920 --> 47:28.440
but the unit itself is completely open.

47:28.440 --> 47:31.960
You can pop it open, there's a Raspberry Pi in there,

47:31.960 --> 47:34.760
and there's an Arduinos, and there's, you know,

47:34.760 --> 47:37.260
everything's exposed, all the ports are exposed.

47:37.260 --> 47:39.200
So you can hack on it if you want to

47:39.200 --> 47:40.600
and add whatever it is that you-

47:40.600 --> 47:42.920
That actually in the rover could be a useful feature.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.600
That could be a very useful feature.

47:45.600 --> 47:49.520
Somebody asked in chat, and I just wanted to tell them,

47:49.520 --> 47:52.440
you do not need a Mycroft unit

47:52.440 --> 47:54.740
in order to use Mycroft on the desktop.

47:56.080 --> 47:56.920
Right.

47:56.920 --> 47:59.760
Yeah, but I would still encourage anybody

47:59.760 --> 48:03.840
who's been on the edge to order a Mycroft unit

48:03.840 --> 48:05.920
because it supports the development effort.

48:05.920 --> 48:06.760
Yeah.

48:06.760 --> 48:11.760
But no, you know, anyone who has the ability

48:12.760 --> 48:14.880
to install Debian packages should be able

48:14.880 --> 48:19.320
to run Mycroft on their desktop.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.160
Cool.

48:20.160 --> 48:22.220
Now, Wimby usually had a question, go ahead.

48:22.220 --> 48:25.360
Yeah, we've obviously heard quite a lot about Mycroft

48:25.360 --> 48:27.080
over the last sort of six to nine months.

48:27.080 --> 48:30.720
I was just curious how much time you'd been working on it

48:30.720 --> 48:32.420
prior to the Kickstarter.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.280
I started working on Mycroft.

48:36.280 --> 48:41.280
Mycroft probably was born in January of 2015.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.540
I think that sounds right.

48:44.540 --> 48:49.540
And then that was Josh Montgomery, the CEO, at the time.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.600
Him and I, I actually hung out at his makerspace

48:53.600 --> 48:58.600
and what had happened is he'd seen a really simple AI

48:59.440 --> 49:00.380
at another makerspace.

49:00.380 --> 49:03.700
It was all like, you just said a specific word

49:03.700 --> 49:08.160
and it just had a pre-selected action that it took.

49:08.160 --> 49:13.160
And so we started geeking out about geek things.

49:13.440 --> 49:16.500
And he started telling me about this

49:16.500 --> 49:19.580
and we were like, you know, maybe we can make this.

49:19.580 --> 49:22.000
That would be so awesome if the makerspace

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
that we hang out in had this in every room

49:25.000 --> 49:27.800
and you could say like, hey, Mycroft, where's this?

49:27.800 --> 49:29.760
Do this, play this music.

49:29.760 --> 49:33.300
And so it was originally named Scarlett, though,

49:34.240 --> 49:35.680
after Scarlett Johansson.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.040
Now I'm in love.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.560
Now you've sold me.

49:39.560 --> 49:43.660
And then over time, when we started playing

49:43.660 --> 49:45.740
with our early code, we were like,

49:45.740 --> 49:47.080
this is actually really awesome.

49:47.080 --> 49:49.300
We should make a product out of this.

49:49.300 --> 49:51.000
And that's where that was kind of born.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.040
So I got on around March or April.

49:54.040 --> 49:57.800
And so it's been worked on since January, 2015.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.280
And then the Kickstarter was, of course,

49:59.280 --> 50:00.960
I think around September.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.400
I kind of, that was so,

50:03.400 --> 50:06.920
there was so much going on at that point with Mycroft

50:06.920 --> 50:11.040
that my mind has kind of like blocked out all of that.

50:11.040 --> 50:15.000
But yeah, anybody who thinks you just throw up

50:15.000 --> 50:18.820
a Kickstarter and money rolls in is just wrong.

50:18.820 --> 50:19.660
Anyway.

50:19.660 --> 50:22.360
Are you saying the device was inspired by the movie Her?

50:23.440 --> 50:24.840
No, not necessarily.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.800
Have you seen that movie, the AI,

50:26.800 --> 50:28.380
voiced by Scarlett Johansson?

50:28.380 --> 50:30.200
It was inspired by many things.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.660
Yeah, I know, I'm just teasing.

50:31.660 --> 50:34.560
Well, you know the namesake, right?

50:34.560 --> 50:35.400
Of Mycroft?

50:35.400 --> 50:36.240
No, I don't.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.600
Oh, you did, I think you told me, but I don't remember.

50:38.600 --> 50:42.040
It's named after the AI in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.

50:42.040 --> 50:42.960
Right, okay.

50:42.960 --> 50:46.080
It's also the name of Sherlock Holmes' brother, but.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.680
Yeah, right, right, right.

50:47.680 --> 50:51.720
Anyway, but yeah, so yeah, we've been working on it for,

50:51.720 --> 50:54.220
well, it's January now, so a full year.

50:55.720 --> 50:56.720
That's remarkable progress.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.120
Yeah, it's actually pretty neat to see.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.600
Yeah, really good momentum.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.400
Yeah, and I mean, especially if you're ready

51:02.400 --> 51:04.320
to show a device at scale.

51:04.320 --> 51:05.160
That's pretty cool.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.520
I'm excited to see that footage.

51:06.520 --> 51:10.840
Yeah, yeah, I'm really excited to share it, you know.

51:10.840 --> 51:12.600
So where do I go right now?

51:12.600 --> 51:15.360
I know I go to Mycroft AI for the project

51:15.360 --> 51:17.840
but if I wanted to jump in with the funding,

51:17.840 --> 51:19.600
where else could I go?

51:19.600 --> 51:20.760
Let me post a link.

51:20.760 --> 51:24.400
It's Indiegogo, you can pre-order on Indiegogo.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.680
They have a nice pre-order system.

51:25.680 --> 51:27.040
I'm gonna post a link in the chat.

51:27.040 --> 51:27.880
Sure.

51:27.880 --> 51:28.720
And if you can post it in the show notes,

51:28.720 --> 51:29.560
that would be awesome.

51:29.560 --> 51:30.880
No problemo.

51:30.880 --> 51:32.220
Yeah, I think this is really neat

51:32.220 --> 51:33.840
and one of the things I like about it is,

51:33.840 --> 51:35.840
I would like to have a hardware device.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.680
I genuinely think that's neat.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.840
But I also love the idea of just turning

51:39.840 --> 51:42.640
all of my Linux desktops into something

51:42.640 --> 51:44.160
that contributes to this thing.

51:44.160 --> 51:45.440
Like if they could all be tied into the same

51:45.440 --> 51:47.080
information sources and I have the same

51:47.080 --> 51:48.800
kind of functionality on my desktop

51:48.800 --> 51:50.040
that I could have and say my kitchen

51:50.040 --> 51:52.680
or the rover would really be pretty unique.

51:52.680 --> 51:56.020
And like VR and other things that are really

51:56.020 --> 51:58.440
kind of developing right now,

51:58.440 --> 52:00.960
I would love to see Linux really have

52:00.960 --> 52:02.120
something here for this.

52:02.120 --> 52:06.040
And what Mycroft to me, in my estimation,

52:06.040 --> 52:07.520
is it's putting us kind of ahead

52:07.520 --> 52:09.500
of the overall competition.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.040
Because the competition can't offer

52:11.040 --> 52:13.720
what Mycroft can offer and it's powered by Linux.

52:13.720 --> 52:16.480
So this is the one to get behind in my opinion.

52:16.480 --> 52:17.680
Yeah, and let me tell you guys

52:17.680 --> 52:19.640
something that's really exciting.

52:19.640 --> 52:24.640
I, we updated, so everything that Mycroft can do

52:25.120 --> 52:26.800
is called a skill.

52:26.800 --> 52:31.520
And we updated our skill framework right before Christmas.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.800
And so on December 24th, we're getting ready

52:34.800 --> 52:36.640
to head up to my parents' house

52:36.640 --> 52:38.960
and I've got the Mycroft code base open

52:38.960 --> 52:41.600
and I said I'm just going to see with the new,

52:41.600 --> 52:44.360
because it looked really simple, the new skill framework.

52:44.360 --> 52:47.600
I'm like, I'm going to see how quickly I can create a skill.

52:47.600 --> 52:50.440
I created a skill in 15 minutes.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.360
And that was with me having not touched the skill,

52:53.360 --> 52:54.640
the new skill framework.

52:54.640 --> 52:57.400
Like I'm granted, I'm somewhat familiar with, you know,

52:57.400 --> 53:00.360
how these things are developed and everything.

53:00.360 --> 53:03.580
But Sean and Jonathan, two of our developers,

53:03.580 --> 53:06.000
had really headed up the new skill framework.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.840
And I just sat down, looked at another skill

53:08.840 --> 53:10.060
that was based on the new framework

53:10.060 --> 53:11.440
and wrote one in 15 minutes.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.280
That's great.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.000
It was a Pokedex.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.720
So if any of you have played Pokemon,

53:15.720 --> 53:17.640
you could say like, what does a Pokedex say

53:17.640 --> 53:19.600
about this Pokemon and it would tell you.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.760
And so it seemed like an easy target.

53:22.760 --> 53:24.920
And so, and I was going up to visit

53:24.920 --> 53:27.920
my little brother-in-law, he's like 13.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.760
And so it was nice to be able to show him that.

53:30.760 --> 53:34.480
But just when I did that, I thought,

53:34.480 --> 53:37.640
holy crap, like that my own,

53:37.640 --> 53:39.960
like our own project surprised me.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.520
Cause I thought if I could do this in 15 minutes,

53:42.520 --> 53:44.560
people can do amazing things.

53:44.560 --> 53:47.160
There's so much out there that can be done.

53:47.160 --> 53:48.840
And that's why we're so excited.

53:48.840 --> 53:50.760
We're trying to get this stuff ready as quickly

53:50.760 --> 53:52.660
as we can to get it out there and get people,

53:52.660 --> 53:54.360
you know, having fun with it.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.880
It's probably worth mentioning too.

53:56.880 --> 53:59.200
If you go to the Indiegogo page,

53:59.200 --> 54:00.400
you can also just get in,

54:00.400 --> 54:02.480
you can just chip in at five bucks or 10 bucks.

54:02.480 --> 54:04.000
You know, you get a sticker, 30 bucks

54:04.000 --> 54:05.680
and you get the dev kit.

54:05.680 --> 54:08.040
You don't have to go all the way in.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.640
If you can't afford to get a hardware device,

54:09.640 --> 54:11.960
but you still think this is a great idea,

54:11.960 --> 54:14.640
there's a $5 and $10 and $35 or $30.

54:14.640 --> 54:16.240
We don't want the open source desktop to be,

54:16.240 --> 54:19.160
you know, left in the wayside with Cortana and Siri.

54:19.160 --> 54:21.560
Yeah, screw Cortana, screw Cortana.

54:21.560 --> 54:22.400
Yeah, really.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.840
Can I share something else that was really awesome?

54:24.840 --> 54:26.320
There's so much, I just need like,

54:26.320 --> 54:29.200
we need a Mycroft action show, but anyway.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.640
We very well might one day.

54:30.640 --> 54:31.600
Yeah, okay.

54:31.600 --> 54:34.900
So the other thing that we got running really well

54:34.900 --> 54:37.400
was up until just last week,

54:37.400 --> 54:38.760
I think of the week before,

54:38.760 --> 54:43.520
we had run Mycroft on a Ubuntu phone emulator.

54:43.520 --> 54:46.360
And so we finally got two Ubuntu phones

54:46.360 --> 54:48.520
and we threw, and we got Mycroft running

54:48.520 --> 54:49.660
on the Ubuntu phones.

54:49.660 --> 54:50.680
Cool, wow.

54:50.680 --> 54:53.940
So I was, but I was getting upset

54:53.940 --> 54:58.440
because I knew it could text

54:58.440 --> 55:01.800
because the other phone was able to text people

55:01.800 --> 55:05.080
by saying, hey, Mycroft, text so-and-so, this is awesome.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.760
You know, text that message to them.

55:06.760 --> 55:07.600
Yeah.

55:07.600 --> 55:08.760
So I was sitting there and I was like,

55:08.760 --> 55:12.060
hey Mycroft, text Aaron, you know, this is awesome.

55:12.060 --> 55:14.460
And then I didn't do anything and I was like,

55:14.460 --> 55:16.040
hey Mycroft, text Aaron, this is awesome.

55:16.040 --> 55:17.360
And so I was getting really pissed.

55:17.360 --> 55:19.240
And so I looked in the logs and it's like,

55:19.240 --> 55:21.880
you haven't put any contacts in the phone.

55:21.880 --> 55:25.040
I don't have anybody named Aaron to send a message to.

55:25.040 --> 55:29.140
And so, but it was, it's just so awesome

55:29.140 --> 55:33.640
that the tech is, it's so awesome using Ubuntu

55:33.640 --> 55:37.280
with like, whether it be on the desktop or on the phone,

55:37.280 --> 55:40.520
with a personal assistant.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.440
I mean, it's just.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.560
Yeah, absolutely.

55:42.560 --> 55:46.200
It's just, I think that a lot of people

55:46.200 --> 55:48.880
are going to appreciate having that option

55:48.880 --> 55:52.900
on the Linux desktop and also having the ability

55:52.900 --> 55:56.080
to add things that are specific to you.

55:56.080 --> 55:58.080
Right, and if it got really crazy big one day,

55:58.080 --> 55:59.840
so you know, somebody could make an Android app,

55:59.840 --> 56:01.560
somebody could, you know, I mean,

56:01.560 --> 56:02.960
it could be on all the platforms.

56:02.960 --> 56:06.000
Yeah, Aaron's writing an in-map skill.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.600
Nice, there you go.

56:08.600 --> 56:12.920
So I think Northranger sort of summarizes it a lot.

56:12.920 --> 56:15.920
And it really, for me, Northranger, I don't know about you,

56:15.920 --> 56:17.720
but it comes down to the fact that

56:17.720 --> 56:20.820
Mycroft doesn't have sort of an overall

56:20.820 --> 56:23.720
multinational corporate strategy tax,

56:23.720 --> 56:27.200
where Cortana has the tax of whatever Microsoft

56:27.200 --> 56:31.520
intends to do with their Bing and Azure

56:31.520 --> 56:34.120
and the entire Microsoft Windows ecosystem.

56:34.120 --> 56:36.520
And Google obviously wants to keep using Google search.

56:36.520 --> 56:39.000
They want to be able to mine your data for advertising.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.680
Siri locks you into the Apple platform.

56:41.680 --> 56:43.400
Mycroft doesn't have that baggage.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.200
And I don't know about you, Northranger,

56:45.200 --> 56:47.160
but I think that's maybe its most attractive feature.

56:47.160 --> 56:48.800
What do you think?

56:48.800 --> 56:50.720
I totally agree.

56:50.720 --> 56:53.240
Having something that both individuals

56:53.240 --> 56:55.960
who'd want to add their own skills, you know,

56:55.960 --> 56:59.160
and it's attractive, Mycroft is an attractive system

56:59.160 --> 57:01.920
for that, and you know, if it takes off,

57:01.920 --> 57:05.320
I'd love to see, you know, outside companies,

57:05.320 --> 57:08.000
you know, publishing their own Mycroft skills,

57:08.000 --> 57:11.280
you know, and not have to feel like they're giving away

57:11.280 --> 57:15.560
their secret sauce to Google or Amazon or whoever.

57:15.560 --> 57:16.800
Yeah, exactly.

57:16.800 --> 57:20.160
Em Hall wants help, Ryan, installing it at scale.

57:20.160 --> 57:22.040
So you're gonna be doing a little tech support

57:22.040 --> 57:23.960
while you're down at scale with Mr. Hall.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.160
That sounds good.

57:25.160 --> 57:29.840
Yeah, so anyway, keep your eyes peeled

57:29.840 --> 57:32.000
for Adapt getting released tomorrow.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.280
If you are not already following us on Twitter,

57:35.280 --> 57:37.920
it's at Mycroft underscore AI.

57:37.920 --> 57:41.280
And if you're on Google+, it's plus Mycroft A dot I.

57:41.280 --> 57:42.120
Yeah.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.480
And you can find us.

57:43.480 --> 57:44.840
If you search, you can find us,

57:44.840 --> 57:46.040
and maybe we can get into the show notes.

57:46.040 --> 57:47.360
Yep, yep, I'll have it linked.

57:47.360 --> 57:48.880
I'll have that linked up in the show notes for you

57:48.880 --> 57:50.080
because I think it's worth checking out.

57:50.080 --> 57:51.880
And you know, Ryan, I really appreciate you

57:51.880 --> 57:53.720
coming on the show and sharing this with us.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.040
It is extremely fascinating to follow this

57:56.040 --> 57:57.760
as you're working on it, so it really means a lot

57:57.760 --> 58:00.360
to come in and chat about it with us.

58:00.360 --> 58:02.560
I love coming in, chatting about this stuff.

58:02.560 --> 58:03.400
Well, thank you, sir.

58:03.400 --> 58:04.240
So thanks.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.160
Stick around if you want to,

58:05.160 --> 58:06.920
because after I go through and own up

58:06.920 --> 58:09.520
to my 2015 predictions later on in the show,

58:09.520 --> 58:11.440
I'm gonna open up the floor to some predictions,

58:11.440 --> 58:13.280
and I'd like to hear some of yours.

58:13.280 --> 58:14.920
So stick around if you can.

58:14.920 --> 58:18.080
And before we get into the rest of the show,

58:18.080 --> 58:20.280
I'm gonna take a moment and thank Linux Academy,

58:20.280 --> 58:23.800
sponsors of the Unplugged show now, for a long time.

58:23.800 --> 58:27.000
And I think that's because this is an obvious fit.

58:27.000 --> 58:27.840
Right?

58:27.840 --> 58:29.800
It's kind of a no-brainer, actually.

58:29.800 --> 58:32.320
This is a resource created for Linux users,

58:32.320 --> 58:34.980
by Linux users, who give a shit about open source.

58:34.980 --> 58:37.200
And if that sounds like somebody that

58:37.200 --> 58:40.100
sort of is in line with the things that you care about,

58:40.100 --> 58:41.680
that might be why it's such a great fit.

58:41.680 --> 58:43.320
Maybe that just has something to do with it.

58:43.320 --> 58:45.000
I don't quite know.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.280
But go over to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged

58:47.280 --> 58:48.680
and take advantage of our discount,

58:48.680 --> 58:50.560
and go check out the Linux Academy.

58:50.560 --> 58:52.280
They really, I mean, I joke.

58:52.280 --> 58:54.760
I'm having fun with you here, but let's be serious.

58:54.760 --> 58:57.800
This Linux enthusiast got together with educators

58:57.800 --> 59:00.160
and developers, and they made the Linux Academy platform

59:00.160 --> 59:01.760
for people who know what Linux is,

59:01.760 --> 59:04.040
know what all of the different stuff in the stack is

59:04.040 --> 59:05.680
that you need to learn, and they know they needed

59:05.680 --> 59:06.620
a good place to go to learn it

59:06.620 --> 59:08.000
from people who actually care.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.760
So they've got over 2,000 video courses you can take,

59:10.760 --> 59:12.440
with instructor help when you need it,

59:12.440 --> 59:14.400
downloadable comprehensive study guides,

59:14.400 --> 59:16.640
seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from.

59:16.640 --> 59:19.000
It automatically adjusts the courseware

59:19.000 --> 59:21.400
and the virtual machines that you can SSH into

59:21.400 --> 59:24.920
from your favorite SSH client and do it like a boost,

59:24.920 --> 59:28.280
which is nice, right in with your existing workflow.

59:28.280 --> 59:30.360
They have the entire AWS stack.

59:30.360 --> 59:32.800
If you want to get into the Red Hat certified courseware,

59:32.800 --> 59:33.740
they've got that.

59:33.740 --> 59:36.040
If you want to learn the Ubuntu LAMP stack,

59:36.040 --> 59:37.020
they've got that.

59:37.020 --> 59:39.760
If you want to go into NGINX or Python or Ruby,

59:39.760 --> 59:41.560
if you want to go into Android development,

59:41.560 --> 59:43.120
if you want to go into virtualization

59:43.120 --> 59:46.040
and containerization, they have all of it.

59:46.040 --> 59:48.160
This is something that they've been really good at

59:48.160 --> 59:49.480
is they watch what's going on

59:49.480 --> 59:51.640
because they're into it just like we are,

59:51.640 --> 59:53.080
and then they pull the trigger on the stuff

59:53.080 --> 59:55.360
they know that's really gonna be the long-term stuff

59:55.360 --> 59:58.420
that's gonna add value to your life to learn.

59:58.420 --> 59:59.720
They have scenario-based labs

59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.420
so you get real hands-on experience.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.880
So you're actually working with the stuff

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.080
so when you go to do it in person,

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.320
it's not the first time you've ever done it.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.120
When you're actually doing it, getting paid for it,

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.800
gives you that kind of confidence in their lab servers.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.240
And then they have that instructor help.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.160
That to me, that to me seems like the big differentiator.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.640
Because these topics are not like learning After Effects

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.120
where there's tens and thousands of After Effects guys

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.880
out there that they could go contract.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.400
It's not tightening the bolts on your sink

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.240
that there's tons and tons and tons of ways

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.040
to get instructions and help on that

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.000
with experts that can help you.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.840
It is working with a Red Hat server.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:41.380
It's setting up AWS and working with S3.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.960
These are a little more esoteric,

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.080
more complicated types of questions,

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.760
and they have instructor help when you need it.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.640
They have graded server exercises.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.720
You log into a lab, you perform a specific task,

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.680
and then they'll automatically grade your actions

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.800
so you can see how well you did.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.440
This is really nice.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.280
Talk about the kind of experience you get

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.200
from something like that.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.960
And remember, it's choosing from the distro

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.480
that you've selected.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:04.320
That's pretty cool too.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.960
And imagine the amount of work they have to do

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.160
to make that work.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.200
That's the thing.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.640
That's the thing that we thought about doing

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.740
for How To Linux and we're like,

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.280
whoo, we don't have a staff of a bajillion.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.160
We could never do it.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.120
You have to pick one.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.080
Go check them out.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.280
They just recently revamped

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.440
their backend distribution infrastructure.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.340
Whole new CDN, HTML5 players throughout

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.400
so it works on all your good devices.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.000
It really is a great resource.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:27.840
You can support the show

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.080
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.080
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.360
Thank you.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.640
The unplugged program.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.760
Okay, Wes, so every year this guy comes along now

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.160
with his big old list of crap that don't work

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.280
on the Linux desktop,

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.240
and this is the major Linux problems for 2016 edition.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.700
And this is as put a regularly updated article

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.000
of all of the things that are wrong

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.360
with Linux distributions.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.720
Now, Wes, did you get a chance by any chance

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.440
to go through this long list of items?

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.880
And did you get a sense of this person's intent

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:04.660
when you went through this list?

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.920
Yes, I think the intent is good.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.320
I think it's a helpful catalog.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.240
I think there are some items

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.560
where it reads more emotionally

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.460
or more heat of the moment than it could.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:19.080
I think there are some items that are either dated

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.660
or I think a lot of it also draws attention

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:23.760
to this fails in some cases.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.240
And it's important that we note that, right?

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.360
Because any failure is important,

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.380
but it also kind of I think highlights some things

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.200
where it's like, well, you may have that problem,

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.560
but 90% of people do not.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.240
I think what it really lacks is a real sense

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.080
of any statistics and the larger context.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.000
Do you have a sense if this person is experienced

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.800
with Linux or with other operating systems?

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.840
Do you have a sense if they have a good technical capability?

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.480
Yes, I would say it sounds like someone

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.640
who's been in the trenches using a Linux desktop

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.000
for a long time and continues to do so.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.720
I know a lot of people who have jumped that ship,

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.520
now they're on the Mac, now they use Windows

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.600
because they have games.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.080
This person sounds like someone who's put up with a lot

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.080
and who's run the full gamut of working or not.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.860
He says here, I want to make one thing crystal clear,

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.120
Windows in some regards is even worse than Linux

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120
and it's definitely not ready for the desktop either.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.120
Right, and I think a lot of these too are

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.760
how you define that ready for the desktop

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.860
because there's some of these where it's like,

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.680
well, if ready for the desktop is you need it

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.120
to work reliably, 100% production machine

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.480
with this specific equipment, maybe it won't.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.000
Is it ready for your grandmother's computer

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.920
to browse the web and write up a word,

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.600
you know, or maybe it is.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.160
Right, and those are two different interpretations

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.000
of the desktop.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:34.820
So here's where he starts.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.040
Open source Nvidia driver is much slower,

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.480
up to five times than its proprietary counterpart

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:42.000
due to improperly working power management

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.600
and the AMD and Intel graphic drivers

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:46.160
can significantly be slower than the proprietary

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.000
counterparts.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.920
This is a huge issue, he says.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.720
And I think this is a prime example

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.320
of what you were just saying.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.720
Those of us that would be using, in my estimation,

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.400
the open source Nvidia driver could give really

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.920
no crap about the performance.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.040
We just really want to be able to hook up a projector

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.640
or hook up an external monitor, hook up our TV

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.460
or just run our single monitor

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.920
and as long as the windows render properly

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.920
and if there is some sort of desktop effect,

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.900
it is within appropriate response time,

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.920
they're happy, that's the baseline,

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.760
all they need from the open source driver.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.740
Those of us who want every bit of performance

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:22.000
out of our GPU we can, we're already compelled

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.600
to run the proprietary driver for other reasons.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.360
So this right off the surface is,

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.160
it's not taking into context this complaint.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.640
And I would also, I could take a moment

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.760
and mention that the graphic situation

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.640
is not necessarily much better on the Mac.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:40.640
The Mac has horrible GPU drivers.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.120
So.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.380
And in some cases the open source,

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:45.540
like I know the open source AMD graphics,

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.800
while they may not be great currently for 3D,

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.840
the 2D stuff is great,

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.660
they support multiple monitors flawlessly.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.160
So I think his first complaint sort of puts it

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.200
in the context of what you're saying

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.960
with the overall issue we take with the article

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.880
is it sort of, it blurs the lines

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.460
between different use cases and it just tries to take,

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.040
Linux is a very flexible operating system

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.200
that can work on a lot of different scenarios

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.760
and some scenarios have different requirements.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.880
Right, some of those requirements are directly at odds.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.000
If it works well in one scenario, maybe it can't.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:11.840
Yeah.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.200
All right, so Mumble Room, as we go through these,

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.480
feel free to chime in as you like.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.600
That was our first one.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.320
But here's some other ones in here that,

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.200
you know what, they ring a little true.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.400
Let's talk about the audio subsystem.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.980
Let's start with my favorite one

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.400
because it affects the Mumble Room.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:29.160
No reliable echo cancellation.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.160
If you use a normal microphone and speakers,

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.520
in many cases you won't be able to use Skype

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.400
and VoIP services normally.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.400
Windows, Android, and Mac OS all implemented

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.360
voice cancel echo cancellation on a system level.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:43.920
There's a solution for pulse audio

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.320
and hopefully be enabled by default in the future.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.560
This is legitimately something that is kind of

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.560
a pain in the ass on Linux.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.880
Are you familiar with that solution?

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.800
I am not.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:53.640
I am not.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.560
The solution is don't use speakers, use headphones.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.920
That's the solution.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.120
Because even voice cancellation, echo cancellation

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.080
isn't that great on the other platforms either.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.880
Just don't use Hangouts or Mumble

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.360
with a microphone and open speakers.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.600
Use a headset or something like that.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.480
Which is what many professional broadcasters

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.520
would be doing anyway.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:13.360
Yeah.

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.720
All right, no reliable sound system.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.640
No reliable unified audio mixing implemented

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.240
in all modern OSes except for Linux.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.200
Many old and or proprietary applications

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.520
still open audio output exclusively,

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.640
causing major user problems and headache.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.200
Too many layers of abstraction lead to situations

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.480
where the user cannot determine why audio input output

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.320
doesn't work.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.560
Also kernel drivers, also library connected to DMX

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.320
connected to the pulse audio server,

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.840
then the also library, then the pulse backend,

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.080
then the application.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.120
That's six layers of redirection.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:45.440
And then you add the seventh layer in the case of KDE

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.680
because they have phonon.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.000
That seventh layer really is killer sometimes too.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:51.840
Yeah.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.680
It really is.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.520
That seventh.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.840
Six seems to work.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.000
It's like a dip, man.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.080
The seventh layer dip, nothing bothers my gut

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.200
except for the cheese on the top.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.200
It's that seventh layer that actually bothers my gut.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.600
Dammit.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.640
You know, it's funny because as somebody

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.800
who is sitting in front of two Linux computers right now

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.680
doing an audio podcast,

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.000
I'm not really having a lot of audio issues

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.240
with these machines.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.320
It really is only under KDE that I ever have problems.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:21.320
Otherwise I really like pulse audio actually.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.640
Yeah, I used it to as like an RTP source

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.920
to play to some other speakers.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:25.760
Yeah.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.520
And it was two clicks of the config

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.440
and it just was playing.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.200
So as an end user,

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.200
if you remove Plasma Desktop from the equation,

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:34.520
I actually don't feel like these are legitimate complaints

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.120
because they're not,

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.920
they don't really impact the end user.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.960
And there are definitely people

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.800
who have weird pulse situations,

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.880
especially on older districts.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.400
Yeah, Mumble Room, feel free to disagree.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.000
But in my estimation,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.120
this is kind of a non-issue for the average user.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.720
Unless you got three or four sound cards.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.560
Or you need it to not be mixed at the end.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:53.320
You know, you need direct output to the card.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.600
Then you might have to do some work around.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.440
Yeah.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:56.280
But for people who just want to listen

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.800
to their YouTube video

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.920
and have it play at the same time as another sound.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.760
Yeah.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.600
Works great.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.420
We got no disagreement from the lug.

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:03.260
So we move on.

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.880
I would say a unified control panel

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.640
for all distros of letters would be better.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.480
Yeah, proof of control.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.300
Because.

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.140
Proof of control.

01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:15.600
Because like there's sometimes when we have issues

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.800
staging people and sometimes, you know,

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.080
they don't know their own control panel

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.720
and you're on a different distro

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.960
and then you have to try to find some example.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.800
Yeah, that is.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.480
And it really doesn't help.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.960
Yeah, that is a good point.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.800
That is a good point.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.760
That is kind of a.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.320
Even here on my little Mint laptop

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.440
they have a native sound settings.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.280
You know.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.100
Yeah.

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:36.940
Cinnamon.

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:37.780
Yeah.

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.600
Which is different than.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.440
Yep.

01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.260
I like Pava control more.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.100
Yep.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:41.940
So that's what I use but.

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:42.760
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.600
That is well received.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.420
Okay, so.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:45.940
And I don't really have a response to it

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:50.320
other than it makes remote support scenarios

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.240
a little more difficult.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.800
Right.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.760
This was a point that he made it

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.640
almost five times in the article over and over again.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.080
And I'm really curious to see what the mumble room

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.040
says about this one.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:06.080
As he puts it, an insane number of regressions

01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.680
in the Linux kernel when with every new Linux kernel release

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.460
hardware can stop working inexplicitly.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:17.260
Incomplete drivers, playback regressions on audio,

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:18.960
all kinds of problems.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.360
He points, he pounds this issue

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.040
throughout the entire article.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.760
Kernel regressions all the time.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.680
Kernel regressions all the time.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.280
Insane amounts of bugs introduced

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.700
with every kernel version.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.440
It really happens.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.280
No, that happens all the time for me.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.120
All the time.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:38.940
Really, okay.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:42.500
In what use case scenario are you experiencing

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:43.480
regressions all the time?

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.300
Tell me.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.980
Typically the AMD open source driver

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:48.220
because it seems like they rewrite significant parts of it

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:50.560
every single major release.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.680
But that's not really the Linux kernel, right?

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.960
That's the driver.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.720
But it's shipped with the kernel, right?

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:57.760
It's the open source driver that ships with the kernel.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.880
It's a module that ships with it.

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.100
So are most of the other devices

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.120
that he could talk about here.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:01.960
Okay, all right.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.440
I think he's, by reading this entire article,

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.020
I grok he's kind of talking about audio devices.

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.640
I almost get the sense that he's an audio engineer

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.680
that works with some Linux systems by reading this article

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:13.720
because he gets into the specifics about the bit rates

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.720
on Linux audio and stuff that I do kind of agree with.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.960
It seems like you would only know of

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.320
unless you professionally work with it.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.520
And so I could see sound devices breaking on him.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.780
I guess I was just surprised

01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.560
because I pretty much, I am running current Linux kernels

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.540
on four out of six machines I use regularly.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.600
And it also seems like another one where,

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:33.800
at least the one you were just reading there,

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.280
like if you follow the link,

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.240
it's a DataMation article

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:39.640
that has some other people talking about a few.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.480
Yeah, the source is weak.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.120
Hand-picked quotes from some kernel developers.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.560
And it doesn't even talk about regressions

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.280
for like the majority of that article.

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:47.160
So I'm willing to believe that there are regressions,

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:48.680
but to say that so strongly

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.200
and then not have any sort of like,

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.160
what are the numbers?

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:52.680
How many companies are affected by it?

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.160
And here's where I think this blog post

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.800
goes way down into the weeds

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.120
because if you just back up for a second,

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.760
you realize that's why there's things like Ubuntu 14.04

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.220
that Mint 17.3 that you are running your laptop on

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.860
right now is based on.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:08.880
It is not experiencing these regressions

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.480
because this is being managed at the distribution level.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.820
And if you're in the enterprise

01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:14.200
where these things really matter,

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.080
you're likely running Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.960
Ubuntu LTS, or CentOS.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.360
You also couldn't afford to have QA teams

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.200
that can review these things.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.080
True, but even if you didn't have a single tester

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.240
before you just randomly installed a kernel update

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.440
on a production machine,

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.400
if you're running it in a business scenario,

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.360
in most cases, you're using an LTS-style release.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.720
Hell, there's even Arch machines have,

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:39.620
you can have an LTS kernel on an Arch machine.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.400
So this, it feels like a false argument

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.780
because if the scenario in which you are so dependent

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:48.400
on the kernel support of your hardware,

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.760
that scenario is not one in which you would be

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.160
also installing every single kernel update that comes up.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.080
The two just things are completely incongruent.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.760
It doesn't match up.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.580
No, I don't think so.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.160
I think you should be able to expect Upstream

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.400
does a decent job testing the software they write.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:02.800
You shouldn't have to rely on a distribution

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.760
to test all your software.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.200
You shouldn't rely on Red Hat to test that the kernel works.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.040
I agree.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.280
Because I've had a lot of esoteric hardware

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:12.240
where it just does not work correctly with a major update.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.920
And I mean, even on point releases, they break things

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.560
like the ButterFS bug that they introduced

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.140
in like 3.19.1 or something that wasn't even in 3.19.0.

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.940
Yeah, but my point is that these things do happen.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:24.960
It is a reality.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.300
And anybody that is administering these systems

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:29.520
is aware of the reality because these are people

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.320
that their jobs are on the line for managing these systems.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.520
And so they have to work in the reality

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.480
of the context of the situation.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.760
So they're not deploying these kernel updates

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.520
on these massively critical machines.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:43.560
It's just not something that's commonly done.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560
It's not a shortcoming, right?

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.120
It sucks when you're going to test these things

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.220
and you have to weed through all these weird issues

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.060
in your lab. I agree.

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.400
I agree. It sucks.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.740
It's one of the main points of his articles

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.920
as the drawback to Linux.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:56.600
I don't think it's a drawback because the fundamental way

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.280
that Linux is deployed and distributed

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.880
is essentially built to mitigate these potential issues.

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.920
No, I don't think it's a drawback,

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.600
but I think it's something that needs to be worked on

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:07.040
because I don't think they do enough regression testing.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.360
And I think it can be a lot better.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.800
Yeah, I know.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.720
I agree there too.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.360
But the thing is, that is...

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.200
Well, I mean...

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.040
I guess that's what I was saying

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.920
is that there's a lot of nuance there

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.520
that is covered in that point.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.960
Well, maybe instead of funding a blockchain replacement,

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.960
they should be funding more kernel testing

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.480
over at the Linux Foundation.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:27.520
And there's the Hacker News article,

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.640
our discussion, which maybe we should link to.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.880
They have some good discussions

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.320
about what current test frameworks are used by the kernel

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:35.240
and what they do.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.120
Anything to jump out at you?

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.960
I just remember seeing a lot of the...

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.040
Because that Hacker News thread

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.120
seemed overly hostile to me.

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.520
There are some hostile sentiments in there for sure.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.840
There's some nice ones too, but yeah,

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.040
it was just like a whole bunch of people

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.400
like, yeah, that's why I switched to the Mac.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.640
And I was like, I don't want to read that.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.760
Just, it's getting disappointing.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.600
And you know what?

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.660
They're all gonna come back.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.200
They're all, they'll all be back.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.040
The Mac is...

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:56.860
They switch to the Mac,

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.960
but they find they have the same regressions, right?

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.380
Like I think I updated to a minor point release

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:01.640
on Yosemite or something,

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.400
and my Wi-Fi driver broke pretty horribly.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:05.240
This Mac, this...

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.520
And this is their hardware.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.160
This expensive Mac Pro,

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.640
that is not the trashcan model,

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.960
but it was the last one they released before the trashcan.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:15.800
Right.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.640
It's actually a decent desktop.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.480
Big metal.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.300
Kind of sexy.

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:19.720
The one that actually has PCI Express slots

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.920
that you can use and stuff and drive slides.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.760
It's kernel panic before the last two Linux unplugs.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.000
Maybe it's when I come over.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.760
Alls I'm saying is,

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.760
anybody who actually uses Mac OS X

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:36.440
under production load,

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.360
where your CPUs are running at higher than 70%

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.400
for more than say 90% of the machine's day,

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.200
anybody who uses a Mac under those conditions

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.160
knows that it is one of the weakest

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.560
operating systems out there.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.200
It eats itself constantly.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.660
It has one of the worst file systems

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.840
in the history of desktop computing.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.600
And on top of all of that,

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.040
the expensive hardware has such a premium around it

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.400
that all of the accessory manufacturers

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.080
also get to add a premium

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.120
to hook crap up to these expensive machines.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.120
It is infuriating.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.880
The Mac platform,

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.420
this is what gets me about this hacker news thread,

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.800
and we should link to it now that I'm ranting about this.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.040
You can go read it and see why I'm ranting about this.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:22.960
The arrogance of these people,

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.600
the supposed superiority of their operating system,

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.920
it makes me laugh because it is all about

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.280
what the different work cases

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.360
and how there's just simply some tools

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.520
that work for some people better

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.120
and other tools that work for other people better.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.680
And that's really what it comes down to.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.240
And when you read this guy's article,

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.160
every single one of these issues that we highlighted here

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.360
is a use case that is edge.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.080
And there are legitimate ones like Xorg allows applications

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.320
to exclusively grab keyboard and mouse input.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.760
If such applications misbehave,

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.520
you're left with a system you cannot manage.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.460
A lot of us have experienced this at some point or another.

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.680
But again, it is an edge use case.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.160
And so when I read these things, I read these rants,

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.080
I just, I walk away from something that doesn't feel

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.960
productive, it feels more,

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.880
it feels more nitpicky for nitpick's sake.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.140
What I would like to see from this article in 2017

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:21.980
is a refinement of what we argue about.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:26.080
Because there are issues in here that, in my case,

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.240
are worth highlighting.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.120
Like I've run into this one.

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:31.600
In most cases, kernel crashes are invisible

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.340
if you're running an X session.

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:36.200
Moreover, KMS prevents the kernel from switching

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.880
to plain 640 by 480 or 80 by 25 text in VGA mode

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.160
to give you an error message.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.280
Because KMS is all locked up.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.880
Very incomplete hardware support for sensors, too.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.520
Yeah, I've seen that.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.000
You know, you might have a machine on a modern laptop

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.800
that has 50 sensors.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.400
And HWinfo is only detecting maybe 20 of them,

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.840
maybe 12 of them.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.560
It's a weak point of Linux.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.500
Power management.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.600
This isn't in his article, but Feronix took a look

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.320
at power management for Linux.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.760
For 2014 versus 2015.

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.160
And we are worse at power management at the end of 2015

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.960
than we were at the end of 2014.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.440
We use more battery power.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.000
So there are obvious areas.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.160
But what he ends up doing is nitpicking in a way

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:23.080
that feels unproductive and also so esoteric and specific

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.720
that it doesn't feel like there's any action

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:25.960
that we can take on these.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:29.920
And I think part of it, too, is where it lacks context.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.800
Like with the regressions.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:34.040
Like, regressions are bad, but how do the rates

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.840
of the Linux kernel versus other kernels

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.000
that are updated as much, that make as much project,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
that support as much new hardware as that does.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.880
Sure, that's a great question.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.120
Yeah, yeah, and almost in all of these,

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.120
through this whole thing, I have to resist the urge to say,

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.880
well, but Windows does it this way.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.200
Well, but the Mac does it this way.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.960
Because there's nothing perfect out there.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.800
Not at all.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.080
And I think we could all agree that no desktop is perfect.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.720
And basically, whatever desktop you spend the most time on

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:00.920
sucks.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.920
And I think this just needs a little bit more context

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.520
so that we, like, a lot of those are completely legitimate

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.080
points that should be fixed.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.280
But we have limited work, you know, hours.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.120
And so I think that maybe this article needs a little bit

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:14.680
context of which are the most important,

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.560
which one of these should we really be pushing towards

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.400
in the next year.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.800
That would be more helpful.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:24.800
And also, it also needs to not be so contradictory

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
at the top of the article he bangs on about

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
not bringing Android into the equation.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:31.840
Right.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.600
Then winds on about how Android UI becomes unresponsive

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:39.840
if you do certain IO intensive operations.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.680
Good point.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.920
It's like, okay, well, you can't say,

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.080
you can't talk about Android as a plus point

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.600
and then draw on it as, by the way, Android.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.600
Yeah, that's nuts.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.880
There's another interesting one in here.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.840
I quite like this one, which I agree with.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.520
Xorg is largely outdated, unsuitable,

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.840
and even terribly insecure for modern PCs and applications.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.320
And you could change one word in that sentence.

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.960
Windows is largely outdated, unsuitable,

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.280
and even terribly insecure for modern PCs and applications.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.120
That's true.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.000
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:20.880
Yeah, you could also say the same about-

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.400
That's comparing the display server

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.200
with fundamentals of the operating system design.

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.320
You could also say that about Mac OS X.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.880
Somebody just ran the numbers, right?

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.200
And in 2015, the Mac OS X had the most vulnerabilities

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.080
out of any desktop operating system.

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.200
Now, sure, some of that was open source packages.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.400
Some of it wasn't.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.760
But you can pick and choose this data any way you want.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.640
You could then say the Mac OS

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.640
was the most insecure operating system of 2015.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.940
It'd be kind of be a bullshit statement,

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.080
but you could say that based on the data.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.800
You could say Xorg's architecture is inherently insecure.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.640
You could also claim that Windows architecture

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.640
is inherently insecure.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.200
Yeah, that's a great point, Wimpy.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.120
Did anybody else in the Mamba Room

01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.840
have any points they wanted to make from this article

01:19:58.840 --> 01:19:59.720
before we wrap up?

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.280
And we'll have the full thing linked in the show notes

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.200
if you guys at home want to read it.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.240
Can we not do this one next year?

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:06.320
Maybe not, you know?

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.840
I kind of like, the thing I like doing is,

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.440
the reason why I like covering it

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.180
is this article manages to get quite a bit of traction

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:17.160
online and every year it's gotten more and it's less-

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.280
Don't you think that's his agenda though?

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.280
Don't you think he just loves trolling the Linux community?

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:26.240
I mean, some of the hyperlinks in this article

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.040
are links to bugs that he's raised on the LKML

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:34.600
and have been closed and then he reopens every year

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.960
and he's beginning to wind up people with every year

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.080
these things being reopened.

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.880
So some of his citations are his own bullshit bugs.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.200
See, this is the inevitable problem,

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.080
is as this gets more attention,

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.160
it almost feels like we are ignoring it

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:52.440
if we don't respond to it because essentially,

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.240
the way it is written and structured,

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:56.780
that almost just gives it credibility

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.800
right there unfortunately.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.320
Like when you read something like this online

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.440
and then you see something that's sourced like this,

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.400
you don't even start clicking links,

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.760
you go, oh, this guy's really sourced his stuff,

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.720
he really knows what he's talking about.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.200
And so it generates a 100-common deep hacker news thread

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.960
that's an entire attack on Linux, right?

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.800
And it gets linked all over the hell over Twitter

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.560
and Reddit and Facebook and it starts generating this buzz

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.720
of this is why it's still not the year of the desktop Linux

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.240
and then that's the headline that runs it.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.720
It's not the year of the desktop Linux,

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.840
it's got all of these issues and I just feel like...

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:27.560
And it really hits that crowd of people too

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.520
who use Linux on the server,

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.360
but just don't think that they can use it on the desktop.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.080
And I feel like that rubs at least me

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.000
and some people in our community just like...

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.240
So I kind of feel like it is sort of our duty

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.880
to sort of respond to it and say, no, no,

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.560
this guy's blowing some of these things out of proportion,

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.800
he's citing himself as Wimpy just pointed out,

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.040
he's citing datamation articles

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.840
that kind of refer to regressions in the Linux kernel

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.920
and some of these are extremely niche use cases

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.200
that don't affect regular day-to-day users,

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.960
which he's supposedly writing this for.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.240
So I think that's worth mentioning.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:03.000
I don't want to give it necessarily any more credibility

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.840
than it deserves though.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:06.920
So I don't, like we didn't cover it in last as news,

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:10.000
for example, you know, just as we almost did

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.120
and I thought, eh, we had a discussion behind the scenes

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.240
about running it as news in the Linux action show

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.960
and we decided that this is more of something

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.680
we feel like as a community we should respond to

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.600
in Unplugged and so we moved it down to the Unplugged show

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.240
in the sense of, not to demote the status of it,

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.200
but just to recognize what it really is.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.120
Right.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.120
It's really kind of a conversation piece.

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:36.760
I actually feel like it's a more honest Linux sucks.

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.300
Blaster Sissy feels like it's a less honest,

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.760
I feel like it's a more because it is at least,

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:44.240
it is appropriately updated and it is also cited,

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.400
which is really nice.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.840
Yeah, there's a difference.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.460
The siting often is himself or the animation articles,

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.120
but the siting is done.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.760
So it seems like it's sort of, it's a different spin

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.800
on that sort of this is what's wrong

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.120
and that's what plays well on the internet.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.100
Right.

01:22:59.100 --> 01:22:59.940
And I think.

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:03.180
I think it's at all ironic that that website

01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.980
is running on Linux.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.840
Well, the guy obviously uses Linux, right?

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.720
I mean, you read the article,

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.080
the guy obviously is a Linux user, that's the thing.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.400
And so these continue to generate discussion

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.360
and he managed this year and last year

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.080
to get a hell of a lot of traffic to discuss it.

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.320
So yeah, I find it to be fascinating.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.260
I find it to be fascinating because it is like,

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:28.360
geeks can argue about this kind of thing forever.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.480
The edge cases are, I guess, where all of the discussion is.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.200
And it's a lot of work, but you find these articles,

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.280
it really gets your blood boiling

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.660
and you know you're engaged and it's like,

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.680
you have to put in some thought,

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.700
like why is that so wrong?

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.420
Well, like the stuff, like I think his PowerPoint,

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:45.420
or his PowerPoint, I think his PowerPoints were really,

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.080
where he goes into Xorg.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:48.920
Right.

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:49.760
That is kind of Xorg.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.920
We all acknowledge that.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.200
Yeah, and then at the same time we all know

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:56.220
we've got our solutions in the works too, so.

01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.780
And he harps on Flash.

01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.620
Right.

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.020
It is kind of getting tiring, actually,

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:01.120
now that I think about it.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.720
It is, the whole thing is just getting kind of old.

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:06.360
And it's getting less and less relevant

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.080
as the strategy tax of the big platforms

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.160
becomes more and more apparent on the Mac and Windows.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.000
Right.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.640
So yeah, maybe next year we don't cover it.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.480
I don't know.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:16.300
Let's hope we don't even have to.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.000
Yeah, it does feel like it's sort of,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.640
it does feel like it's something of a bygone era.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.880
I'll tell you what's not of a bygone era,

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.120
that's our friends over at DigitalOcean.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:27.320
Head over to DigitalOcean.com

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.480
and get yourself a Linux rig up on their awesome servers,

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:31.840
all running KVM, sitting on top of Linux boxes

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:35.400
with SSD drives, 40 gigabit E connectors,

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.260
and guess what, a $10 promo code

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:40.480
when you use DO Unplugged, one word, lowercase.

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.680
One word, lowercase, that'll get you hooked up

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.160
over at DigitalOcean for two months

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:45.400
to try out their $5 rig.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.960
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.320
And at $5 a month, you get 512 megabytes of RAM,

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.480
a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.320
Did you see my old terabyte dance I just did there?

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.680
That was a beautiful dance.

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.280
That's my terabyte transfer dance.

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.120
That's a big deal.

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.920
Do the terabyte transfer.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.760
There you go, I just did it again.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.440
You get a terabyte of transfer with a $5 rig,

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:07.600
it just, I just don't even.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:08.440
That's insane.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:10.440
That's great, I just, as somebody who used to have

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.840
to do coload servers, I just, that really blows my mind.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.600
And they got data center locations in New York,

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.760
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London,

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:20.160
Germany, and Toronto, so you can go have your server

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.960
chill with Alan Jude.

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.800
Hey hey.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.120
Yeah, Netflix and chill with Alan Jude.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.080
That's what I hear you do up in Toronto.

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:29.440
They have a great interface, it's very simple and intuitive.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:31.320
And that's kind of my nice way of saying it's better

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.680
than any other virtualization management platform.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:36.220
Way, way better than anything VMware could ever dream of,

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.640
which is pathetic.

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:39.840
It is really good.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.640
It's better than any other service provider out there.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:44.240
And then to just sort of put a little sprinkling

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.040
on top of that tasty muffin.

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.760
You know, because muffins with sprinkles are better.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:48.840
Ooh, they are.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.160
Just ask my five-year-old.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.880
They gave you a great API.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.160
Really straightforward.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.720
They've just recently updated it, well not,

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:59.080
they updated it last year now, because this is 2016.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.780
That allows you to replicate the functionality

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.160
of the control panel on a larger scale.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.180
And so there's a bunch of really nice open source code

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.480
written around that API to manage droplets.

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.320
It's nice.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.280
They got an HTML5 dashboard, so you can see it

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.680
from boot all the way up to login.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.500
It's a great system.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:14.520
Digitalocean.com.

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.400
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG, get $10 credit.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.760
Also, go check out their documentation

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.000
and their one-click deployment.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.880
You got Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS, FreeBizzle.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.720
Is that what I see?

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.160
FreeBSD right in the corner there?

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.400
Yeah, yeah, that Alan Jude.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.120
That Alan, he's a campaigner.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:31.960
He's a campaigner.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.400
Let's see what we've got him,

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.200
because it's running under KVM.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.840
Yeah, that's true.

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:37.680
That's true.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.200
Oh, that gives me a nice jolly.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.640
You can also deploy applications with a single click.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.120
They use DoCo in the background.

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:47.240
They're big fans at Docker.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.920
They work upstream with the projects.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.760
It's pretty good.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.580
Digitalocean.com.

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.000
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.680
And a big thank you to Digitalocean

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.280
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.400
And thanks, you guys out there, for keeping the show going

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.280
into 2016, and keep us going.

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.000
Everyone get more droplets for 2016.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.680
DOUNPLUGED.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.000
All right, so in episode 3, Hyundai,

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.840
and 45 of the Linux Action Show,

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.680
I busted out my predictions.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.900
Now, traditionally, in the big show,

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:16.160
what we do is we own up to our predictions from last year,

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.400
and we make our new predictions.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:21.560
But since we had a host change up from Matt to Noah,

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:23.160
I decided it wasn't really fair

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:26.160
to make Noah own up to Matt's predictions, and vice versa.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.760
That would have been funny, though.

01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.700
What I did is I pulled out a few of my predictions,

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.560
and I'm gonna own up to them in this episode.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:33.720
We start with a clean slate on last week,

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:37.480
and then we'll do this own up thing in next year.

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.080
I'm watching this, you know what?

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.920
I came away realizing I didn't like

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:44.960
the way I did this format last time.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.600
It really sucks to watch yourself,

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600
and then be like, you know what?

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.560
I don't like the way I did that.

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.520
So having watched this again, I decided

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.520
I probably wouldn't do the format like this.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.720
So now I'm gonna, now I know, now I know.

01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.560
You know what I mean?

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.560
Like, going forward, I'm gonna do this right.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.640
But what I will do here is I'm gonna play,

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:07.040
I pulled out one, two, three, four predictions

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:09.680
that I made, and I'm gonna see how I did.

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:11.160
And I'll link to the full episode

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.160
if you wanna watch all of them.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.160
But I wanna start with this one

01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:17.200
that I think I got half right.

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.480
I kinda made the mistake of making

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.320
like two predictions in one here,

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.160
but I'm gonna play it for you.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.120
And this is about Debian, and how I thought

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.200
that in 2015 they'd have a new feature come to Debian

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:30.760
that would be a big hit.

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.920
Hold on, that was my cue, but then I don't hear nothing.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.520
I hear nothing, hold on.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.440
See, Debian come up with a PPA-like solution for 2015.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.920
You know, like, honestly, one of the reasons

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:47.160
I will go with Ubuntu over Debian is for PPAs.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.320
Yeah, yeah, but I would like them

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:51.440
to not just, you know, carve and copy the concept.

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.280
Because it's not a great system.

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.120
It's not, I mean, even with PPA Manager,

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.960
while that, god, that's a huge help,

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:58.960
it's more of a Pac-Man-like situation would be ideal.

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.400
I would love, so obviously the Debian PPA thing,

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.240
that didn't work out.

01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:04.080
That didn't happen.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.280
I thought for sure it would, too.

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.480
And then there was even discussions in the mailing list

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:08.960
about implementing a PPA-like system.

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.080
Yeah, there was a lot of news about it.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:13.040
It got close, my prediction got real close.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:15.240
But it didn't quite work out.

01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:17.960
And then I kinda threw in like this other prediction.

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:21.960
Love, love to see more distros work

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.360
with the openSUSE build service in 2015.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.320
That would be cool.

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:27.000
Although, open, yeah, it's a good idea,

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
but their stuff is-

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.320
It's not gonna happen, is it?

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:30.720
There's still misses stuff.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:32.000
When I tried using it in the past,

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.280
it does still miss some things.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.240
So, yeah, it's the right idea.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.240
I wanna put a stake in the ground right here.

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.620
My prediction for openSUSE build service

01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:43.880
and for Copper is more of the same.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.120
And I think that was kind of true.

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.800
I mean, they grew more, but it was just sort of more steady,

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.960
more of the same.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.920
Nothing really broke through as like a big,

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.080
like, oh, we're switching over to this.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.900
You think I kinda got that one, that last part right?

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.000
I definitely didn't get the PPA thing right.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.280
Unfortunately, no.

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:01.380
But the, yeah, I mean, I do think at least marginally more

01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.280
are using the build service.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:03.240
It's a great resource.

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.540
I wish that more people would use it.

01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:07.600
I hope that's another repeat, let's just say.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.440
I hope that continues.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.200
All right, so then I made a prediction about Docker

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:15.120
and how it might affect the Linux action show.

01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.040
I think containers will continue to see huge adoption.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:19.240
It's gonna blow up.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.360
Docker's gonna do great.

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:21.720
Rocket's gonna do great.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.240
We're gonna come up with a lot of great new uses.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.800
You're gonna see probably your humble host

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:29.160
here on the Linux action show say,

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.220
here is a project, it's super cool,

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.280
and you can do it in a container

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.600
on your distribution right now.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:35.560
And we'll stop saying things like,

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.000
this only works on Ubuntu.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.340
This only works on SUSE.

01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:39.840
This only works on Arch.

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.320
That is gonna go away a little bit towards, but...

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.160
So you know what?

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.960
And it did kind of work out that way.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.120
Not completely as I thought,

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.040
but I know off the top of my head,

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.960
we talked about Smokeping and MB last year

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.440
that at the end of the episode were like,

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.920
all right, go get this Docker container

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:57.760
and you can use it.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.280
It came up a couple of times.

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.720
But I saw you kind of go iffy.

01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.880
What was that iffy on, do you think?

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:02.720
Oh, just don't know.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:04.440
I feel like Rocket from CoreOS.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.260
Oh yeah.

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:06.100
It's not delivered as much as...

01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.940
Yeah, you're right.

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:07.760
It really hasn't, has it?

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.160
Rocket hasn't been like huge.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.320
It's, yeah.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.160
They're there.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:11.980
I mean, I appreciate it.

01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:12.820
I like CoreOS, but...

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:13.760
Yeah, yeah.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.480
Pocket Casey points out that ownCloud

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.840
is using the openSUSE build service.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.480
In fact, I was gonna talk about that today in the episode.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.440
I just forgot.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.560
MB was for a while.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.300
Yeah, Joss Blog is like,

01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:28.000
don't use your native distro repo packages.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.800
You know, use the build service packages.

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.100
So there's been some movement there,

01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:33.040
but I just attribute it at the same steady pace.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:35.920
I don't think the openSUSE build service

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.040
or Copper has had a breakout.

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.560
Like when I install Fedora,

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.840
I still find Copper not nearly competitive at all

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.320
with the AUR.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:46.400
And that's kind of my benchmark for both those things.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.360
All right.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.480
So I have one I'm saving towards the end,

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.680
but I got one more.

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.620
And I'm curious, I think this one is iffy.

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:54.860
I wanna know what you think, Wes.

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.560
I made a prediction about freeBSD

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:58.520
kicking Linux in the bools.

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:02.360
Is in large scale production, enterprise grade.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.740
People are gonna look at the Linux stack as a whole

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.980
and look at virtualization.

01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:09.920
They're gonna look at containerization

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.080
and they're gonna look at the file system.

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.080
And I predict that Linux over 2015

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:24.480
will lose a lot of installations to freeBSD.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:27.960
I think 2015 will be the year

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:32.960
that the Linux community recognizes the amount of heat

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:35.400
that the freeBSD project

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.380
and all of the people around freeBSD are bringing.

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:41.680
So I was supposing that freeBSD

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.820
would see a lot more market adoption.

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:48.020
I don't know how to measure that now in looking back at it,

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.920
but it does seem like a lot more VPS providers

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.840
have started offering freeBSD.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.200
Free NAS has gotten a lot more mindshare

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.940
and a lot more market.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:01.020
Noah just shared a story on Linux Action Show this Sunday

01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.160
about a client that wasn't even willing

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.020
to consider Linux anymore.

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:05.920
They wanted free NAS and CFS.

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.240
So what do you think?

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.400
Do you think?

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.400
I think a lot of the system D stuff,

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:13.280
I think there's a certain set of,

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.060
well, on the Linux side,

01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.280
I think some of the system D fallout,

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.900
there have been more Linux power users

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:21.000
who have been exploring freeBSD.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.880
I think it still is the king

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:27.320
in terms of easy, open source, secure data storage.

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.280
But I'm not sure.

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.640
I know from our emails that come into TechSnap,

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.700
a lot of people have been switching in our audience.

01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:37.640
So I know, and the BSD Now show

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.720
has grown a ton in the last year.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.160
The BSD Now show really grew a lot last year.

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:44.020
It was a big year for the BSD Now show.

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:48.080
So yeah, I kind of think that did actually happen.

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:49.080
If I go by those metrics.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:51.240
I think it does deserve to be recognized

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:54.480
because freeBSD is a great open source project.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:57.800
I don't know, I feel like it deserves more recognition

01:33:57.800 --> 01:33:59.040
in the container space for jails.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.400
And I feel like there's the privileged admins

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.720
and developers who do use it.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.900
But I feel like there's been so much further hype

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:08.560
in the Linux community that that shift has not happened.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.840
Go ahead, Ryan.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:14.720
So I'm not really sure that even though there

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:19.160
is a lot of interest in BSD, and especially

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:22.200
among those who are really technical

01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.580
and like to explore this technology as far as they can

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:28.720
and be kind of on the cutting edge,

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.920
I think that we have to ask, at what expense?

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.240
Is it at Linux's expense?

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.840
No, I mean, Linux may be losing these users,

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:41.680
but many are coming to take their place.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.880
That's a great way to put it.

01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.120
That's a great way to put it.

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:46.080
There's so much momentum behind Linux and people

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:47.980
that want to be creators and people that

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:49.320
want to be on the cutting edge.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.380
There's so much momentum there that it's

01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:53.960
a drop in the bucket, right?

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.680
Yeah, and I was just going to say,

01:34:55.680 --> 01:35:00.120
I got the opportunity to talk to somebody who works for one

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.880
of my former employers.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:06.000
And when I worked there, it was completely a Microsoft shop.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.960
They were a Microsoft Platinum partner,

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.480
whatever the highest was, and they would not really

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.680
deploy anything.

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.440
I maintained three Linux servers that I

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.600
had to beg to get in there.

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:20.480
And I just had a conversation with one of the guys who

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:24.440
works there, and now they have OpenStack deployed.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.640
It's pretty much all Linux where Windows was king before.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.120
And so I think about that, and I think,

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:36.120
yeah, people might be moving over to BSD

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.120
to try some of these technologies

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:39.600
that they're interested in.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.320
But there are so many people continuing

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.280
to come to Linux because it's becoming the de facto.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:47.680
The part that jumps out at me at the prediction

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.960
is at the end there I said, by the end of 2015,

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:54.520
we're going to recognize the heat that FreeBSD is bringing.

01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:57.400
And I think now if you look back at canonical preemptively

01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:00.200
announcing planned support for ZFS,

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.100
I think that is sort of a recognition of the demand

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:04.520
for some of the feature set there.

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:07.560
Wimpy, you say more it's like you see FreeBSD going in

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:10.120
for specific tasks, not really replacing Linux,

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.360
but more like complementing it.

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.080
Tell me more about that.

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:16.200
Yeah, well, yes, replacing Linux, but not entirely.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:21.280
So the things that I do, I've been deploying

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.640
PFSense for firewalls because if you're

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:29.240
going for a full-on open source solution, in my opinion,

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:31.360
there isn't a Linux-based firewall that

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:34.320
can compete with PFSense.

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:38.320
And in terms of doing big file servers,

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:44.160
if you're not doing clustered storage like Ceph or GlusterFS,

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:48.040
then ZFS is really the only game in town

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:51.800
unless you really pay through the nose from something

01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:54.320
from EMC, for example.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.320
So I've been deploying BSD in those scenarios for file

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:04.640
servers and for firewalls, but the rest of the Linux

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.280
infrastructure has remained.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:10.400
So all of the big compute and data science stuff

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:12.040
still runs on Linux.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:18.520
It's now just using TrueNAS in this case, or FreeNAS.

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:19.200
As the back end.

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:23.600
And ZFS as the back end, and then PF in front of it all.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.840
But I think you're right.

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:30.200
I think with Ubuntu adopting ZFS in 16.04,

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.200
and also some of the Debian derivatives,

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.120
so Open Media Vault, for example, where ZFS is now

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:42.120
an option, I think you were right in your predictions

01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:45.320
that this year is the year that Linux is going

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:48.000
to sort of embrace ZFS, and ZFS will

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:57.400
be the future of enterprise scale storage on Linux.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.120
And then you can layer all of the clustering file

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.880
systems on top of that.

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:04.200
So don't go away, because this last prediction,

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.480
I think I kind of got it right.

01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:08.760
And I think what I got wrong was Ubuntu Mate edition

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.720
wasn't at the forefront of my vocabulary at the time.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.040
But it's essentially, I think, what

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.720
I was trying to say in my last prediction for 2015.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.360
Right.

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.200
Here's what I think.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:24.920
I think 2015 will be the year that the bet that Mint took

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:28.240
with their multi-year release, and that Ubuntu is taking

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.720
with the let's not focus on a Unity 7,

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:34.160
let's just make it better.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:37.600
I think 2015 is the year that that check is due.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.400
Like that payment needs to be made.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.200
And 2015 is going to come along.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:44.240
And I'm not trying to brag, but guys

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.120
like me on Arch, and Gnome 3, and the rolling releases,

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:52.280
like KDE 5, SUSE Tumbleweed, Fedora,

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.720
we are going to have such awesome desktops that's

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.120
so much far and above what the commercial competitors are

01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.360
going to do, that I suspect that where Linux's genuine gains are

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.640
is in that geek, that enthusiast.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.680
That when we did how-to Linux in 2014,

01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:12.200
and Chase was sort of like the ideal Windows switcher.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:14.080
He was a Windows power user.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.560
He liked to tweak Windows.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:16.880
He was ready to do more.

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:20.560
And what he found was, those old desktops

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:22.400
were not very appealing to him.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.360
They weren't customizable enough.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.880
They weren't new enough.

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.000
And I think in reality, you have more people switching

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.840
to Linux that are savvy than you do that new mythical user.

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:35.760
Over 2015, I think it's still going to be more of us,

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.240
more geeks, more enthusiasts switching to Linux.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:42.520
And because of that, I think things like Plasma 5 and Gnome

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.400
3 will be way better received, because you're

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.240
getting a modern experience, you can still customize it.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.160
You don't feel like you're taking a step back.

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:55.920
But I think in terms of raw numbers and organic adoption,

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.920
things like the Matei project or Trinity,

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.000
other classic desktop paradigms, I

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.580
think that's where the most growth will happen.

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:09.320
I think a lot of it's still going to be Ubuntu-based.

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:11.440
Last year, I thought it was going to be Arch-based.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.200
I think this year it's going to be Ubuntu-based.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:13.820
Maybe I'll be wrong.

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:14.960
Maybe it's going to be Fedora-based.

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:17.380
I think a lot of it's going to be traditional Matei edition

01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:19.360
style, Ubuntu-based growth.

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:21.720
But I think for power users, enthusiasts,

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:24.760
the people that are watching this show, those of us who

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:28.440
work in IT, those of us who are just like Windows power users

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.020
that are switching to something else.

01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:30.640
I would agree.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.000
We're going to look for the more modern stuff.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.660
And a lot of the power user growth is going to happen there.

01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:36.740
So I think I got it right.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:38.800
The base usage growth, the granite growth,

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.240
was in the Ubuntu Matei.

01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.360
And then people had to go with the Raspberry Pi grabbing

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.120
the Ubuntu Matei edition.

01:40:45.120 --> 01:40:47.120
And then the people with powerful computers,

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.400
more of us adopted Plasma 5 and Gnome 3 this year.

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.920
That's sort of the long version of,

01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.360
that's a short version of a long thing I just said.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.720
But I think, I don't know, Wimpy,

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:57.360
your thoughts being Mr. Ubuntu Matei over there?

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.840
What do you think?

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.960
I don't know.

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:01.460
I know.

01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:04.180
It was a long way to get to it, watching that back.

01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.340
But I think essentially, it seems like Ubuntu Matei really,

01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:09.520
really came into its own in 2015.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:10.800
It really became recognized.

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.440
It existed in 2014.

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:16.240
But 2015, I mean, it became a serious contender.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:18.000
April, when the official version came,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.480
the official, when it became part of the Ubuntu family,

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:26.960
that really did jump on quite considerably.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.300
Things have calmed down a bit now.

01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:30.000
People are used to the fact that it's there

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.340
and it's part of the furniture.

01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:34.160
So it's a bit more calm.

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:36.280
I don't really know how to gauge,

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.280
because I've got no insight to how popular

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:39.960
the other distributions are.

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.880
I'm just pleased that I've made something

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:42.760
that's so many people.

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.320
And there are a lot of people that are downloading it.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:45.960
Yeah, but you can just tell, as somebody

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.620
who's been in the Linux community for a while,

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:49.780
when a distribution moves up to the forefront

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:53.880
and sort of gains mindshare.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.440
And yours has very quickly.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.920
Yeah.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.280
Yeah, maybe.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.400
I think, yes, it's clearly popular.

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.280
I can't gauge how popular exactly versus the others.

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.040
That's very difficult to do.

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.600
But generally, there's a lot of interest

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:13.720
around it, and that's very pleasing for me.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.320
You know, it started off as a bit of fun,

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.960
and it's become a bit more than that.

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.400
But yeah, it's been a very enjoyable journey

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:23.320
and I'll make it continue.

01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:26.240
Now, Ryan is a crazy SOB, and he thinks

01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.120
that those blokes over at Canonical

01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.740
are going to actually make an Ubuntu vanilla desktop that's

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:31.780
going to get all the buzz.

01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:35.240
Ryan, share your wisdom with me.

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:38.280
So as somebody who spent a considerable amount of time

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.520
using the Ubuntu phone here in the last,

01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.080
I don't know, probably month and a half,

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.880
and just played around with Unity 8 a bit,

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.160
I got to say that if the desktop, Unity 8 desktop,

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.160
doesn't make a big splash, then the apps

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:58.440
that the community has created for that desktop that

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.540
seem to fit in so well in that desktop

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:05.680
and scale as your screen size does, that I think

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.720
will swing the pendulum back the other way.

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.240
Because if you think about it, the Unity 7

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:15.880
was just really iterative, almost for the past like two

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.920
years.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:22.040
You know, it's just been bug fixes and the occasional,

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:23.920
I would consider, minor feature.

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:25.840
And I'm sure somebody could debate me on that.

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.960
But especially this year, it kind of,

01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:32.600
it just kind of polished and fixed bugs.

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:36.600
And I was using Gnome 3 quite a lot

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:41.400
until I played around with the Ubuntu phone

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:43.920
and then Unity 8 some.

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.560
And I realized that they've actually

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:47.840
got something really interesting there.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.460
And if I were going to predict, I

01:43:51.460 --> 01:43:55.460
would say that there's going to be some renewed interest when

01:43:55.460 --> 01:43:57.160
they really push that to the forefront.

01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:00.400
So is this an official Ryan prediction for 2016?

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:01.900
Because we've been writing it down.

01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:05.880
I'm willing to put my stamp on that.

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.600
I've got another one if I can share it.

01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.920
Yeah, go ahead.

01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.360
So I've been saying this forever.

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:14.320
And I know I'm sure Canonical doesn't like this

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.160
when I spread these rumors.

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.480
But I really think that we will see

01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:24.000
some Canonical partnerships.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.100
And I don't have any privileged information or anything.

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.320
But I just think that I was looking

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:33.240
at the stats of their cloud, how many deployments Ubuntu

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:35.040
has in the cloud.

01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:38.440
And I don't feel like somebody who has so many,

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.760
even on their competitors, like, well, not really,

01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:42.080
they would say not a competitor.

01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.960
But Azure, on the Microsoft platform,

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.720
they have significant market share.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.080
I don't think that's a play.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.760
I think what you want about Canonical,

01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:57.080
but that's not something they can ignore,

01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.000
these companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.480
And so I would be really interested to see

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:06.720
what happens with that company, Canonical,

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.720
and their partnerships with these traditional big players

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:11.720
in that space.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:13.280
So this Sunday on the Linux Action Show,

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:15.800
we're doing what we wish happens in 2016.

01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:19.640
And one of my wishes, and I'll just give one of them away,

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:23.720
I guess, is my wish is that Ubuntu's adoption

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.080
in these cloud platforms encourages a desktop adoption

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.400
after Unity 8 stabilizes, like Unity 8.5, Unity 8.7,

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:32.600
something like that, is I really hope that.

01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.960
Can I?

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:35.600
Go ahead.

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.520
Sorry, go ahead.

01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:42.000
No, I was just going to say, the thing that I think about

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.280
is this year, it wasn't just Ubuntu, but people who,

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:50.840
and we talk about the year of the Linux desktop every year.

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.400
And I'm not saying it's the year of the Linux desktop,

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.240
but the barriers to get there, every year,

01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.920
I think it's impossible for it to drop down again.

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.760
I think this Linux, the desktop is

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:04.200
going to remain this niche thing.

01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:07.120
And we've kind of got the users we're going to have.

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.280
And it's just going to be the tinkerers, the hackers,

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:16.000
and the really explorative, curious power users.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.240
But then something like Steam drops, or even more

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.800
applications go to the web, or somebody implements,

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:30.440
for instance, I've got Spotify on my Linux rig.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.320
And each time one of these things happen,

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.880
somebody else can be talking to me.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.120
A new category of user can move over, yeah.

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.920
Exactly.

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:45.640
Months ago, I put my lay friend on the Ubuntu Mate desktop.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.840
And really, Spotify was probably the final app

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:50.640
that made it doable.

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.480
Not a single functionality or feature

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:53.800
is missing anymore for her.

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.080
Not a single thing.

01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.760
There's nothing that she needs her computer for

01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.840
that the Ubuntu Mate desktop is not providing.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.080
And maybe a stable Unity 8 could provide something

01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.560
of the reference platform that Ubuntu kind of already is,

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.080
but in better form.

01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:07.880
I like it, Ryan.

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.720
It's good stuff.

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:16.520
I talked about this at System76, but I have a Yoga 2 laptop

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:18.120
that I take around with me.

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:21.000
And Unity 8 would be so cool if, when

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.280
I flip it back to tablet mode right now,

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:26.240
it just kills the keyboard and switches

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.400
to pulling up the online keyboard, which is fine.

01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.320
It allows me to just sit there and read a web page

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.640
or something.

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:36.600
But wouldn't it be so cool, since they

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:40.200
have the tablet interface and the phone interface

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.800
versus the desktop interface, if, when I did that,

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:48.480
it actually switched to a complete touch-centric experience?

01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:51.120
Because when I want to read, I want

01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:54.720
to just be able to flip through the stuff with my hands,

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:57.000
sitting there relaxed on the couch or whatever.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.640
And consolidating that device seems pretty nice,

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.000
because I have all my files, and I

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.560
wouldn't be using some kind of sync service to go to tablet.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.480
I agree.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.920
That's the dream.

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:08.160
That's the dream, Ryan.

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:11.440
And then you tie it all together with a little Mycroft here

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:11.960
and there.

01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.120
And boy, that's a happy world after all.

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:17.400
Yeah, then I don't even have to touch it anymore.

01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.920
I can just say things to it.

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.320
Yeah, yeah, I love it.

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.880
I love the fact that you're talking about the opposite way

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:26.240
that whenever we talk about convergence at Canonica,

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:28.800
we talk about how you take a phone out of your pocket,

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.920
and you plug your keyboard and mouse,

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.400
and it turns into a desktop.

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:32.560
You want to go the other way.

01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.840
You want to take a desktop and turn it into a tablet.

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.200
Oh, for me too, yeah.

01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:38.760
It should be able to do both of those.

01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:40.760
Yeah, I would say I fall in that category too.

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.320
That's exactly how I think about it.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:45.080
Well, guys, I look forward to seeing both of you at Scale.

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.840
Don't forget, if you're curious about Scale,

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.120
we got links in the show notes.

01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.840
We also got links to all the Mycroft stuff that's

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:52.720
going on, including the Indiegogo campaign

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.880
and the community.

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.560
As well, we have links to that episode of the Linux Action

01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.680
Show if you want to see all of the predictions of Matt

01:48:58.680 --> 01:48:59.440
and mine.

01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.680
It's a whole bunch of stuff in the show notes this week.

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.040
A whole bunch of stuff.

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:03.760
Don't miss it.

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:04.520
That's right.

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:07.140
And you know, you could be here live to take in all of it

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.440
and actually get even more show.

01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:09.240
You get some of it.

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:10.200
Way more show.

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.000
You get some of it.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.520
We could include some of it, but not all of it,

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.880
especially the really dirty parts.

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:15.380
What?

01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:16.840
Whoa.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:18.280
Let's just say pants were involved.

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:18.760
Yes.

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.120
All right.

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.160
So that brings us to the end of this week's episode

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.080
of Linux Unplugged.

01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.400
We do this live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:26.640
Go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.160
to get that in your local time zone.

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.000
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com for topics and feedback

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.520
into this here show.

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.120
I'd love to get your feedback there.

01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:35.800
And of course, join us live next week

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.280
so you can be in the Mumble Room and take

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:38.200
part of our virtual lug.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:39.440
Thanks so much for tuning in.

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:41.480
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:50:09.520
Good day.

01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:19.760
Now we're all done.

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:21.960
I think it's time for a little Mycroft and Chili.

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:24.000
We can just do this.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:24.760
That's a good show.

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.440
Thank you, everybody, for making it out.

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.760
That was an awesome show, guys.

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.720
Did you see my BSD and Chill image?

01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.920
Yeah, I did.

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.160
That's perfect.

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.680
Yeah, that's great.

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:36.680
BSD and Chill.

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.800
I guess it's like now that I did

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.640
the whole, now that I totally didn't

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.320
get the whole Netflix and Chill reference,

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.440
now I'm seeing even Ted Cruz is making references

01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:45.400
to Netflix and Chill.

01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.360
I am an old man when Ted Cruz has got a meme faster

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:50.280
than I do.

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.680
All right, jbtitles.com.

01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:53.680
Let's go vote.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.360
Speaking of which, my wife is actually chilling here.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.320
I had the headphones unplugged for a little bit,

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:01.000
and she was listening to you.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:01.520
What'd she think?

01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:02.320
She liked the show?

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.640
And hold on.

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.440
Java with Gnome Phone was kind of good.

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:09.800
Oh, right, titles.

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:11.400
Minecraft Action Show, that's not bad.

01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:18.320
Master Clickbaiting, that's good, too.

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.360
Here she is.

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:21.200
I'm going to let her tell you in her own words.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.440
Hello, Ryan's wife.

01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:24.360
Hello.

01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:25.320
Ryan, hello.

01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:26.200
What's your name?

01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:26.920
Hello.

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:27.440
Hi.

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.160
Misha.

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:28.640
Hi.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.520
So what'd you think of the show today?

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.400
I actually didn't hear the show today.

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:35.240
I was working.

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:40.000
But I actually hear your various shows quite often

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.200
because Ryan listens while he's in the shower

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:45.440
and has it over a big speaker.

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.200
How considerate.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:46.920
That's nice.

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:47.560
That's good.

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:48.600
Yes.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:49.120
Yes.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.800
So I stay quite informed on Linux news.

01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:52.400
Oh, good.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:54.360
I listen in my fortress of solitude.

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:54.840
Right.

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:57.920
So while you're having shower thoughts, I understand.

01:51:57.920 --> 01:51:58.560
That's pretty good.

01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.800
Yeah, it's the best time.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.040
All right, so give me your feedback.

01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:03.080
This is your chance to give me any feedback, any improvements

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:03.680
you'd like me to make.

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:04.000
Go ahead.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:04.840
I'll note them down right here.

01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:05.760
I got a piece of paper.

01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:06.160
I'll note them down right here.

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:07.080
I got a piece of paper.

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:07.600
Oh, OK.

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.120
OK.

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:14.120
Maybe more, I don't know.

01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:15.200
I don't know.

01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:15.840
Really?

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:16.640
I guess that's good.

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:17.920
Something complementary.

01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:20.120
Yeah, something involving magic would be great.

01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:20.680
More magic.

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.040
OK, I'll write magic.

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:22.520
Yeah.

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:23.840
All right, magic and sparkles.

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:24.480
Yeah, OK, I got this.

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.480
Purple elephants.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:26.160
Purple.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.720
OK, these are all things I can work on.

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:29.440
Purple elephants.

01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.040
Good.

01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:30.680
OK, thank you.

01:52:30.680 --> 01:52:31.080
Yeah.

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.160
That's solid feedback.

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.080
The thing that I wonder about, Chris,

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:39.920
because she gets to listen to you on Linux Action Show,

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:43.160
Linux Unplugged, and Coder Radio mostly.

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:50.520
My question is, I know you have the women's,

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:54.440
I'm blanking on the name, but I have the Women's Tech Radio.

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:58.120
And I'm curious, do you know how much of your audience

01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:01.960
as maybe a percentage or as a number is women?

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.400
Do you have any idea on that?

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.320
I don't think I have any current numbers,

01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:08.920
but I don't think it's a huge, I don't think it's more than about 6%

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.720
or 7%, but I'm not sure.

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.640
And how many of them are forced to listen

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:13.880
by their showering husbands?

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:14.880
Yeah.

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.120
I'm going to have to try that.

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:16.640
Do those count?

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:17.120
Do those count?

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:20.200
Maybe that could be a new marketing approach.

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:23.200
Spread the word via the shower.

01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:29.280
Get those, tell those sponsors, if you're trying

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:33.800
to hit this demographic, women who are forced to listen

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:39.240
to their husband's podcast, then you never know.

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:42.040
We could have Ting, and then we could have, I don't know,

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:44.280
what's a brand that wouldn't offend every woman that

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:46.000
listens to this, if I said it?

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.320
I feel like I could focus on shower-related products, too.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.880
That could be a new category.

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:52.280
I could focus on soap.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:53.840
Yeah, oh, yeah.

01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:57.000
It's a video show, just chest up, Chris showering,

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.400
shampooing his hair.

01:53:58.400 --> 01:53:59.400
No more.

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:00.400
No more shower talk.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:03.480
Actually, I would like to know what hair products he uses.

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.480
He says he doesn't.

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:05.480
Cut you guys off.

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:06.480
This is ridiculous.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.480
This is Washington water.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.720
End of discussion right there.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.000
End of discussion.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.400
Just had my first day at my new job today, and I'm super excited.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:14.400
Oh, congratulations.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.400
How did it go?

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:16.400
Yeah, great.

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.400
Like-minded people.

01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:18.400
Fabulous.

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.400
All the right things.

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.400
Lots of Debian, lots of Ubuntu, lots of open source.

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:22.400
Yeah, really?

01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:23.400
That sounds wonderful.

01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:26.400
So are you saying Ubuntu and Debian on the desktop?

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:27.400
What are you saying?

01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.400
I'm saying Debian for server infrastructure and Ubuntu on the desktop.

01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.400
Nice.

01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.400
Mm-hmm.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:34.400
Mm-hmm.

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:35.400
Get in.

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:36.400
Get in?

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.400
What the heck?

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:38.400
That's such an old man thing to say.

01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:39.400
No, it's not.

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:40.400
It's a very British thing to say.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:41.400
Oh, okay.

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.400
Oh, okay.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.400
It sounds old.

01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:44.400
It sounds old.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:45.400
Yeah.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:55:04.400
It sounds old.
