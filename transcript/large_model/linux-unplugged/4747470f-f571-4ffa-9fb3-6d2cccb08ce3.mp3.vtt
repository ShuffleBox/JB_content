WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
Kind of funny this week. I was I was at a bar having a beer

00:03.160 --> 00:07.920
You know like one like one does occasionally mm-hmm as a responsible adult. I'll pretend

00:08.520 --> 00:13.400
And I was talking I talked with the very nice guy there. He just drops this bomb on me I

00:14.120 --> 00:16.120
Grew up in a Linux household

00:16.800 --> 00:21.680
Was like how is how is someone that I've never met saying this to me. I'm not at a Linux conference

00:21.680 --> 00:27.460
I'm not in a Linux users. Well. You've got that look apparently look yeah

00:27.460 --> 00:31.320
Well, he was asking me like I'm in there a lot like I'll just you know be working on something or show notes or whatever

00:32.480 --> 00:36.600
You probably sell up over your shoulder. He may have yeah anyway

00:36.600 --> 00:38.760
It turns out he didn't he doesn't use Linux currently

00:38.760 --> 00:42.720
But I guess one of his parents was in the IT field so when he was growing up

00:42.720 --> 00:47.400
They switched the whole he told me some stories about like he spelled play Diablo 2 which he liked a lot and then they switched

00:47.400 --> 00:50.840
The whole house over to Linux, and he couldn't do that anymore, but he got into it

00:50.840 --> 00:53.800
I guess at one time he was like a regular contributor on some Ubuntu forums

00:53.800 --> 00:57.600
It was just funny because I had brought back a whole like a whole life ago for him

00:57.600 --> 00:59.640
He didn't do any of it now totally had different interests

00:59.640 --> 01:03.600
But yeah, I do think he did say he had some live CDs here live USBs

01:03.600 --> 01:07.400
He carried around and I was encouraging him. He was curious about hey

01:07.400 --> 01:10.080
You know what are the what distros might have not heard of that sort of stuff?

01:10.080 --> 01:14.280
He was actually really interested in solace especially when I told him it wasn't you know it wasn't just a new derivative

01:14.280 --> 01:16.360
It was its own first-rate distro

01:16.880 --> 01:21.480
Yeah, so maybe there's a new solace convert out there next time if I see him again. I'll have to ask

01:21.480 --> 01:24.560
This is a Linux unplugged episode

01:25.360 --> 01:27.800
206 for July 18th

01:29.040 --> 01:31.040
2017

01:39.640 --> 01:43.000
Welcome to the Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show

01:43.640 --> 01:48.240
My name is Wes and joining me this week. Oh my it is an oh so special guest

01:48.240 --> 01:55.400
Oh guys who is that the one the only the beardiest it's our friends Rekai the editor who keeps

01:56.040 --> 01:58.040
everything going around here

01:58.960 --> 02:04.200
Welcome to today's episode. We've got a you know. It's a special show anytime Chris is away. We've we've convinced him to take a vacation

02:05.320 --> 02:08.400
Finally yeah out of the house out of the studio

02:08.400 --> 02:11.960
We get to play do whatever we want so you know the show probably be a little bit different

02:11.960 --> 02:16.900
But I think it's gonna be a lot of fun. We've got we've got some complicated things explained well obviously

02:16.900 --> 02:20.440
I've been convinced that this is a good thing by my bomb the tech snap program by

02:21.040 --> 02:26.000
Deep dive master Dan over there, so we've got some highlights of just some things. I think around the web that

02:26.760 --> 02:30.720
There's a lot of complicated things that are hard to explain. It's always a great thing when they're explained

02:30.720 --> 02:35.280
They're explained really well. We're not gonna go as deep as you know it will not be a dandy dive

02:35.280 --> 02:38.400
Don't worry. We don't want to put them out of a job. We won't even talk about let's encrypt

02:38.400 --> 02:40.400
So you just it's fine. It's fine

02:40.400 --> 02:44.400
But it should be fun after that we've just got some updates from some of our favorite

02:44.400 --> 02:47.720
Favorite projects around the web and maybe not so favorites

02:47.720 --> 02:53.480
But they you know they deserve updates to plus. There's you know as always a couple news a new things to highlight

02:54.360 --> 02:56.760
Enrique, I found a very interesting handheld

02:57.880 --> 03:03.800
Project over on Indiegogo that it's not every day that I think one of these is actually interesting or that it might happen or that

03:03.800 --> 03:05.800
It's worth talking about but

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
This one seems kind of unique and had some had some interesting things going for it that hey like maybe some new AMD

03:13.000 --> 03:14.440
technology

03:14.440 --> 03:16.440
I like the sounds of that

03:16.760 --> 03:21.400
and after that of course because I'm hosting we're gonna talk about containers and

03:21.840 --> 03:26.600
about the evolution of containers and how they've gotten a little bit more friendly a little bit more confusing and oh

03:27.120 --> 03:29.120
So many more daemons

03:29.160 --> 03:36.040
Plus there's some birthdays for our some of our favorite distros or not so favorites. We'll kind of talk about what does that mean?

03:36.040 --> 03:42.560
What does it mean to be a distro in today's in today's world and what should you reflect on on these birthdays?

03:42.560 --> 03:48.040
And if we have time I'm gonna pick the beards brain about some Linux gaming and maybe some not so

03:48.680 --> 03:51.960
Linux gaming but before we get there

03:51.960 --> 03:59.160
We should really bring in our good friends the people who make this show possible time appropriate greetings mobile room

03:59.160 --> 04:05.640
Oh, hey guys, I didn't even see you there. I know they were just hiding there in the corner this whole

04:06.160 --> 04:08.380
Time and boy aren't we glad?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.480
To have them you are you guys how you guys how do you feel about a beard on the show?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.480
I'm pretty stoked about it

04:16.480 --> 04:18.480
Not bad awesome

04:19.320 --> 04:23.880
Yeah, see there you go nice a warm welcome for his beardiness the beard

04:23.880 --> 04:30.080
Okay, so first up today in our new category probably one time only but complicated things

04:30.920 --> 04:35.080
Explained well, we've got a real-world guide to web

04:36.080 --> 04:37.200
RTC

04:37.200 --> 04:44.160
Talking directly from browser to browser sign me up web RTC just makes so much sense and lets you do many awesome new things

04:44.160 --> 04:48.720
That simply weren't possible before anyway, that's the promise of web RTC

04:48.720 --> 04:50.900
I mean we've certainly played with a lot here at the studio

04:50.900 --> 04:56.740
It kind of promises to be that thing where you don't have to I don't have to super learn all of the ins and outs

04:56.740 --> 05:00.980
of VoIP and SIP and all of that or have an ISDN line between

05:01.340 --> 05:06.020
Studios do they have the part where they explain why it doesn't work half the time. Yes, so

05:06.460 --> 05:12.580
That's where the real world aspect comes into this and looking at some of the discussions over it, you know people talking about this

05:12.580 --> 05:18.340
I think that's the key is that web RTC has been talked a lot about how easy it is how simple it is to get started

05:18.340 --> 05:20.820
distributed peer-to-peer all those things but

05:21.740 --> 05:27.460
There's a lot that has to go on there's a lot that has to get right and it turns out yes peer-to-peer is important

05:27.460 --> 05:29.260
But you also still need a server

05:29.260 --> 05:34.740
And there's a lot of things you have to get right things like stun and turn and NAT busting and all those things just to

05:34.740 --> 05:41.300
Get two browsers to talk to each other in a way that will work be reliable and provide like acceptable video quality. Mm-hmm

05:41.300 --> 05:48.400
I have you had much experience. Do you use any of these, you know conferencing programs or just video chat?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.520
mostly just hangouts

05:51.520 --> 05:53.520
yeah, that's a

05:54.320 --> 06:02.120
That's a good problem because most of the the other options tend to as you pretty much explain not work reliably

06:02.240 --> 06:10.120
Yes, so they talk about here like what do you what do you need to get started two things a reasonably recent browser and drumroll a

06:10.120 --> 06:16.400
Server. Yeah, that's right. So they go on to explain like isn't WebRTC all about peer-to-peer communication

06:16.400 --> 06:19.800
Well, yeah, it is but these peers need to find each other

06:19.880 --> 06:24.240
So they kind of go over like what all this means they talk about ice which is interactive connectivity

06:24.720 --> 06:27.040
Establishment, which is a just a fun way to say

06:27.640 --> 06:31.360
How can you actually get two people maybe behind that to talk to each other?

06:31.760 --> 06:36.720
You think that eventually we'd be able to figure out IPv6 and get through some of these things, but no it's not gonna happen

06:36.720 --> 06:40.200
well, you think you'd also be able to take some of the the

06:41.680 --> 06:48.000
Info that the the browser itself has that where it's able to negotiate various connections to do some of this stuff automatically

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
But I wonder if there's security reasons for that. Yeah, that's a good question

06:52.840 --> 06:55.320
So they just got some you know, we're not gonna dive any more into it

06:55.320 --> 06:56.640
But they've got a lot of cool

06:56.640 --> 07:03.080
cool details here stuff about data channels mesh connectivity audio and video screen sharing a lot of stuff like if you're just getting started or

07:03.080 --> 07:05.320
maybe you have a pipe dream that you want to

07:05.320 --> 07:12.400
You know implement your own WebRTC solution. You kind of just need some JavaScript a back-end server and a lot of time. Yeah talking about

07:13.160 --> 07:21.200
The stuff like stun and ice it kind of makes me realize that WebRTC is really just sip in your browser. Yes, exactly

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
Yeah

07:22.200 --> 07:24.200
We're not gonna talk about today, but that makes me think about

07:24.440 --> 07:29.640
You know the the matrix project that we've talked a lot about before and I know I've seen them and there's a couple other things

07:29.640 --> 07:35.600
Too free switch does some of it trying to marry that where you can, you know make a WebRTC call through a sip gateway

07:35.600 --> 07:39.360
That goes and talks talks sip to another thing because you got to complicate it more

07:39.360 --> 07:44.880
you've got to complicate it more but we might have a glorious solution where I can be on Wi-Fi on a bus and

07:45.180 --> 07:50.720
Make a WebRTC call that goes through sip and then I can just ask Noah questions on his show whenever I want

07:50.800 --> 07:52.840
Except that the connection will never be established

07:52.840 --> 07:57.360
You'll never be able to have that or it'll be like really distorted and he'll keep asking and then drop me and

07:57.360 --> 08:02.800
Yeah, I'll have to yell at him later. That's no fun or he'll get really angry and confused. Could you talked about Windows?

08:02.800 --> 08:08.840
Oh, you know that happens that happens a lot. Yeah, I think especially with you. Oh, yeah

08:08.840 --> 08:14.720
Mm-hmm. You just like to troll everybody mostly know mostly know that's why if you guys haven't seen it

08:14.720 --> 08:19.960
Make sure you check out the most recent user error cuz that that show there's always something worth listening to there

08:19.960 --> 08:27.280
And we try to make it worthwhile plus there's that sweepstakes, right? I think it actually just ended. Ah, I

08:27.560 --> 08:30.400
Think it ended at 11 o'clock actually. Okay. Well, there you go

08:30.400 --> 08:32.460
You were too late if you're hearing about it now

08:32.460 --> 08:37.480
But I bet there'll be some announcements about what's gonna happen with that in the future. Probably in this next episode

08:38.040 --> 08:39.400
excellent

08:39.400 --> 08:43.320
Okay, so you're admittedly someone who spends some time on Windows, right? Yeah, that's true

08:43.320 --> 08:50.120
So maybe maybe you don't know about this, but have you heard about the SS command? No, okay

08:50.760 --> 08:55.760
Well, I've got the article for you beard an introduction to the SS command over at Linux

08:56.240 --> 09:00.440
Dot-com news for the open source professional. That's us. I think right. Yeah, it's gotta be us

09:00.800 --> 09:05.520
So Linux includes a fairly massive array of tools available to meet almost every need

09:06.040 --> 09:08.480
from development to security to productivity to

09:08.480 --> 09:14.360
Administration if you have to get it done Linux is there to serve. Yes. Of course it is. The SS command is a tool

09:14.360 --> 09:21.920
Used to dump socket statistics. You may have heard of this in the past a similar capability was exposed in the netstat tool. Ah

09:23.680 --> 09:24.760
Yeah, see there you go

09:24.760 --> 09:28.320
So there's a lot of people a lot of people end up using the you know

09:28.320 --> 09:34.760
The IP command which is the new new replacement for IF config. These are all part of the IP route to

09:35.240 --> 09:37.240
library or set of tools rather

09:37.240 --> 09:40.080
but I feel like a lot of people end up missing SS or

09:41.400 --> 09:48.160
Actually just don't like it very much a lot of my colleagues kind of it kind of has a bad wrap around them or they're

09:48.160 --> 09:51.840
Just so used to netstat net stats been written in British about every guide everywhere

09:51.840 --> 09:56.160
it has command line arguments that you're used to reading simple to use but

09:56.720 --> 10:00.720
SS exposes actually a lot more functionality in some ways. It's faster more modern and

10:01.200 --> 10:02.680
It's gonna be here for the future

10:02.680 --> 10:06.280
There's probably a lot of distros that at some point will no longer ship net stat out of the box

10:06.280 --> 10:09.000
You'll have SS. So if you are on the system where you need to troubleshoot something

10:09.000 --> 10:11.360
Maybe you don't have the ability to install net stat

10:11.480 --> 10:15.520
It's probably a good idea to learn even if it's not, you know your program of choice

10:15.520 --> 10:18.020
I don't know. I tend to use a net stat for for basic

10:18.800 --> 10:20.800
troubleshooting but then if stuff gets

10:21.160 --> 10:23.580
Much more complicated. I just switched to wire shark

10:26.120 --> 10:31.440
Yeah, that's I mean that's right sometimes you're when you have to get to that level of troubleshooting, you know, you're in trouble

10:31.440 --> 10:38.360
Yeah, all right. Well, I need Kappa packet captures. That's something's wrong here. Is that something you have to do very often?

10:38.400 --> 10:43.320
No, no, I hope not. Although I did use it to figure out why our live stream was getting knocked offline

10:44.920 --> 10:47.880
Because Noah accidentally assigned the same IP to a printer

10:49.720 --> 10:51.720
Yes, I

10:51.900 --> 10:57.080
Will refrain from comment, but maybe we already gave him crap. Yeah Linux action show

10:57.080 --> 11:02.740
Excellent, and maybe that's why you should go check out our pre show where we've got a DHCP solution

11:02.740 --> 11:05.440
That might be right up Noah's alley

11:05.800 --> 11:10.520
Anyway, this article, you know, it's not crazy in-depth, but it does have some handy guides if you haven't used it before

11:10.520 --> 11:12.340
I'm sure that's not many of our audience

11:12.340 --> 11:14.240
I just want to throw it out there because you know

11:14.240 --> 11:19.360
It's good to stay with the times and honestly, I've been using SS a lot more just like a conscious effort

11:19.760 --> 11:20.800
It's really not too bad

11:20.800 --> 11:25.360
It makes it pretty easy to choose between IP v6 or 4 if you just want to listen for you know

11:25.360 --> 11:30.480
Listening sockets or UDP connections in the unconnect state pretty simple pretty quick

11:30.480 --> 11:35.360
It shows the you know, it's easy to filter easy to say things like don't you know?

11:35.360 --> 11:40.560
Don't try to resolve all my IP addresses show me the program that owns this socket that sort of thing

11:40.920 --> 11:46.640
So you have some homework to do I think I guess so. Yeah get with the times beard get with the time

11:46.640 --> 11:49.080
Contrary to popular belief. I do have a Linux box

11:50.360 --> 11:54.960
So I can do this stuff. Do you yeah. Hmm. It's just the knock. Okay

11:54.960 --> 11:59.520
So it's not as beefy as the the Windows rig. Well, it doesn't need to be it doesn't need to be right

11:59.640 --> 12:03.600
You're saying that because Linux makes such great use of the system's resources. Yeah

12:05.720 --> 12:07.440
Why are you grinning at me?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.440
Why I never I would never

12:10.400 --> 12:12.960
Okay, so there's still a couple more things

12:14.040 --> 12:18.680
Really? I've just got you know, you haven't heard of SS. Maybe you're a mere BSD convert

12:18.720 --> 12:23.320
You might fall into you know, the target audience of this next piece as well

12:23.320 --> 12:26.600
System D for impatient sysadmins

12:27.320 --> 12:31.800
System deep it's the in its system that some love to hate I think more than some actually

12:33.240 --> 12:35.640
So full disclosure over here at tie blog. I

12:37.320 --> 12:42.960
Find system D a little overbearing although by no means would consider myself militant militantly anti system D

12:42.960 --> 12:47.960
It has obvious advantages and though I'm at philosophical odds with at least some of it

12:47.960 --> 12:51.440
I see no reason why everybody shouldn't understand it a bit better

12:51.440 --> 12:57.600
Especially now that most people will need to deal with it on their favorite distros

12:57.800 --> 13:04.360
This post is sort of just a formalized set of operational notes that I've made frequent use of in my experience with system D

13:04.360 --> 13:09.760
I hope this purse post serves as another tool in your operations sysadmin utility belt

13:09.760 --> 13:15.160
We need to get solutions quickly, but are working with a system that relies on different tools than your normal sys5 toolbox

13:15.600 --> 13:19.120
Just a note the paths and examples here will be drawn from Arch Linux, but

13:19.120 --> 13:23.960
Most of them should carry over to too many other distributions. So really that I mean, I think that's it right there like

13:25.240 --> 13:29.360
We can really get past especially for a lot of people who have to use this stuff at work or on systems

13:29.360 --> 13:33.000
They didn't get to make you know get to set up or dictate all of the software on

13:33.640 --> 13:37.080
Even if you don't like system D or especially if you don't like system D

13:37.600 --> 13:40.320
I don't there's a lot of people who didn't like sys sys5

13:41.040 --> 13:44.640
RC in it kind of thing you still had to use it. You still have to know how to do it

13:44.640 --> 13:49.840
I never loved upstart had to learn how to use it. So from that angle, I think this blog is just a great post

13:49.840 --> 13:54.160
You know, it's like a field guide. It won't teach you all the theory. It's not a man page necessarily

13:54.160 --> 13:59.280
But if you just like I'm on the system, I need to disable services. I need to edit this unit file

13:59.800 --> 14:04.640
Boom, here you go. You don't have to read anything written by Leonard. So you don't have to like

14:05.280 --> 14:09.160
Strangle anyone or erupt into a ball of hatred and confusion

14:09.160 --> 14:13.800
No, my friends just head over to tie blog here. I think it's really handy

14:13.800 --> 14:17.440
I I can think of some people in my life that I will definitely be handing this out to just as like

14:18.000 --> 14:24.680
Don't hate it. I'm not saying it's the best thing ever does come with your system now. Here's the system D cheat sheet. Exactly. Yes

14:26.040 --> 14:30.600
Are you a system D person on your Linux box there? Yeah, I don't have a problem with system D

14:30.600 --> 14:32.600
I actually kind of like it because

14:33.200 --> 14:36.520
It's very easy to look at the unit files and see what what's going on

14:36.520 --> 14:40.040
It's very easy to look at the unit files and see what what the hell is going on

14:40.640 --> 14:44.080
Which I did not find that to be the case with sysv in it. Mm-hmm

14:44.800 --> 14:46.120
because

14:46.120 --> 14:48.560
Sometimes those were very complicated scripts

14:49.160 --> 14:52.840
No, you know, I think I think that's true. There's a lot of the very as as he points out

14:52.840 --> 14:54.520
There's a lot of very legitimate

14:54.520 --> 14:58.200
You know problems with system D things where especially experienced

14:58.640 --> 15:02.160
Sysadmins experience Linux users or developers don't like they lose control

15:02.160 --> 15:08.520
They do things in a stupid way or dangerous way or insecure way, but I will say from the casual user

15:08.520 --> 15:13.600
It's pretty easy, especially when like I have one. I have an executable. I'd like it to run as a service

15:14.680 --> 15:18.980
Done, you know, there are other in systems that I should point out here that can do that

15:18.980 --> 15:22.780
Just as easily as not a unique feature to system D, but it is a it is a benefit

15:22.780 --> 15:26.480
I do also appreciate system, you know system control status on a program

15:26.480 --> 15:29.480
It will actually show you if it's running or not gives you an excerpt from its logs

15:29.480 --> 15:34.120
It's a pretty nice little drill down on a system. If you don't, you know, I will say also from a casual users perspective

15:34.640 --> 15:37.120
The logging system is less straightforward

15:37.960 --> 15:44.840
Yeah, that's for sure. Like, you know with sysv. You can just go and look at a log file, but with

15:45.920 --> 15:50.800
System D you you have like six different commands to get different sets of logs that tell you different things

15:51.480 --> 15:54.600
Yeah, yes, that's certainly true. There are there are definitely

15:54.600 --> 16:00.320
Disadvantages and advantages to the journal and I think that's probably one of the most controversial pieces of system D

16:00.320 --> 16:05.280
I will say I think both however are better than upstart. I really do not like upstart

16:05.280 --> 16:09.640
I have there's so many upstart scripts that I've just never gotten to work and gave up on and

16:10.040 --> 16:13.480
Actually reinstall the dis a different distro just so I didn't have to use upstart

16:14.240 --> 16:20.960
Wow, that is dedication. I mean, I think upstart had a lot of good, you know, a lot of good things going for it

16:20.960 --> 16:23.360
It was obvious. It was modernization. It was advancement

16:23.360 --> 16:27.720
Yeah, but at the same time it was very it seemed very easy to break to me

16:27.720 --> 16:32.080
Yeah, and it didn't quite I didn't enjoy the interface to it very much and it was yeah

16:32.440 --> 16:35.920
At least on the systems I used especially around like a 1204

16:36.120 --> 16:41.360
Period and it's kind of awkwardly integrated and confusing and the documentation for it wasn't very clear either

16:41.800 --> 16:45.760
Yeah, I felt like one of those things where it was an awkward stepchild where it could have been the future

16:45.760 --> 16:50.560
But then before it really got to the point of being polished and used widely system

16:50.560 --> 16:53.520
Yes, exactly. I think that's the perfect

16:54.400 --> 16:55.520
phrasing

16:55.520 --> 16:58.500
Okay. Well enough about that because we certainly don't need a flame war today

16:59.040 --> 17:01.480
Well, unless the beard once won he gets what he wants

17:03.400 --> 17:09.360
Still in the topic of interesting things complex things explained well or questionably well, perhaps

17:10.320 --> 17:14.600
We've got over on Kushal Das's blog. We've got a piece about

17:15.360 --> 17:16.880
encrypting drives

17:16.880 --> 17:20.720
With Lux. So if you're not familiar, you know encrypting hard drives

17:20.720 --> 17:24.080
It's a common step that you see all the time now, especially on smartphones

17:24.440 --> 17:30.040
Maybe on laptops a lot of installers even these days will make it pretty easy for you to get started

17:32.240 --> 17:35.800
And this article I think is just a nice he's got some good pictures here that kind of

17:36.160 --> 17:39.460
Sketch out some of the concepts that you're you're going to run into

17:39.960 --> 17:45.760
Starts off write it off with an X AD X e X K CD. Excuse me comic, which is you know, a

17:45.760 --> 17:51.760
Classics, you know, you know, he knows what he's talking about in that regard, but it's basically just a you know

17:51.760 --> 17:58.280
A breakdown over you know, what is Lux its Linux unified key setup is a disk. It's a disk encryption specification

17:58.600 --> 18:00.280
first introduced by

18:00.280 --> 18:04.080
2004 by Clemens fruit with fruit worth. That's fun to say

18:04.720 --> 18:09.800
notice the word specification instead of trying to implement something of its own

18:10.360 --> 18:14.160
Lux is a standard way of doing drive encryption across tools and distributions

18:14.160 --> 18:20.280
You can even use drives from Windows using the LibreCrypt application that I actually did not know that's near to me

18:21.260 --> 18:24.880
So he kind of just goes through it this in this tutorial. He's using USB sticks

18:25.060 --> 18:27.660
Which may be more practical for you know, a lot of people you're not

18:28.360 --> 18:33.240
Not everyone has a laptop or a computer. They can just like I'm gonna wipe the disk play with encrypting it

18:33.960 --> 18:35.440
I

18:35.440 --> 18:40.400
would suggest maybe stay tuned for some of our sponsors later and we'll have solutions for that as well, but

18:40.400 --> 18:45.600
Virtual machines USB sticks. That's a great. That's a great way to do it

18:45.980 --> 18:52.840
He does have some very diligent notes here about you know, execute things with caution. You will be erasing your hard drives. Watch out

18:54.480 --> 18:57.280
But otherwise, it's just kind of a it's just a great explanation

18:57.280 --> 19:01.360
It walks you through things and hold your hands in ways that things like the arch wiki

19:01.440 --> 19:06.120
Well, it may have more detail may have more technical specifications or examples

19:06.120 --> 19:10.760
it's not necessarily for the first-timer it can be if you're an experienced first-timer, but I

19:11.440 --> 19:15.000
Remember, you know way back in the day when I was first playing with encryption and you're kind of like well

19:15.000 --> 19:20.240
What what's happening here when it's not like one command you're like trying to piece all of the pieces together. I

19:21.040 --> 19:26.300
Don't know it can be complicated. So I think I would have I would have really appreciated a guide like this say eight years ago

19:27.180 --> 19:33.840
Do you encrypt much over there? You got BitLocker on all your Windows systems? No, I actually don't encrypt anything

19:33.840 --> 19:37.200
I don't really have much that I feel I need to secure. Mm-hmm

19:38.480 --> 19:42.640
Anything I think needs to be secure is not on a computer

19:43.840 --> 19:47.200
Interesting a hard copy man. Well, I mean

19:47.760 --> 19:51.560
Nobody can hack into your stuff and steal your data if it's not there

19:51.680 --> 19:55.940
That's true. And I suppose you're not you're not too worried about the physical security aspect here

19:56.080 --> 19:59.960
Yeah, no, no one's breaking into the studio for your precious secrets

19:59.960 --> 20:04.060
If they want they got to go through me and if they go through me, I'm probably dead and don't care

20:04.320 --> 20:08.400
Most of it I think they're after is that large photo collection of the beard that you have?

20:08.400 --> 20:11.040
No, yeah, various beard shots profile pictures. It's

20:11.680 --> 20:15.920
It's highly sought after it is highly sought after. All right. What about you guys mumble room?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.920
You guys have been pretty quiet over there anyone

20:18.320 --> 20:22.440
Play with Lux or any other forms of encryption that they want to talk about. I think it's becoming

20:23.040 --> 20:28.600
Increasingly popular increasingly used and now that people people seem to trust Libre vault at least a little bit

20:28.600 --> 20:30.600
and

20:31.480 --> 20:35.120
Been using it a fair bit. I mean it'd be more of a solution

20:35.120 --> 20:42.640
I was literally talking someone in IRC last night in the JB IRC about like they wanted something that works on Linux and Windows and

20:43.240 --> 20:50.080
Let's would work except for the Windows set apart. So bad. I'm not sure because I just lost some

20:51.000 --> 20:55.880
Some keys, so I'm not sure if I'm gonna be Lux again. I'm debating it

20:55.880 --> 21:02.800
Yeah, no that makes sense, you know, I've I've I've had some friends in that in that position as well where if you don't do

21:02.800 --> 21:04.800
it all the time if

21:04.920 --> 21:10.600
You're unfamiliar with it. If you aren't, you know, you've got yourself in a situation. We have a system that you don't necessarily understand how to

21:11.360 --> 21:12.800
administer

21:12.800 --> 21:14.800
Well, then you can you can lose data

21:14.800 --> 21:16.720
You can lock yourself out and you know

21:16.720 --> 21:20.640
You don't have a cloud cloud provider that you can call up and be like hey, I lost my key

21:20.640 --> 21:23.400
Can you guys use your back door and get into my stuff for me?

21:23.400 --> 21:26.480
When you do it this way, that's just not an option

21:27.480 --> 21:28.480
I

21:28.480 --> 21:34.640
Saw some some points here though. I guess no no disks has gotten a lot better in recent days at you know

21:34.640 --> 21:39.160
Including encryption support. So there are a lot of gooey options as well for people who want

21:39.720 --> 21:42.520
Encryption they want the security of it, but they don't necessarily want to master

21:43.200 --> 21:45.200
Running all this stuff to Crip setup

21:45.400 --> 21:47.800
Managing their Crip tab all of that stuff on the command line

21:47.800 --> 21:51.480
I can realize can be done even some people or just extra administrative overhead that you know

21:51.480 --> 21:53.480
That's not really what they're trying to do

21:53.720 --> 21:58.520
But hopefully and as the author notes, you know, hopefully this post encourages people to use encrypted drives more

21:59.160 --> 22:04.760
All of his drives are encrypted. Most of mine are not on my current system because I just reformat it, but

22:05.640 --> 22:12.200
It is something I try to do on sensitive systems or on laptops, especially when I can and you can use Lux encrypted drives

22:12.200 --> 22:18.520
With Windows now, can't you? I believe that's possible via I think it's Libre Crip

22:18.520 --> 22:23.880
Yeah, I believe that's true. Yeah, and that's actually what the author notes here. I have not tried that

22:24.520 --> 22:27.440
Yeah me either, but that would actually be awesome

22:27.440 --> 22:32.280
Yeah, because then you've got a cross-platform solution as long as you don't have a Mac. That's open-source

22:32.600 --> 22:38.520
Well, you can probably get it working on the Mac. Yeah, you probably could yeah, that's that's probably true

22:39.720 --> 22:41.720
Okay

22:41.720 --> 22:46.120
I'm using BitLocker on Windows, haven't used open-source last year

22:46.120 --> 22:50.840
I had some problems with it, but Microsoft helped me solve it and for Ubuntu

22:50.840 --> 22:55.080
I'm using whatever is standard when you press encrypts in the Ubuntu Mati installer

22:55.720 --> 22:59.640
Oh, see, there you go. I think that might actually be like I would imagine so

22:59.640 --> 23:03.240
Yeah, unless it's only doing the user stuff, but I don't think anything does that anymore

23:03.960 --> 23:08.760
Nah, I know that used to be the styles like you could have your own little encrypted, you know, home dir. Yeah

23:09.640 --> 23:12.680
But I think those technologies were largely proven not to be secure

23:12.680 --> 23:15.320
Makes sense. Okay, so moving on

23:16.520 --> 23:22.680
Do you ever have slow systems, you know systems that you're just not happy with their performance and you're struggling to understand why maybe

23:22.680 --> 23:24.680
JBots not not

23:24.680 --> 23:26.680
Doing titles as fast as it should

23:27.000 --> 23:32.520
It's that memory leak Wes. Why are you gonna call me out? I'm sorry. It's not your fault. You can blame someone else

23:32.520 --> 23:36.120
It's a Ruby's fault. Yeah, it was whoever coded that part of the code. Yeah

23:36.680 --> 23:38.680
Just you know, not me. Certainly not me

23:38.680 --> 23:44.840
Well, our friend Julia Evans who is maybe the one of the masters of explaining complicated things. Well

23:45.720 --> 23:47.720
Just got a guide for you

23:48.200 --> 23:53.900
Uh linux tracing systems and how they fit together. So everyone knows we don't have detrace

23:55.560 --> 23:56.760
It sucks

23:56.760 --> 24:00.760
It sucked since like the mid-2000s or whenever detrace was first released

24:01.240 --> 24:04.280
We've always wanted it. We haven't quite had it and there just hasn't been

24:04.280 --> 24:08.360
There hasn't been like a you know, the solution for that on linux

24:09.640 --> 24:12.600
But a lot of workloads are on linux a lot of our systems, you know

24:12.600 --> 24:16.920
Especially here at the show like you you want to be able to have insight you want to be able to understand your production system

24:16.920 --> 24:18.920
You want to be able to troubleshoot them?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.200
So I think this is a great guide. There's been a lot of developments in the recent years

24:22.200 --> 24:27.320
There's a lot of different systems that have a lot of overlap and I think Julia does a great job of talking about

24:28.360 --> 24:32.840
You know, what's what are the things that are going on in Linux that are going on in Linux?

24:32.840 --> 24:35.640
You know, what's what are these? You know, there's strace

24:36.200 --> 24:40.280
ltrace kprobes tracepoints uprobes ftrace perf

24:40.980 --> 24:42.360
ebbf

24:42.360 --> 24:44.360
That's a lot

24:44.680 --> 24:46.680
Of things. Mm-hmm

24:47.000 --> 24:51.240
I mean that's kind of that's crazy. So she's been doing some work. She went to uh papers we love

24:51.880 --> 24:53.560
uh and uh

24:53.560 --> 24:57.640
hung out in in montreal where I guess lgtng comes from

24:57.640 --> 25:02.280
And she's been working on trying to understand how all of these can fit together

25:03.800 --> 25:12.440
So you can split linux tracing systems into data sources where the tracing data comes from and mechanisms for collecting data

25:13.160 --> 25:16.360
For these sources an example of this would be something like ftrace

25:17.160 --> 25:22.920
And tracing front ends the tool you actually interact with to collect and analyze data

25:23.080 --> 25:26.200
The overall picture is still kind of fragmented and confusing. Amen

25:26.200 --> 25:31.000
Especially since some of these also fit into multiple categories like ftrace. Yes, exactly

25:31.320 --> 25:35.000
But it's at least a more approachable fragmented confusing system

25:35.640 --> 25:40.840
Uh, so here we have a summary in pictures and I just love this. She has great pictures. I really appreciate that

25:41.320 --> 25:43.320
Let's see if we can't

25:43.720 --> 25:45.720
Something like that. There we go. So

25:45.720 --> 25:51.880
Linux tracing systems and how they fit together for data sources over there. You've got kprobes which are basically kernel functions

25:51.960 --> 25:53.960
You've got kernel tracepoints

25:53.960 --> 26:00.920
Uprobes which are user space c functions usdt detrace probes and lttng user space tracing

26:01.640 --> 26:05.880
So these are ways that we can actually collect data inside of the kernel and in linux systems

26:06.120 --> 26:09.880
Then you've got ways to extract data which include perf which actually perf is a great tool

26:09.960 --> 26:14.780
If you haven't used it, you should definitely try it out ftrace lttng system tap sysdig

26:15.800 --> 26:19.560
And ebpf ebpf you may be familiar with it's been worked on. Um

26:19.560 --> 26:27.500
A lot by some of the people over at netflix brendan gregg in particular who's done great work on linux profiling and performance

26:27.960 --> 26:30.520
In general, so I definitely recommend checking him out if you haven't already

26:31.160 --> 26:35.880
And then you can see a lot of the overlap right here as as rika was talking about in the front ends category

26:35.880 --> 26:41.000
You've got things like perf ftrace catapult kernel shark. Actually i've never heard of that one trace command

26:41.000 --> 26:48.940
Bcc sysdig lttng and system tap. Well, i'm instantly excited about kernel shark just because yeah shark

26:50.220 --> 26:52.220
I like that a lot

26:52.620 --> 26:56.220
So, you know this uh, this article goes on and on because it's awesome

26:56.300 --> 26:58.940
And there's a ton of great pictures and they really are worth

26:59.180 --> 27:02.540
Thousands of words in this case and actually the pictures are like 90 words

27:02.620 --> 27:07.980
So you can tell that it's a kind of complicated, uh, but I think if you're at all interested in this stuff

27:07.980 --> 27:12.860
It's a great place to start it can maybe tell you some of the tools that you should look in personally

27:13.420 --> 27:14.780
um

27:14.780 --> 27:16.780
There's a lot of tools that are just not

27:17.500 --> 27:19.900
It feels really inaccessible sometimes I guess

27:20.300 --> 27:21.820
um, but

27:21.820 --> 27:23.100
I've recently been upgrading, you know

27:23.100 --> 27:28.300
Been able to work on more recent systems that have newer kernels and can take advantage of some of these ebpf tools

27:28.460 --> 27:33.820
And it's awesome. And in particular the bcc project has a lot of pre-compiled pre

27:34.300 --> 27:36.300
pre-built scripts that you can use to measure things like

27:36.300 --> 27:41.500
Like um run queue latency or you can you know, see where see where things are blocking you can

27:42.220 --> 27:45.980
Chart mysql long running queries based on query execution time

27:46.460 --> 27:49.580
Or even one of the ones i've used just to troubleshoot some systems that I was you know

27:49.980 --> 27:52.540
A system I didn't build but I had to go in and diagnose

27:52.940 --> 27:55.980
Uh, they've got one called exec snoop, which is great and you just run it

27:56.300 --> 27:58.940
And it reports everything that gets executed on your system

27:59.100 --> 28:05.100
Well, they specifically say here that one of the newest and most powerful ways is to write a small ebpf program

28:05.100 --> 28:07.820
Then ask linux to attach it to a kprobe

28:08.620 --> 28:11.980
Slash u probe slash tracepoint and then the ep

28:12.620 --> 28:18.460
Or ebpf program will send the data to user space with ftrace perf or bpf maps

28:19.100 --> 28:21.660
Yeah, exactly. So I mean I think that exactly covers how

28:22.520 --> 28:26.060
Confusing that is and why i'm glad there are guides like this

28:26.300 --> 28:30.620
But like it's getting a lot better and there's a lot more options

28:30.700 --> 28:32.940
Especially like just between perf and ebpf

28:32.940 --> 28:35.580
Like there's just a lot of ways that you can get information that will help you

28:36.140 --> 28:38.460
Start on this path. It does seem like a lot of them

28:40.060 --> 28:44.620
End up glomming around ebpf. So maybe that's where you should start

28:46.380 --> 28:51.420
Yeah, I think so and I think that's where a lot of the more recent uh momentum has been um

28:52.300 --> 28:54.300
So definitely worth checking out brendan gregg

28:54.700 --> 28:59.500
This article links to there's got a ton of there's got a ton of great stuff there continual development

28:59.500 --> 29:04.140
So go check it out go profile some of your uh systems. Let us know how that goes

29:04.220 --> 29:06.620
I think i'd be curious to see this evolve and it's great that we're finally

29:07.180 --> 29:11.900
You know with ebpf and some of these more recent developments. We're finally in the place where we can build things that

29:12.700 --> 29:17.020
Olumos and solaris have had for a long time and and freebsd and osx even

29:17.500 --> 29:20.380
So we can finally be in that category and hopefully that goes a long way to

29:20.620 --> 29:23.900
Making people more confident to run serious workloads on linux systems

29:23.900 --> 29:26.140
I don't think there's any dearth of that now, but you know

29:26.140 --> 29:30.380
There's old school admins and holdouts that are rightfully so or like well, I don't have the same kind of insight that i've had

29:30.460 --> 29:31.820
on other systems, but

29:31.820 --> 29:34.380
Uh on recent kernels, that's finally changing

29:35.980 --> 29:39.260
All right, well keeping with this theme

29:41.740 --> 29:45.500
You like complicated things but you need them you need them explained well

29:45.900 --> 29:49.020
Just pop on over to our first sponsor tonight

29:49.580 --> 29:53.740
And that's our friends over at linux academy. Head on over to linux academy dot com slash unplugged

29:53.740 --> 29:57.180
There you will find basically the premiere place

29:58.060 --> 30:03.020
To learn about linux and related technologies. They do it differently than pretty much anywhere else

30:03.020 --> 30:05.340
They're not going to teach you how to maintain your garden

30:05.820 --> 30:09.580
You're not going to learn how to repair your car, but you are going to learn from linux

30:10.060 --> 30:14.380
Experts industry insiders people who've been doing this for years and who are passionate about linux

30:14.940 --> 30:20.700
You're going to learn what you need to know to to get a job to pass exams and to be prepared to use linux

30:20.700 --> 30:25.420
In the real world. Yeah, I will say I haven't used linux academy personally

30:25.500 --> 30:29.740
But I have recommended it to some people that were looking to get into the it field

30:30.220 --> 30:34.540
And they took some courses and ended up getting a job. That's awesome

30:35.100 --> 30:37.100
I'm i'm kind of consistently

30:37.420 --> 30:39.420
impressed that

30:39.420 --> 30:44.160
People that you know, I don't that don't watch these shows that uh don't seem particularly

30:44.700 --> 30:46.220
hip or even you know

30:46.220 --> 30:50.300
They've been doing this for years. That doesn't seem like they really necessarily even need linux training necessarily

30:50.300 --> 30:51.020
but

30:51.020 --> 30:58.220
linux academy has gotten a great reputation and and totally deserves it because it's a great reference and it's

30:58.540 --> 31:01.340
Employees are starting to employers are starting to recognize that linux

31:01.820 --> 31:07.420
Linux academy is serious serious business if you can go get some certifications or go take some courses and show that off

31:08.460 --> 31:15.020
Employers understand that that means something that means that you're a passionate about this and b you've gotten really good instruction up-to-date instruction

31:15.020 --> 31:19.660
You didn't learn on some outdated six years ago distro that just won't apply anymore

31:19.660 --> 31:25.900
You already know about system d you can do that and it supports some of the latest stuff like go check out their courses

31:26.380 --> 31:28.380
It's awesome

31:28.460 --> 31:30.060
They make it super easy to get started

31:30.060 --> 31:34.780
They have things like a you know a scheduler so you can understand how long some of these things are going to take for you

31:35.020 --> 31:39.820
If you don't have a lot of time, they've got nuggets which are just little tiny things little facts

31:39.900 --> 31:42.700
I mean some of them are a little bit long. Some of them are like five minutes of them are like an hour

31:42.700 --> 31:48.540
They're fascinating and it's a great way to just you know, you have a little time to kill you got stuck in the train

31:49.420 --> 31:55.260
You're on your way to work and someone else is driving a nugget is perfect to increase your linux knowledge get things started

31:55.980 --> 31:57.260
If you take a look at all their courses

31:57.260 --> 32:02.380
you'll see that they really have pretty much any linux thing that you want to know and what makes them so different is

32:02.940 --> 32:05.500
You don't have to do this on your system. You don't have to set up all this stuff

32:05.580 --> 32:09.520
You don't have to worry about paying for that. It's all included and when you go to linuxacademy.com

32:09.520 --> 32:12.560
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged you'll get a seven day free trial

32:12.800 --> 32:15.840
Well, and even if you're trying to get hired at an employer

32:15.920 --> 32:20.640
For example that doesn't know about linux academy because they're old and behind the times and they they suck

32:20.880 --> 32:22.880
But you're trying to get hired there. Anyway

32:23.200 --> 32:25.280
You still get the certifications and on top of that

32:25.760 --> 32:29.760
It it becomes pretty obvious that you have a good foundation of knowledge

32:30.000 --> 32:34.960
Even if they don't know what linux academy is. Yeah, right exactly and it shows that

32:34.960 --> 32:38.720
It shows that you know what you're what you're doing and I think it makes it, you know

32:38.720 --> 32:41.840
You'll be backed up because employers can go to linux academy and check out

32:42.480 --> 32:47.280
What they teach and it'll I think it'll instantly show them that oh these guys know what they're doing

32:47.680 --> 32:51.120
Plus they do things like, you know, they customize it. You're trying to learn about a red hat system

32:51.200 --> 32:53.440
They'll make sure that the the vms they spin up for you

32:53.680 --> 32:58.560
Are they the the distribution that you want and all the courseware automatically customizes for that?

32:58.560 --> 33:02.960
So you'll be running the right packaging commands. You'll be running the right, you know, init commands. It doesn't matter

33:02.960 --> 33:08.400
They've accounted for that. They make it super easy. And I know for me. I use it a lot both learning chef and

33:09.360 --> 33:11.760
working with aws resources I hadn't used before because

33:12.560 --> 33:17.040
I mean sometimes to model some of this aws stuff you have to spin up your a whole vpc for yourself

33:17.120 --> 33:20.080
You've got a ton of stuff. You're getting databases. You're getting load balancers

33:20.720 --> 33:23.280
That's a lot of money to spend just to learn how to do something

33:23.840 --> 33:27.760
On your own time with linux academy you pay them. They manage all those resources

33:28.080 --> 33:30.640
They help you do it and they make sure you don't waste your time

33:30.640 --> 33:34.320
You don't waste your money and you just get the best educational bang for your buck

33:34.400 --> 33:36.800
So go on over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

33:37.760 --> 33:39.360
Get your learn on

33:39.360 --> 33:40.400
I agree

33:40.400 --> 33:42.400
beautiful

33:42.560 --> 33:45.040
Oh linux academy, you really do make things a lot

33:45.600 --> 33:49.040
Easier i'm glad they exist. It's kind of funny to think about like a couple years ago. They didn't and

33:50.080 --> 33:51.920
What what would you do?

33:51.920 --> 33:57.360
I don't know. You'd have to you'd have to go learn from some some worse resource. I think I don't I don't want that

33:57.920 --> 33:59.600
all right, so

33:59.600 --> 34:01.120
Now we move on

34:01.120 --> 34:02.640
Yeah, read man pages. I think that's about it

34:02.640 --> 34:03.120
ww

34:03.120 --> 34:05.920
You read man pages, which is not a bad way to do it if you have the stomach for that

34:05.920 --> 34:10.800
But I think it you know, it helps lower the boundaries. It makes it more digestible more digestible. Mmm

34:12.000 --> 34:13.200
tasty

34:13.200 --> 34:17.920
Plus you can't deny. There's some man pages that are pretty crappy. Yeah

34:20.480 --> 34:26.080
Like I love man pages, but some of them not so great. Yeah, exactly could could be info pages

34:26.080 --> 34:30.080
Oh, I like that irc room colonel panic. You're brilliant

34:30.800 --> 34:32.800
okay, so

34:32.800 --> 34:36.480
Up next we've got our updates section and this is just I thought we'd just take you know

34:36.560 --> 34:41.120
Not nothing crazy long, but we just talked about a couple things we've talked about before on the show. So first up

34:42.400 --> 34:47.840
How microsoft brought sql server to linux now sql server is not something I actually have had to use

34:48.320 --> 34:53.520
Very much. What about you? Nope, I've thankfully managed to avoid very much investment in the

34:53.520 --> 34:58.960
You know in the dot net stack, but I know a lot of people who do maybe that's what they learned in school

34:59.440 --> 35:03.200
Um sql server is actually I mean legitimately a really good product

35:03.200 --> 35:06.400
It's a great sql server if you have the money to pay for it or you work somewhere that does

35:06.880 --> 35:08.080
um

35:08.080 --> 35:08.960
And I know for a long time

35:08.960 --> 35:10.960
They've had a lot of features that people have relied on

35:11.280 --> 35:15.040
So it's interesting this article just kind of explains some of the explains some of the history

35:15.440 --> 35:19.360
You know back in 2016 when microsoft announced that sql server would run on linux

35:19.360 --> 35:24.160
The news came kind of as a major surprise to users and pundits alike. But over the course of last year

35:24.480 --> 35:26.480
microsoft support for linux

35:26.480 --> 35:28.480
And some would say open source in general

35:29.040 --> 35:34.640
Has come into clear focus and the company's mission now seems to be all about bringing its tools to wherever

35:35.200 --> 35:38.080
Its users are so they first launched this back in

35:39.760 --> 35:43.600
Sorry, excuse me. They today launched the first release of sql server 2017

35:43.600 --> 35:48.960
Which will be the first version to run on windows linux and in docker containers. I

35:49.760 --> 35:55.680
It I think that kind of shows that microsoft's really they are trying to pivot to this cloud first mentality containers

35:56.480 --> 35:58.880
They they use the word docker all the time

35:58.880 --> 36:03.120
Now the docker container alone has already seen more than one million polls and I think they get like, you know

36:03.120 --> 36:06.000
they really are trying to target developers with that like if I can just

36:06.800 --> 36:11.120
I can already go like docker run mongo db if I can do the same thing for sql server

36:11.120 --> 36:13.520
Maybe i'll start considering it. Yeah, exactly

36:14.400 --> 36:20.160
Do you use docker much at all in your development work? Uh, not really. I I just run it in vpss

36:20.480 --> 36:22.480
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah

36:22.720 --> 36:26.400
I think I think a lot of this too like they they talk here like, you know talking to enterprises

36:27.120 --> 36:33.360
It became clear that doing this it was necessary, you know, we were forcing customers to use windows as their platform of choice

36:33.840 --> 36:34.640
um

36:34.640 --> 36:39.920
And it's funny to think about because in another incarnation of microsoft that probably would have been seen as something positive

36:39.920 --> 36:44.000
But the company's strategy today, you know, it's it's quite different

36:44.480 --> 36:46.800
It's it's interesting to see them actually think about you know

36:46.800 --> 36:51.040
They acknowledge now that linux kind of dominates the server world and they have to

36:51.280 --> 36:54.240
They have to play ball if they want to get a piece of that money, which they really do

36:54.960 --> 37:01.600
Um, so this article kind of just continues on they've got some some nice graphics here kind of explaining how they managed to

37:02.160 --> 37:06.020
You know change the abstraction layers change the architecture or work with the existing architecture

37:06.020 --> 37:10.580
Of sql server to make it run on windows and linux and to do so really well

37:10.660 --> 37:14.020
I mean, I think it shows like microsoft's got a lot of developer muscle

37:14.500 --> 37:18.820
And when they actually pour it into something like this or similarly like the windows subsystem

37:19.380 --> 37:22.580
They produce some interesting things even if i'm not personally using them

37:23.860 --> 37:28.500
Have you used that uh subsystem much? Do you use that on your your windows hosts?

37:28.580 --> 37:30.020
I've used a little bit

37:30.020 --> 37:36.500
But I ended up not using as much as I would like because since I do do a lot of my development on vps's

37:36.900 --> 37:39.300
It would be nice to have the linux subsystem there

37:39.860 --> 37:40.820
but

37:40.820 --> 37:42.180
I can't

37:42.180 --> 37:45.940
Do sshfs because it requires a kernel module. Oh

37:46.660 --> 37:47.860
so

37:47.860 --> 37:49.860
It became pretty useless. Yeah

37:50.020 --> 37:57.220
Your like existing workflows no longer really worked. Well if you're interested sql server for linux should reach general availability later this year

37:57.220 --> 38:03.300
Um, but even today there are some people using it in production. So i'm sure we'll hear some more about this story soon

38:04.980 --> 38:10.900
Speaking of another somewhat foreigner in our in our midst. Did you know rikai that

38:12.100 --> 38:16.260
Zfs is the best file system at least for now. Yeah

38:16.820 --> 38:21.300
Okay, well i'm not this is not this is not news news to you at all. No, is it?

38:21.300 --> 38:26.900
Zfs is it's the best option. It's just too bad that we have to use it via dkms on linux

38:27.300 --> 38:32.740
Because that makes it a lot worse. Hey, unless you're running the most recent abundance true

38:32.980 --> 38:38.500
They've got that should compiled already for you, but i've also not seen that work. So

38:40.100 --> 38:42.100
I haven't messed with it much admittedly, but

38:42.740 --> 38:45.940
Yeah, no, that's fair. Well, uh, stephen foskett

38:46.660 --> 38:48.660
over at foskets.net

38:48.660 --> 38:55.780
He acknowledges zfs is the best file system, but he starts out with zfs should have been great, but I kind of hate it

38:56.580 --> 39:01.460
Zfs seems to be trapped in the past before it was sidelined. It is the cool storage project of choice

39:01.460 --> 39:07.300
It's it's inflexible. It lacks modern flash integration and it's not directly supported by most operating systems

39:08.020 --> 39:12.580
But I put all of my valuable data on zfs because it simply offers

39:13.380 --> 39:16.180
The best level of data protection in a small home

39:16.180 --> 39:18.680
Small office or home office environment

39:19.620 --> 39:21.620
Here's why

39:21.700 --> 39:23.700
One does not simply return zero

39:24.340 --> 39:29.460
Instead of one. Yeah, I mean that that that is that is pretty much pretty much how it works, right?

39:29.460 --> 39:32.500
I mean you need a file system that has checksums you need file systems that

39:32.820 --> 39:37.780
are designed with failure in mind and plan for that ahead of time and zfs is really the

39:38.100 --> 39:41.940
Ultimate example of a file system with those kind of thinkings designed right into it

39:41.940 --> 39:46.280
Right into it. Uh, so he goes in, you know talks about the zfs revolution circa 2006

39:47.140 --> 39:48.340
um

39:48.340 --> 39:50.020
When it first appeared in like 2005

39:50.020 --> 39:55.220
It was absolutely with the times right copy on copy on riot had been a research thing that was now starting to see

39:55.780 --> 39:57.460
general deployment

39:57.460 --> 40:02.580
um, but he does kind of talk about some of the things he'd like to see be improved with zfs or

40:03.060 --> 40:07.860
Things he'd like to see in a you know an even newer more modern file system. Mm-hmm

40:08.420 --> 40:10.420
I know there's a lot of complaints about

40:10.420 --> 40:14.100
It's not that you can't expand it. You just have to be a little bit careful or plan with how you'll be

40:14.260 --> 40:18.740
You know expanding your arrays, um or building them. It's certainly not necessarily for the

40:20.180 --> 40:24.660
Casual admin if you're going to be administering a lot of storage, I think you can use zfs just fine

40:24.660 --> 40:30.340
There's a lot of fud out there about memory consumption or difficult, you know difficulty to administer

40:30.420 --> 40:32.420
I think really actually the tools are really good

40:32.580 --> 40:33.460
but

40:33.460 --> 40:37.700
There are just you get to a point where you have enough data and you have to or enough redundancy or not enough redundancy

40:37.700 --> 40:42.660
And you have to do things, you know appropriately zfs does have somewhat high memory consumption

40:42.660 --> 40:46.420
But that's because it's doing a lot more than pretty much any other file system out there

40:46.980 --> 40:48.980
Yeah, yeah, exactly

40:49.220 --> 40:54.820
So they kind of talk about you know 2017 to 2010 zfs is to derailed and then talk a little bit about the

40:55.460 --> 40:58.260
sun to oracle transition and the changes there

40:59.460 --> 41:02.660
How that all goes wrong then he gets into what's wrong with zfs

41:03.700 --> 41:05.300
today

41:05.300 --> 41:10.660
So, uh, he talks about money remains skeptical of deduplication which hogs expensive ram in the best case scenario

41:11.140 --> 41:13.220
And I do mean expensive. Um

41:14.100 --> 41:19.780
And and goes on a little bit about how you know, he'd like to see a more first clash notion of flash storage

41:20.180 --> 41:24.420
um, you know, there are things you can do things with the zil and l2r caches, but um

41:25.700 --> 41:29.060
There are some limitations there which he gets into so I think it's just an interesting article

41:29.060 --> 41:31.400
He may not agree with all of it. I think his conclusions

41:31.400 --> 41:34.520
Are uh are reasonable for his use cases

41:35.000 --> 41:40.280
But maybe a little bit over exaggerated the point I kind of took away was like look at all the things that zfs has

41:40.280 --> 41:43.000
Got right here the things that we should focus on in the future

41:43.080 --> 41:47.640
Where should we be taking what should we be thinking about for the future file system development because like it's not like we need

41:48.040 --> 41:50.040
the next file system today, but

41:50.440 --> 41:52.680
10 years from now. Are we still going to be able to use zfs?

41:52.760 --> 41:57.000
Will it be feeling a little bit stale? Is it the kind of stuff that we can change especially in the way?

41:57.480 --> 42:00.600
You know incremental change without breaking things but getting new features or at some point

42:00.600 --> 42:05.960
Are we going to actually have to have you know, a new file system design not from scratch necessarily, but you know what I mean?

42:06.520 --> 42:08.520
yeah, I think that the

42:08.760 --> 42:11.960
Your willingness to learn zfs is directly reportionable

42:12.900 --> 42:15.720
Proportional to how much you care about your data

42:17.640 --> 42:20.760
The more you care about your data the more willing you're going to be to learn zfs

42:21.560 --> 42:23.560
yeah, I think that's uh

42:23.560 --> 42:30.200
That's entirely accurate. That's yeah, if you take it seriously, that's kind of it's kind of what you need to know. Yeah

42:31.000 --> 42:36.040
So maybe maybe zfs isn't anything. Um, I will say even you know as the irc rightly points out

42:36.040 --> 42:37.800
It's really not that hard to set up even on linux

42:37.800 --> 42:43.160
You do on a lot of distributions have to compile the kernel module dkms tries to make that nice and easy for you

42:43.800 --> 42:47.000
If I was running it in production, I think I would almost certainly compile

42:47.560 --> 42:50.600
That myself and then ship my own repo that had those pre-built

42:50.600 --> 42:55.720
I know on entergos you can just use zfs as part of the install process

42:56.280 --> 43:01.400
Yeah, you can even install on root. I would not recommend that it often breaks systems

43:02.440 --> 43:04.440
Which it's like you can certainly make it work

43:04.440 --> 43:07.080
Um, but that's the category where it's like, all right

43:07.080 --> 43:11.000
Well, you are now administering this be prepared for failure know how the command line works

43:10.920 --> 43:15.160
Also, I hear that if you want to learn about zfs or if you're having issues with zfs

43:15.400 --> 43:17.880
There's a guy named alan in the jupyter broadcast and chat room

43:17.880 --> 43:21.160
He has no problem receiving any pms

43:21.960 --> 43:25.560
About zfs. You're right like pretty much at any hour of the evening

43:26.040 --> 43:31.320
Zfs problem 24 7. He's like a zfs helpline. Mm-hmm, but then you do have to say

43:31.880 --> 43:37.640
Alan switched me to zfs, right? I think that you have to say that. Yeah when when you go to buy your file system

43:38.120 --> 43:40.760
Is that how it works? Yeah, exactly. Yes

43:41.480 --> 43:43.320
Oh beard

43:43.320 --> 43:46.600
Okay, so maybe maybe zfs isn't your thing. Maybe you're not

43:46.600 --> 43:50.700
You just missed the boat on that one. You're like zfs. That's so 2006

43:50.760 --> 43:57.080
I want something new but obviously butter fs. I just don't it leaves a bad taste on my mouth. I'm not going to talk about it

43:58.040 --> 44:02.840
Really? The only thing we've got going for us. Actually, there's a lot I shouldn't say the only thing but in the linux world

44:03.560 --> 44:05.560
It's our friend kent overstreet

44:06.440 --> 44:07.880
working

44:07.880 --> 44:09.880
On bcash fs. So we've talked about this

44:09.880 --> 44:14.760
It's kind of something we like to highlight occasionally just not not because I think it's going to be necessarily be great

44:14.760 --> 44:19.720
Not because that's necessarily the future but it's one possible future and its development that I like to see

44:20.200 --> 44:21.400
um

44:21.400 --> 44:24.520
There's probably better ways to do it. I'm not saying this is optimal or

44:25.320 --> 44:26.120
Going to be perfect

44:26.120 --> 44:32.200
But kent overstreet has a has a great history of writing good code bcash has proved very fruitful and useful in the kernel

44:32.600 --> 44:33.400
um

44:33.400 --> 44:34.760
And it's just exciting to kind of stay up

44:34.760 --> 44:41.080
You know, I I contribute to his patreon if you guys want to as well. I think linux needs to get over this butter fs thing

44:41.880 --> 44:43.400
There's just so much

44:43.400 --> 44:46.120
The license issue with zfs. We'll see what happens with the bun too

44:46.120 --> 44:53.080
I'm not confident that we'll actually see easy to use or at least as easy as in kernel solutions to zfs anytime soon

44:53.320 --> 44:55.800
But we do need a file system that we can use that's modern

44:56.360 --> 45:02.600
Um, hopefully bcash fs can go at least part of the way there some developments here that I thought were kind of interesting

45:03.560 --> 45:07.960
He's been asked a few times about the potential for porting bcash fs to other operating systems, right?

45:07.960 --> 45:09.480
We were just talking about like, you know

45:09.480 --> 45:13.640
If you can use lux or you know zfs is sometimes something that you can actually use that's very portable

45:13.720 --> 45:16.200
If you can use it on mac and linux for instance

45:16.760 --> 45:17.480
um

45:17.480 --> 45:18.200
but

45:18.200 --> 45:24.440
Nearly about 90 of the bcash fs code already built and runs in user space and is used by bcash fs tools

45:24.680 --> 45:27.480
So the core file system code is more or less structured as a library

45:27.960 --> 45:31.480
And bcash fs tools mostly just implements command line interfaces to it

45:31.560 --> 45:37.400
So what this means is that most of the code is not actually particularly tried tied to the linux kernel

45:37.400 --> 45:39.960
Uh, you know if most of the code already works and where's our space?

45:40.040 --> 45:43.560
We're just we're kind of most of the way there to be able to run it on other operating systems

45:43.960 --> 45:46.440
Well, the problem is the other operating systems

45:47.080 --> 45:51.400
Outside of windows, which will probably never be able to use bcash fs anyway

45:52.200 --> 45:58.520
They already have file systems with these features like apple is starting to roll out apfs or whatever the hell it's called

45:58.600 --> 46:01.560
yep, and which has most of the features of zfs and

46:02.040 --> 46:04.760
The bsds and salaris they already have zfs. So

46:04.760 --> 46:06.760
Why do they care?

46:07.800 --> 46:14.280
I mean not to be mean linux could definitely use it but it's true the portability. Not really

46:14.360 --> 46:16.360
No, I think that would only be you know

46:17.080 --> 46:21.640
If if eventually there were some open source projects that that took up that banner, you know

46:21.720 --> 46:25.640
And then let you I mean it would be nice to have a you know, a nice file system

46:25.800 --> 46:28.680
Yeah cross-platform that wasn't ntfs or fat

46:29.160 --> 46:33.000
Yeah, that makes sense or xfat or ufs all of which have issues

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I mean there isn't really a great

46:35.240 --> 46:38.920
A colonel panic in the chat room says that net bsd could potentially use bcash fs

46:38.920 --> 46:42.920
I guess they don't use zfs for some reason. I don't know. Yeah, that's a good question

46:43.000 --> 46:45.160
We'll have to look into that. I'm not i'm not sure

46:46.120 --> 46:50.440
That would be interesting. I would also love to see more, you know development of the linux of uh, you know

46:50.440 --> 46:54.280
bsc file systems hammer 2 in particular see that used or at least

46:54.280 --> 47:02.520
The potential of it being used on linux. Do you know what license the abfs is under? You know, I don't that's a good question

47:03.000 --> 47:07.560
Let's find out. It'd be interesting if it were open and it could be ported to linux. Yeah

47:09.160 --> 47:11.880
I'm not an apple fanboy by any means but

47:12.520 --> 47:16.680
It's a good technology, right? I mean and they're paying talented developers to work on it

47:16.760 --> 47:21.640
So you can't you can't really ignore that some of which are former zfs developers if I remember correctly. Yeah

47:21.640 --> 47:23.400
Yeah

47:23.400 --> 47:30.200
I don't see. Okay. Well wikipedia doesn't mention the license. Okay, so it's probably proprietary. Yes, I think so

47:31.560 --> 47:32.920
That's unfortunate

47:32.920 --> 47:37.160
We'll see what happens with that. I mean apple definitely does a uh, I mean they open source swift

47:37.240 --> 47:39.720
They open source a lot of stuff. I think they're picking up on

47:41.160 --> 47:45.240
On that this is an important thing to do. So yeah, we'll stay tuned. Um,

47:45.240 --> 47:51.000
Um, hey, there we go. Hey tech map. Thank you. Okay, so there's there's some licensing link there

47:53.400 --> 47:57.640
We'll check that out and have to update the show that seems to be for apfs cloning though

47:57.960 --> 48:01.400
I don't know what that is or how it relates to the direct apfs code base

48:01.480 --> 48:05.720
So it seems to be some sort of example code. Yeah, that makes sense

48:06.360 --> 48:11.640
Yeah f2fs is another contender flash focused. I've used it a little bit but I haven't played with any

48:11.640 --> 48:17.080
You know any of its necessary any any of its features to a large extent that something we'll have to play with more here

48:19.080 --> 48:23.640
Okay, so another update from a project we've talked about before on the show

48:25.160 --> 48:28.700
Wire guard has just gone through formal verification

48:29.800 --> 48:33.960
Of their protocol. So I should stress here. This is not a verification of

48:35.460 --> 48:38.840
Implementations not saying that the code that you run that runs wire guard

48:38.840 --> 48:41.480
Has been verified. No, but it's still important

48:42.200 --> 48:49.240
Um, if you're not familiar with wire guard, it's a you know, a new intended to be hoped to be in kernel vpn solution

48:49.880 --> 48:51.880
for linux, um

48:52.360 --> 48:54.360
There's a lot of issues with the

48:55.000 --> 48:57.960
Complexity of current solutions open vpn is a huge project

48:58.600 --> 49:00.600
Um that has has some known problems

49:01.400 --> 49:06.680
And performance issues ipsec is pretty is pretty great and and reasonably well trusted

49:06.680 --> 49:10.120
But is also very complicated has a large formal spec

49:10.680 --> 49:12.680
uh and

49:12.680 --> 49:17.720
Doesn't deal with key exchange and the key exchange itself is actually quite complicated in many cases. Um, and

49:18.840 --> 49:22.040
It doesn't have easy user land support in linux anyway

49:22.440 --> 49:28.040
Uh, so wire guard aims to have a lot have lower overhead have high performance be simple be built on modern crypto

49:28.360 --> 49:31.080
And work. So this is a first step here. Um,

49:31.080 --> 49:36.200
It's based on noise, which is a modern cryptography framework that you may be familiar with from

49:36.760 --> 49:39.640
um, some some of the other podcasts here as well as

49:40.520 --> 49:42.520
It's used in some of the stuff like from signal

49:43.240 --> 49:45.240
uh, so what they've done here is uh

49:46.440 --> 49:53.800
Yeah, they've they've used a software called a symbolic modeler called tamarin which I had not heard of before but it's called the tamarin prover

49:53.800 --> 49:57.800
It's a security protocol verification tool. It sounds like a spice

49:57.800 --> 50:03.500
It sounds like a spice. It does sound like a spice, but it supports both falsification and unbounded verification

50:04.120 --> 50:11.720
In the symbolic model. So what they were working on here is proving that if implemented correctly the security model around the protocol

50:12.120 --> 50:16.120
Is actually secure. Um, so the paper is a work in pro

50:16.760 --> 50:22.360
Progress, but they are using you know computer aided proof here to try to show that the wire guard protocol is secure

50:22.920 --> 50:25.240
When done properly and that's kind of the first step

50:25.240 --> 50:32.120
Um, it will help audit and conformance of the actual implementation and then it it opens the future for you know, if you want to build

50:32.760 --> 50:37.320
a um a verifiable in like a verifiable programming language something like f star

50:38.040 --> 50:43.800
Um, you could build a wire guard that would be provably correct. Um, this is obviously very important, especially in

50:44.760 --> 50:47.740
Times we see china cracking down on personal vpns

50:48.360 --> 50:53.640
The internet at large is you know more government interest more surveillance more corporate surveillance all of those problems

50:53.640 --> 50:55.640
It's important to have an easy to use

50:55.960 --> 51:01.000
Vpn where you can get security, right or at least understand the security of it or have others understand it

51:01.160 --> 51:07.160
Yeah, that's been designed from the ground up to be easily audible. Yes, exactly not have to go back on this

51:07.240 --> 51:13.000
You know large thing that's been developed for years and try to figure out if it's proved open vpn code base. Yeah

51:13.720 --> 51:16.040
So what do you think of wire guard? Have you used it at all? No

51:17.000 --> 51:19.320
I don't have any uses for a vpn really

51:20.840 --> 51:22.840
Yeah, that's fair. Yeah

51:22.840 --> 51:28.040
I gotta say i'm i'm excited about it. I don't know but it's super easy to set up. I enjoy that it's

51:28.760 --> 51:32.360
They make it really easy to implement with standard linux user space tools

51:32.840 --> 51:34.120
um

51:34.120 --> 51:39.080
And i've got great performance. I mean nothing i'm doing is like super performance critical where open vpn wouldn't work

51:39.160 --> 51:41.640
But this is easier to set up by far than open vpn

51:42.040 --> 51:47.560
Um, yeah, they say that they specifically wanted it to be as easy to set up as ssh. Yeah, exactly

51:47.560 --> 51:53.880
I would say it's it's approximately in that category. Um, and so I think i'll I it's not in the kernel yet

51:54.200 --> 51:59.160
Um, but they do have an up-to-date repo dkms builds it really quick. It's actually a very small module

51:59.160 --> 52:01.160
So it doesn't take ages to build or anything

52:01.640 --> 52:06.520
They say it's even capable of roaming between ip addresses just like mosh. Yeah, and that's the thing

52:06.520 --> 52:09.640
It's like it's really nice. I've been using it for a while now on my laptop and it's

52:10.120 --> 52:13.080
It's one of the better vpn experiences i've had because you don't have to worry about it

52:13.080 --> 52:17.080
I don't have to worry about it. It comes back up wi-fi comes back up. I connect back up to the server

52:17.080 --> 52:22.520
It's kind of amazing how it can handle so much while being so small compared to all the other ones. Yes

52:23.000 --> 52:26.440
I don't I guess they do have the the bonus of being able to

52:26.760 --> 52:31.160
Start much later than the other ones and learn from all their mistakes. Yes, it seems thoroughly modern and

52:32.040 --> 52:33.880
You know, I don't advise production use of it

52:33.880 --> 52:35.720
I'm not saying that you should go ahead and deploy it everywhere

52:35.720 --> 52:41.640
But it's definitely something i'm i'm trying to keep track of and i'm excited to see future development. They do say that they

52:41.640 --> 52:47.560
Make conservative and reasonable choices and that they've already been reviewed by cryptographers. Yes. So there's already been some work

52:47.560 --> 52:53.000
They're trying it's it feels really like they're trying to do it trying to get to that the right part where you can trust them

52:53.480 --> 52:55.480
Yes, exactly

52:55.960 --> 53:02.360
We'll see though. So while i'm using this project, of course, I need somewhere to like put the end of my vpn, right?

53:02.440 --> 53:07.160
That's like a thing that you need or I hear is great at tor, you know tor works pretty well. I could use my house

53:07.160 --> 53:12.600
Uh, but a lot of times I choose digital ocean. So, uh, head on over to

53:13.960 --> 53:17.000
Digital ocean.com there you will find

53:17.720 --> 53:23.320
I'm, pretty sure your future cloud provider because it's cloud computer designed for developers. I mean really it's designed for admins linux

53:23.940 --> 53:26.940
Enthusiasts anyone who's tired of complicated apis

53:27.480 --> 53:33.320
Inane user interfaces or just paying too much or paying an unknown amount for a questionable

53:33.320 --> 53:38.120
Service if you go on over to digital ocean.com, you can use our promo code do unplugged

53:38.920 --> 53:44.360
Oh, yeah, that'll get you a ten dollar credit and when you find out that prices for their awesome droplets

53:44.360 --> 53:51.000
Yeah, what what's a droplet you might say that is a vps in the cloud on real kvm hypervisors with incredible

53:51.400 --> 53:57.420
40 gigabit e networking right to that hypervisor. It's like the rain cloud. It's just a series of droplets

53:58.920 --> 54:00.760
I think that's exactly right

54:00.760 --> 54:05.480
And the droplets contain little bundles of linux goodness or bsd goodness

54:05.480 --> 54:11.480
It's all honey badger on digital ocean like an actual clouds where they only just contain water. Yes much better on the internet

54:11.480 --> 54:14.040
Yeah, much better on the internet. That's why we recommend it so much

54:14.600 --> 54:16.600
So you get like a ton

54:16.600 --> 54:20.920
For that five dollars a month, right when you go on over to their pricing page, they make it super clear that

54:22.120 --> 54:25.720
You don't know. There's not you're not like wondering about how much you're going to be spending each month

54:25.720 --> 54:28.600
I I never I never worry about that at digital ocean

54:28.600 --> 54:34.360
They make it super easy to do and it's it's kind of a bargain. I mean for okay you get the ten dollars

54:34.360 --> 54:38.280
So maybe you just want to use that you're like, all right. Okay one free month. I'm sure I won't need it anymore

54:38.280 --> 54:41.480
Actually, you're going to be hooked. So we're two months for two months. Yeah, it doesn't matter

54:41.480 --> 54:43.720
If you go with the ten dollar you get a whole gig of memory

54:44.520 --> 54:50.520
One virtual cpu which these are some nice cpus too. So don't don't think that that's some skimpy arm thing

54:50.520 --> 54:55.320
No, no, certainly not 30 gigs of all ssd

54:55.320 --> 54:59.000
Disc and a whopping two terabytes of transfer

54:59.560 --> 55:06.200
Plus receive free access to services including monitoring cloud firewalls and more maybe that's not enough for you though

55:06.200 --> 55:10.360
Maybe you're like, oh, I really need more from my provider. They've just rolled out

55:11.320 --> 55:13.000
high cpu

55:13.000 --> 55:19.160
Droplets, so if you're crunching tons of data really putting the cloud to work for your projects digital ocean is now totally viable

55:19.160 --> 55:21.960
And they've done a ton of stuff like adding monitoring load balancers

55:21.960 --> 55:26.120
Attachable block storage. They're working on object storage, which i'm super excited for

55:26.680 --> 55:31.080
There's a ton of things that you can get that you can find at other cloud providers that don't have nearly the same kind of

55:31.320 --> 55:32.840
ease of use

55:32.840 --> 55:39.400
Simplicity of digital ocean. They've got an incredible api. They use it to build their awesome. Super clean super easy to use ui

55:40.040 --> 55:44.200
We use it here. The api is super easy to use all the all the apps are super easy to use

55:44.200 --> 55:46.200
It's just it's simple. It's no nonsense

55:46.520 --> 55:50.520
It's easy to get started with and when you use it, you're going to be able to do a lot of different things

55:50.520 --> 55:53.640
Easy to get started with and when you use our promo code do unplugged

55:54.200 --> 55:56.200
You get a ten dollar discount. We wanted

55:57.080 --> 56:00.600
To be able to turn droplets on and off via the irc

56:02.200 --> 56:04.360
To control the live stream to youtube

56:04.920 --> 56:05.800
and

56:05.800 --> 56:09.240
So I asked one of the people that was helping me develop j-bot. Can you?

56:10.280 --> 56:12.600
Find a way to hook up these commands

56:13.560 --> 56:17.400
To j-bot to be able to turn the droplets on and off within

56:17.400 --> 56:20.120
In 20 minutes he had finished the plugin

56:20.760 --> 56:22.840
Because the api is that good? Wow?

56:24.200 --> 56:29.240
That's kind of incredible. Yeah, I I like I I was talking to chris and noah about it and they're like

56:29.400 --> 56:30.600
Yeah, that'd be cool if you could do that

56:30.600 --> 56:34.120
So I went upstairs I messaged him and I came back downstairs and I checked a little bit later

56:34.200 --> 56:36.200
I'm like, oh, I guess it's done

56:36.840 --> 56:42.600
Wow, yeah, that's awesome and we use it like every day here. I mean all the all the freaking time

56:42.680 --> 56:45.560
It's pretty reliable. It yeah, I think it is pretty reliable

56:45.560 --> 56:47.000
so

56:47.000 --> 56:48.440
Awesome. All right. We'll go check that out

56:48.440 --> 56:53.960
Thank you very much to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux on program unplugged program and that promo code one more time. It's do

56:54.600 --> 57:00.760
Unplugged all one word all over case. Oh and all those vpss that I was saying I was doing development on digital ocean droplets

57:00.840 --> 57:06.280
Of course, so sly that's your secret sauce super cheap and no effort to set up

57:06.920 --> 57:08.200
that is

57:08.200 --> 57:11.880
Awesome. All right. Well, okay, but to set that all up right you do need

57:11.880 --> 57:17.800
You do need internet right? Like you got to be able to get to digital ocean. Yes. I don't think they have

57:18.600 --> 57:21.000
IP over paper yet. Mm-hmm

57:21.640 --> 57:23.640
And you know a lot of these people a lot of people today. They don't

57:24.280 --> 57:26.280
They've heard a lot about security problems

57:27.000 --> 57:29.960
They want to secure secure wi-fi router

57:30.440 --> 57:33.800
Maybe they maybe they went with the google wi-fi router, you know

57:34.120 --> 57:40.040
It's been pretty popular these days a lot of people buy it for maybe loved ones or family members without looking at the chatter

57:40.040 --> 57:46.280
Right now i'm going to say that they're probably saying that anybody that thought that google would be secure is

57:46.920 --> 57:48.920
kind of dumb, but

57:49.080 --> 57:50.760
And I would agree

57:50.760 --> 57:52.680
I don't know if I agree

57:52.680 --> 57:57.720
Yeah, I mean it depends on there on the product line, I suppose. Um, anyway, you may have had one of these

57:57.800 --> 58:03.160
I know some people who got them or uh, you know, inherit them or are troubleshooting to family members

58:03.880 --> 58:06.360
And I know for me, it's always frustrating when you're on like, uh, you know

58:06.360 --> 58:09.960
Stupid proprietary router and you can't troubleshoot things. You don't have access to a console

58:09.960 --> 58:13.560
You can't use all this linux knowledge that you've just gained or i've always had

58:14.840 --> 58:16.840
Especially on super lockdown things

58:17.640 --> 58:18.520
but

58:18.520 --> 58:23.640
If you're on google hardware my friends, there is a new open source project called gale force

58:23.800 --> 58:26.200
Which allows you to customize your google wi-fi

58:26.920 --> 58:29.800
Router like the wind. Yeah, like the wind

58:29.880 --> 58:33.640
So I guess the hardware name for google's wi-fi is gale

58:33.640 --> 58:38.600
You know much like they have the hammerhead for the nexus 5 or for all those fun names that they have

58:39.480 --> 58:42.840
So I don't I don't expect anyone to go out here and buy google wi-fi necessarily

58:42.920 --> 58:45.720
But if you are already administering one

58:46.280 --> 58:48.600
Gale force is kind of the best of both worlds

58:48.840 --> 58:56.280
It lets you run your own vpn server customize your gateway ip address or do any other system administration sort of thing that linux makes possible

58:57.160 --> 58:58.920
the bad news

58:58.920 --> 59:01.400
You do have to get your hands dirty to put the router in development mode

59:01.400 --> 59:03.960
You'll need a screwdriver a usb-c adapter with

59:04.520 --> 59:06.360
power delivery

59:06.360 --> 59:13.080
And some very precise button presses. So, you know fat-fingered people out there. Maybe this is the one for you get a helper

59:13.240 --> 59:15.480
Don't let noah set it up. Don't let noah

59:16.600 --> 59:17.880
Set it up

59:17.880 --> 59:24.120
But this is pretty fun. Actually, I think it's uh, it's neat what's nice about gale force. Uh, it's that it's gonna keep working

59:25.800 --> 59:30.840
Even if you get updates so it's not some sort of thing where you you know flash your router with alternative firmware

59:30.840 --> 59:34.280
You're stuck. No, they've just kind of they figured out a way to

59:35.380 --> 59:41.160
Unlock down things so that if you want root access you want to get things going you can but you still get security updates

59:41.160 --> 59:43.000
You still get feature updates

59:43.000 --> 59:48.200
It still has a nice ui that your parents can use. They just probably replace user space stuff. Yeah, exactly

59:48.280 --> 59:50.600
So you can go check it out. Um has a github project

59:51.240 --> 59:53.240
And that makes it really easy to get started

59:53.400 --> 59:57.560
Basically enables you to get root ssh access so I have anything any extra features you want

59:57.560 --> 01:00:03.320
And they keep mentioning this apparently with the stock firmware stuff. You can't customize the gateway ip address

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.800
Which personally that would frustrate me at least a little bit

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.920
it actually makes uh google wi-fi more appealing to me because i've been doing research because

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:17.720
As some people might know i've been planning on moving eventually and I was looking at uh, what the best way to do

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360
Whole house wi-fi is yeah

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:26.760
And apparently google wi-fi is one of the easiest ways to just get repeaters and coverage without really having to deal with it

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:32.280
So maybe that combined with some of this more open stuff would be really nice

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Interesting. Yeah, that that's what I kind of thought too

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.680
Is that yeah, maybe this is suddenly like we'll open it up to enthusiasts in a way where it didn't didn't have any interest

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.120
there before

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.080
um

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.040
I'll have to look into that. I actually hadn't looked at the hardware at all kind of for those reasons

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.920
I was like, well, I don't need that like i'd rather run something that I can actually, you know play with or or mess with

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.720
Interesting. When are you looking at moving or is this kind of just off in the future off in the future?

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.560
Yeah, that makes sense

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.560
Hopefully next year. Yeah

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.920
So i'm running my linux router still which has been working really well

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:08.280
And then I just this year just added a ubiquity ac pro which has been performing quite well nice

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.200
But I live in an apartment so it's not like I have crazy wi-fi needs

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.560
It's just like, you know a couple hundred square feet and then i'm set. Yeah

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.680
okay, so

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.920
Speaking of things the beard is interested in

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:25.180
You pointed this out to me and it's not all the time that we talk about an indiegogo

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.860
Indiegogo or kickstarter project because it's actually on both. I don't understand how that works interesting

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.640
but uh, yeah, so

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.560
There's this project. Uh, what's the name of it again? You have it up there? Yes

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:45.480
Smach smach smach z. Yeah, I think it's smock smock. Yeah, that makes more sense. So essentially it's a

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.560
A desktop pc in a handheld form factor

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.320
That's what the the pitch seems to be anyway

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:59.400
So basically it's based. Well originally it was based on

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.420
one of the the amd mobile processors

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.120
and

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:15.720
Some sort of amd gpu now they're saying actually i'll just read it. Yeah, please do. Uh, where is it?

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.680
It is over here

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.880
Uh, they they posted an update to their exclusively to their backers

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.520
But I happen to have a way to see that post outside of there. We won't talk about how

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:34.600
Uh, they said amd has kindly agreed to let us inform backers about their new soc upgrade

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:40.760
We can officially confirm that we are moving to the latest generation amd technology, which will be based on ryzen and vega

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:45.400
We are working together with amd to bring the best performance to smac z

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:48.760
So it will be the most powerful handheld console on the market

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:55.480
The new generation looks amazing and we want to thank amd for all their support and efforts contributed to our project

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.120
At this point we can't say anymore, but we hope that will alleviate the long wait

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:06.440
Because uh, this kickstarter happened like sometime last year. Oh, okay. Yeah, and then they they had a

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:11.960
um a partner that they were partnering with for the the soc technology back out

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:19.960
And because they backed out that caused delays but on the other side that let them work with amd to get this new tech in there

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.640
so it's kind of a handheld that's basically

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.400
a

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.400
low to mid-range pc in a

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.920
Uh handheld form factor so you can basically run

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:37.640
All your windows or linux games because you can install either os on there. Wow, and it ships out of the box with linux

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.280
Out of the box assuming it ever comes out. Yeah, assuming it ever comes out, of course and to me

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:51.800
That's the kind of handheld although admittedly still way too bulky for my taste. It is pretty big. Yeah, I will still probably get one

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:55.880
But uh, that's the handheld i've been waiting for a lot of the people, you know

01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:59.480
They're like you should get the pyra or you should get the the pie top

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.720
Or all those mini boxes and laptops, but to me

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.840
This is the one i've been waiting for because it's got

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.600
new

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.600
recent hardware in it

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.880
rather than something that's like several generations old like the

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:20.040
The pyre for example has a resistive touch screen, which is very old technology. Yes, totally. This has a

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.040
six inch 1080p

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.840
Capacitive touch touch screen. Ooh, and look at those like uh, those big

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.680
But I don't even know what to call those the pads there for controlling it. Those look nice

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:36.280
Oh, yeah, it's it's it reminded me a lot of the um, the steam controller. It does remind me. Yeah, exactly definitely. Um,

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:42.760
Interesting. So yeah, look at that like powerful enough to play almost any game on steam portal to dota left for dead 2

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:47.720
To portress 2 they've got benchmarks there somewhere haptic touch pads the evolution of the mouse

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.360
Like it's you're not going to get like top-end performance out of it

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.360
But at least from the the benchmarks they did on their prototype you can play

01:04:54.840 --> 01:05:01.480
Most games with medium to high settings on 720p for serious gamers. This looks like maybe something where you know

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.720
Yeah, it's not it's not your pixel perfect 60 frames per second that you get on your desktop with your sli card, but

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:14.840
You still have to take the bus to work sometimes and you can keep gaming. Yeah, so for people wondering the tech specs, um,

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:22.440
The the old setup that they were using they haven't updated with the new information yet was the merlin falcon rx421 bd

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:29.480
Which is like a 12 to 15 watt soc. Okay. Yeah that had four cores and an iradeon r7

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.320
Nice the 4gz ram. That sounds actually pretty sweet. Mm-hmm

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.440
I like that a lot. They claimed at the time that it would get five hours of battery life

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.880
I don't know if I believe that but maybe if most of that bulk was the battery I could believe that

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.840
I mean it is it is sizable. I mean we should be we should be clear about that

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:55.240
But it does have a micro sd slot a usb type c

01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.240
connection and hdmi port and wi-fi or

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.040
4g lte connectivity

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.240
Wow, and apparently a front facing 5 mAh battery

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:14.760
Wow, and apparently a front-facing five megapixel camera because everything that is portable has to have a camera

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.640
Yes, exactly

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.880
Interesting. All right. Well, that's pretty exciting and

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:26.840
The multi os support comes with linux right out of the box. Yeah, and yes, I do believe it has a headphone jack

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:31.000
Somebody in the chat unfortunately, you have to ask these kinds of questions today

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.840
But does it work with my air pods? It's it's not a phone. Well, it does have bluetooth. There we go. Alrighty then

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.320
That's awesome

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Yeah, so i'm kind of excited for that

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.120
So what do you think about vulkan then?

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:51.560
Are you excited for vulkan? Uh, i'm excited for when I actually start seeing games that are shipping with vulkan

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:58.920
So I do think I've I found two things around the net this week that maybe will help the first one was just some

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:05.880
Beginner friendly vulkan tutorials. So I right out of the bout i'd say you probably don't want to learn vulkan first

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:12.520
It probably shouldn't be your first intro to graphics programming. Um, just because it's you know, it's it's a lower level library

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.240
Maybe you experiment with some higher level stuff get your fundamentals down

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:19.080
There's a lot of math that you likely need to understand as well as you know hardware specifics

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:23.720
Uh, but if we want to have vulkan roll out and be successful and be adopted we need

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.720
pipelines to get devs involved trained up and be able to you know, make

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.520
Make new games with this stuff or new tools or you know, i'm sure also machine learning stuff. So

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.640
uh, stephanie hurlbutt

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.480
Recently put out a call for beginner friendly ways to learn vulkan for those who don't know vulkan is a new graphics

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.840
Api in other words a fresh new way to talk to your gpu and make it do things

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.600
It's managed by the kronos group, which means no one corporation controls it

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.640
It's pretty cool. Anyone wants to do work on gpus not restricted to graphics programmers

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:59.320
That's an important point in today's world should at least have a high level knowledge of what it is by beginner friendly

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.360
I mean that a total newbie should be able to at least understand what vulkan is and after some programming knowledge is assumed

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.400
You know, of course, no graphics api knowledge should be assumed

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.960
So this is just kind of a you know, it it talks about a little bit about what what this should be

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.960
um

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:21.080
And just provide some some really good links and it talks about how vulkan has actually kind of helped people, you know, like, uh,

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.560
Her friend dustin has writes that

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:30.280
So, how did I finally break through that wall of understanding? I'll give you a hint. It begins with a v and ends with vulkan

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:37.160
But vulkan is the hards. I hear you saying shouldn't I start with something easy like open gl and actually

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:39.720
No

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.320
Maybe you shouldn't the point is that vulkan removes the mystery

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.200
It spells things out plain as day and for a programmer. This is awesome

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.560
It's intellectually honest about what it needs and what it's doing

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.680
It will teach you what it really means to program a gpu

01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:01.160
Don't think of all the extra code as a mountain to climb but instead as a clearly articulated set of instructions to help you get

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.920
Where you need?

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:06.280
To go so go forth friends and enjoy learning some vulkan

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:10.920
So they've got some links down here at the bottom that can uh, that can help you out. Um, you know

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:15.000
It's not top of my list of things to learn but uh, I think there are a lot of people that are and i'm really

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.680
excited to see what happens

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:22.200
And you know, maybe you try out some of these tutorials. You probably want to go benchmark your results

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:28.360
We've got some news there too introducing vk mark more than a vulkan benchmark

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.800
Ever since vulkan was first announced a few years ago the idea of creating a vulkan benchmark

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.440
In the spirit of you know, gl mark 2 for example

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.680
It's been kind of floating around

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.920
Recently, thanks to alexandros's employer

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:42.840
Collabora

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.440
Collabora, I don't know. How do you actually say that? It's the people they do. I think it's collabora. Yeah

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.120
Okay, that's what I thought as well, but you know, you got to explore especially i'm in chris's chair today

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.760
So i'm callabora. I'm kind of obligated to mispronounce things. I think that's how it works

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:59.800
I feel like that's a combination chris. No, uh mispronunciation. Yeah. Well, i'm trying to channel them

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.120
Yeah for inspiration you see anyway, thanks to them

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:10.440
This idea has materialized. It's now on gintub github. And the result is the vk mark vulkan benchmark

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:15.640
Like its sibling gl mark 2 sibling project vk mark's goals are different from the goals of big

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:21.320
monolithic and proprietary benchmarks instead of providing a single complex benchmark vk mark aims to provide an

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.640
Extensible suite of targeted and configurable benchmarking scenes

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:30.600
So just kind of a new tool set as you're learning vulkan. You can kind of go see what what does the performance?

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.960
Actually look like so I thought that was kind of fun

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.920
And since we're already talking about games, I thought we'd just touch on real quick

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.400
Something that we'd been discussing earlier today

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.960
Which is the pterodactyl?

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.040
panel

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.520
pterodactyl panel, it's a free open source game agnostic

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.360
game

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.360
management portal, what is pterodactyl?

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.240
It's a free open source game agnostic

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.240
game

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.520
Management portal. What did you think of this? I'd be curious for your opinion

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.880
Well, it seemed to me like it was a super easy way to set up game servers if I understood correctly

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.800
which appeals to me because I am a lazy sob

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.040
no, you don't say and

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.040
Anything that makes that easier is good in my book especially I don't know

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.200
Does it handle like uh steam games like steam servers?

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:25.200
If it did, that would be amazing, because Steam servers are notoriously difficult to

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.200
set up.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.200
Yeah, that's true.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.800
It does mention Team Fortress 2 and CSGO here.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.800
Oh, so then yes.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.300
It sounds like yes, yeah.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:36.920
So Teradactyl Panel is a free, open-source, game-agnostic, self-hosted control panel for

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.280
users, networks, and game service providers.

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:44.280
Teradactyl supports games and servers such as Minecraft, ARK Evolution Evolved, CSGO,

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.240
Team Fortress 2, Insurgency, Team Spike 3, Mumble, and many more.

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:49.400
Some of those aren't games, oh, they're servers, yeah, that makes sense.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.080
If you're a Linux gamer, you probably don't know, we don't mention ARK.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.760
ARK is a bad thing these days.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.760
You're okay.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.760
Yeah.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.760
You're right, I didn't know.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:04.400
They did very bad things, like early access DLC and raising their price from $30 to $80.

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:05.400
Ouch.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.400
See, this is why we need you here, for context, I really appreciate that.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.920
You'll notice that it looks like you can even use the web UI on a Mac, so even though you're

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.480
not gaming on your Mac, probably you can administer from it.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.480
Well yeah, you have your Macbook that you're not using off to the side running the website.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.800
And then Linux is on the server, and then you have your Windows gaming machine, that's

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800
how it works.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.680
Or your Linux gaming machine, a lot of those are available on Linux.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.840
That's a very good point.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.680
So it looks pretty sweet, it's got a nice looking web UI.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.760
The other thing I like about it is that since it's open source, you know, if you want to

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.920
see support for a new game, you can probably just go open an issue.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.080
Yeah, exactly, right, like this is something we can do.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:46.320
It's secure, it's themeable, Docker based, which is maybe a plus or a minus, but I should

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.920
hopefully mean it's really easy to get started with, that's kind of the whole idea.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.160
It's free, open source, user friendly, and scalable.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.280
So they've got a bunch of screenshots, I've not had a chance to play with it yet, but

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:03.120
as someone who does like to casual game, but is not always an expert at running the server

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.560
necessarily, just because I don't do it a lot, this looks awesome.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.280
What I would like to actually try is see what, yeah, what does adding a new game look like?

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.760
If it doesn't have out of the box support, what are the hooks there, what is the interface,

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.920
how do I get that started and have it understand the new game?

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:24.720
How can I set this up myself, or maybe see if I could get somebody else to write that

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720
for me?

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.720
Exactly.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.720
Yeah.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.360
So anyway, I thought that was a great development, might make things a little bit more accessible,

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.640
and maybe this is the final drop in the bucket where you've wanted to run your own game server,

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.200
you want to have a game server for you and your friends to play on, but you're not a

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:43.120
great admin, you're a little wary of having that all work.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.120
Go check out Pterodactyl.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:45.120
Yeah.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.800
So I'm going back to smock for a minute.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.800
Yeah, sure.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.720
Somebody in the IRC chat room asked how much it was.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.880
They don't have retail pricing yet, but at least when they did on IndieGoGo, the price

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:03.800
for the original version was $350 for the Wi-Fi version or 550 for the 4G version.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:10.880
Also supposedly from what I was reading, some of the, or all of the parts are replaceable.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.720
So potentially there could be upgrades in the future to like the GPU and CPU.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720
That's awesome.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:18.720
Yeah.

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:24.360
And just as an aside, it's a group of Spanish people doing this particular project, which

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.120
is something you don't often see.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.120
No, totally.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.120
So go support it.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.120
Yeah.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.560
We need a nice diverse community of people making these awesome handhelds.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.960
So does our very quiet mumble room have anything to say about any of this stuff?

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.960
That's a good question.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:38.960
Yeah.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.000
I guess that's enough.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.240
I was about to say about the VKMark.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.880
It sounds like a wonderful set of tools to develop Vulkan based games, just to continuously

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:55.200
figure out how to get away all the things that are stunting performance and just streamlining

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.200
development.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.880
And maybe something you can set up and maybe not quite continuous, but some sort of pipeline

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.620
that as you're going, you can keep track of what does this look like?

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:07.400
Make sure you don't have any performance regressions or get an idea as you're experimenting with

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400
new techniques.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400
Sure.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.200
If it's something we'll see integrated into the Ferronics test suite at some point.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.200
Oh, that's a good question.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.720
So they can test more Vulkan-y things.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.320
Yeah, as that continues to roll out, interesting.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.320
Anyone else have any thoughts?

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.840
None of these guys are gamers.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
That's true.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.000
It's not something we always talk about, but yeah.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.320
Also Vulkan actually had an update last week, so I'm surprised you guys didn't see that

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:44.200
with new extensions and some parts of it are promoted to stable, so that's also good.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:51.360
So hopefully they'll announce some more stuff at SIGGRAPH 2017 in a little while, but outside

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.960
of that, not much else.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:03.040
I'm just waiting to see the first breakout hit game that runs on Vulkan primarily.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.800
That still hasn't really happened.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.360
I know it's still like everything has Vulkan as an option, so you kind of really want just

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.560
something that runs on Vulkan.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:19.440
It's easy to port over so that it can run on Linux.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.920
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.320
Well, so we were just talking about trying to make these things easy, trying to make

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.680
them simple to use.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:33.160
I think that just leads us right into our final sponsor this evening, which is our friends

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.160
over at Ting.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.680
Head on over to linux.ting.com to discover a smarter way to do mobile.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:45.240
Did you know, Rekai, that the average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month?

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.720
Seems unbelievable, right?

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.480
That seems crazy.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:53.640
Have you ever been on any of those big name carriers with their unlimited data plans?

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.480
Yeah, especially T-Mobile.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:58.440
I'm not a fan of T-Mobile.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.680
They charge a lot of money for not a lot of stuff.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:05.240
And it puts you in the position of trying to figure that out, right?

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:09.720
You're like, okay, well, the cheapest plan I can get is X, and I assure you X is more

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.880
than $23.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:16.040
I have to make sure that I stay within that limit, otherwise I'll get charged a boatload

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.040
more.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.040
Yeah, either you get charged a ton more.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.640
Ten kilobytes over.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.160
Or you're in the position of like, I got to try to use my data because I paid for this

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.160
much.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.240
I'm just not getting the good deal with it.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.560
Or you want only data, but all of the plans tack on minutes and messages that cost a bunch

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560
of money.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.400
My friends, this is just a bad way to do mobile.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:40.800
Go on over to linux.ting.com and find mobile that just makes sense.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.280
It's mobile a la carte.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.160
So if you're curious what the beard's talking about here, just go on over to the rates page

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.920
and you will see exactly.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.880
Turns out you only pay for what you use.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.280
Each line starts at $6 a month.

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.040
Now there may be some taxes and fees.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.400
That depends on your locality.

01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.920
Ting can't do anything about that.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.400
That's just a fact of life.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.480
But they'll charge you $6 per line.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.740
Two lines, just $12.

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.000
It scales just like that.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
It's so simple.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It's easy to understand.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.960
And if you have a line you just want to hang around, you're not sure if you're going to

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.800
need it or not, $6 is like nothing.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.800
That's less than a sandwich.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:19.960
I could be wrong, but I think that $6 is actually to cover those taxes and fees.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:21.140
That may be true.

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.140
Even better.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:23.140
But don't quote me on that.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.140
I could be wrong.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:25.140
Don't quote us on anything.

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.180
That's just not cool.

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:30.640
But after that, you just tally up how many minutes you've used, how many megabytes and

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.640
how many messages.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:32.640
Probably no messages.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.640
Maybe a few minutes.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640
It depends.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640
Sometimes people call you.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.760
Nothing you can do about that.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:41.240
But it doesn't matter because you just pay for what you use.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.200
So let's say you just, you know, a little bit of messages or a little bit of minutes,

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200
you know, just to cover it.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.680
A little bit of messages, same reason.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.880
And then a whole bunch of data.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.760
You're still only using $32 a month.

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.760
And that's all of it.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.760
You get three-way calling, tethering.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:55.760
That's included.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.760
You don't have to pay extra.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:57.760
There's no limits.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.760
There's no special tethering budget.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:05.560
And there's no early termination fees, no overages, no weird, strange extra fees.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.160
It just is simple.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.360
You can bring your own device.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:14.260
They support both CDMA and GSM, which is pretty much all of your options here in the U.S.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.500
So you'll be covered.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:19.920
And honestly, that's great because I know at my parents' house, CDMA is king.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.840
But in the city, for whatever reason, GSM ends up being a lot better.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.560
So it's super simple to keep those, you know, we can all be on Ting.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.560
It doesn't matter.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.920
It's the thing that works for where you're at the most.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.400
Or for just $6 a month, maybe you have an extra phone or an extra SIM hanging around.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.760
Totally worth it for $6 a month.

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.080
You can bring your own device or shop their devices.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080
Did I mention?

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.080
No, I did not.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:48.380
But I should have, when you go to linux.ting.com, you'll get a $25 service credit.

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:52.640
So that will probably pay for the majority, if not all, of your first month.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.720
Or you can use it on one of these shiny new phones.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.100
It's cheap enough that you could have like an emergency backup phone for when you lose

01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:02.240
your main phone, tossed away in a drawer.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:05.800
And if you lose your phone, well, here's your other phone already ready and ready to go.

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.280
And the Ting interface is so easy.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.600
Whether you're using their app or their web interface, it's just super simple to do that.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:15.240
It's super simple to activate or deactivate or register a new phone.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:22.480
I will say that if you use Ting smartly, your boss that has your phone on a business line

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:30.200
because I have my phone on a business line because I don't use my phone much, he'll forget

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:35.160
that he even has, that he's even paying for your phone because it's that cheap.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:40.960
Like I mostly use my phone on Wi-Fi, so there's not much data and I make like maybe a dozen

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.960
calls a year at most.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:42.960
Yep.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.760
Mostly to harass me because I didn't finish the text snapshot notes.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.760
Yeah.

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.760
Well, no, those are usually text messages.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.760
True.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.000
When you don't have weird blocking things that don't let me talk to you.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.040
But yeah, I barely hit 10 bucks a month at most.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.040
That's awesome.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.920
And that's not something you could do on like any other carrier.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920
That's the thing.

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:02.920
Yeah.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.280
And Ting doesn't have to focus on like building new poles or lines or anything.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.040
They can focus on keeping things simple and customer service.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:16.000
So whether you want to pick up the new Samsung Galaxy 8 or just bring your crappy burner phone,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
it doesn't matter.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.760
It's super simple, linux.ting.com and thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.760
program.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.760
Ting's pretty great.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.760
Yeah.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.040
I mean, it's just so easy.

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:35.040
The only time Chris notices that I'm even on the JB Ting account is when I go home for

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:41.280
a week and I actually have to use the data because Maine has no internet.

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.320
Maine has no internet.

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.320
Yikes.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:49.120
All right, well, I guess it'll be time for tech snap soon so we should probably get out

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.120
of here.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:53.920
But before we do, I just wanted to talk about a couple of things real quick on our way out.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:58.120
The first of which is it's a little bit late now, I know.

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:03.240
Happy birthday, Slackware, 24 years of awesomeness.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.840
That's pretty cool.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.720
Something I learned about Chris last week because he's never used Slackware.

01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:08.720
Never?

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:09.720
Never.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.720
Really?

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.720
Apparently he skipped that phase.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.720
Just wasn't a Slackware person.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.760
He ended up on Gentoo, but he's never tried Slackware.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.760
That's hilarious.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:20.320
He was going to try Slackware at some point, but then he took the Arch challenge and started

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.120
using Arch and never used it.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.120
Never got back to Slack, huh?

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.120
Yeah.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:25.120
What about you?

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:29.880
I used it in the 90s and not since then.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.560
But I respect people that use Slackware.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.120
Yeah, I think you have to really.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.040
It's a very different kind of distribution.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.040
It is.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.320
And it's the kind of thing that, especially in the Linux community, we shouldn't be focused

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.280
on conformity or trying to press people into our favorite boxes.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.400
So like you're saying, it's great.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.040
Slackware offers a particular thing.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.180
It's a different kind of minimalism.

01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:54.960
It's a different kind of minimalism, but I think one that I can certainly respect.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.280
People who use it know what they're doing and understand the distribution that they're

01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.280
using.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.560
And I think that's great.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.360
Anyone in the moment room want to chime in about Slackware?

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:07.200
We got any Slack fans here or people who got some good stories?

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:09.160
Still haven't used it.

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:11.160
So I'm with Chris.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.440
Magic was popular in my day.

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.440
So you know.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:21.040
I feel like if you haven't used Slackware, you're missing a bit of the Linux experience.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.680
Yeah, you know, that may be true.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:30.080
It is the first distro, if I remember correctly.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.080
Is that right?

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.840
I think that's right.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.120
Let's just find out, folks.

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:36.160
Or at least the oldest still existing distro.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.160
Yeah.

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:38.160
Okay.

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.360
I think it's 2015, which is slightly out of date.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.200
But I don't see how that would change because Slackware is still around.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.760
So the oldest currently existing Linux distribution is Slackware.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.760
Awesome.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:55.800
I haven't used it that much myself, but my web hoster is using it.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:03.440
So whenever SFTP files, PHP and HTML files, the web hoster company is using it.

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.040
And I have a couple of friends that use it, but I haven't used it myself as a client

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.040
or server.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040
That's interesting.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.840
Other than using it on other servers.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:15.920
I would not have expected a web host to use Slackware.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.880
That seems peculiar.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.880
I like it, but it's peculiar.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:20.880
Yeah.

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880
Yeah.

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.680
The Swedish web hosting company FS Data from Skåne using Slackware.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:30.520
I found out what they're doing, like cat etc. and catting files and stuff.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520
Interesting.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:33.240
I wonder why they chose Slackware.

01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.840
You know, I could see it from some, you know, it's kind of like some people who use this,

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:40.920
like Gentoo, for instance, where if you really, if you're doing something special or you have

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.240
a particular way or you're really knowledgeable and you know what you're doing, you know,

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.000
it might be customized enough that you can get what you need without all the bloat.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.540
Or it just might be that web host.

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.540
That's what they know.

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.540
Yeah.

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:53.540
Yeah.

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:54.540
Might be comfortable with it.

01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:55.540
All right.

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.540
Well, then Slack is great.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:24:57.540
Keep using Slackware.

01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:01.080
Some, another birthday, not really a birthday, but a release that we should talk about just

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.200
real quick on the way out here, Magia 6.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.140
It's finally ready to shine.

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:11.600
The whole Magia community is extremely happy to announce the release of Magia 6, the shining

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.720
result of our longest release cycle so far.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.020
Comes with many new and exciting features, a new range of installation media and the

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:22.720
usability and stability that can be expected from any Magia release.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.880
So are you excited?

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:31.600
I have not heard about Magia in so long that I forgot everything about it.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.760
So I will have to say no.

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.980
Luckily for you, if you're a little concerned, we do in the show notes, we will have a link

01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:44.080
back to an article from 2010 called Forking Mandriva Linux.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.080
The birth of Magia.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.080
Oh, right.

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.080
It's the Mandriva fork.

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.080
Yep.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:50.420
Mandriva, one of my favorite Linux distributions has been forked and the new distribution is

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:51.420
named Magia.

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.940
Mandriva is no longer around, right?

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.880
I believe that is the case.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.880
Yes.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:58.740
And so Magia is what lives on.

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.420
It's a fork that's outlived.

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.920
It's fork-y?

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.920
Yes.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.480
Before that time, there was Mandrake.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480
And then Mandrake before that.

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.480
Yeah.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.880
And before that, that was forked from the Red Hat stuff.

01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:10.880
Yeah.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.840
There is a fork called Open Mandriva.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:13.840
Oh, nice.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:14.840
Oh, nice.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.840
Interesting.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.840
I haven't checked on it.

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:20.120
That's much other than seeing it on Distro Watch.

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.120
So some of Magia's gold...

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.120
This is Rosa Laff.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.120
Oh, go on.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:24.120
Oh, Rosa Laff.

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:25.120
Got it.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.120
So some of Magia's gold...

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:27.120
Rosa Laff.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:28.120
Yeah.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.880
So some of Magia's gold when they launched...

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:31.880
That makes sense.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.920
We're to make Linux and free software straightforward to use for everyone, provide integrated system

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:41.320
configuration tools, keep a high level of integration between the base system, the desktop

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:47.000
and applications, especially to improve third-party integration, be it free or proprietary, target

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.700
new architectures and form factors, and improve our understanding of computers and electronic

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:52.900
device users.

01:26:52.900 --> 01:26:59.600
So the thing with that list is it sounds like the same list that every other fork has.

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.600
It does kind of.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:08.840
So my question is, I've lately become kind of an anti more distros, more forking kind

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:09.840
of guy.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:10.840
Understandable.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:14.440
As you can hear on user.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:18.840
What sets Magia apart that would make me ever want to use it?

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.440
Do you know?

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:21.440
I'm not really sure.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.160
I'm going to throw this to the mumble room.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.800
Do you guys have any insights here?

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.040
I kind of put this in the show because I wasn't super familiar.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.040
I did download the ISO.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:34.200
I didn't have a chance to try it today, but I will try it later this week.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.560
I never was on the Mandrake, Mandriva lines.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.720
I don't have a lot of insight there.

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.720
I assume it's RPM based because of where it came from.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.160
But at that point, why wouldn't I just use something like Fedora?

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.160
Yeah.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.160
They do have...

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.760
This new release does have Plasma 5.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.880
They've got DNF in there.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:55.440
They support AppStream and Gnome software and Plasma Discover.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.280
They've support Copper and the open series build service.

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.700
And they've got a new DNF Dragora GUI tool for package management.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:10.200
So it sounds like Fedora with a couple more GUI apps and open build service.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.200
Right.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.120
And I guess more focus on providing good integration with third party services.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.400
So maybe this is a Fedora you can install on your friend's computer.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.360
Yeah, but that third party integration, isn't it just a matter of adding a text line to

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360
something?

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:34.000
See, once again, I don't see the point of having a fork just for that.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.360
I think that may be true.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:40.880
But I will say congrats on their sixth release.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.880
That's awesome.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:42.880
I'm sure they're doing lots of hard work.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.640
I just personally don't understand why it exists.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:46.640
Yeah.

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:49.080
So I think this is a great way to provide feedback if there are people out there either

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.200
right now in the Mumble Room or who want to write in and give us feedback to the show.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.200
I would be curious as well.

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.800
I think that's something ongoing.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.600
What does it take for a distribution to really carve out its own way and exist?

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:03.680
Well it should have a consistent release because I'm kind of with the Rekai with this, but

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:05.680
I thought it was dead.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:12.560
So you're saying Magia is around, I'm like, wait, they're around?

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.360
I think that's what a lot of people thought.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:15.360
All right.

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360
Anyone else?

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.360
Yeah.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.440
Please chime in.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.880
Don't break when I update.

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.440
Yeah.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.440
Don't break when I update.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.560
Have the software that I want.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:31.200
That would actually be something in its corner is if they have the third party integrations

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.600
and when you update it doesn't break because that is a problem that some people have with

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:39.880
Fedora when you enable things like copper and they try to go do the DNF update to the

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.240
next version or whatever and their system basically breaks.

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.240
Exactly.

01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:48.440
So if Magia could handle that, that would be a differentiator.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:50.920
I think you've hit the nail on the head.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:56.360
And with that, I think it's time to bring this episode of Linux Unplugged, episode 206,

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.360
to a close.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.780
Thank you very much for guest hosting, Mr. Rekai.

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.120
It has been an absolute pleasure.

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:05.480
If you want to see more of this show, you can head on over to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.120
There's the archives, a ton of other shows.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.280
If you want to see more of me, I'm at Westpain on Twitter.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.360
And where can they find more of you, Dear Beard?

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:16.960
Well, they can find me on Twitter at twitter.com slash RekaiLP.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:22.280
Or they can find me on Twitch, streaming usually almost every day.

01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.280
Hey-o!

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:27.880
The short URL is R-E-K-D dot net, Rek.net.

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:32.000
Or if that doesn't work for some reason because I screwed something up, it would be twitch.tv

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000
slash RekaiLP.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Perfect.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.120
Well, thank you very much for joining me.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.040
Thank you everyone who joined us in today's Mumble Room.

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.080
You really make the show, as well as the IRC.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.040
And hey, we'll see you next week.

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:29.760
Alrighty, thanks everyone, that was a fun show.

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.600
Hopefully you guys enjoyed it as well.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:38.820
So now it's time to go on over to JBtitles.com and get your vote on.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.160
So we have a bit of a problem with the titles here, Wes.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.560
Do we?

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:47.680
All these titles are about me.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.440
Of course they are.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.400
So you want something filed under B for Beard?

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:54.400
That's what you want?

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.400
I don't know, Wes.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.240
I'm going to leave it up to you.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.300
I think we leave it up to our dear friends, the voters out there.

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:03.300
The voting public.

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:10.600
The way this works, though, it's kind of like it's, you might call it an electoral college

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:16.040
where there's the public that votes, but then there's these mysterious people in the background

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.040
that make the final decision.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.040
We don't speak of them.

01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:20.040
No.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.040
We can't actually.

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.040
Forbidden.

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.040
And then one of our titles is President.

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:26.240
For the whole next year.

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:32.040
Ooh, Linux Unshaved, that's kind of fun.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:43.360
I'm kind of partial to Beardy McBeardface, but at the same time, I feel like having the

01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:47.400
title be about me is really self-serving.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.160
But it's a special episode.

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.160
I guess.

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:51.160
But what happens next time?

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.160
I'm on.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.160
Exactly.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:56.960
Kind of like the Dubstep Alan thing.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.560
It'll have to be even more creative then.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:03.280
We named an episode of last Dubstep Alan, and then we had to end last.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:04.680
Yeah, that's true.

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:05.680
So think of the show, people.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:06.680
We couldn't top that title.

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:07.680
Think of the show.

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.600
Man, we just had so much stuff today, I didn't even get to ramble about containers at all.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.400
You didn't get to ramble about containers.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.880
You didn't get to piss off everybody that was listening by talking about Windows games

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:19.880
like you wanted to.

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:20.880
That's true, yeah.

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:23.000
Wes wanted to do that, by the way, not me.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Not you.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.040
You were a willing participant.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:29.720
I said we could do whatever you wanted, but I wasn't going to take responsibility.

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.720
That's what you always say.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.360
No one wants to take responsibility.

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:36.480
I've been too busy with file systems to even game.

01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.480
Hey, that's not a bad thing.

01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.080
I'm going to rat Wes out here.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:45.080
Wes has been gaming on a Windows box, I'm told.

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:48.200
There is now one in my house, yeah, it's true.

01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.200
It's true.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.200
Last fever.

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.200
Yeah, pretty much.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.200
You're losing quite a bit.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:53.200
Oh, come on, Wes.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.520
I'm still also gaming on a Windows box.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.520
It has both.

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.720
Wait, wait, you're gaming on a Windows box and also a Windows box?

01:33:58.720 --> 01:33:59.720
I mean Linux box.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.160
God, Windows has infected me.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:02.160
What am I going to do?

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:05.280
This is what happens, Wes, that's what I'm told.

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.560
Windows isn't good for anything.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.200
So in full disclosure, it's not like it's a shared system that is dual boots, Linux

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:13.200
and Windows.

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.580
It just also now boots Windows for some games that other people in my household would like

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:21.660
to play, but it does open the possibility of if there is a Windows game that I want

01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:25.120
to play or have wanted to play or should be playing, I now can.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.120
Not saying I will.

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:30.800
I still keep it booted into Linux most of the time, but it's a new world.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:31.800
Some games that I don't like.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:32.800
Or an old world that I'm back to.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.680
Are available for Linux that you might be interested in, Factorio.

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:38.280
Oh, yeah, I've seen you stream in that.

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.280
And Rimworld.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:40.280
Oh, okay.

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:41.280
I'll check those out.

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.280
Yeah.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.160
Yeah, I tried the beta of Lore Breaker.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.160
That's kind of fun.

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:51.880
New FPS by the guy that did some UT stuff, Cliff V. Also the Battlefield games doesn't

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.560
work on Linux.

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:56.760
One of my most entertaining games.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:58.680
I've been watching a lot of it.

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:04.880
I'm not playing it much because I'm really bad at it, but it's Player Unknown's Battlegrounds.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.320
It's kind of a battle royale game with more of a realistic bent.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:16.200
So you just have like a hundred people that are dropped from a plane all across a map

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:21.680
and you kill everybody until there's only one person left and they're the winner.

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:23.800
Yeah, it's similar to DayZ, right?

01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:29.880
But instead of having like that eternal continuous map, you have a closing in map.

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.160
So you have to stay within certain bounds of a certain radius or else you'll die.

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:38.160
That way it keeps it interesting because people have to continuously get closer to each other.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:42.880
Yeah, because you start with the full map and then as time progresses, you have a circle

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:46.920
on the map that gets smaller and smaller and people that are outside of that slowly take

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.880
damage and later in the game, they take more damage until basically, if you're outside

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:54.800
that circle, you'll die within a couple of seconds.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:55.800
Wow.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.800
Okay.

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.640
So it kind of forces PvP until there's only one person left.

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:01.640
Cool.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.320
I've seen a coworker played some of that.

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.880
It's a lot of fun.

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:10.120
Even when you're bad at it, it's still fun.

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:11.320
I might have to give that a shot.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.880
There's a lot of good suggestions here.

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:14.360
There we go.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:15.360
All right.

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:22.400
There's a humble bundle of some Telltale games, but I don't think they run on Linux.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.600
Some of them do.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.600
I believe.

01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:29.200
I thought I saw a Linux icon on there.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.720
I could be wrong.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.840
But even if they don't, if you happen to have a Windows box, I would highly recommend any

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:35.840
of the Telltale games.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.480
They're almost all great games.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.480
That's awesome.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:44.160
They're all point and click games, but they are very story heavy and most of them are

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:50.960
based on existing franchises like The Walking Dead or Back to the Future or Batman or Minecraft.

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:52.640
Borderlands.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.560
The Borderlands one is actually really funny.

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.560
Nice.

01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:56.560
It is.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.560
I've played the entire thing.

01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:58.560
It's so awesome.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:01.760
Even if you don't traditionally like point and click games, I would still recommend trying

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:02.760
them.

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:06.760
My favorite one, I think, is The Walking Dead series, which if you're a fan of The Walking

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.720
Dead, it's amazing.

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:13.360
If you're not a fan of The Walking Dead, it's still a fun zombie story.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.360
Huh.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:21.040
Here's a classic, basically Beneath a Steel Sky is available as a flat pack or a snap,

01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.040
I think.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.040
Oh, that's nice.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.440
That's a really old school point and click game.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.440
It's really fun to play.

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.360
Once you've got the audio working too and it works, so it's nice.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.360
That's awesome.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.360
Here's another tip.

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.920
I used to play Monkey Island on Linux when I was younger.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.200
You can play the older adventure games in SCUMVM.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.520
Is that right?

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:45.160
That's something too, one of the JBLives in the chatroom said you could probably play

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:51.280
most of the tailgates via Wine because they're on the simpler end of the technology scale.

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:55.320
Yeah, you know, that's nice.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.520
Also hitting back on, you had two machines, one that's Windows and one that's Linux.

01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:06.920
I don't know how good Windows 10 supports IOMMUs, but maybe you could just bypass hardware

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:12.800
to your Windows install on the partition and play those games on Linux.

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.240
Oh, virtualize it?

01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:16.040
Yeah, that's totally worth investigating.

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.960
I'll have to see what that hardware supports.

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.040
The slightly older system with a modern GPU, so I'll have to look into that.

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:28.800
Okay, so I guess we should pick a title and get out of here because we've got a live tech

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:29.800
snap coming up next.

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:31.720
I've got to go edit a show.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.160
And you've got to edit a show.

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:38.400
So Linux Unshaved or Beardy McBeardface.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.640
As the guest, I think it's up to you, Mr. Beard.

01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:44.200
Or Unplugging the Beard or the Bold in the Beardy Fool.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.300
Those are all hilarious.

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.300
Not that SS.

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:50.080
I like that too.

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.080
What do you think?

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.480
I think we're going to stay away from the SS status.

01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.920
Yeah, I agree.

01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:00.960
Let me refresh here.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.960
Yeah.

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.440
Doesn't it auto refresh?

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.440
Didn't you make this?

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:07.920
Well, it doesn't seem to be working on mobile, so that's a bug.

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:08.920
File a bug.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.960
Yeah, it hasn't been working on desktop for me.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:19.280
Also, you had to restart JBot earlier, so that might be a thing.

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.720
Yeah, that might have been it.

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.720
Yeah, that's fair.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:32.400
Yeah, as I mentioned in the show, JBot has a memory leak that I can't really track down,

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.640
and it only happens on certain distributions, which makes it even weirder.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.640
Weird.

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:43.240
Yeah, by the way, I'm looking for people to help me with JBot because I have no time to

01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:44.240
develop it.

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.240
That's fair.

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:47.240
So if anybody knows Ruby and wants to help out.

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.800
Jim and I know Ruby now.

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:49.800
I should help.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.800
All right.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:51.800
I'll help.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:52.800
I'll help.

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:53.800
Stop twisting my arm.

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:58.440
I guess we're going to go with the beard title, since that's all the top-rode titles.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:39:59.440
Yeah.

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:03.240
Well, I do kind of like init it to win it.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.240
I also like that.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.240
Or init to win it.

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.240
Init to win it.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.920
I'd be okay with that if that's what you want to choose.

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.840
Colonel Panic offers to rewrite it in a real programming language.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.880
I mean, if you want to support it, then yes, do it.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:16.880
Do it.

01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.000
No, don't, because I won't use it.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Ruby or not.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000
The problem is I'm the one at the end of the day that has to maintain it and make sure

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.560
it's running for JB.

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.120
And if something breaks, I have to fix it.

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.360
So I still have to know the language.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.940
And the only language I'm really comfortable in is Ruby.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:36.940
That's fair then.

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:40.360
I think that's how a lot of things get made.

01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:45.520
One last gaming thing is there's a game called a survival game called The Long Dark that

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:46.520
I've been playing.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:47.520
It's a good game.

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:55.320
It's got 205 hours played in it and it's coming out of early access in August 1st.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:58.920
So the story mode will finally be coming out.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:05.200
So maybe once I've played that, I can say whether it's good or not for someone to buy.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.800
Well if we're going to talk about games where there's thousands of hours in games, I can

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:11.600
recommend a couple.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.520
Civilization 5, great game.

01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:17.720
I have like 600 hours in that game.

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:25.800
Path of Exile which is kind of like a Diablo 2 clone with a much more extensive skill tree.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.680
We're talking like hundreds of different variations on skills.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:34.240
That's something if you like action RPG kind of stuff.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:40.040
And one that I'll probably get a lot of crap for from some gamers, Final Fantasy XIV

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:44.640
Online is an amazing story based MMO.

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:48.240
I hate most MMOs because they all feel like fetch quests.

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.760
But Final Fantasy XIV, it has a crap ton of stories.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:57.120
So it kind of just feels like a regular RPG where you happen to be playing with other

01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:58.120
people.

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.120
Nice.

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:00.880
That actually kind of sounds exactly like what I want.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.800
I think I have like $3,500 in that game.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.760
I'm impressed.

01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.920
I think Path of Exile is like $1,500.

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.040
I game a lot.

01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.040
You sure do.

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.840
And that's why we love you.

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:17.400
All right, we should probably get out of here.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:19.520
Thank you everyone for an awesome show.

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:23.640
Your feedback and input has been very much appreciated and a lot of fun chatting about

01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:25.580
games too surprisingly.

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:26.580
So this is awesome.

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.580
Thank you very much.

01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.580
Stay tuned.

01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:32.880
We'll have a live tech snap coming right up.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:33.880
Lots to come.

01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:34.880
Yeah.

01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:35.880
Awesome.

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:39.080
So streams will blip, et cetera, et cetera.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.920
Hey, Elixir's actually kind of fun there, Colonel Panic.

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:42.920
Anyway.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.120
I actually have an article I can link about how Discord used Elixir to scale to millions

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.120
of people.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.080
I'll put that in the charm later.

01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:56.600
And don't worry, the Beam VM is written in old school ADC so everyone can be happy.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.600
Nice.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.200
Okay, with that, let's get things switched over.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.200
Beard, thank you so much.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.200
This has been a lot of fun.

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.200
We'll have to do more shows again.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:03.200
Let's get rid of that Chris guy.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.200
We'll just post all the shows together.

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.200
Yeah, who needs it?

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.720
It's Jay in Montana.

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:12.120
I'll take over on LAN and then we'll host this together.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.040
I don't gotta do anything for tech stuff because you got that under control.

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:16.960
I guess I have to do on filter?

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:17.960
Yes, you do.

01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:18.960
Or do you want to do that?

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:22.920
Well, we can switch back and forth or bring Noah on.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:27.240
I guess I'm going to have to replace you with Chris on user error since I'm already on there.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:28.760
Or Chase does user error?

01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:29.760
I don't know.

01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:31.520
We'll replace Noah with Chase.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.520
There we go.

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:33.520
Yeah.

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:34.520
Okay, I think we've got it settled.

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:37.520
And we'll never speak about the hair again.

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:38.520
Yeah.

01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:39.520
Woo!

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.520
Alrighty.

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:41.520
He can just stay in that Montana place.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:44:08.340
Hopefully.
