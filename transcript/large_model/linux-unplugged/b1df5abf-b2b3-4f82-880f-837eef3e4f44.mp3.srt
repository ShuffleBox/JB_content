1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
As long as everybody keeps showing up. We'll just keep using mumble for voice is what I figure cuz you know power to the people

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,360
Yeah

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,920
I've um, I've not reconfigured my new IRC with

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,900
Geek shed so if I can just fire up discord that is easier new IRC, huh?

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,200
I've switched over to IRC cloud. Oh really and and

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,640
This is a controversial move apparently because when I did this I got a whole bunch of crap for it

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,960
But I think it's actually kind of a practical use to for IRC. It's just makes it simple

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,360
And you make you set it up in one place and you log in when you need IRC

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,240
Yep, so the way I've been doing it is I used to run ZNC on a droplet

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,080
which is an IRC bouncer and that effectively maintained a persistent connection to the

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,500
Dozen or so servers and the thousands of blooming channels that I'm in

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,440
And then I had to fire up hex chat which connected to that and that was fine if I was on my desktop

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,780
but I didn't have a convenient way to do stuff on my mobile devices and

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:09,600
IRC cloud is brilliant and it even has IRC cloud desktop app now. Yeah, which low and behold is electron. Yes, and

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,800
Now I just fire that up login login to any browser on any machine and I'm just there and on my phone and when people

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,680
Ping me in the various channels. I just get notifications on Android. It's just glorious. I'm never going back

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,440
It's great. The mobile support is really top-notch since it's it's server-based IRC

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,800
The server always remains in the IRC room and then the way they're able to send it to your mobile device is pretty smart

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Of course, they have full support for

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Notification settings and granularity there is it's nice

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,080
I kind of every now and then still like to fire up a traditional IRC client that's just connected like a single room

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,520
but

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,520
recently becoming enamored with

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,960
A riot actually. Oh, yeah did for quite a while, but right has inbuilt IRC bridging

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,560
As well as some other services, right?

26
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,320
Right and the cool thing about it now is that you when you create a room

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,920
You can add your own kind of widgets to the room including things like, you know gdocs and everything else

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,800
But what really blew me away was it allows you to add a gypsy wizard widget

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,420
So you can actually have a gypsy conference room inside your matrix room

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,860
And it looks exactly the same okay as a conference room, you know, I tree bridges to me. I love it

31
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,220
I'm really proud of us. We managed to start talking about IRC and we still brought it to matrix. The matrix hype is strong

32
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,780
This is Linux unplugged episode

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,620
213 for September 5th

34
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,140
2017

35
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Oh

36
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,100
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show

37
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,940
It's surrounded by smoke. My name is Chris and this is a less hipster more bearded Wes

38
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,380
Also known as Rekai. Haha. All right. Well, he might take that he might actually take that

39
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,940
Yeah, Wes is out today more on that in just a moment

40
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,740
But let me tell you about what we have coming up on your unplugged program

41
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,740
We have lots of community news Linus passed a few stones and a new kernel

42
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,700
Microsoft is turning Linux into the ultimate runtime and I might be having an existential crisis about it

43
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,680
Heli packer just sent a Linux supercomputer up into space

44
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,980
We may be saying goodbye to Solaris a major feature that all of you have been wondering about is coming to Wayland

45
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,380
finally and

46
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,460
No one's removing some more features and they're pretty sure you don't need them. Hmm

47
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,580
Although I can't imagine life without it

48
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,060
We'll tell you about that and then later on in the show Ubuntu has got something cooking over in New York City

49
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,500
The guys over at canonical have a big party plan a rally you might call it

50
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:54,060
But tell you about that and then we're gonna wrap it up with something that I think maybe when I say it's gonna sound like what?

51
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,180
But stick with me stick with me here for a moment. There is a revolution a revolution in the works and

52
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,220
It's bots and it's not robots

53
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,380
It's not like crazy AI. It's just simple bots that are gonna replace our jobs

54
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,180
They're either they're already in the works

55
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,460
We'll tell you about how Linux is missing out on this why that matters a lot

56
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,620
And maybe how some of us here at JB are trying to make a difference about it

57
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,500
I know it sounds it sounds like almost like talking about VR. I wish it were true

58
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,420
But if you stick with me you make it all the way to the end

59
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,940
I'll try to explain to you why I think that it's gonna come harder and faster than any of us expect and

60
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:41,600
Unlike self-driving cars unlike virtual reality or even just AI and machine learning in general

61
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:49,140
Which are actually now starting to finally pay off after decades, you know, you and I just watched war games. Mm-hmm back from 1983

62
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,060
They were talking about this stuff

63
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,100
But they're actually starting to pay off bots

64
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,980
You're not gonna be like that. This isn't one of those hyped up things

65
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,540
this is gonna be something that scales of economy are gonna ram down our throats and

66
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,100
Microsoft and Google are gonna be the ones making all the money, but we'll talk about that later

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,420
We got so much Linux community stuff to get into a bunch of topics that I want to chat about

68
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,140
But before we before we bring in the Mamba room, I'll just address West couldn't make it today. He had he's on assignment

69
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,260
He's like on a mission

70
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,100
No, no Chris. You're wrong. I've just been slowly killing off all of your co-hosts on all your shows

71
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,840
Very good, sir. Smart move very cling on of you. So he couldn't make it today, but

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,520
We had thankfully beards been been stepping in so that worked out pretty well and I because of this

73
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,340
Totally blaming hashtag hashtag blame Noah hashtag blame West we're gonna

74
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:45,060
We're gonna we're gonna we're gonna punt on the gentoo challenge for one more week. I'm

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,020
Sorry, but look I couldn't I couldn't do it without West here. It's okay if you're scared

76
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,740
It's not that and the value of this is negative. It's just without West here

77
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,300
It's not a complete challenge

78
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,620
So and I got a couple of notes from people in the audience who've been taking the challenge

79
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,260
Most of them are done, but not everybody so I guess I guess not my fault, you know

80
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,180
It's just it just happens so many excuses

81
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,340
Let's bring in that virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hello

82
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,860
Hello hello, it's good to see you. It's good to see you I craves EFS

83
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,060
So let's talk about some some news from Linus

84
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,180
I guess I guess when you get famous even passing a kidney stone is newsworthy at least over at the register

85
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,860
Linus Torvalds has passed kidney stones and squeezes out linux 4.13

86
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,540
There's a couple of interesting things of note in here. By the way, Linus is okay

87
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,500
He said it was seven hours of pure agony. But other than that, he's okay

88
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,620
Here's some changes in 4.13 that I think are noteworthy for all of us

89
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,700
Finally finally, it's almost laughable. It is laughable. It's embarrassing

90
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,740
They finally changed the sifts behavior the default sifts

91
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,260
Which is basically the protocol that Samba uses to communicate with sift servers

92
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:03,700
They've changed it from SMB 1.0 to SMB 3.0 and Linus himself admits. It's embarrassing that we hadn't done that soon

93
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,700
Yeah, it only took a few major

94
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,940
Vulnerabilities to make that happen. It's naive

95
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,700
Now the reason why it hasn't been a major issue is because Windows servers stopped refusing it around Windows Server 2013

96
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,940
Depending on your group policies, so the server would then have to automatically try to negotiate up

97
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,140
But that takes time and then it negotiates to the lowest common denominator that it can get which isn't the best security approach

98
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,300
Here's what our friends at canonical are probably excited about

99
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,380
This also is the mainlining of the app armor code that will tie to

100
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,440
Snap confinement is this wimpy is not to talk out of turn here

101
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,980
Is this am I right? Is this everything we need for app armor to be bolted in? Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a big deal

102
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,860
there's been an ongoing effort to make sure that all of that stuff got upstreamed for some time now and

103
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
There was a tweet by

104
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,340
Dustin Kirkland few days ago who highlighted that two of the canonical kernel engineers are in the top

105
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,820
Committers at the moment because of all of the work that's going on in that space. I saw that. Yeah, that is really impressive

106
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,940
So this is a big deal. This is this is 4.13. I think might also be the

107
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,940
Is this going to be what the future LTS is based off of is that right?

108
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,180
I think it might even land in 1710. I'm not certain

109
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,540
Hmm, but I it'll certainly be at the start of 1804

110
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,540
I I'm I'm not sure but the other interesting thing about 413 is this carries?

111
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,940
Most I think all of the important patches for the GPD pocket to run. No kidding. I missed. Yeah

112
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,840
That's great that now that makes me want one even more

113
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,580
Jeez that is one of those toys that I really regret I couldn't have got at the time because I

114
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,660
Had I really I really am excited by something. Yeah, I have one. It's really nice. I love it

115
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,100
You you do you you have you have I have I have one. Would you be happening to bring it to New York? I

116
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,980
Will be bringing let's talk about that

117
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:06,060
I have I have it on authority from the lead developer of Ubuntu multi that there may be a GPD pocket spin in the works

118
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,120
Oh boy, how about that? That is so cool. So do you I mean just quickly, I mean, are you satisfied with the purchase?

119
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,320
By and large, yes, the the only thing that's a bit sketchy is the the quality of the keyboard. Mm-hmm

120
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Or rather the only bit that's a bit sketchy from the perspective of an end-user is the quality of the keyboard

121
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,120
And I haven't worked out yet if that is universally across all of them or it just depends what?

122
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Manufacturing run you had. Yeah

123
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,120
So well you and I think we'll talk much more about that

124
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,120
But I wanted to cover some news that was happening right now

125
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,120
August 31st posted over at Tech Republic comm

126
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
the Tech Republic reports that

127
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Essentially the way I read this is Microsoft's trying to position themselves as the ultimate Linux runtime

128
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,120
for people developing software on Linux and Windows and this is

129
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,120
Insidious as long as you don't need a GUI of any kind, right? Yeah, good disclaimer

130
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,120
So Craig Lowen, I think is how you say his name. He's the program manager at Microsoft

131
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,120
He's showing off a new feature for the Windows subsystem for Linux. Yep. They're adding features everybody and

132
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,120
What you can do and it's fascinating is you can chain commands together

133
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,120
From different distros and call them from all inside of Windows

134
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,120
So from the Windows command line, you could pipe data output from say Windows IP config

135
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Into OpenSUSE which then could parse it for a few things and then pass it on to Ubuntu which then could do some other work on it

136
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,120
And then send it back to the Windows command line and it all happens under a second

137
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
You've run a Windows executable

138
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,120
You've fed that information into one of the Linux distributions has taken that output and feeds it into another Linux distribution

139
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,120
The chain of commands was relatively simple just in this example

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
But it even included like taking out IP information added color coding

141
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,120
They also demoed the ability to run multiple Linux distros side by side in Windows

142
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Showing windowed versions of Ubuntu and OpenSUSE Leap 42 side by side

143
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Do it using different tools just each in different command prompt Windows

144
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
So as well as allowing users to run bash tools and commands inside Windows

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
The subsystem also allows Windows software and files now to be called from bash

146
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:24,120
So is it just me or I will admit I have a bias in this particular

147
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,120
I can't help but see this now as exactly what Microsoft did to NetWare

148
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Which was hugely dominant in the file server and print server space and authentication and directory services huge

149
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,120
And then Microsoft came in and implemented the NetWare compatible tools inside of Windows

150
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,120
So you could talk IPX you could log into NetWare networks

151
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,120
You could use their network directories for file permissions and provisioning of you could use the groups and all of it

152
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,120
And they just they gave it a they gave it a grade a experience

153
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:02,120
And then they made it really easy to move over and then they just slowly degraded that grade a experience until you just ended up using Windows

154
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
And I could see something similar where they do this

155
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:12,120
But with the real end goal is to get you in to get everything on Azure to get you on to you Windows is the ultimate runtime

156
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,120
All right well if you're going to use Linux if you've got to use that free tarred crap

157
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Then you run it on your machine under Windows 10 in a window and then you run the services on Azure

158
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,120
I can't help but see it this way I can't help but see it as almost as a contempt for the Linux desktop

159
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:38,120
It feels to me like it's a it's a it's a it is a diminishing of the platform

160
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I

161
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Don't know the more they features they add

162
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,120
I really hope the subsystem for Linux would get implemented it would be what it was and it would just stay there

163
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,120
And it would just be a great easy way to run bash which my co-host on Koda radio has been trying

164
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
He says it's not perfect, but it would be a way to do it

165
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,120
but now this this is actually starting to bug me a little bit because

166
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,120
If you are if you are not really very comfortable with the Linux landscape one of the hardest choices is which distribution do I use?

167
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Or how do I main compatibility across distributions especially when I'm trying to develop software and now they've solved that problem

168
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
And they've solved it with Windows

169
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Am I misreading this I mean this feels bad to me. I mean you could you could take the opposite tack and say that

170
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:28,120
They're giving a good command-line experience for these distros which would ease the transition if people wanted to switch to a full-time Linux distro

171
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Yeah, okay, I like that yeah, well are we interested to see how much more

172
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
of the sort of

173
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Polishing of the the rough diamond Microsoft do because there are a number of things that don't work in WSL that I think for many

174
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,120
serious Linux users would be a showstopper and also I still feel like this is

175
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Going after Mac's audience, you know, you know Mac OS these audience and demonstrating that you can have a solid

176
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Linux user space on Windows and provide all of those

177
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:14,120
tools that you know front-end and back-end developers are using on Windows rather than

178
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Leaving for Mac OS. Hmm

179
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Yeah, you you're right. It probably is more of an assault against Mac OS or keeping people stopping the bleeding might be the other way to put it

180
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Yeah, I think yeah, I don't know that many people will come back, but it might stop a few from leaving

181
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Yeah, but if these features keep coming, maybe it will attract some people back. I don't know I I don't know enough about the

182
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Mentality of developers using Mac and what's what's important to them to understand why they would choose Mac over Windows

183
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
now I'm

184
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
I'm curious actually because

185
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,120
obviously Microsoft invested quite a bit again to the whole PowerShell experience and

186
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,120
The fact is they're gonna be dumping that in favor of Linux

187
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Which makes me wonder exactly what direction they think they're gonna go in. Are they dumping it? I don't think so

188
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,120
No, I've not heard that. I mean certainly PowerShell is available for Linux as well now

189
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Yeah, and the thing is is there's a whole there's a whole ecosystem of Windows admins that are are using

190
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Microsoft tools all day long that have no interest in Linux subsystems. So I don't think they could replace it

191
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I mean you could make the argument that they could maybe

192
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Just integrate PowerShell into the Windows subsystem for Linux and just make it one nice big package

193
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,120
Well, there is one more step to this world domination that Windows is driving for it's on the tip of your mind

194
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,120
I know it's the elephant in the room and it's it's

195
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,120
Dominance is impossible unless they implement this feature. Obviously, I'm talking about butter fs support. So

196
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,120
Posted on github this week win butter fs version 1.0. I guess probably wasn't posted this but the version this update

197
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,120
Win butter fs as you might guess is a Windows driver for a next-generation Linux file system and by next-generation

198
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Well, that's that is a very that's a very polite way. It's more like the Voyager of Linux file systems

199
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,120
It's a reimplementation from scratch. So what could go wrong? It contains no code from the Linux kernel

200
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
It should work on any version of Windows 7 onwards. And of course because we like our

201
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Our butter fs beta file systems to go with alpha drivers

202
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,120
This is really the perfect combinations and this guy of course is taking donations to support this work

203
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Win butter fs version 1.0. It has read write support

204
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Win butter fs version 1.0. It has read write support apparently has support for raid 5 and raid 10

205
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
So in raid 6 what could go what could go wrong? What could go wrong?

206
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Have at it everybody

207
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,120
If you want that link is in the show notes for all of those thumb drives you formatted in butter fs and can't get

208
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
on

209
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Windows

210
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,120
I don't I don't know. I don't know how we missed this next story

211
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,120
August 11th this happened and just it flew right over our heads

212
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:03,120
He let Packard sent a supercomputer into space on one of Elon's rockets one of the SpaceX rockets and

213
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,120
On a jono shuttle and it's kind of cool

214
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,120
it's more interesting than you might even think because

215
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,120
The the thing about these computers they usually put up there is they have to make serious modifications and they end up running like

216
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Decade-old power PC processors and you know

217
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,120
They have 16 megabytes of RAM and they have these crazy old AB failover ROMs and all this weird like ancient stuff

218
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,120
So they can't really fully take advantage of high-end computing

219
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
well

220
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,120
We have a Mars to get to and we're not going to get there with

221
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Emacs in our shuttles. Well, and you know, not only that but you know

222
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,120
One of the hardest things to deal with with these supercomputers is cooling if you it's true

223
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:51,120
But it's very cold. Well, so check this out. So this is this HP a HPE Apollo 40 that runs Linux

224
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,120
And it's using their new interconnect memory system and they made no hardware modifications to the server

225
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,120
They created a unique water-cooled enclosure. I'll show you a picture here in a moment

226
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,120
For the hardware and then they develop purpose-built software that runs on Linux that monitors the environmental constraints and

227
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,120
reliability requirements of a supercomputer in space and so normally so normally you'd have to just totally lock this thing down

228
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
You'd have to rugged eyes it you'd have to harden it

229
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,120
You'd run you'd clock everything down you do this crazy cooling and then you go through a NASA testing process where they test

230
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,120
146 different things about it and then they certify it and without making any modifications by using this software

231
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
they could automatically change this the load on the server and

232
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Dial it up or dial it down clock it up clock it down based on radiation levels and things like that

233
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,120
They were able to without making any hardware modifications just doing it in software pass all

234
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,120
146 safety tests to put this freaking super server up into space

235
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,120
Here's a here's by the way. Here's a picture what it looks like. Does that mean that Linux officially has the

236
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,120
The most powerful supercomputer not on this planet it would have to be because we've never we don't do this normally

237
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,120
This is like a big deal and it's sort of a historical event for a supercomputer to be up in space and for to be running Linux

238
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Is awesome and for the greater goal to be well when we go to Mars

239
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,120
We're gonna need to be able to play doom. This is how they're gonna do it

240
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
I'm just waiting for the

241
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
asteroid data centers

242
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Yeah, that's gonna be great

243
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,120
With like with like these just like they'll just go on there and glom on and we'll just orbit around

244
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,120
With like these just like they'll just go on there and glom on and we'll just orbit around and they'll be their off-site backup

245
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Connected via microwave. Yeah. Yeah, that's where back blazes future expansion actual cloud storage space cloud

246
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,120
You ever notice how every website wants to send you notifications is anybody turning those on?

247
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,120
I could only imagine how awful that be if you actually said as an experiment on a system

248
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,120
I'm gonna nuke after like a week. I should just allow all notifications on websites and see what that's like

249
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,120
I think I have mine automatically set to deny all oh, yeah. Yeah

250
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,120
All right. So let's talk about one of our cousins

251
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Solaris seems to be dead as well as the ZFS teams and spark teams that were employed by Oracle

252
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,120
This is a process that's been going on since December 2016 really

253
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,120
When they laid off 2500 people from the Solaris division 2500 people. Holy crap

254
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,120
And then in January another 450 were laid off

255
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
But then get this

256
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
This is so cold

257
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
This week

258
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,120
September 1st

259
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
Oracle employees

260
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
started getting

261
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
FedEx packages

262
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
from Oracle America

263
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,120
Incorporated that you had to sign for and they either sent to the home some were sent to deaths and

264
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
That was the note that was the notification

265
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,120
They were getting laid off is these FedEx envelopes arrived that they had to sign for and there was no pre-warning

266
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,120
So people around the office start getting these packages just random people around the office like but not everybody

267
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,120
And so people start opening these up and like I just got fired

268
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,120
And then the person sitting next to him didn't get a package and they don't know if they're getting if there's this coming yet or not

269
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,120
It's and you sign for it. So they know that you saw it

270
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Yeah, so Simon Phipps, I'm sorry

271
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Simon Phipps tweeted for those unaware Oracle laid off all the Solaris tech staff yesterday in a classic silent end-of-life product move

272
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
It's such a crappy way they're going about it too

273
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,120
And so then people are able to see like that's their standard mo though

274
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,120
I mean Oracle known for handling anything with anything with tech to diplomacy

275
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah, it is true. It is it is it is really true

276
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Now you can wonder if some of these may be able to join some of these developers might be able to join the Illumos project

277
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,120
Which is a you know an open source fork of open Solaris

278
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
And of course ZFS will continue on

279
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:51,120
There's different projects for that but she's Louise just I don't know it seems like Solaris is so here's how you know Solaris isn't

280
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Obsolete even though it seems like it might be toss Linux users

281
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,120
But Oracle knows there's some people that still absolutely need it for their workload

282
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,120
So these these cold bastards are going to run virtual spark on on x86 systems

283
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,120
And they're launching a migration there's they haven't officially announced this new service yet, but they're on October 1st

284
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
They plan to launch this

285
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,120
Move your or your your Oracle Solaris instance to the cloud

286
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,120
And then they're gonna they're gonna emulate spark on x86 which you know, that's just gonna rock

287
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,120
That's just gonna rock and they'll label it as virtual spark on x86 your legacy Solaris app survival

288
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,120
on an x86 spark emulator and

289
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:43,120
People are gonna have to buy it because you know, there's these mission-critical organizational apps that run on these legacy installations

290
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I've seen it myself

291
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
I've you know, I've worked at places

292
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,120
They've used it for weird things like massive statement printing and batch processing jobs and all these weird things

293
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,120
You think there'd be better systems and faster systems for but they're just they're totally dependent on it

294
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,120
And so Oracle's gonna try to get them to sign up for that virtual spark on cloud

295
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Probably great performance

296
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,120
I think I think I think what people ought to do is if you're stuck in this spot

297
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,120
There's a there's a developer we've talked about before Brandon Greg. He works at Netflix

298
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,120
And we've talked about how he's on performance tracing on Linux under really high streaming loads

299
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,120
I know the BSD now guys like to tell you that they run all free BSD over there

300
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
But the dirty secret is they run quite a bit of Linux too

301
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:32,120
And he's he has done lots of great blog posts Brendan Greg comm about Linux under crazy workloads tracing processes

302
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Metrics on Linux CPU usage and all that stuff and he's written a massively comprehensive guide on

303
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,120
Solaris Linux migration tips. This is current. He just posted this today

304
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,120
And he goes through all of it moving to a Lumos moving to Linux

305
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,120
He talks about the future of ZFS ZFS on Linux and open ZFS projects

306
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,120
He talks about observability, which is something that he has a unique perspective on like this

307
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
These are the performance things you should expect

308
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,120
This is how you're gonna be able to if you do these kind of performance tracing and metrics on Solaris

309
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Here's what you're gonna be able to do or how you get that information under Linux. It's it's fascinating

310
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,120
and Maybe very very useful and it's you know, it's coming from this guy who's got a lot of experience

311
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Working at Netflix and he does a piece here that may be more relevant than ever

312
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Zones versus containers, which if you're interested about this

313
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:32,120
He's got a good space on sort of a nice transition guide from a smart guy. Yeah with a lot of experience, but wow

314
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
That's so it's so weird because like I don't know

315
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,120
You know Solaris has literally been around since I've been in the industry

316
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,120
I think I mean I think so I I just it to me it seems like one of those never like IBM's

317
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,120
System 390s like they're just never gonna go AIX. It's just never gonna go away

318
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,120
But Solaris or Oracle is ruthless, I suppose

319
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,120
All right, any guys any any Slayer stories or closing thoughts on saying goodbye to a cousin of ours before we move on

320
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,120
We do have many things to cover

321
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Just very sad. I used to work at Sun used to work on Solaris

322
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,120
1993's my first internet chat room experiences were on some machines

323
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Yeah, this is really the death of Sun is as a as any kind of organizational structure that remained

324
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Honestly the way they let them go just does not surprise me

325
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,120
I mean Larry Ellison is a very famous jerk and

326
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,120
It just trickles down throughout the company and he he set the clock

327
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Yeah, well, you know, hey at least we've got unbreakable Linux. So everybody go install unbreakable Linux because that's the future obviously

328
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,120
That's the way to go known as Red Hat. Oh

329
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Well, so whenever we talk about Wayland the thing that everybody always writes in or comments on an episode is

330
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,120
When we go to Wayland, how the heck am I gonna have remote desktop?

331
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,120
Well, remember remember there's a technology we talked about a little while ago

332
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,120
PipeWire, I think it's called when it may be here to solve our problems. I'll tell you more about that in just a moment

333
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,120
First I'm gonna tell you about ting you go to linux.ting.com to get $25 off a device or

334
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,120
$25 in a service credit if you bring a device and you support this here show

335
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,120
You're still rocking the s6 over there on the ting that way until it dies. Are you feeling like it's time for an upgrade?

336
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Um, not quite yet. Yeah, although some of that new Android Oh stuff is looking pretty good

337
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, like the notification grouping stuff is what I like the most. I think I like the the fact that you can upgrade your

338
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
your

339
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,120
OS without having to upgrade all the drivers. All right, cuz it's the first one to ship with treble. Yep

340
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Yeah, that's what's so great about ting is they're really just mobile the way it's meant to be they get out of your way

341
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:44,120
So I have a Nexus 6 on ting. It's running the day. Oh came out. I got it

342
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,120
It ting doesn't get in the way. They don't have to like skin it with the ting experience, you know, or the ting video store

343
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,120
The ting app store. There's none of that

344
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,120
If you whatever your device ships with that's fine

345
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,120
They don't care if you want to get it from play and bring it over if you want to go grab a device from their store

346
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Their honey badger about it. Just check their BYOD page and here's why it matters

347
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,120
You just pay for what you use you got Wi-Fi where you're at

348
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Then you're not on the ting network. You're not paying for it

349
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,120
If you're on telegram or whatsapp or whatever you're paying for it

350
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,120
You're not on the ting network. You're not paying for it if you're on telegram or whatsapp or I don't know

351
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Whatever messenger you like to use then you're not using SMS so you don't pay for it

352
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,120
I never make phone calls unless I have to like I was just talking about I will call somebody through slack

353
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Through slack before I will use the phone

354
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,120
So I really don't need to pay for minutes unless I have to make a phone call

355
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
So it's just your minutes your messages and your megabytes

356
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,120
It's six dollars for the line and then whatever uncle Sam's cut is and that's it

357
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
You're always in control. You can see your usage at any moment

358
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,120
You can take complete control and set usage alerts and they have a CDMA and GSM network

359
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,120
So good pretty pretty good. Here's my question Chris

360
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,120
When is ting gonna start making phones? I know right the ting phone that way I can just get my updates day one

361
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,120
For non Google devices in the meantime, they are giving away a moto e4 plus

362
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:07,120
You can get in on that go to the ting blog just start by going to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com and thanks to ting

363
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
For sponsoring the unplug program

364
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,120
I'm really excited about pipewire. It's going to solve so many problems if they manage to pull it off and I like where they're starting

365
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:27,120
So a quick recap pipewire is a skunkworks project to potentially replace pulse audio and G streamer with one rebuilt

366
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,120
From the ground up media pipeline like a proper media API for a desktop

367
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:40,120
But it's starting in different areas and I think this is kind of genius so remote desktop under Wayland never been a thing

368
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Wayland don't got time for that is Wayland is a protocol. It ain't Wayland's problem

369
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,120
So that's the thing that's what's really been holding it up is that it's not the job of the Wayland project to implement this

370
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,120
Then you have it then it comes down to like your mutters or your K wins of the world

371
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,120
And they're gonna have to implement something and this is where pipewire comes in

372
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:06,120
It's an API they're building for Gnome remote desktop

373
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,120
It's going to be a service that works with Gnome and it uses Dbus APIs to talk to lib mutter

374
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Mutter is the Gnome window manager and the Wayland compositor

375
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:23,120
They're implementing two new APIs and they're like ones like a screencast one and one's a remote desktop so screen casting is also part of this

376
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,120
And the pipewire stream containing the contents of the system stream will be sent to a system

377
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,120
The new APIs can create full screen streams streams of just individual windows, which that sounds amazing

378
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,120
Which we could totally use that in production and and the form has already been implemented in this code

379
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:46,120
The new API allows for services such as RDP or VNC servers to be piped through this

380
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Which really opens it up to the type of clients you can use there's all kinds of VNC stuff you can do with it

381
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,120
It's not really clear like when this is going to hit mainline Gnome

382
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,120
It could be a way off but there the test codes out there have they said what language it's in

383
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,120
I don't think so. I wonder we'd probably have to whatever pipewire is written in. Yeah, I guess I would imagine, you know

384
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,120
I'm just wondering how Gnome independent it is for other people to pick up. Well, it talks directly to mutter

385
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,120
So you don't yank out mutter yank out any of this and nobody but Gnome is crazy enough to use mutter

386
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Well, yeah, but you could you could maybe write bindings for something else

387
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Um, yeah. Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What do you I mean, what do you think?

388
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:37,120
As I mentioned a couple of weeks back that the, you know, Wayland default compositor system had it built into it

389
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,120
So everyone's free to implement their own version of it. Oh, OK. So it has to be done to the actual compositor itself

390
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,120
You're talking about Weston. So are you saying Weston has is that what you're talking about?

391
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Yeah, Weston had a patch for it a long time ago. Really? Yeah, yeah. I know I don't remember us talking about that

392
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,120
But that's great. And so the problem is, is that people people don't use Weston, of course

393
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,120
So they have to get that implementation in their own compositor

394
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Mr. Wimpy, I'd love to kind of pick your brain about this from a Matei perspective

395
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,120
And the fact that this is tied directly into mutter. You have any thoughts on that and Wayland in general?

396
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Well, it's not so much this tied into mutter, but the more I look at Wayland, the more I realize

397
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,120
If you are wanting to write a Wayland compositor and all of the other stuff

398
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,120
The Wayland compositors that exist at the moment extend the Wayland protocols

399
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,120
That's the first thing. And the second thing is you have to implement much of what X does for you already

400
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:44,120
In each of the compositor implementations. Absolutely. And it feels like a lot of heavy lifting and duplicated effort

401
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:52,120
And in the smaller projects, there is not the breadth or depth of skills to do that

402
00:31:52,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I also agree with that. So I have a concern that if we don't coalesce around some standards that are not tightly coupled

403
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:15,120
To a particular desktop implementation, then some of the desktops that we have could become irrelevant in the next five to six years

404
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Because I still reckon that's the time it's going to take for Wayland to really replace the functionality and serviceability of X for most people

405
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:36,120
I think that's 100% spot on. 100%. And when I see these kinds of things, like this is great, this is going to be great for Gnome users

406
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:45,120
This is going to be really great. But if it is only useful for Gnome and desktops using mutter, then it's always going to be a niche implementation

407
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,120
I agree with Wimpy. We need something that's common across, we really need something common across all the

408
00:32:51,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Well I suppose if they're all talking RDP and VNC, it might not matter in the end, but if we have varying implementations or varying levels of performance

409
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:08,120
It's the exact kind of shitshow that Windows and Mac never have to deal with. It is almost the prime example of a Linux shitshow

410
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:18,120
That causes hassle for system administrators, end users, and everybody to understand, and it causes a difference of development time

411
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:30,120
So on that point, imagine this then, I'll be devil's advocate, what if this move towards Wayland and the technologies that are being developed

412
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:38,120
With most momentum to support this new way of doing things are coming out of the Gnome camp

413
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:46,120
What if all we're left with at the end of this is Gnome and also KDE because they're able to keep pace with this

414
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:58,120
What if the Linux desktop is Gnome, so just like Mac OS and Windows, there is only one desktop environment that you have to now focus on in order to target Linux

415
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Is that better or worse?

416
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:09,120
Well here's where I begin to get a little concerned. This alarms me a bit because you could see it going this way even if it wasn't as black and white as that Wimpy

417
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:20,120
But say all of the enterprise market, all of the business market ran Gnome, the dev ops market runs Gnome

418
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:28,120
Where it's such a huge percentage that it becomes the only relevant one in terms of industry, which we could already be sliding in that direction

419
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Not in terms of community weight, but in terms of industry weight

420
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Given that Mood 2 has been dropping Unity in favor of Gnome, it hardly makes Gnome niche applications does it?

421
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Well that's true. See the thing is, the more I hear about Gnome, the more it feels like a hacked together desktop

422
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,120
And you will need somebody that really knows what they're doing to give you a good Gnome experience

423
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:01,120
So there's an update on Alan Day's blog about status icons being removed from Gnome 3

424
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Have you guys heard about this in Gnome 3.26, status icons going away?

425
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:14,120
You know, the ones like your Dropbox icon, your Skype icons, your Discord icons you might have right now as you're listening to this show, VLC

426
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:22,120
If you want to keep them, the official recommendation of the project is to install top icons extension

427
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:29,120
I think that may be a Wayland limitation actually, because I noticed when I switched to Wayland, my icons just disappeared

428
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:36,120
There's a few, they say this long term the change will be good for end users, they're going to provide a better experience

429
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,120
It goes into some detail, here I'll give you the rationale before we go too far

430
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,120
The main reasons relate to two things, they think it will be a better experience for users

431
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,120
And it will align with Gnome's wider design philosophies and goals

432
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Which is always a great one, so they're going to implement new APIs, notifications, MPRIS which is media playback

433
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Search providers and libcloud providers for things like file sync

434
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Here's their core rationale, the design of status icons goes against Gnome's principles

435
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:11,120
They know from observation that people often only care about a small fraction of their status icons that they are exposed to

436
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:16,120
But the rest that just get stuck in there don't reflect their interest or any of the activities they're doing

437
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,120
And it stems from an old status icon API and the ethos behind it

438
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,120
Users do not opt into status icons

439
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
How do they know?

440
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Well, observation they say

441
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,120
What usability studies have they conducted to back up that point?

442
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,120
What usability studies have they conducted to remove all the other features that they've removed?

443
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
So this is where I'm going with this

444
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,120
Shouldn't that be known from the Gnome extensions at all?

445
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,120
Because I'm not tying to your individual desktop

446
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Can we pause for a moment though and can we have a discussion about the fact that

447
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Perhaps one of the most relevant Linux desktops, the official recommendation of the project

448
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Is if you want that basic functionality, install an extension

449
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,120
And that to me doesn't feel like a sustainable good route

450
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Like we can't have our most, like this stuff has to be, some of this stuff has to be, it can't be extensions

451
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
It has to be baked in

452
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:14,120
Well yeah, because if you think about the knock-on effects from that, every time you update your Gnome desktop

453
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
If the extension is not updated, you don't have status icons anymore

454
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
And talk about ultimate fragmentation

455
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Just a support nightmare, a standardization nightmare, a developer targeting nightmare

456
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,120
You have no idea if a user is going to have a status icon

457
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,120
Again, I want to pick your brain, Wim, because I know you guys over there at Canonical have been

458
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Churning out this 1710 desktop, working with Gnome

459
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
You guys have got to be coming across stuff like this

460
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,120
You know, with the dock, to status icons, to testing Wayland

461
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Is Gnome 3 not it?

462
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,120
Like are we going all in on something that's just, it's hacked together with extensions

463
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,120
Mudder is a performance hog

464
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Like I'm JavaScript all over the place

465
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,120
I know I'm hitting typical Gnome talking points

466
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,120
But we are really on the precipice of something here

467
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
And I'm curious what you think about it

468
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Being right there on the front lines of implementing a modern Gnome desktop right now

469
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,120
Well, I'm not on the front lines of implementing Gnome

470
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Okay, near the front lines

471
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,120
You're much closer than the rest of us, let's put it that way

472
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
I have some sight

473
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:21,120
I don't know what the position on indicators are with regards to the Ubuntu implementation

474
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:29,120
I imagine that we will find out in fairly short order what with Gnome 3.2.6 coming along next week I think

475
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:36,120
And we're obviously releasing our first Gnome based desktop a month after that

476
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,120
So it remains to be seen

477
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,120
There are some rough edges that we're running into

478
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:54,120
You know, we're seeing some processes are crashing way, way more than we've seen in the past

479
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:00,120
There are some Gnome services that have a colossal number of duplicates that are crashing in the same way

480
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,120
And that's because we have a lot of users

481
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:09,120
And there are a lot of users that are very interested in the 17.10 release

482
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,120
So there's lots of people that are banging on it even at this early stage

483
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,120
But that gives us the opportunity to use those as data points

484
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,120
And identify where the rough edges are and where development effort needs to be focused

485
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:27,120
And as I understand it, there are good lines of communication upstream

486
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:34,120
So if we've got good data to support investigation into stabilizing particular pieces

487
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,120
Then I'm sure they'll be open to us helping do that

488
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
We have a new update

489
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,120
Is it didrocks? Am I saying that right?

490
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Yep, that's his handle. Yeah, Didier

491
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Yeah, didrocks.fr

492
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:51,120
He's been posting these basically road to Gnome updates

493
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,120
And day 9 is talking about the theme

494
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
I like it

495
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,120
I can see it getting iterated on a bit for the LTS

496
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
I can see some areas for iteration

497
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,120
But it looks really good

498
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,120
It looks a lot like the Unity theme

499
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
But a little more modern, a little more pro

500
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,120
It has sort of that Gnome 3 polish to it

501
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,120
I really like how this is turning out

502
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,120
And I really like getting these updates too

503
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:29,120
I was fortunate in that I was at the fit and finish sprint in the canonical offices in London a couple of weeks ago

504
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,120
And Didier was there and other members of the desktop team

505
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,120
And we had some feedback from the community as well

506
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:44,120
So we saw and helped this sort of take shape over a couple of days there

507
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,120
And there's still some work to come to refine it a bit

508
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,120
But it's looking like Ubuntu now, isn't it?

509
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,120
Really? Yeah

510
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,120
I already saw some people getting all worked up about the Amazon button there

511
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Yeah, well, it's inevitable, isn't it?

512
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,120
We could actually dedicate a whole other show someday to it

513
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Perhaps we will

514
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Because to me it's nothing like the old Surge

515
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,120
It's a great way for Canonical to make revenue

516
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,120
Yeah, if you're going to go shop on Amazon

517
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,120
A lot of people use Amazon

518
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,120
It's a clean looking theme

519
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,120
And I think it's going to be a great implementation of Gnome

520
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:29,120
And I know you've been following Didier's posts about how we're using some new facilities

521
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:37,120
To segregate the settings for the vanilla Gnome session and the Ubuntu session

522
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Okay, so talk about that a little bit

523
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
Help me crystallize that in my head

524
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Right, so this is all happening in GLib

525
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,120
It's a new feature there

526
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:55,120
So most of the GTK desktops have this ability where you have default configuration

527
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,120
And then you can override it with your distribution or desktop settings

528
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,120
And at the moment, for example, there are certain things where Ubuntu set things up in stock Ubuntu Unity

529
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:12,120
A particular way a Mate might have the same keys but configure them differently

530
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,120
And Ubuntu Budgie may also configure the same keys differently

531
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,120
So when you install the three desktops beside one another, they clatter

532
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:26,120
And you don't necessarily get the Budgie experience on Budgie and the Mate experience on Mate

533
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Because it will be whatever settings got inherited first

534
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,120
So not only are we using this ability to namespace settings

535
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:40,120
So now each session has keys that are specific to the session it was launched under

536
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:49,120
And this is how you get that customization under the Ubuntu login versus the vanilla configuration under the Gnome login

537
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:56,120
But Word was put out to the Ubuntu Mate team and also to the Ubuntu Budgie team

538
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Because we are using the same mechanics to configure our default experience

539
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:08,120
And now we are able to namespace our configurations so the Mate stuff doesn't tread on Budgie

540
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:13,120
And doesn't tread on Ubuntu and doesn't tread on the default Gnome configurations

541
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:20,120
So this mechanism goes far wider than just segregating Ubuntu's

542
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:23,120
That's great! So it's sort of a flavor-wide improvement

543
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,120
People are going to use it

544
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:32,120
Yeah, and then all the flavors that are can jumped on, well not all, but the flavors that can jumped on, that's awesome

545
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:39,120
And then the theming that you see of Gnome Shell is an extension, well not an extension, a Gnome extension

546
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,120
But it builds on that technique

547
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,120
So the Gnome Shell has its own CSS to style it

548
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:52,120
And when you log into the Ubuntu session it looks for a different named CSS file

549
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,120
So we don't have to mess with the default styling of Gnome Shell

550
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:04,120
We have our own separate styling and that's what's used to style the Ubuntu session

551
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,120
I would love to see more distributions, take that on

552
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,120
I'm looking at you Antair Gross

553
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,120
I think it's going to happen because this is a new capability

554
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:22,120
So we're using the final dev versions of GLib in order to do this at the moment

555
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,120
But that's all about to get released alongside Gnome 3.2.6

556
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,120
So this is stuff that will be available to everybody in a matter of days

557
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:37,120
And other distributions are going to be able to take advantage of this and they almost certainly will

558
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:44,120
So 17.10 is going to have support for all known driverless printing standards

559
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,120
I don't even really know, I don't grok that fully

560
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Gnome 3.2.6 and possibly maybe we'll see kernel 4.13

561
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Possibly

562
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,120
So I know a little bit about the driverless printing stack

563
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:05,120
So there's a specification that means that printers these days don't have to have all of their own bespoke drivers

564
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:09,120
They implement a common printing language

565
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:18,120
So printers that support this you don't require a big hefty lump of cups drivers and filters and what have you to make them work

566
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,120
So the guy that looks after all the printing stack in Ubuntu

567
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:29,120
Who just so happens to be like the world authority on cups and printing in general

568
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,120
He's like this amazing guy who's dedicated his life to just doing printers well

569
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,120
He's put the whole stack together so driverless printing just works

570
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:45,120
So if you've got these modern printers they just magically appear and you can just print to them without any setup or faff

571
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:51,120
You know they should give it a name like the common unified printing standard

572
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Well that's the services that power it all but there's another spec for actually in the printers to define how they operate

573
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Very cool well that actually sounds like it's going to make things one of those just works experiences when you have a modern printer that supports that

574
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,120
Which is probably, every time you have a win like that it really impresses people

575
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:17,120
Like it really endears them like you imagine you sit down to use Linux and you go oh crap time to add the printer

576
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:24,120
And you go in there and it just kind of shows up yeah that sells Dells that's what that does

577
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:29,120
That's great okay well so don't go anywhere MP stand by

578
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:34,120
We have a rally to talk about but let me get a moment in here with DigitalOcean my friends over at DigitalOcean

579
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:41,120
I love it I love DigitalOcean for all of the reasons that every single day here at Jupiter Broadcasting we find them more and more valuable

580
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:46,120
You can get spun up in less than 55 seconds they have all SSDs for all their machines

581
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,120
The virtualizer is a Linux box running KVM oh Linux powered

582
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:54,120
You know every software that we don't run locally Chris is on DigitalOcean

583
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,120
It is I know it's just so solid

584
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,120
People watching the live stream right now DigitalOcean

585
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:04,120
We will talk maybe more about this later but when you have a service like this that you can integrate into your business

586
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:11,120
When they make an API an actual priority it really is it's a game changer for us

587
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,120
Because not only is there just a ton of open source code to let us remotely control our DigitalOcean infrastructure

588
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,120
But we've been able to write our own around it

589
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Our bot is DigitalOcean inception because it runs on DigitalOcean and also starts DigitalOcean droplets

590
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:27,120
That's awesome it has lightning fast networking 40 gigabits into the hypervisors

591
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,120
Highly available block storage you can just add up to 16 terabytes as you need it shows up as a block device

592
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:37,120
Load balancing as a service pre-build open source apps ready to go or you know build it from scratch

593
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,120
Don't forget about the crazy storage stuff Chris

594
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:47,120
Yeah they have their storage these days is such a cool way to play around with things like ZFS or even ButterFS or LVM

595
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,120
And then at the end of the day just destroy it all

596
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,120
And you didn't have to go out and buy hundreds of hard drives because you can attach these things as individual block devices

597
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,120
And you can start messing around with the storage managers and do some cool stuff

598
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:05,120
You know if you're going to get into like high end CPU intensive stuff you need to do a batch of a bunch of image processing or video processing

599
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:15,120
Or I'm not going to judge what you're doing they now offer really powerful CPUs with the Skylake Xeons and Broadwell Xeons with like hundreds of gigs of RAM

600
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,120
But they all start like five dollars a month my favorite rig is three cents an hour DigitalOcean.com

601
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:27,120

605
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
Heyo!

606
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:54,120
So the Ubuntu Rally is an event taking place in New York City September 25th through the 29th

607
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:59,120
It's like a five day hackathon and

608
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:04,120
I'm I'm really excited because I think it's gonna be the like the timing of the event

609
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:10,120
Is with the new Ubuntu 17.10 and all and you know Mark's back as the CEO he's gonna be there

610
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:16,120
It's I think it's gonna be I think it's gonna be a pretty big event but Wimby's gonna be going Wimby's gonna be there

611
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,120
What do you think Wimby is this something is this something that I should definitely try to make it out to?

612
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,120
Yes

613
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,120
That's hoping you should definitely

614
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
Good because I'm planning to

615
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,120
No no is that because of the contents of the rally or you just want to see the hair?

616
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,120
No I just want to see Wimpy

617
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,120
No I'm talking to him

618
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:44,120
So yeah Chris is in a unique position where he can you know look at this with observers eyes and also see you know how the sausage is made

619
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:53,120
So the event itself is very much you know developer focused and it's a sprint a five day hackathon sprint

620
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Composed of major software vendors Ubuntu engineering people from every level of the stack and community contributors as well

621
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:15,120
And it's a doing sprint so there is going to be a lot of furious energy and activity this week

622
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:24,120
So we've got a lot of people from canonical going we've invited some people from around the community to attend

623
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:32,120
And we have because space is limited we have some slots remaining for non sponsored places

624
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:39,120
Which basically means if you're local to New York or you can arrange your own travel and accommodation

625
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Then let us know if there's something you really want to work on and we'll review those proposals

626
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:53,120
And if we can accommodate you we'll extend you an invitation to join us

627
00:50:53,120 --> 00:51:00,120
That's not a funded invitation that's a you can you know get in the room because we have a limited space

628
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:07,120
And we can't just have people walking in off the street and filling the filling the place up because we have got a tight schedule of stuff

629
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,120
And it's a it's meant to get work done yeah exactly yeah I'm going to be a fly on the wall when the work happens

630
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:17,120
Because I don't want to interrupt that I just want to observe and I'm I'm I'm paying my way I'll haul my way there

631
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:24,120
And and I think that's going to be a I'm hoping a good chance to like wimpy said not to see how the sausage is made

632
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:31,120
But rekindle connections that I haven't met I haven't seen some of these people in person or met them in person

633
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:37,120
But only talk to them online like also many great opportunities around that I watched your your your short little vlog crazy

634
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,120
I was super excited about it I was yeah well you know it's it's it's funded I love to travel

635
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:48,120
So any chance I get to travel I'm down for there's there's a lot of buzz around this at the moment

636
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:54,120
And you know that there's some interesting people coming along who are from outside the company as well

637
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:00,120
So it will be a rare opportunity to sort of see those interactions anybody you want to name or do you want to just leave it vague

638
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:09,120
Well there are some some large companies coming who I don't want to name at the moment because I don't want to steal their thunder

639
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:18,120
And then there's also people that we do know in the community so the likes of Aiki Doherty from Solus is going to be there

640
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:27,120
The elementary guys are going to be there KDE representation is going to be there

641
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:34,120
So you know a lot of those those people in the community that we're working alongside some Gnome developers going to be there

642
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,120
I hear there's going to be some more work on Wayland and high DPI taking place

643
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:47,120
And then you know IoT manufacturers and PC OEMs you know getting their input on the direction of the desktop

644
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:54,120
Active community contributors and

645
00:52:54,120 --> 00:53:03,120
People working on snaps and you know language and ecosystem developers you know people that are working on the new generation of languages and stuff like that

646
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:09,120
You know this sounds like it might be a good way or a good place to talk about some of that Wayland standardization stuff

647
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,120
You know it could be something that gets discussed

648
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:23,120
So I was wondering so does Canonical have offices in that area was New York picked because it's a high profile location that people can get to like what's the story there

649
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:32,120
You know my understanding is that New York was chosen because it's a hotbed of technology companies in the area and companies that make it

650
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,120
You think that was the main reason yes.

651
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:46,120
Yeah I will that'll be my first experience of New York I've never been so I've always wanted to go never thought I would sleep in the truck when I went to New York

652
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:54,120
Pretty intense Chris So if anybody's got some New York tips for truck camping I've got I've got a tip for you Chris Yeah don't sleep in the truck

653
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:01,120
Yeah I know I know I think before I go I'm considering maybe I should get my front windows tinted my back windows are tinted but you know I gotta think about these things

654
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:10,120
Be prepared for complicated driving that's all I can say Yeah but you know you know I am I am I am

655
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:17,120
Well you gotta remember this is a city that's only a couple like couple miles across and it's got a higher population than some states

656
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:24,120
I've been yeah I've been through some bad traffic so I'm not too worried about it because I can be a monster you know I can

657
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:30,120
This is next level Watch out for Chris New York New York needs to worry about me That's what I'm saying

658
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:37,120
I can't wait to see that city crush you That's going to be a vlog right there Yeah that is going to be a vlog The whole thing's going to be a vlog actually I think it's going to be

659
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:43,120
You know I'll try to vlog the trip there and as much as they'll let me run the camera I'll sneak around and try to get my vlogging done as I can

660
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:50,120
Don't tell Wimpy that though because he might I heard nothing Good good Well I'm I'm really looking forward to it I think that's going to be a good event

661
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:57,120
And I'll report back and I'll go for the audience and let them know what it was like I've always wanted to kind of see how you guys do that too

662
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:03,120
And it's a good way to sort of show some of the community involvement I think that's sometimes overlooked

663
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:11,120
All right I want to talk about something that I think is is a is a potential missed opportunity for Linux

664
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:19,120
We've talked a lot a lot about a lot of things though So if there's something something we talked about that you want more experience with something that you think might be an area of interest

665
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Especially what we're about to get into I want you to consider going to Linux Academy Linux Academy dot com slash unplug you sign up for a free seven day trial

666
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:35,120
And you support the show Now it's a platform that's built by Linux enthusiasts to teach people more about Linux and they've done some really smart things

667
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:43,120
They have probably the most sophisticated courseware virtual machine infrastructure that I've seen on any any online site

668
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:51,120
It's it's particularly built for Linux users You choose your distribution the courseware in the virtual server match that you can SSH into the box

669
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:59,120
It gives you an address to connect into you can use whatever you want to interact with that so it's nice and smooth they have hands on scenario based labs to give you real experience

670
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:05,120
And course planning Yeah that is really nice for busy schedules or if you got a particular thing you want to learn and instructor mentoring

671
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:15,120
So if you do get stuck and you need that human touch they've got it practice exams before you go take the big test flash cards that are forked by the community which is stacked full of Jupiter broadcast

672
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:24,120
You remember stacked these flash cards and they're stacked Oh I did that I did that I did that they also have Android and iOS apps that you can study on the go

673
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:34,120
And speaking of studying on the go they also have offline content you can like you know listen to when you're not connected to the Internet or maybe while you're driving or you know doing the dishes

674
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:42,120
It's it's great and you can go in there just really wrap your head around anything you want to learn because they break it all down for you and easy to process chunks of time

675
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:50,120
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged Big thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the program Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged

676
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:58,120
So the bots are coming and they really are I mean they're coming and it's not for like the stuff that we think like customer support

677
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:06,120
And all these external facing things where you chat with a bot to get help Yeah that's coming too but that's that's not that's not what I'm worried about

678
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:18,120
That's old school bots Yeah that's that's basic B bots right there That's basic bot That's what that is It really is actually I think the future our bots like our friend Michael Dominic has created over at the mad botter dot com

679
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:32,120
And he's made a bot called Alice Here's a free plug for you Mike It's it's a PMO It replaces the PMO You know maybe not for like a large large large company but definitely for like a small team or remote team

680
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:43,120
You never know it could scale Yeah and it's it does all of the project follow up and all of that even does the client follow up when they haven't paid bills like it's it replaces the PMO role

681
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:57,120
And it's it's so obvious when you think about it because you have these huge back end infrastructure where you can like Microsoft will give companies like the mad botter free credits to run on their serverless architecture

682
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:13,120
Where it just fires off batch processing and then gives you the results Amazon has something similar So does Google All of these are proprietary back end infrastructures But these bots that are actually useful like we have a few we talked about here on the show

683
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:29,120
We're building more It's going to start replacing the compute jobs jobs where you're taking data from one field and trends and translating entering a different field where you're working with spreadsheets or approving documents

684
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:43,120
A lot of the back end work is going to be handled by bots stuff that we attributed to human jobs stuff that we think is more like you know the blue collar work that isn't going to get replaced by automation too soon will be replaced sooner because these bots can be controlled and built and innovated

685
00:58:43,120 --> 00:59:01,120
And it's all the buzzwords all the buzzwords way faster than any of these actual physical robots that we're building or a eyes because a eyes are supposed to be these all purpose intelligent machines but bots are very task driven They have a set of things they have to do and they can do them really well

686
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:19,120
We had a great email that came in Dakota radio weeks and weeks ago And this guy was really stuck in a hard spot He was in a total moral problem because he essentially botified his work He created a bot a basic bot that automated 90 percent of his job

687
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:36,120
And he was basically only working 10 percent of the time and the error rates had gone down so far that this guy had to introduce a little used the modified the bot after a certain point to start reintroducing error rates So it looked like human work and he's like what guys what do I do because if I tell them this I'm basically out of a job

688
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:54,120
Yeah and he's that he is a sysadmin He's an I.T. worker And they're all built on like these Microsoft and Google frameworks Linux is like out like there's Mycroft out there but that's not really happening This you know this would have been great if Mycroft could have gone in this back end direction Mycroft is more generalized

689
00:59:54,120 --> 01:00:13,120
It's more like Alexa as well Yeah Well you didn't trigger it That's amazing Cancel Somebody else right What do you think Am I Am I Am I I'm worried that Linux is missing out on what is obviously going to be a huge moneymaker for developers for people running the back end services

690
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:32,120
It's going to need a lot of deployment of back what I really I should probably round this out because I get so excited about this and I miss out major pieces I want around this out I think the type of bots that are going to be successful will be the internal company bots ones that maybe have slight rough edges but do their job

691
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,120
And they're built internally they're hosted internally or they're hosted using like these Microsoft services

692
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:52,120
They're not customer interfacing They don't have to have perfect understanding of human English If you just go through the right steps you get it to do what you need Yeah you just need a purpose built bot that can connect into all these APIs So I think it's these internal bots

693
01:00:52,120 --> 01:01:03,120
They're going to go pervasive throughout companies and replace a lot of data processing and input and these kinds of jobs just like a virus

694
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:14,120
And the problem is right now I believe the best like built ready to go Here's an API and all runs on Windows

695
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:30,120
And we've been following the story on Koda radio and it seems like they're getting a lot of traction with it like it's becoming to be a part of Microsoft's business now I think it's only going to be a problem if we let it become a problem though because like it's not particularly difficult to write these bots

696
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:47,120
It's just nobody's doing it Right well I think it's going to it's going to be like the app gold rush This is like the next app rush Yep All right anybody in the Mamba room want to take another side or want to contribute a bit and have any thoughts on if Linux is missing out

697
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:55,120
Sort of like you know we've missed out on some other trends some of which like VR have sort of fizzled others which seem to be holding more and more getting more traction

698
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:13,120
No I don't think Linux is going to miss out because I do agree that bots are a new wave of technology and services are going to be deployed on top of bots but they'll be available through discourse and slack and telegram and WhatsApp and all the rest of it

699
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:23,120
So I don't know that we're going to be excluded from that I was thinking more from like an infrastructure standpoint I'm more worried about Amazon and Microsoft They're already there super serving giving away credits

700
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:36,120
You can you know if you're a small business they have like these you they have these programs you sign up for and they just they give you hours and hours of free runtime Yeah locking the developers into their platform and I'm really yeah that's where I'm worried we're missing out

701
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:45,120
It's not so much getting access to interfacing with the bots but being the back end infrastructure sort of like you know how Apache and that whole lamp stack was such a boom for Linux

702
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:53,120
And in a big way the economy has to like a lot of these apps that are on people's Android devices and phones they're connecting the Linux boxes on the back end

703
01:02:53,120 --> 01:03:03,120
But in this case is these bots they're connected to Amazon they're connected to Microsoft and in Microsoft case they run on Windows and if you want on premise you also have to run Windows

704
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:07,120
That I'm worried about

705
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,120
You're supposed to make me feel better about that

706
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:22,120
No I'm thinking about it and I don't have any soothing words for you right now Yeah it's it could be one of those things where there's going to be something that really kind of comes together like you could actually see Matrix playing

707
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:35,120
Speaking of Matrix you could see Matrix playing a role in this even and that being run on Linux Yeah I I'm officially making a call out to awesome Linux developers to make awesome bots on Linux Yeah well let's get started

708
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:56,120
We're working on some Yeah our bots run on Linux Yeah well we're rewriting our bots to be more task oriented I guess Yeah breaking it out Yeah to be more focused on individual tasks and spread across more platforms so we can replace a lot of the manual things that we do

709
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:09,120
Yeah I think for a lot of us we won't even know like it'll be an internal thing that happens like the audience never knows what we use bots for to automate like it's just a it's a transparent thing so it's going to be a it's going to be a very silent revolution

710
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:24,120
One day one day J bottle just show up on Discord and you can do all the things there Yeah you know this is great when we do projects like this because it it's a great way for people to get in and work with us and have where there's there is a novelty for a community to rally around and work together on

711
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:45,120
And it's a great way to get involved in open source projects I know it's very self serving for me to say that but if you do want to check it out Discord dot me slash Jupiter colony and look for the Jupiter dev channel And on top of that for anybody interested tomorrow at six o'clock we'll be having a audio and text based developer meeting for this stuff specifically

712
01:04:45,120 --> 01:05:04,120
That would be Wednesday September six at six p.m. Pacific time Correct We could put it on the calendar if you remind me All right And then people could just get it converted Yeah and I'll stop plugging but the thing that is appealing to developers developers with these bots is you get to work against a set of document documented

713
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:25,120
APIs and integrations So it's sort of like the breadcrumbs are laid out for you and the companies have a lot of momentum behind these areas So it's it's sort of a sort of a fun area to get into And the sort of like also you have what do you call a bumper when you have those bumpers in the bowling alley What is that called just called bumpers

714
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:41,120
Yeah sort of like yeah it's like bowling with bumpers Everything's there it's documented for you You have a community that's already structured together They're rallying around a common cause And all you need to do is write a plug in on top to interface with whatever you want to use rather than write the whole stack

715
01:05:41,120 --> 01:06:03,120
I just can't I think back to that I.T. guy Who he was he replaced himself with a bot that did so good It did better than he did I think And he was worried about getting caught so he had to I think that he actually shouldn't worry because even if it replaces him there needs to be somebody to maintain that bot Yeah that was I think part of my advice on code or radio if I recall

716
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:22,120
Because you're right Yeah somebody I said maybe the bot could fix other problems too What he should pitch is he should go and show them his bot and tell them that it can replace all these other people Well that was part of his conundrum is there was I think three other people involved in verifying the data and when the data was perfect they didn't have anything to do

717
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:38,120
And so he was essentially working them out of a job too and he felt bad about that was another reason he introduced errors Is it he so he had the sys admin they got the systems talking to each other and did the data exports and tried to then move that into like an excel file and he would do that by hand

718
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:49,120
And then handed off to these these three ladies I think it was what he said in his email I can't remember now that would then go through an air check it and fix it against the master data or whatever I don't know I barely understand the process

719
01:06:49,120 --> 01:07:08,120
And he replaced all that Yeah I think in a couple years I think jobs are going to be a very different concept There's going to be less doing the work and more maintaining the things that are doing the work Well that could be good you know that could be Yeah but that also means there's probably going to be less jobs

720
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:20,120
I suppose if you think about it in a weird way it has enabled us to do more in the studio with less people Yep You know there's less things for me to worry about when I'm setting up a live show because with one command I execute like four different things in the background

721
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:36,120
Mm hmm That's pretty handy It's only a matter of time until I figure out how to automate video editing Chris Well we just need some sort of like sonic marker every time there's a every time you hear the bell you just make an automatic edit you know like if you could do with NIT TV and commercials back in the day we should be able to do with JB shows

722
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:46,120
Yeah but who's going to be able to figure out the most embarrassing clips to put in at the beginning of the shows That's true that's true well we need machine learning for that part you see All right Beardsley where should people find you throughout the week?

723
01:07:46,120 --> 01:08:00,120
Over at twitch.tv slash rkylep or twitter.com slash rkylep Well a big thank you to Wimpy for making it I know he had recording and he was recording his show check him out at Ubuntu Podcast anywhere else you want to send people Wimpy?

724
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:18,120
No just Ubuntu Podcast we've recorded the sessions where the winner of the entryware Apollo laptop is announced and all of the entries that people created it's fantastic Cool and also if you're an interested developer to New York Yeah yeah let me know if there's any New York stuff any New York tips for me

725
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:30,120
All right we'll see you back next week Wes will be here for another episode this was Lucky 213 we got through it so far thanks for joining us see you next week

726
01:08:48,120 --> 01:09:12,120
Oh shout out to Caster Soundboard playing under Solus using a snap taking us in and out of the show officially the first time we've had a snapped version of Caster Soundboard on Solus that worked really well by the skin of our teeth

727
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:36,120
Yeah by the skin of our teeth but we got it we did actually get it that was fun all right so what do we get for titles? What do we get? Well you guys I wish I wish I had a way to capture what it's like here today so I woke up and it was ominously yellow outside it was very yellow and we have essentially all of eastern Washington's on fire in parts of Oregon

728
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:53,120
It is it is brutal how many if Harvey wasn't going on this would probably be a national story it's less yellow now it's more of like a jaundice yellow yeah now it's turned jaundice as the day has gone on but when the sun is lower higher in the sky it's this weird eerie and there's smoke everywhere and it's snowing ashes

729
01:09:53,120 --> 01:10:08,120
Well even when the sun got high in the sky like up until like noon it was it felt like it was like dawn or dusk yeah oh yeah and but it's also it's 90 degrees today so it's extremely hot and humid yeah and very humid it's wet in here I think we're near 50% humidity

730
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:23,120
And so Angela said she's having chest pains today from the smoke because it's so thick and when I'm driving around it's I'm driving through ash like there's been a volcano it's really it's really something like when my car sits the truck sits it gets covered in ash

731
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:44,120
Pipewire pipe dream that's pretty good Stonic that's pretty good butter smooth very tuned his loan luck solar solaris sunset oh son was here wow you know the worst part Chris is because of you we are under a wasp attack and I have to have my room window closed

732
01:10:44,120 --> 01:11:00,120
No no the screens don't you have a screen I do but somehow the wasp still got in oh why this other screens will work alright anybody else have an off the cuff recommendation for a title the bots are coming is the top one but was that really the was that the thrust of our conversation.

733
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:03,120
I don't know if people are going to be into that.

734
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,120
If you saw that with that would that entice you to listen.

735
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:26,800
I would have a comment about the status I can see straight thing you mentioned oh yeah we never had that we never had that with enlightenment because the reason was the developers said that there was never a clean implementation following the free desktop standard so they never really implemented it.

736
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,520
What about known which I find.

737
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:46,740
Sorry no you're right go ahead sorry I thought you were done finish your thought no I found that very interesting because for years people were asking for a sister in the enlightenment desktop the developers always say there was never a clean implementation so we don't do it.

738
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:54,580
It is funny how sister icons have been this ongoing nonstop problem really since unity.

739
01:11:54,580 --> 01:12:19,440
Well it's because everybody creates their their own version of it and there's no standardized implementation it's maddening it's mad well no there is so KDE came up with the status notifier got what the I stands for status notifier indications or something and that's what the Ubuntu indicators are based on it's the same specification so why isn't enlightenment using that then no no don't know.

740
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:38,880
So I guess this is the part I meant to put in the show because here's what I but I was I was distracted by the other things about no I want to say but here's the problem with their new approach I think their new approach is solid if everyone that writes a gnome application starts using their new API is the new for API is they've made to replace.

741
01:12:38,880 --> 01:13:08,840
Trey icons the issue is gnome doesn't have that kind of weight we've seen this over and over again now with gnome 3 they make these changes that are great if the entire world is writing applications only for no which is happening more and more but it's not the state of the Linux desktop and so that's why this is a problem and so they're essentially forcing the hands of the majority of no users to use top icons at least for the foreseeable future until developers update their GTK applications and let's be honest the developers that are going to update their GTK applications.

742
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,680
Are the most passionate GTK apps and they're also the ones that are the most feature.

743
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,640
Mmm what's a polite way to say this.

744
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:39,400
I don't want to say the rich well I would say there I would say your apps that are most feature rich get updated the slowest unknown and your apps that here's another way to put it your apps that are newer and still missing features how about that thin and light yeah okay yeah that's I'm trying to be nice about it because they're going to get there eventually but I'm you know look at Polari or look at the new known photos or look at known games.

745
01:13:39,400 --> 01:14:09,160
The known calendar these are all early days applications and these are the applications that will update to support the new standard the ones that have the minimal amount of use and classic applications like Thunderbird you know and lightning the calendar and all and Firefox aren't going to aren't going to support the new APIs and users will suffer from the way they phrased it it kind of sounded like maybe they don't want a lot of these apps to update because they think that the tray the tray icons are too cluttered so maybe they just are expecting a lot of these to not update.

746
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:22,040
Not have tray icons so I submit it as a title something about known I can't remember what I suggested what was it you know Chris your your name is known takes over that was my title suggestion known takes over.

747
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,080
No how about known does it again.

748
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:35,600
No I don't we don't have to be incendiary but it seems like people would listen to that you know I'll be honest ever since we talked about New York all I can think about is bacon pancakes.

749
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:48,640
I'm sweating bad so we got to come up with a title because we are dripping it is so wet here and hot that's the best thing about Washington is just so humid it's so great people talk about Florida Florida worse than this because geez geez geez I'm sorry guys that's rough.
