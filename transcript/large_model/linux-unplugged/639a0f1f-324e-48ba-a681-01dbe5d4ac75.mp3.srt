1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
How

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,720
How much of your Bitcoin stash have you still got left Chris or have you exhausted it yet?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,960
I haven't exhausted it yet, but I am starting to get more picky about how I spend it. Yeah, I've

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,240
I've

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,800
Depleted mine by about eight and change Bitcoin this last week. Oh, what did you oh really and and and I worry

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,760
See, I've been watching the price. In fact at this very moment. It's at six hundred and twelve dollars and eighty-one cents

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,200
U.s. Not that I'm following not that you're not that I'm multiple tickers on your desk

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,920
But why why would you do you want to share the class with the transaction was because that sounds like a big chunk of Bitcoin

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
I mean, I gotta look that up. But let's see eight

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,160
Bitcoin can you can Google do this eight Bitcoin in USD? Is that five grand?

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Yeah, it doesn't doesn't do it when you type it in but I wonder if I could ask Google 8 BTC is you basically five

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,420
Grand. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, just about yeah

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,420
Wow

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,620
That's some buying power and that is I

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,820
Have been tempted to cash mine in for a very large laptop recently. I've been thinking more about doing production on the road

16
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,180
Oh, that'd be cool. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is this is how much is that Acer 21? Just curious

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,220
I don't know what the price is. I don't know if they even have a price yet. It's probably not out

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,260
Yeah, they probably don't have an announced MSRP. So is it is it a was it a laptop wimpy?

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,460
two laptops Oh

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,480
Wow, you were all of a sudden the in them in the hardware

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,300
Yeah, yeah

22
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:34,540
So I I haven't had much hardware for a long time and then this year um has been a blowout year for new hard

23
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,380
Yeah, sort of a restocking. Yeah, I've been selling stuff as I've been going along. Oh good. Yeah

24
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,620
Yeah, I've got the I

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,420
Haven't got it yet. It should arrive tomorrow. Hopefully the

26
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,820
The top of the line Dell XPS 15. Oh, that's nice

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,740
Yeah, and also the Dell XPS 13 developer edition. Are those both sky-like or both sky-like? Yeah

28
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Mm-hmm. That'll be interesting. He's gonna be development machines

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
Yes. Yes one one

30
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,660
for mobile stuff and

31
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,020
And one for around the house sort of

32
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,160
dev work and

33
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
To and from family and stuff like that

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,800
But I really wanted something with them 4k screens and touch to to experiment with so

35
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,500
So yeah

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Congrats about accessories as well. So that'll be interesting. Were you able to take advantage of Dell direct using Bitcoin?

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
No, I went through

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,780
some local companies that are part of the Dell outlet program

39
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,340
Interesting. Yeah

40
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,220
Whoo, that'll be really cool. But great. It'd be great to hear your thoughts on them

41
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,520
The I know for me

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,740
I one of the reasons I pulled the trigger on the XPS 13 was that high DPI display because that that was a game-changer

43
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,740
For how I do my reviews, right?

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,060
Wow, I think I waited too long even mm-hmm, but maybe I don't know it kind of depends Linux is also kind of dragging its feet

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,140
So you you got yours last year. Is that right? Mm-hmm

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,900
Yeah, yeah. Okay. I couldn't remember if it was last year's all the years but it blended to one now

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,500
And you got a windowsy version that you adapted with the adapted as a polite word

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:28,300
Yeah, I pulled out the wireless and I put an Intel card in and then I installed Linux. Yeah, it's interesting actually reading reading because um

49
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,660
There's been lots of firmware updates for these devices

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,660
Which you sort of have to apply and some of them you can only apply through Windows. So

51
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,100
Bust out the trial versions of Windows 10 in order to update all the drivers. That's a matches and firmware. Yeah, I know

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,740
The BIOS you can do but it's like the Thunderbolt firmware and touchscreen firmware. You can't do outside of Windows

53
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,580
But it's interesting how many people that are running Windows actually say swap out the Broadcom

54
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,100
For an Intel adapter because it yeah. Yeah, that was much simpler when I did that

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,680
Yeah, yeah, but but it's not for compatibility with drivers

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,860
It's just the Intel stuff works better than the rural cum stuff or at least it did then when it was sort of new

57
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,740
I think it's all been resolved now, but yeah, it's interesting to see some of the parallels between the two communities

58
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,900
Yeah, it's funny because I I really really like my expert

59
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,500
Yeah, XPS 13 is as turt as far as far as size and right portability goes but

60
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,020
Man having now now having worked on some desktops some newer refreshed desktops again

61
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,260
I really feel like the there is some serious advantage to a large machine

62
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,300
I can maybe I could maybe have a much more portable workload where I could do more work

63
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,260
We're usually less limited by things. You don't have to think about it. Mm-hmm

64
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,980
Mm-hmm your manual example, you know, you have a lot going on at once. Yeah, and so

65
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:56,420
I would there is so to buy that laptop in Bitcoin. Did you have to convert it first or were you able?

66
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,060
How did that so I'm wondering if like you were able to avoid like brexit induced

67
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,540
economic depression like type conditions

68
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,860
I can't tell you how how valueless our currencies

69
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,900
And that's why Bitcoin could look even more attractive at this moment. Yeah. Yeah, so for both transactions

70
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,460
I was able to keep it purely through Bitcoin which was a key part in actually being able to do it. Yeah. Mm-hmm

71
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,980
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah

72
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,060
I wonder

73
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,940
but for anyone for anyone listening in this part of the world specifically in the UK and you're interested in Bitcoin and you need an

74
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,940
exchange that is reliable and works

75
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,060
there is an exchange called coin corner and

76
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,700
You can move your money in and out of a Bitcoin wallet

77
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:49,620
No problem whatsoever and cash out no issues pay in it's really really simple works very well

78
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,680
So they're a semi offshore. They're in the Isle of Man, which is sort of a tax haven

79
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,820
and

80
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,940
Independently governed so a good place to put your Bitcoin

81
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:11,940
This is Linux Unplugged episode 161 for September 6th, 2016

82
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,420
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's not all that interested in tomorrow's Apple event

83
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,100
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

84
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm glad you're here today because apparently Linux doesn't take Labor Day off. Nope. We have a lot to cover

85
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,940
In fact, the show this week is packed full of updates from some of our favorite open source projects all over the net

86
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,060
Including a little suspense

87
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,380
Including a little distro review. Oh and even some Waylon love it is a classic episode of the unplugged program

88
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,420
So super excited to be here. We're back from Labor Day. You didn't miss a beat Wes

89
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,580
You are on top of with tons of links this week

90
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:06,900
So we're gonna go through all of those so brace yourselves mentally and let's bring in that mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual lug

91
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,580
Hey, oh

92
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,860
Hello guys, so Wes is over here rapidly tap tap typing away on his computer where he has once a gun

93
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,420
Trying out another distro for us to discuss here on the unplugged show. So that'll be coming up in a little bit

94
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:29,220
I'll give you a hint. It might be the best KD desktop ever. It just might but you have to stay tuned

95
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Yeah, we then might not it might not

96
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,940
You never you never really know, but why don't we start out since I just hinted with a little KD news

97
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,180
Or a little KD review. How about we start with a little KD news?

98
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,260
Speaking of Waylon speaking of KD. I just threw them all together in a sandwich and that is our

99
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,020
first update this week the KD neon developers are switching to

100
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,260
Wayland

101
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,100
by default

102
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,340
Yeah

103
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,580
Yeah, you're ready for this now you guys remember neon that's the more a cutting-edge version of the KD desktop that sets a top

104
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,100
of Ubuntu

105
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,460
Now they're gonna start moving forward for their developer unstable packages to use Wayland by default now

106
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,740
There's gonna be some conditions here. There still has to be some work done on X X Wayland

107
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,260
Plasma 5 8 is required

108
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,760
There's some other upstream updates that have to be made and also if you're on Nvidia, you're still gonna be using X

109
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,760
It's gonna default you back to X, right?

110
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,280
But the Wayland is getting nice

111
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,220
So we have this we have this story here from the KD neon project and then here's another story for door 25

112
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,880
Technical technical advisory board for Fedora has given the thumbs up for Fedora 25 to ship Wayland by default if they want wow

113
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,580
Now the developers could still choose not to just like they did for 24 because they got the same approval for Fedora 24 and they

114
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,520
Decided to punt it

115
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,720
But it's been given the go by the FS CEO as we all like to call it around here

116
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,640
Which stands for fedora engineering and steering committee? I guess of course yeah, obviously

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,960
so they gave it the green light they say they agree to go with Wayland by default and

118
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,720
They'll make it clear how to switch back to x11 in the release notes if needed that was part of their requirements by the technical

119
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
board

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,600
Fedora 25 will be using gnome 3.22 by

121
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,960
Default and it's currently scheduled home to ship on

122
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,560
November 8th assuming there were no delays there will be never delays never delays, so let's take a moment Wes and

123
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,620
Envision a future where fedora 25 actually ships

124
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,780
With Waylon, let's just pretend like this actually happens

125
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,680
All of like the major major major issues are fixed

126
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,440
What's the first benefit you're looking forward to when you can boot up one day and Wayland is by default

127
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,240
It's turned on ready to go. You're no longer using X

128
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,840
What what what that day changes?

129
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:55,920
I'm gonna be able to watch a show a YouTube video to one of my co-workers without being embarrassed by the screen tearing yes

130
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,920
That's it for me. Yeah, in fact one of Wayland's taglines has always been every

131
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,640
Frame is perfect right that would be huge

132
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:09,960
Yeah, the famed like control it you know if I'm using MPV or something else where I can really and where it knows

133
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,860
What's what it's doing?

134
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,080
I don't really have that big like day-to-day watching problems

135
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,680
But there's just always those videos or it's coming from an old flash client or something. It's just

136
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,520
My computer is powerful enough. I have the GPU for it. It just looks like crap

137
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,400
Yeah, that was gonna be my pick too does anybody else in the mumble room have a big like this is why I'm waiting for

138
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,440
Wayland because you gotta ask yourself. What's all the excitement about it's gonna be a huge change things are gonna undoubtedly break

139
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,280
Is there is there something on the other end of this transition that you're looking forward to for me?

140
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
It's definitely the screen tearing thing

141
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,080
I wonder if you know if anybody else in the mumble has any go ahead and jump in I was just reading there's a thread

142
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,160
On on the fedora subreddit that talks about it

143
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,680
They also you know this is a good one to multiple monitors with different DPI

144
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,440
So you can have a high DPI monitor and a low DPI monitor and have a multi monitor set up that's like

145
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,880
That's it's kind of embarrassing actually on Linux if you have a high DPI laptop with a with an internal screen

146
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
It's high DPI, and you hook up an external monitor the external monitor

147
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,760
Is is that as it is at a much lower resolution than you would like it's it's really kind of you know

148
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
It's even more embarrassing what what?

149
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,080
Microsoft Office failed you high DPI on a single monitor on Windows

150
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,240
That's embarrassing. Well. Yeah, I mean the wind yeah, the Windows platform is not there's no excuse for that

151
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,680
I know Microsoft's part office should work perfectly on Windows with high DPI. Yeah. Yeah, that is but yeah, I

152
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,360
All right besides the besides OS 10 everyone has their problems there. I think

153
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,720
Guys, I got a crack one open before we get into this next story because this is not the headline

154
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
I expected to ever read on this show

155
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,720
Adobe is updating the flash player using the Netscape plug-in API

156
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
New version of flash is coming everybody

157
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,320
well

158
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,060
And I was trying to think about this why why would they why would they do this William?

159
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Do you have any guesses why Adobe would do this I?

160
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,720
Mean besides Firefox support. I don't know does Firefox have any like workaround for dealing with that if they didn't do NPAPI

161
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,760
Well, I guess Firefox could probably adopt them the PPAPI if they wanted to which

162
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Well Chrome and chromium are using the PPAPI already yeah, so it was opera yeah

163
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,280
So here's a couple other things. They're just noteworthy. This is a really odd like

164
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,080
understated

165
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,120
They don't make a big deal about the fact that they're totally reversing the position that they made in 2012

166
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,120
This is really odd, but one of the things they do mention is

167
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:45,120
Because this change is primarily a security initiative some features like GPU 3d acceleration and premium video DRM

168
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Will not be fully implemented

169
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,960
Hmm. Mm-hmm. I wonder what their angle

170
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:58,240
What this has to pressure for there has to be so there has to be some sort of contract or or some sort of agreement

171
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,300
I mean so one of the things that Adobe had done is they said they were gonna stop updating in

172
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,120
2017 for security purposes, maybe this is just an easier way to do security updates

173
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,740
Possibly because that's what they're focusing on, but I almost wonder if there was some sort of vendor

174
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,140
Product that shipped using Linux and there was there was a contract in place

175
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,180
Oh, maybe and Adobe's like well if we have to do this work anyways

176
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,660
Yeah, I'll ship because I don't think Mozilla has any interest in keeping it around

177
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,780
Here's what it's got to be someone else using it. This is what grinds my gears though

178
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,020
If these bastards at Adobe

179
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:38,220
we're gonna spend all of this time and all of this back and forth and all of this rigmarole on getting flash on Linux and

180
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,860
supporting an old Netscape plug-in API and back porting features from their Windows and Mac version in the Linux version to make it stable and

181
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,860
Secure again, which can't be a small task

182
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,500
They were like, why is this what they choose to spend their time and resources on right?

183
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:58,660
Why aren't they doing Photoshop or Premiere ports or after effects like spend your time and energy there you jerks

184
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,180
Not on the flash thing let flash die. Maybe it was easy enough. It was just oh, all right

185
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,420
We'll kick the cron back on and they'll build that for him and upload it to their web server

186
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,140
Ah, so yeah, that is that was a story that caught my attention this week and I just you know facepalm

187
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,860
Well, I'm glad in some respects. I'm glad we're getting security updates for flash

188
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,540
I mean it is better to have them to have not I just hope it doesn't like

189
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,940
Grant some legitimacy to people still using flash or not without a migration. Oh, I think it does

190
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,300
Yeah

191
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:30,900
I think it does and I think part of that is because the industry hasn't fully replaced the functionality that flash offers still feels

192
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,500
Like one or two years away. Mm-hmm. That's just crazy. You know, it also is an

193
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,300
Interesting little read that I think you caught this is from somebody named Carl

194
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,340
And he's a software engineer and he likes to be considered an aspiring artist

195
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,060
Oh, and he ran into a little extended for bug that I thought I'd just share with the class because it's particularly interesting

196
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,900
He said after buying and setting up a shiny new four terabyte hard drive

197
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,480
I began filling it slowly with files from various old hard drives. I have we've all done this. Yep been there

198
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,820
I have he says and I so I went through I found like an old website I had when I worked in high school and decided

199
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,060
Why the heck not why was so much space should I not just keep track of all of this?

200
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,460
It's gonna be easy. So I started copying the files over and I started getting a strange no space left on device air

201
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,820
He says hmm. This is odd

202
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,460
I have this huge hard drive and I'm just trying to move over an 18 gigabyte website directory

203
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,860
He says as it turns out I ran into a bug with extended for that causes it to fail if there are more than

204
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
32,000 files in a directory

205
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:31,580
so he goes on to say by the way really what you should probably do is do a little bit better file management and not

206
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,060
Have so many files in the root of a directory

207
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,940
But I guess that you know, I I toss that in there mostly as a PSA

208
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,640
This is probably not something most of us think about but I think the real lesson here was

209
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,980
Do better file organization plan to have your files stored in a hierarchy from the get-go

210
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,500
Don't have flat folders with file explorers that just when they when you open it up

211
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,540
They just totally die because they can't read all the files

212
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,300
William do you have a sense of what this particular bug is? Oh

213
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,220
It's kind of a built-in limit, I don't think it's really a bug

214
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,220
He just hit a limit at a limit of ext4

215
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,060
No, just has a limit of storing 32,000 entries in the inode will be you had experience with this

216
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,960
It's it's not a limit. It's a bug

217
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:22,960
So really? Yeah, so I got hit by precisely this issue about

218
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,520
Four or six weeks ago at work and we figured out the problem and fixed it. So very quickly

219
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,320
In the transition from ext3 to ext4. Yeah, I knew

220
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:43,720
hashing algorithm was added to hash all of the files in a directory in order to accelerate the lookups and

221
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:51,600
Theoretically that hash should be good for a massive number of files in a directory

222
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,600
But in reality, there's a limitation in the implementation

223
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,160
It is a bug that means you start to get hash collisions after about

224
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,880
50,000 files or or you can start to get hash collisions after about 50,000 files

225
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,560
And we were backing up a large directory a single directory that was full of files millions of files

226
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,840
And the issue was is that the actual server was running ext3

227
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,660
The backup server was running ext4 and our backups were failing

228
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,540
Because we were running into this hash collision and and if you look into the kernel messages, it says dir index

229
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,600
Out of range or full or something like that

230
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:41,000
So our solution was to change the backup server from ext4 to X

231
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
And all of our problems went away

232
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:52,040
One of the favorite and file systems here on the show everybody thinks that we're on the ZFS payroll

233
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,120
I've been accused of yeah being but if anything it'd be the XFS camp

234
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,840
Which who even who even is the main was SGI back in the day?

235
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,960
Wasn't it? That's it? Yeah, I don't know. I think it still is SGI engineers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow

236
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Thank you ships us by default, right?

237
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Yeah, I think so what extended for I

238
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,740
Have the full you know, I will put the full link to the post in the in the show notes

239
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,560
Between a rock and a crazy place. It says Wimby while we have your ear

240
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:32,120
I wanted to do a follow-up from our discussion last week about installing Ubuntu touch on the Meizu Pro 5

241
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,760
because you came across like a pretty solid piece of

242
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,000
Instruction like it's a PDF that kind of has everything you need

243
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,600
Yeah, a couple of guys in the Ubuntu community have basically pulled together all of the information that I you know

244
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,980
I sort of read they've pulled it together into one PDF document with links to all of the

245
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,660
Files and utilities that you need so you can start at step one and work your way through and at the end of it

246
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:05,060
You have Ubuntu running on a Meizu Pro 5. So it's a PDF and I've got it linked in the show notes

247
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,300
How has your experience been going now another week into it?

248
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:14,060
Yep, very good still works. No issues discovered still finding my way with you know, the

249
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
touch experience and

250
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,980
Updating some of my own apps and still finding new apps along the way

251
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,580
So I'm good and working working out what I'm gonna do to sort of help improve things. Oh cool

252
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:36,700
So how does the podcast playback situation? Is that is podcast player Bluetooth audio? Is that still rough? Hmm? Yeah, so

253
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,920
I could use it. I can use a headphone jack. I'm not an animal. I'm sure I'm sure that every Ubuntu touch device

254
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
We'll have headphone jacks for a long time

255
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:52,320
Yeah, so if you use a headphone jack, that's just fine and I've updated my so I say I've updated my

256
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,720
There's a guy who was maintaining a pocket casts web app. I've published my own pocket casts web app

257
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,280
Which is a little bit more updated and we'll keep

258
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,680
Will not interrupt the playback of the podcasts for example and things like that

259
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,120
So I'm using that for local playback because I can just you know resume

260
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,320
It's got you know staked between all of my other pocket cast setups

261
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,080
But I desperately need to actually write up a number of sort of feature requests and

262
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:32,840
Enhancement ideas for pod bird because what I'd like to do is actually move to the native pod bird player which can play

263
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,040
Podcasts just fine. It's if you if you listen to a lot of podcasts

264
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:47,240
You know what the rough edges are in terms of the user interface and and and using it navigating around and that's sort of

265
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,440
Stopping me from adopting it that and the fact that Bluetooth in the car doesn't work at all

266
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,640
Yeah, disappointing but that'll come I think and

267
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,680
Yeah, there's there's bugs for it and I've I've added my information to the to the bug tracker on that one

268
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,520
So there are people that are aware of it. It seems to have a high priority

269
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,320
It sounds like there's a couple of different options for playback of podcasts. So that's nice. I

270
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,760
Was pretty close to trying it out on my Nexus 5

271
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,940
I got the process started, but I didn't have time to let the Bantu flash tool finish going

272
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,040
Oh, that's gonna happen again when I have a little more time dedicated to it. It would have been really cool

273
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,840
That's I was trying to get the multi boot image to work, but no luck

274
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,520
That's the way to do it too. So that way if you really had to you could still go back to Android, right?

275
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,560
I see that's like to all booting with Windows though. You know, it is risky. Yeah, it is. Yeah

276
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,400
It's I think you've used this analogy before it's like a recovering alcoholic, you know, if you leave

277
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,920
You leave a a bottle of beer out on the on the desk somewhere and you can see it

278
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,560
You'll be tempted to drink it right the first time things get really hard

279
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,140
I'm just rebooting for Netflix. That's fine. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it starts with the Netflix

280
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,020
No, it does

281
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,700
So yeah remove all of those temptations

282
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:09,340
I've I've actually reset my my Android phone, which is still doing pocket casts, but it's just all it's got is pocket casts

283
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,180
I haven't set up any of the eyes on it. So that's a good way. I kind of mean and I've also you know

284
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,420
moved all of the

285
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:24,580
Two factor authentication stuff onto the Ubuntu phone, you know, because that's kind of when you do that you there's no going back

286
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,300
It's like right. This is my device. Now. This is the one I'm using

287
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:35,620
Interesting I'm following wimpy I'm following this because you know, I'm looking at I'm looking at the Nexus 6 something and one of these days

288
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Android one of these right?

289
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,260
Speaking of mobile. Let's stop for a second and mention our first sponsor this week

290
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,500
And that would be the folks over at ting

291
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,660
What a fitting moment to talk about ting because that's exactly where I'll be taking my Ubuntu touch device

292
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,340
I do know folks that have run Ubuntu touch devices on ting for like

293
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,540
I

294
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Think it was a two-week period

295
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,060
To run a boot to touch but then I actually ended up on the Nexus 5 finding sailfish OS to work a little better for me

296
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,780
Ting does not mind any of the ting is really great. It's super simple wireless

297
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:11,220
they they have CDMA and GSM service, which is wonderful because you can pick whichever works better in your area and

298
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,300
You can get a great discount if you go to the linux.ting.com

299
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,980
You support the show you get a discount off your first device or if you have a compatible device that works on their GSM or CDMA

300
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,100
Networks then you'll get $25 in service credit ting just charges for what you use

301
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,900
$6 for the line and then your usage on top of that. They got real human beings that actually help

302
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,020
They're geeks themselves and they actually help which is sort of an amazing thing to be able to say about a company

303
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,700
They have a whole range of devices from exceptionally well-priced phones up to the really crazy high-end expensive ones

304
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,340
The ones the ones that we all drool over they've got great tools to manage your account

305
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,420
one of the things I really like about ting is

306
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,800
They don't really have any agenda other than just offering you a simple wireless service

307
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,460
So they the way they've set it up here is you can use ting as only a phone provider

308
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,700
You could use ting as only data

309
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,300
You could never text if you use something like telegram and never pay for text message or just only text

310
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,620
Maybe you love texting well

311
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,940
And I do know a couple of people who I've mentioned before that have the SIM cards in

312
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,020
Little devices that are connected to their alarm systems

313
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,740
Oh, yeah, and they text them when there's movement or things like that and it can just be the simplest thing and that's all they

314
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,940
Use it for and they get what five text messages a month. That is cheap. Yeah, it's so cool

315
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,380
Go to linux.ting.com to check them out

316
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:34,180
Also, you don't even have to be a ting customer taking advantage of some of the cool stuff on their blog. They've been doing unboxing giveaways

317
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,820
Usually it's like a matter of leave a comment on Facebook

318
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,020
Subscribe to the YouTube channel leave a comment and you're entered to join to get a potentially free phone, which is really cool

319
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,060
But they've also been covering all the different types of cord cutter problems that you might run into

320
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:54,460
So if you're a cord cutter and you want to get sports or you want to get news or you want to get the CW shows

321
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,980
They've been doing a series of blog posts on that and that's not really specific to being a ting customer

322
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,100
they're just geeks and this is the kind of stuff they're into and you might

323
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,020
You might just want to go there to check them out and just learn more about like in

324
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,540
In a piece down here where they talk about football

325
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:15,340
And they do a they do a little mini review of the sling TV service which I use to watch a food network and history

326
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,940
Channel and live news at home where we don't have any TV service

327
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,820
It's pretty cool, and they do a review in there

328
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,820
And it's really applicable to anybody that might want something like that

329
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,580
So it's kind of a nice to go over there

330
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,420
You can you can learn more and you can before you hit their blog you can support the show by going to linux.ting.com

331
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,820
And then jump around and learn more about ting try out their savings calculator read their blog

332
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:43,940
See how cool those people are linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

333
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,420
That's linux.ting.com to support the show

334
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:51,380
Well, mr. West I can't believe that Adobe story like that's still right

335
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,880
That's still like rattling around the back. We were beyond this as a community

336
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,140
And you know what else I thought we were beyond is this trying to trying to get a government approved backdoor into encryption

337
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,620
And I think this is gonna be a major problem if this goes forward for open source software

338
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,700
This is something that we briefly touched on in the roundup in tech snap last week the

339
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,820
FBI director James commie is

340
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Positioning for a

341
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,140
reopening quote-unquote of the

342
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:27,500
Quote encryption debate because right now it's dipped below public consciousness. He says and he thinks in next year

343
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:34,500
He's gonna wait to 2017 because next year. We can have a quote adult conversation in this country about it

344
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:41,500
You want to install backdoor encryption and that would it would be a it would be a regulatory thing

345
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,500
So that would mean if you're shipping software that uses a type of encryption in the US in order for it to be legal here

346
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,500
You would have to follow these rules potentially and that seems like you could have huge consequences

347
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Question what?

348
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,500
And this has got a bit of conspiracy bacon here, but why is commie?

349
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Wanting to wait. Why not do this debate right now? Is there?

350
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,500
Something else that's more important than that

351
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Well, I think he I think he gives away his motivation when he says next year

352
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,500
We can have an adult conversation in other words once we're past the election year because everything in an election year gets crazy

353
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Let's have a let's have a conversation right now about it

354
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,500
You know, well, I think that's what I'd be saying

355
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:38,500
I think I think the technology community is simply of the opinion. This is just a bad idea for all kinds of reasons

356
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,500
We've been at there's no such thing as just a government backdoor

357
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
There's back doors that can be taken advantage of but just for so frustrating because it feels like

358
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,500
It's like they're not listening on the other side, you know, you're like, well, okay

359
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:54,500
We can have this conversation to have you have you answered our other big point that we kind of have been asking you about

360
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Well, I guess what I'm worried about is

361
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:03,500
What we're not talking about what we're not talking about is the impact this will have on the legality of open-source software

362
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:10,500
The impact this will have on the adoption of open-source software in companies that have government contracts or government agencies themselves and divisions

363
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:23,500
if all of a sudden things like Tor and I don't know what a name a Lib Lib vault or Libre vault or you'll sink thing or all of these things all of a sudden have to have back doors built into them

364
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,500
Well, there's gonna be a huge portion of these software developers gonna say no, I won't do that right plus now now

365
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,500
The technical the technical aspect of how that gets implemented. Is that gonna be GPL code? Like how does that exactly work?

366
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Yeah, it can't be like some sort of proprietary thing that gets bolted onto these GPL projects. So

367
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:52,500
How the hell does open-source exist if this ever becomes a reality and here's why I worry about it is because they do not let up

368
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Every single terrorist attack. Oh, yeah, it's encryption going dark. They're using that evil telegram

369
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,500
They're creating their own encrypted applications for communications cybercalifate blah blah blah

370
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:10,500
and then there's a and then anytime there's an attack the encryption is once again the conversations brought up and it does kind of worry me and

371
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
the other thing is is that

372
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,500
It's not just commie. In fact, I think one of the reasons why James commie is having so much luck with pushing this conversation

373
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Amongst legislators and whatnot in the US is our counterparts over the European Union have expressed similar initiatives last month

374
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:32,500
The French and German interior ministers called on the EU to implement measures forcing encrypted app manufacturers to develop back doors

375
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
for use by law enforcement officials

376
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Would effectively make end-to-end encryption where only the center and the recipient have access to transmitted data illegal in Europe

377
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Yeah, isn't that that seems wild?

378
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,500
It's happening on both ends of the pond right now. They come in for my full disk encryption too. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. That's terrifying

379
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I don't it does feel like open source isn't hardly considered because it's like yeah

380
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Well the government can strong arm that you know come you can get your Microsoft's and your Apple's and your Google's to do this

381
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,500
But how you gonna get the Libra vault developer who lives in Russia to do it? Yeah, exactly

382
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,500
And you can't I mean are you just gonna have more laws that we just?

383
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Pretend and look the other way when you acknowledge that you're not really gonna be able to stop your citizens from using it and then you

384
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Just turn them into criminals is open source software that doesn't have these

385
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Mandated backdoors become illegal. Do you is it does it become a crime to use types of software like that for communication?

386
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I don't know. Where does this end? And that's why it's kind of got me worried because in particular

387
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,500
We are having we are having the conversation and people like Bruce and I and other loud voices in this debate are are

388
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Coming out strongly against this concept

389
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:41,500
But the but there's nobody advocating it from the open source perspective of how this could and if you at this point

390
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Damaged open source in a certain like to this degree would probably have a negative impact on the economy. Mm-hmm

391
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Seems pretty maybe we maybe we can be you know those

392
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Advocates in that or at least the starting forces, you know, I think you give us too much credit

393
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Damn it we can try let's let's go back to something that's more in our realm because yeah

394
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,500
There's only so much shouting of the wind we can do on that particular issue, but the issue has been raised

395
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
I thought this is pretty cool

396
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,500
KTE software is coming. Oh, that's right

397
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,500
It's gonna be a store soon to offer downloads in snaps flat packs and app image formats. Wow

398
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Yeah

399
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Dub the Katie each store the new software store is exactly that a store where application developers can publish their own open source projects and

400
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,500
Share them with the world also known as the Katie software store

401
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,500
The migration from the open desktop to our services to the new Katie software store has happened in the background

402
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,500
It's been going on for a while now and a Katie developer blogged about the new software store on his personal blog revealing the fact that

403
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Users might be able to soon download their favorite open source applications in the new snap and flat pack and app image binary formats

404
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Which was which is pretty damn cool and it's it's nice because we've seen the gnome software center

405
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Sort of get pretty wide adoption on the GTK side of things

406
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
There's

407
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Not a great answer for the KTE plasma desktop side of things. There's some different solutions like the muon software center and things like that

408
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,500
But one like KTE quote-unquote. Yes official store is great and I I remember

409
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Talking to Aaron years ago about some of the back-end ideas I had for this which were pretty bright

410
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,500
So I think it could be it's been stuff's been in the works and hopefully this is a good

411
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Good push through and people can use it anybody the mumble room have any thoughts about the new KTE software store

412
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,500
And again when they say store, I bet you almost everything there's yeah gonna be free. It's a weird model for open-source

413
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Why say store? Is that just because of what they think people will understand that analogy better?

414
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Well repos a scary word. Maybe they couldn't think of a better word like boutique. Oh, yeah

415
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
There's only so many good words that's boutique was taken

416
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:56,500
The software center has taken to I still think boutique would or something would be weird compared to store because you're used to like

417
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:01,500
The Google Play Store the App Store those kinds of things, right? That's where I think it comes from

418
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Yeah, something something big marketing be different

419
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Katie big list

420
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Yeah, go ahead

421
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,500
If I might offer I think the software store given that people are looking for app stores, etc

422
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,140
And there is such a thing on the gnome side. I'm not a KTE user myself, but I

423
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,500
Widely would accept a software store even if it's not monetizable

424
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,500
And if it is that's great more app developers well, I mean and it leaves room for that later and making some money

425
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,040
Yeah, I mean it leaves a room for later on for them to come along and say let's sell this

426
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,300
And as long as they like do a good job on the back end

427
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,020
Yeah

428
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:50,620
Chris here's another thought how long won't be until the other desktop environments

429
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,500
Get their own stores or boutiques or whatever you want to call it like

430
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,140
For example the X F C E shop. No, no

431
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
Store no

432
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
There will be and there will there will be

433
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,380
It's not gonna be called the Pantheon store, but you're you're barking up the right tree there. Yeah. Yeah elementary already doing that

434
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,580
They've already got their App Center. I think they call it. Mm-hmm. All right. Yeah

435
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
and

436
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,780
So that's that is I think good for Katie because kind of by my estimation there

437
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,060
They were sort of I was kind of looking like where's their official solution here

438
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,320
So there we go the KTE software store and downloads and snap to

439
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,140
You know, it's been weeks. I can really haven't heard really any big

440
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,900
snaps

441
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,540
No big flat packs

442
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,780
Like there's no been there's not there hasn't been an ounce would have some big project or or anything like it was build up to

443
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:50,020
But then we haven't really heard anything for a bit. Maybe we're an incubation period people kind of trying them out making more of them

444
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:55,780
Maybe even using them. Mm-hmm. Maybe it'll be interesting to see what kind of distribution like for those three, you know

445
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,060
Well, they have mostly at one kind mostly snaps. I

446
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,820
Don't know. Hmm. Yeah, which ones will be the most popular all those. Yeah, maybe we get stats on that. All right

447
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,800
Well, let's let's move along moving on because I caught something caught my eye

448
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,420
Over at elementary.io speaking of this of the elementary OS desktop

449
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,360
There's a countdown going two days 19 hours 22 minutes and seven seconds as we record this year show I count down

450
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,320
Yes, right now just like last time it's gonna be for a new release. Hmm. Why would you give them?

451
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
I don't know miss Wheeler. I don't know

452
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,400
Hmm. I don't know. She's yeah, probably likely. I don't know today. We'll find out two days

453
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,720
I remember I I broke the news in the chat room the last time they did it so sweet Lou breaking the news for us

454
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,440
Maybe they're just merging with Apple and Apple have some big news for us

455
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,180
That's a good one that's a good conspiracy that they're merging with Apple. Yeah, I like that

456
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,280
I'm gonna I'm gonna guess it's probably not that yeah

457
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,320
Well, I'm gonna say that if that were the case, they probably wouldn't be the ones making the announcement

458
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,560
Yeah, of course. They're smart. They're smart because if you work, yeah

459
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,680
It wouldn't suspect a thing if it was gonna be merging with Apple would be announced tomorrow. Yeah, right

460
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,040
That's just wrong Apple's keeping them in the dark

461
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,080
Yeah, maybe so we'll find out stay tuned and find out I'm sure we'll do a little update next week

462
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,040
But I do kind of like the hype. I gotta admit it's fun. It makes it feel a little more like

463
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,760
You know, it's not just posted on the mailing list and maybe that's more your style

464
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,860
But it's like there's a whole involvement to it. It feels like a production. So, let's see as any

465
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
452 says that they're merging with twit

466
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
elementary OS and twit

467
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,680
That's I got a theory for you. How about this one?

468
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,240
System 76 is buying them. Oh, yeah, right

469
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,840
Distribution for system 76 hardware wouldn't that be good wouldn't that be something because you know

470
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:03,020
They've got system 76 got a really great range of machines right now and they have one of the developers

471
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:07,840
Works there at system 76 both share attention to detail and wanting to craft

472
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,800
Yes, exactly and you know because somebody who works with the project works there at system 76

473
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,320
They have a kind of a direct line for this kind of stuff and some of their rigs would look particularly good

474
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,440
Running elementary OS like like they have the disable complete all-in-one

475
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,420
Right, that's like obvious. That would be I mean that would

476
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,860
Legitimately would make and it also elementary OS has really kind of gone out of their way to make sure everybody

477
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,460
They're they're clear like they're there

478
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:38,500
They don't feel that their competition is Ubuntu or Ubuntu Mate because they want to go there

479
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,200
They say they mainly going after users that are already running proprietary OSes

480
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
They don't right that's who they're going after

481
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,500
You could argue that still competing with other distros

482
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,140
But I think it's it's an interesting approach and if you look at their distribution in that context that their their primary market is people

483
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
Who aren't running Linux yet?

484
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,900
I think they think their attention to details. It's pretty interesting. So the system 76 picking them up

485
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,700
Well now I just want that to happen Chris. I know I know it would be pretty big

486
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,140
I wouldn't want like the general distribution to go away because I've been running on Dylan's laptop and that's a Dell

487
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,380
Like I think it's almost like that same exact model you've got right there

488
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,020
Oh nice, and it's been flawless for over for well over a year now

489
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,660
So I wouldn't want them to go away as a general distribution. No, I wouldn't either but you do have to wonder

490
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,580
I'm sure if I'm sure if something like that were to happen

491
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:31,060
There would be some little birdies going around tweeting about it. Yeah, probably all right before we go any further into the show

492
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,820
I'm excited to get to the review that Wes is reviewing wait

493
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:40,900
What the review that Wes is reviewing no the distro the Wes is reviewing speaking of really well put together

494
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,060
distributions that pay a lot of attention to the fine details

495
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:51,020
I'm really curious, but before we get there. I'm gonna mention digital ocean digital ocean comm and use our promo code

496
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:57,180
Do unplugged all one-word lowercase, and you'll get a $10 credit at digital ocean. This is a great cloud hosting provider

497
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,180
Why is it great? Well when you're using the cloud you're using other people's computers

498
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,300
And so you want to make sure they're good you want to make sure they got great infrastructure

499
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:11,020
Running on Linux using the KVM virtualizer SSDs for all the disk I owe 40 gigabit e-connections right into the hypervisors

500
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:17,660
Some of the best data centers in the world in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, even India

501
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,220
It's I know I know they have the best interface in the business

502
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:28,460
Never seen anybody come close to this desktop or a web app HTML5 console you get access to your rig from

503
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,660
Post all the way to login they have incredible

504
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,100
Nicely formatted tutorials and guides to help you set things up. They have entire application stacks

505
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,860
You can deploy boom ready to go. Everything's good to go or you can deploy a base rig. I love both of those options

506
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,540
They've got a bunch of good distributions

507
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:50,860
You can choose from and you combine that with the great UI the simple ability to spin up multiple machines at once

508
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
The crazy straightforward pricing get this

509
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,580
$5 a month is the base rig so if you use our promo code deal unplugged you get the $10 credit

510
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,060
But you can also do digital ocean at an hourly rate

511
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,420
Now girl, I am telling you do unplugged is going to get you the extra money

512
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:11,500
Plugged is going to get you the extra mile if you're using the hourly rate because you can get a fantastic rig at like

513
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,380
Three cents an hour. I think that's the most popular one. I mean, it's just nuts

514
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,380
And now they have block storage up to 16 terabytes of storage. You can allocate to your rig. That stuff is awesome all SSD based

515
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,900
That's pretty nice. That is pretty nice

516
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:29,420
Also, check out the digital ocean community page where they've got all of their tutorials posted right there

517
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,340
Including some good ones working with zfs working with own cloud

518
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,140
A lot of stuff is now getting updated for ubuntu 1604 and centos 7 and all that stuff

519
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:45,980
And then also they they're highlighting their projects that use their super nice straightforward api just use our promo code do unplugged and a big

520
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:51,500
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged program. And yeah, they got free bsd too

521
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,940
Yeah, they got free bsd. In fact mentioning free bsd just really quick before we move on free bsd

522
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,980
Just announced a centos 7 binary compatibility. They've been working on it for a while

523
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,980
You know, but get that linux layer in there. Yep

524
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,540
Yeah, well, I mean like windows does

525
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,700
Yeah

526
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:16,620
As of yesterday a linux based c7 landed in ports for installing the centos base packages as it will allow running newer linux binaries built for

527
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,500
modern

528
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Centos right at enterprise 7 era systems on free bsd

529
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:29,020
Which is very handy it turns out, uh, previously centos 6 was the default and by a little bit dated now

530
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:34,300
It is isn't it? So there you go. So now you get the centos 7 which doesn't feel like a spring chicken chicken either

531
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,620
But uh a nice step up. Yeah, absolutely

532
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,420
I was kind of wondering to see this after windows made their announcement when if free bsd was going to have any more incentive to

533
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,580
Keep this current wonder

534
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,180
I wonder what kind of game not games, but I do wonder if games are going to be more

535
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,820
I was wondering just what kind of class of applications this opens up for bsd that wasn't available before

536
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,460
And i've seen some people hacking to get steam working on free bsd and there's been scripts that do it

537
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,620
I guess it wasn't this yeah, this could make it easier. Yeah, maybe I wonder if they'll ever target not sent to us as well

538
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,900
I've asked about that and I basically got a what's the point? Yeah, and why would we do that?

539
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,740
Like because I think and I don't mean to disparage but I think to the bsd people

540
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,180
Linux is already really silly. And so if you're gonna support any kind of compatibility

541
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,060
Why wouldn't you do it with the most adult linux? I think it's how they look at it

542
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,700
Well, and if and if they're targeting a lot of server workloads centos may be the thing that you know

543
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,500
Is most like what their boxes will end up being used for yeah

544
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:36,220
I don't I I would be way more enthusiastic about being able to install like a debian user land set of tools and stuff

545
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:42,060
And then i'd be like, oh right. Okay. Let's go look at this true os with the rolling free bsd and a debian user land

546
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,980
I can install

547
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,140
I mean, I I would do that. What's that that mac os 10 don't uh, there's a there is a there is a like a

548
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,780
There's like a user land set of tools. You can install that has like apt-like functionality. I'm blanking. I don't even know

549
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,500
Yeah, yeah homebrew that's what it is. Yeah homebrew. Yeah homebrew that they can kind of like that. Yeah, that'd be nice

550
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,540
Give me all that kind of stuff. But yeah, I I you know, I I think that's probably going to hook some people up

551
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,620
So mr. Wes

552
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,720
You are trying out the distribution that jack wallen at linux.com

553
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,740
Says bring serious relevance back to kde. Oh strong words. Yeah

554
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:24,540
Yeah, um, so it's called chaos kaos. We have talked about it before they've just recently gotten a new update

555
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:30,060
And it is a very refined approach to the plasma 5 desktop

556
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,420
Sort of a gray color scheme very uniformed. What are your thoughts on it so far?

557
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,660
You know i've um, I haven't run a kde distro for a while

558
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,460
So that was a little bit of one of the reasons I was thinking it'd be a fun one to throw at you

559
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:48,300
Yeah, um, I like it katie takes a little bit to get used to I honestly there's a lot of little things that i'm

560
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,300
Kind of surprised by and i'm like, oh right. I really like this and so there's a lot of little things

561
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,940
I'm enjoying having the like the taskbar kind of thing right on the bottom. I'm enjoying

562
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
just the responsiveness and

563
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,140
There's a lot of effects, but there's not there's not too many effects and it's kind of just it's just refreshing

564
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:04,780
It feels light

565
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:08,460
It feels pretty responsive and i've been really impressed when I was just going into tinker with it

566
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,700
and they have their own limited repository and they're using pacman as the

567
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,460
As the tool so it felt right at home and they've got like nice colors

568
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,820
It feels it feels just like it's been well cared for well touched

569
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,900
I you know, I haven't I haven't used it long term

570
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,020
So I don't know

571
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:28,060
How well their software availability will meet my needs especially since i'm used to the larger arch repos

572
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,260
And one of the things they advertise is a limited repo. They're very focused on kd isn't arch base though

573
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,500
So yes, and I believe it'd be pretty easy to get

574
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,740
Um other other arch packages installed if I wanted to i've not tried that yet

575
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,460
Yeah, I think I think when I messed around with it you could but I think that's one of their things

576
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:47,260
Is they really want you to just use their limited selection?

577
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,780
um

578
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,780
It does feel like a very modern

579
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,180
Like if you're someone who who really likes kde

580
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,380
And want something that like you can just kind of set up go with it'll be a nice configured default

581
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,380
You can customize it if you want from there

582
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,020
But you have like new packages you have like the core stuff

583
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,580
You're kind of already using the you know k-office or whatever then I think you'll be really happy with it

584
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:15,420
So they have uh, they have a qt designer included karita cupzilla c file dolphin k3b kate sue studio image writer

585
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:20,940
Jack says the only real glaring hole in chaos's list of software would be an email client for that

586
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:25,500
You have to go to the package manager. Now. Did you did you get a chance to try out their gooey package manager?

587
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,260
Did you get a chance to look at this? Yeah, aren't they they're using uh octopi? Yes. Yeah

588
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,940
Uh, yes, I installed the installed firefox from there and a couple other things

589
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,540
And it wasn't uh wasn't too bad

590
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,100
I went back to the shell which I was also very pleased with and they've looks like they've applied some formatted options

591
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:44,220
Like they've got the fun little pacman style on pacman set and they've got some really nice spacing setup

592
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,740
So it like very clearly shows you some like these are your packages. Here's the new ones

593
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:51,100
Here's how much you're downloading in kind of a non-standard way, which I appreciate it

594
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,660
So they have they break it out into three repositories

595
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,220
So they've got core that contains the basic software necessary for the system to boot communicate with the bios

596
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:05,260
And set the basic shell options then main which contains the necessary libraries drivers and firmware to make the desktop function

597
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,780
And then they got apps and that contains all the user facing apps

598
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:14,480
Spread out into those three different categories the three repositories work seamlessly together to keep chaos or kaos

599
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:21,260
Up to date and running smoothly jack concludes by saying if you've been looking for a distribution to sway you back to the kde desktop

600
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:26,220
And by kde desktop, he means plasma desktop look no further than chaos. It's a beautiful

601
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,940
It is beautiful runs with us which runs with a snap of a much lighter desktop

602
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,980
And feels as reliable as any other option available for linux

603
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,300
I haven't been impressed with kde for very very long

604
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,860
I have not been impressed with kd in a very long time

605
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,340
But I am very impressed with this one and I'm certain users would find themselves equally happy to return to a desktop

606
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:46,140
That has long needed a champion like chaos

607
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,660
What are your thoughts on the speed? He talks about the speed a lot in this review

608
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,060
Yeah, I mean I was pretty

609
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,740
It didn't feel sluggish. I mean I haven't used a bunch of other kde distros recently

610
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:59,020
So I don't really know I can't compare them that well from that perspective

611
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,580
But as someone who uses who's you know

612
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,180
Uses i3 are awesome from time to time who otherwise uses, you know

613
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,540
Gnome but not that many plugins kind of a lighter gnome. It it really felt responsive. It felt light

614
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,980
The graphics looked nice, which they usually do thanks to kaywin. Um, so I was very pleased

615
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,060
It was like a very usable experience. Hmm

616
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:18,860
well

617
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:24,860
That is that is probably if you've been looking for a plasma desktop to jump into this is probably one to play around with if nothing

618
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,420
Else because you can get a sense of their design look and their theme they're going for and you could replicate some of that

619
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,300
If you want it in your own, yeah, and I I don't hate the way it looks

620
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,380
I don't think it's necessarily the style that I would go go for it's a little it's a little

621
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,260
Blue and boxy and I mean the gray is nice

622
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,340
Um, I don't think it feels quite as streamlined as what i'm used to in gnome

623
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,660
But I mean katie is so flexible that i'm sure you can

624
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,260
You know if you want to change it to make it something that you like that wouldn't be a huge problem

625
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,540
Um, i'm waiting for the plasma matte desktop version

626
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,100
Wimpy will be shipping in ubuntu 17, uh, oh

627
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,260
I will say it does come with some nice stuff like mpvs here. Yeah included by default

628
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:11,820
There's the it's a pretty good showcase of a lot of different qt software as well. That's good. Yeah, i'm i'm

629
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,980
Seriously tempted to replace vlc with mpv at some point. Yeah

630
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:23,900
Um, the new versions are very nice and um, yeah, i'm waiting to see a vlc

631
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:31,100
Three drops with high dpi support. I like gnome mpv a lot too, which is a nice front end mpv. Yeah, exactly

632
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,300
That's exactly in fact that and that new version. Um for gtk 320 is really good

633
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,820
Yeah, yeah

634
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,380
It's it's it's my go-to player now for video clips on the stream whenever i'm whenever i'm playing videos

635
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:47,980
On the show that aren't that aren't like on a web page i'm using gnome mpv because it i've been also having a decoding

636
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,260
Issues with vlc and where it starts dropping frames and things like that

637
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:54,620
It just gets to be all all kinds of a mess not something you can afford as a broadcaster

638
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,740
I like sweetloo's idea of looking at chaos desktop and then taking some of those

639
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,500
Ideas and transitioning them into an lxqt sort of lightweight desktop

640
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,340
I don't think lxqt has all of the theming and and and well, I guess unless you can use kwin with lxqt. I'm not sure

641
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:14,140
Uh, but I I look at this and I think they're doing some things that are right here

642
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,420
And it's that same sort of a little extra attention to detail and the plasma desktop doesn't often get it

643
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,860
So that's what also kind of makes it special. Yeah, exactly and it feels like they're you know, it's it's nice to have the focus

644
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,220
It's not just

645
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,540
A distribution that has oh, you can also get our kde spin. It's like this is what we're doing

646
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,940
It feels a little more polished. It feels a little bit more like yeah, we thought about it from beginning to end

647
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:39,660
We've picked our entire software stack. We've built our own repos just to do this project

648
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:47,260
Wimpy are you feeling the uh, the impending release date of the 1610 version of the ubuntu bata desktop?

649
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,060
Does it start to build up like is it? Yeah

650
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Yeah, so, um

651
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,860
In feature freeze now. Yeah, and uh, yeah, we got lots of stuff to fix

652
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,660
Now I know there was uh, there was one feature that ended up getting scrapped for 1610, right?

653
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,780
Yeah, we uh, I yanked the uh, the marte hub hud

654
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,100
Um, we introduced that in alpha 2

655
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:15,260
And uh, we had some great testing feedback, but the feedback was clear. It was not ready

656
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:23,520
And uh, uh, we don't have time to fix it up. So, uh, we've we've yanked that and we'll revisit it in 1704

657
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,900
Well, that's kind of a downer you should share with us something that's going well

658
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,740
I mean I I respect the decision. You gotta you gotta do what you gotta do. Uh, but now you should pick now pick me back up

659
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,740
So get me excited about something. Yeah

660
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,820
What do we have to look forward to?

661
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,060
well, it's

662
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:44,460
It's a bit uninteresting really this release for ubuntu marte because we haven't

663
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,180
landed any groundbreaking

664
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,060
new features, but in terms of what the

665
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,620
end user sees

666
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,900
but

667
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,900
It's a ground up

668
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:01,360
Recreation basically so although it doesn't look like and it might not feel like it

669
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,720
But we literally started from scratch and built it all from the ground up all over again

670
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,320
And it's really all about the transition to gtk 3

671
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:17,520
And one of the reasons that we don't have time to go back and fix the marte hud for example is we did the initial

672
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,120
Let's go to gtk 3 and at that time it was

673
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,600
gtk

674
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:29,520
318. Oh, right and then part way through the ubuntu cycle

675
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,560
They've pulled in gtk 320

676
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Which is a massive upheaval

677
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,800
For anyone that's a theme designer, you know that basically all your themes stop working. You have to redo all your theming

678
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Oh man, so we've redone

679
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:49,780
All the themings for gtk 320. So we've actually done like two significant tool get toolkit transitions

680
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,020
In in this cycle, does that feel like you're bringing a lot of a lot of your time up?

681
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,460
um

682
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:02,740
It does and it doesn't because I made this decision that this release was going to be the we break everything we start over

683
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:07,000
You know, this is this is the new starting point heading towards 1804

684
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,300
We have to do this and the other thing that's happened, which is perfect timing. It was um

685
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,920
Um, maybe late last week. Um, it's been announced that gtk 322

686
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,860
Will be the last gtk 3 release

687
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,140
From that point onwards it will only get fixes

688
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:32,900
So after 322 then we go into this new gtk 4 development cycle, which is great. So from the mate

689
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,420
Desktop team. This is ideal because now we can

690
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,700
Stop having to do catch up on

691
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:46,440
On gtk 3 toolkit api changes and actually just solidify hunk down fix up stuff

692
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,040
Against that version and then the idea would be that 322 would be around for a year or more

693
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,120
It will be well the idea is is uh that um

694
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,200
Uh in about 18 months the stable version of gtk 4

695
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,120
Will come along in that there won't be any api changes at that point

696
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:10,940
So we've got like 18 months of sitting on that version of gtk

697
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,040
with no api changes

698
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:21,160
And then we have a transition in about a year and a half to a new toolkit, but we can now choose when

699
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,160
we jump

700
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
um toolkit versions

701
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,080
Rather than us all having to you know, keep pace with with the cadence of gtk. Yeah

702
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:36,360
Yeah, that's nice have something really you can target and then do bug fix and that kind of stuff

703
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,880
Yeah, so so we might be a little bit rough around the edges for 1610

704
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,600
but i'm really looking forward to 1704 because I know that we'll

705
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,520
only have one gtk version to focus on and

706
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:56,860
From now and probably all of the 1704 release will just be a refinement and fixes version probably no significant

707
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:02,620
New developments will continue to improve the ubuntu mate welcome and the software boutique

708
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,380
But in terms of all the other stuff

709
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:09,980
We'll just focus on fixing up and making good for a good long period because we need to sort of develop that

710
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:14,780
That stability and confidence that everything's working as we intend it to it's amazing

711
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,900
How much you know how much back end work that takes for sometimes very little actual show

712
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,460
But when you really do get that like no you can trust it. It just works. It's really worth a lot

713
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,100
Yeah, and it does sort of just work at the moment

714
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:32,620
But I know where the bugs and the wrinkles are and some of the testers have sort of identified lots of little paper cuts

715
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,620
And we need to start addressing that stuff

716
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,980
It sounds like it is it going to be an interesting it's an interesting phase

717
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,300
And I bet I bet you're still I bet there's still something as an end user

718
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:45,020
I'd be excited about for the for the 1610 release and I think

719
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,460
for somebody like me, uh, I am I

720
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,420
I think every six months is pretty aggressive and I don't think there's any problem at all

721
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:58,300
With using a couple of releases every now and then to just work on some of this stuff. Yeah, right

722
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:06,220
Yeah, that's what these intermediate releases are for, you know, these are the releases where you do this stuff, you know to build up to the lts

723
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:06,940
I mean

724
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:13,100
I suppose the thing that i'm most looking forward to and this isn't a 1610 thing specifically because it's um, I think it's landed in

725
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:20,140
1604 if it hasn't it's about to and that's um firefox 49 being able to play netflix. I think

726
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,460
That's huge. That's such a big deal. Um

727
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:30,540
So, you know amazon prime and netflix now working in uh firefox is terrific

728
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:36,700
So, you know, that's not nothing to do with tomato in particular, but that's a real good feature

729
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:42,460
Yeah, absolutely. It is man. In fact, we should do just a quick firefox update

730
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:45,660
So we're blowing through a lot of our updates right now. I think this is good. So but wimpy brought it up

731
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,820
Why don't we do that? Um

732
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,620
It's looking serious. I'll tell you about it here in just a moment

733
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:56,320
In fact, let's let's uh, reorient ourselves and talk about linux academy really quick and then we'll transition into firefox linuxacademy.com

734
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,660
Slash unplugged that's where you go. You want to be happy like this lady up on the screen and do a little linux academy dance

735
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,900
Go there and learn more they got labs

736
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,940
It'll spin up on demand with the distributions you've chosen and the courseware and the lab servers match that choice

737
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,580
They have instructor mentoring when you need it

738
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:16,380
It is really a platform to teach you everything about the core essentials around linux and everything built

739
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,300
On top of it if you're a client if you have a client that has a new project for you

740
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,340
If you want to impress an employer or you want to learn a new skill

741
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,160

751
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,900
Linux academy.com slash unplugged. So this is a big deal

752
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:20,140
I think firefox could be getting up to a 700 improvement in responsiveness. Yeah, I said 700

753
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:25,580
Holy crap chrome take that. This is really something now

754
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:30,940
This is these are stats that are being reported by mozilla themselves. I'm guessing hopefully based on metrics

755
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,940
They're getting back from early rollout of

756
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:39,500
Electrolysis the company is reporting a 400 improvement in responsiveness and a 700 improvement in

757
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500
web page load times

758
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,960
There's also the responsiveness for loading large web pages

759
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:51,360
Over the next week multi-process will begin coming to 10 percent of total firefox users in the coming weeks

760
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,320
mozilla will push multi-processing to 100 percent

761
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:00,400
Of their initial user group the group represents 40 to 50 percent of the total users

762
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,640
It's a lot of interesting numbers here

763
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,720
The gradual rollout with the next six months a major within the next six months

764
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,240
The majority of users can expect to have these capabilities. So here's what you're going to get in firefox 49

765
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,480
It's going to enable us a set of add-ons that work well with multi-processing

766
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,840
So you'll have for you'll have like a set in firefox 50 and 51 is somewhere depending on how development goes

767
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,000
Sandboxing and enabling of more add-ons turns on then firefox 52 or 53

768
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,680
Multiple content processes will be introduced and they talk about some of the cool things

769
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,640
They've done in there with their mem shrink project to really nail this memory use thing with multi processes and they say well learn from

770
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,960
the competition

771
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:49,220
The way they implemented multi-course referring to chrome right the way they implemented all day. Oh, yeah, of course or opera. Yep

772
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:54,320
The way they implemented multi-process is RAM intensive it can get out of hand

773
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:00,560
We're learning from them and building an architecture that doesn't eat all of your RAM. Oh, I like that

774
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,200
Yeah, so up to 400% improvement on load times less RAM usage. Um

775
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,840
rust

776
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,840
electrolysis

777
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,880
Netflix support

778
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,120
What is going on?

779
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,480
Wes is firefox all of a sudden coming around only ready for Chris is it bad?

780
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,080
Is it coming out off the ropes and swinging them punching chrome right in the face?

781
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:28,660
I think it is clear at least the Mozilla's kind of you know, they've really felt what users pain has been

782
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:32,240
I mean, especially like electrolysis has been a huge long rollout

783
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,400
But it does feel like they've been making a lot of changes now to kind of like, okay

784
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,200
We really need to catch up

785
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,320
We really need to be

786
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,440
Be in the spots where Chrome has us beat because there's like, you know

787
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:44,840
There's like the 80% that they both do they're both totally fine. You can do like that much of your web browsing

788
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,840
It's just those like extra Netflix support

789
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:54,120
Responsiveness not hanging on your one crappy site. Like these are things that people who like use the web a lot really expect out of a

790
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,600
browser

791
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,560
Ww you've run into 4 gig memory limit issues. What are you let's go. What are you talking about?

792
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:05,080
You're talking per tab per process. What is this for the entire process of firefox?

793
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:11,160
I've run into like two to three to four to five to six

794
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,120
Gigabits or six no six gigabytes of my eight gigs of RAM use

795
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:25,000
Just because I'm running multiple tabs or maybe I'm researching something or I'm reading cross things and you know

796
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,480
So yeah, firefox definitely needs a memory shrink because it's getting ridiculous

797
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:38,520
Well, I think this new electrolysis overall is gonna end up using more memory

798
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,960
I mean, they're just being really smart about how they're doing it

799
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,400
But I think it still uses more memory because you're running more processes

800
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,320
So I don't I don't know if that's actually gonna I don't know if that's gonna help

801
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,240
Yeah

802
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:55,920
firefox doesn't have that sandboxing or like that chrome thing where it separates up in orange tabs into

803
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,660
Separate processes right now. So on the latest, you know version for me

804
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:09,140
It's still chewing up memory. So the only thing it's saying boxes would be the flash process

805
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:16,860
I believe so that's still separate. So you'll eventually get a flash crash, but you won't as often as it was before

806
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,860
So it still needs

807
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:25,740
Don't do improvements and this is a good stuff and I've been waiting and waiting for like electrolysis and I I think

808
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,180
Michael to know which isn't here

809
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:35,300
Has been using electrolysis a little bit more so he could probably talk more on it. Mm-hmm. Yes, so

810
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,860
So for me right now

811
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:43,220
I'm still dealing with that and I sold and up crashing firefox daily

812
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:48,100
Just because I need to reset my memory and I need to keep tabs and I have stuff

813
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:56,020
Enabled for that to keep those sections. It's it's a process and I'm willing to wait for it. So, you know, we'll see what happens

814
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:03,100
Yeah, I'm getting hopeful though. Mm-hmm. And you should note that you can in about config under browser tabs. Yes remote

815
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:07,820
Yes, you can enable it for yourself. If you have firefox. Oh now you're talking my

816
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:13,420
So go try it out about config, right? You go in there and then it's where let's see how you got that. You got the file

817
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:17,820
I got it right here browser tabs.remote.auto start set that to true

818
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,420
If you then look under about support

819
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:27,700
It should have a multi process windows column. And if it shows that you have those then you're on it. Cool

820
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:32,540
I just enabled it right now is really easy. So cool. Well, all right now I kind of want to go try that

821
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:36,820
Yeah, I see if it's possible. That's pretty neat. They say and you know, I I caught the first

822
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,020
No, I caught the thing is for me is I'm such an extension idiot

823
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:45,060
Like I've just got I got like markdown dome be a chrome. Yeah, really

824
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:48,940
I know it's it's it's because the I find these tools useful to extend my workflow

825
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:53,460
Like I I can bang out some just some great show notes by using a bunch of different tools and stuff and you're in like

826
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,460
It's like a candy store right? You're like, oh, yes

827
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,980
Oh, come on. Oh, come on

828
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:06,580
I'm not that bad. I I do good. I do them. Yeah, I do that. I got laugh. Okay, here's what I have right now

829
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,200
I have two markdown extensions to yeah, because one

830
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:16,020
One can create markdown by selected HTML and one just creates a markdown link to the page

831
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:21,820
I see and then I've got last pass because I went back on the last pass juice. I got my highlighter bookmark

832
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,980
And I got hangouts and I got an imager. Oh

833
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:29,940
And I got Google quick scroll, which is kind of cool. Have you ever seen?

834
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,700
Yeah, tell me more

835
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:35,380
So like when you search for something on Google and you click the link quick scroll comes up and it takes you right to the spot

836
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,340
The page that is relevant here. Okay, that's really nice. Yeah, it makes it fast

837
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:41,460
And then I've got a subreddit style on it, which I don't even know what that's for

838
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:45,180
So I'm not like crazy with the extent. No, that's actually pretty good

839
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,220
And that you know flash is probably in there somewhere, but Google does all that. Yeah

840
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,900
Thanks, you make me to sound like I'm some sort of maniac. No, that's actually very reasonable

841
01:03:52,900 --> 01:04:00,700
I I I'm excited to say that Wes and I will probably if all goes as planned be going to the open daylight summit

842
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,780
I think it was called on September 27th in Seattle

843
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:08,780
It is a conference about software defined networking and Linux etc

844
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:14,760
Etc put on by the Linux foundation, which means we might be doing like a different recording time in a week or so

845
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,760
So we'll update the calendar and let you guys know

846
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:21,060
Probably the 20th would be the the day we would do something if we do like a double or a late recording

847
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,900
I don't know what our plans are there

848
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,220
But because the 27th the day that the conference starts is a Tuesday, right?

849
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:31,180
And I don't really have any rigs here by myself that I think we could do a show live there from at the moment

850
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,780
I'm not sure tricky endeavor. Yeah, and I just don't think I don't know

851
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,100
Maybe I'd have time to put something to be such a bummer if like, oh

852
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,900
We tried that and then it didn't work. We just didn't have a show that we could always just have the mumble room to the show

853
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:46,140
Oh, yeah, I think they've got it down now. They might I bet I bet if I bet if they really put their minds to it

854
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:51,340
They could I bet I think they could I could probably do a better show with maybe Rekai Marshall on them into into place

855
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,340
I don't know. I could I could see I don't know. I think they could self-organize actually

856
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,580
I tell you what, I tell you I think wimpy would probably get drafted

857
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:04,540
Yeah, but I think I could I think they could self-organize and then and then they do their own show. Don't tell them

858
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,540
They'll go off and just come back to the network

859
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,380
It's just you and me from then on

860
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,340
Also, I guess before I run if you want a little more show

861
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:20,300
I got to give a plug to our brand new show you can go to error dot show and

862
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:26,840
That'll take you to the user air program. We've got two episodes out right now. Episode 3 is officially in the can

863
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,420
I hear it's coming soon. Mm-hmm. It'll be coming out soon

864
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:35,380
and so you can subscribe to the feed and just get it auto magically we do have an mp4 and mp3 feed at this time and

865
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:40,780
It's also getting posted to the youtubes and in the all shows feeds if you're there you've got it

866
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,660
But both episodes so far really well reviewed

867
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:46,340
So I invite you to check it out if you want a little more Linux discussion

868
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:51,700
You know pleasant fun manner. It's great. We we we very

869
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,500
We try to have a very different feel for that show. And so I think we're pulling it off

870
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:01,320
Yeah, I gotta say you episode 2 was great. Thank you. I hope you enjoy candid and yeah, that's true

871
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:08,460
It is and I hope you enjoy episode 3 as well, which will probably be out Wednesday morning Tuesday night JB time

872
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,500
So if you're watching the feeds what what I just like JB time that is do well

873
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,760
That's that's where we live. I just because it doesn't really matter to anybody listening

874
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,780
It's just because if I say it's specific, well who cares I could it could be East time

875
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:24,820
But if it's not your times, it doesn't matter. It's just the time that would jet evening for where we're at

876
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:30,380
Yeah, we got to do the beard time. Haha. I kind of like that too. That's that's not a bad suggestion

877
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:35,220
Beard time. I like it West. Alright, so I think that'll probably bring us to the end of this week's program

878
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:39,540
We do have a couple of more things that we'll pick up in the post show. So if you're sticking around

879
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:45,540
Well, I might put some of it in there West don't disparage. Okay, people could stick around and listen, but really you're right

880
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:51,660
The live experience like because we might get some gonna probably say hey recap put some of that in there

881
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:56,700
You know, but there's some like there's some real stinkers that are worth being there live for

882
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:03,860
JBLive.tv on a Tuesday you go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get it converted to your time

888
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,540
Get it out of here

889
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:48,900
I've never installed GNU slash Linux

890
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,980
And the value of this is negative

891
01:07:55,060 --> 01:08:02,660
I'm gonna say a cucumber sour is very refreshing. It was actually very pleasant. Yeah, not too sour not super intense

892
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:07,140
It would be a good summer beer too. Like when it's really hot out. Yeah, even moan the law yo, man

893
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,580
Screw water you go. I want a beer and you go grab one of these this this cucumber

894
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:18,180
Sour would really do it for me. Not hoppy at all. Is this is this another local beer you brought to let's find out

895
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:24,780
You are some kind of maniac from Bend, Oregon, Oregon. That's not too far. That's that's legit. That's local

896
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:29,700
That is local. All right, JB titles calm. Let's go pick our title everybody. Thank you mumble room

897
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:41,420
Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Now. We have to go vote somebody off the island and only one person will survive at JB titles.com

898
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:50,220
Flashy extension idiot. That's kind of funny. Welcome to nope a real pain in the flash. That's also good

899
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:56,180
So from everything I'm reading that we could link me earlier

900
01:08:56,180 --> 01:09:04,660
Apparently by the end of this year slash and silver light will be mostly in the NT API

901
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:11,500
For Firefox and it will be the only thing there and they're moving everything else to web extensions

902
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:17,500
You know, I do remember some talk about that web extension stuff in that vein interesting. Yeah

903
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:22,300
The beard knows the beard knows. So what do you know about software to find networking West?

904
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:31,100
Not as much as I would like to. Mmm, but it's an interesting topic and I feel like it's something that it's Linux is poised to do well with

905
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,980
It's too bad. A lot of the hardware implementations are so proprietary exactly

906
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:42,700
Just don't really have much option in the way of hardware things like switches. They're all very expensive for software-defined switches. I

907
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:47,780
Don't be nice if there were cheaper devices it'd be nice if like ubiquity

908
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:51,860
You got in the software-defined networking more I'm waiting for like a white box

909
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:57,940
Switcher that you can download by and like actually run cumulus on but they're all like open compute theory will provide these things

910
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:03,620
But they're still targeting way higher end than what your average home user is gonna want like they're going like hundred gig now, right?

911
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:07,180
I feel like there's like this huge software defined

912
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:11,900
culture and and community that's growing that is sort of like

913
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,940
unknown

914
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:18,680
Because it this there is so much happening here, but yet I don't really have any eyes on it for some reason

915
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:22,880
I and I don't know if it's just a lot of it kind of behind closed doors in the enterprise though

916
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:29,900
I think that's why hmm. Okay. I don't usually work on your switches or 40 gig plus or yeah. Yeah. Yeah

917
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,180
Okay, that kind of makes sense

918
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:36,940
So there is a Linux Foundation have looking at it right now

919
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,220
software defined networking

920
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,020
Event in Seattle. Oh

921
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:50,660
The open Daylight Summit. That's what they're calling it the open Daylight Summit September 27th through the 29th and

922
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:57,820
I have gotten you and I pre-approved press wise to go in the foundation actually contacted us and said hey

923
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,820
Do you guys want to attend and I said?

924
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,940
Can West go to well, thank you

925
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,460
Well, I don't think this isn't his this is actually not really his thing

926
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:15,660
So this is this is developers and the software to find networking community coming together to demonstrate some of the latest technology

927
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:17,540
in open

928
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,860
software to find networking

929
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:25,260
So I feel like this is an opportunity for maybe to go and learn what's learn what some of them are talking about and then see

930
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,900
We can translate that to back to the audience to something that's interesting. I don't know what you're gonna say

931
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:35,580
Well, I was gonna say it's open like open power is open to some extent like there's the protocol and stuff is open

932
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:40,780
But most implementations are not necessarily open like a lot of the ones you care about say the hardware stuff

933
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:47,240
While they're using open flow as some great API that you can talk to you still don't have any of the software or for the switch

934
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:52,960
Yeah, and see that's the kind of you're linking against some Broadcom IP or something. That's exactly the kind of thing

935
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,660
I want yeah, I out for that's exactly what I want to keep my eye out for and I mean

936
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:02,500
It's still cool you buy the switch and it runs whatever software as long as you can control it with your open controller and stuff

937
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:07,740
It's mostly okay. Yeah, it's still it's still an ideal, right? It's still an improvement, but it's not ideal

938
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:13,320
So that's so that's on the 27th West okay, and that's that's a Tuesday

939
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:17,700
And I don't know exactly what we should do like we there's a couple of options

940
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,980
We could go in the morning and try to hustle back up here in time for unplugged and do a later unplugged

941
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:23,980
That's definitely a possibility

942
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:30,980
We could pre-record on the 20th and dude we could do two unplugs and then not worry about that Tuesday at all or

943
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,180
And I don't think this is I don't think I have the hardware for this

944
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:40,500
But the real Hail Mary of course would be to do a show from down there. Oh, right, but I don't think I have

945
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:46,900
I mean, maybe I could do it from the MacBook Pro, but I haven't really put it in that kind of workload yet

946
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:51,260
But otherwise I I mean I need like a pretty powerful machine to do all that not to mention

947
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:56,580
I'd have to make sure I have all the analog equipment to make that possible so I didn't get permission from them

948
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:03,020
There's a good open flow switch. Oh, yeah, okay in terms of like something a consumer could afford. It's like a hundred bucks

949
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:09,420
Posted it. It'd be a good learner device wouldn't it yeah the zodiac here. Oh, yeah

950
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:13,260
Yeah, the zodiac those would be fun to play with wow look at that thing. That's pretty interesting

951
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:16,740
Yeah, I don't know how performant this would be in terms of switching capabilities. I don't even know

952
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,060
Learn on yeah, yeah

953
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,740
So I guess I'm gonna go in there with a pretty open mind

954
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:27,260
If we can make it down there, and you and I'll probably just have to figure out what we want to do recording wise

955
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:33,260
Okay, I'm open for whatever. I would love to do the show from there, but I'm thinking that's probably not doable

956
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:38,820
But if we got if we hustled we got a few interviews in the morning and then got up here say by like

957
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:44,340
233 and did it like a late-unplugged. Yeah, maybe that might be I don't know so that's something to think about

958
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:50,020
It's coming up on our radar on the 27th. They're having it here in Seattle and the Linux foundations behind it

959
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,260
So that's kind of awesome. Yeah, that's interesting too. I like the idea of this at least

960
01:13:54,260 --> 01:14:00,820
It's the tough pie case with 15 backers. They have 22 days to go. They're looking for

961
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:03,740
5840 Australian funky money

962
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:10,580
But it and they're at 2400 right now the tough pie is an all-in-one breakout tough case for the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3

963
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:17,140
With an inbuilt 7 inch display look at that thing Wow it looks like you're toting a bomb around

964
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:20,140
You could be toting a bomb it could be high-end production equipment

965
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:27,300
There's the inside view with 3d printed mounting brackets and spaces and look at all that stuff like they're running Cody down there

966
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:29,940
Look at that. Yeah, they gotta go home with Cody on it

967
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,860
And of course I like that setup just for like all right

968
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,100
I can watch my movies and retro pie it's got a keyboard in there

969
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,380
I mean, it's a huge laptop

970
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:42,060
But this thing looks like you could toss it around on an airplane or or drive over it with a tank and it would survive

971
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,580
It's pretty cool, and it's called the tough pie by Brett Swan

972
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,220
Mmm. Yeah, you never know you never know 22 days left to go

973
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:54,180
He might Brett my reasonable goal to try to raise to I'm gonna send it over to know though because he and I like the idea

974
01:14:54,180 --> 01:15:15,860
Of modding up those types of pelican type cases to do production stuff too. It's part of cool ways. I like it. I'm interested
