WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
So they say it's a phone that's designed so you don't use it.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.240
It's called the Light Phone, and Brandt

00:06.240 --> 00:10.080
has his hands on a minimal phone with a neat trick.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.840
It's got an e-ink display.

00:11.840 --> 00:12.600
I do.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.840
And I must say, this phone fits the hand so well.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.600
If you remember the original iPhone,

00:17.600 --> 00:20.520
it's kind of like it's a bit smaller than that, actually.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.700
It's beautiful.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.880
And light would be accurate.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.980
It doesn't weigh hardly anything.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.160
But this phone is really neat.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.520
It's simplistic.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.400
So you have to be sort of up for that.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.480
And I'm struggling here to get the screen on.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.280
There we go.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.640
Is it slow with e-ink?

00:36.640 --> 00:38.960
Does it take a second or two for things to update?

00:38.960 --> 00:41.480
I think if you're used to a modern phone,

00:41.480 --> 00:43.960
I would call this like a meditative phone,

00:43.960 --> 00:46.600
because you have to give it a moment to react

00:46.600 --> 00:47.440
to anything you do.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.040
But it gives you that split second

00:49.040 --> 00:50.240
to think about your life choices.

00:50.240 --> 00:50.960
Does it have apps?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.080
Does it do maps?

00:52.080 --> 00:54.320
OK, let's call them apps.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.800
But it does do things.

00:55.800 --> 00:56.780
So here we go.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.720
I'm pulling up the menu, which takes it

00:58.720 --> 01:01.840
kind of like flashes between menus to clear the screen.

01:01.840 --> 01:05.140
That's the kind of e-ink perk, I suppose.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.720
Well, yeah, the mark of e-ink as it updates, yeah.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.600
Implementation detail, perhaps.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.240
Right.

01:10.240 --> 01:15.960
I was kind of surprised, because the screen is simplistic,

01:15.960 --> 01:18.960
but easy enough to read in full sunshine and stuff like that.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.520
So that was impressive.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.640
You asked about apps.

01:21.640 --> 01:25.120
So I've brought up the apps menu, which

01:25.120 --> 01:27.200
when I got my hands on this, it only

01:27.200 --> 01:33.080
had three apps, which was phone, alarm, and calculator.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.840
However, we've discovered that there are many more apps

01:35.840 --> 01:38.840
to add, which includes directions, which

01:38.840 --> 01:41.140
is very exciting, and I'll talk about it in a moment.

01:41.140 --> 01:43.120
It does have a music app.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.360
That seems essential.

01:44.360 --> 01:48.600
It also has, Chris, podcasts, which I haven't tried yet.

01:48.600 --> 01:49.640
You haven't tried that?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.120
Come on.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.440
How did you not listen to a Linux

01:51.440 --> 01:53.000
unplugged first thing you did?

01:53.000 --> 01:53.680
I know.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.520
I'm sorry.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.240
I've disappointed you all.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.180
So Heather and I tried the directions,

01:58.180 --> 02:00.800
because we thought, holy gee, that seems pretty advanced

02:00.800 --> 02:03.240
for such a simplistic device.

02:03.240 --> 02:06.360
And there are kind of two views.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.120
Actually, it found the addresses of the local Home Depot

02:09.120 --> 02:10.920
we were trying to get to very quickly.

02:10.920 --> 02:12.640
So I don't know what the underpinning is,

02:12.640 --> 02:14.680
whether it's OpenStreetMaps, or if it's actually

02:14.680 --> 02:16.040
just Google in the back.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.080
Maybe some handy listener can let us know.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.760
But it did really well.

02:19.760 --> 02:25.440
You have to expect that it's of this light phone design.

02:25.440 --> 02:30.960
So the map itself is kind of like, hmm, imagine Pong,

02:30.960 --> 02:33.000
but it's trying to tell you where to go.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.100
So very simplistic lines and things.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.560
And it's kind of delayed a little bit, which is not

02:37.560 --> 02:39.440
that helpful if you're driving.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.560
However, if you're hiking or something,

02:40.560 --> 02:41.920
I imagine that would be perfect.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.080
But we used the text instructions,

02:44.080 --> 02:45.480
and it was perfect.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.040
Got us there.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.320
So I would say if you're looking for a phone that

02:48.320 --> 02:51.720
is trying to keep you disconnected,

02:51.720 --> 02:53.120
this is pretty good.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.240
And it also has hotspots.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.680
So if you want to carry your real phone around,

02:55.680 --> 02:57.720
you could do that, too.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.520
It definitely seems like it has a more simplified UI.

03:00.520 --> 03:04.080
And they kind of brag about it not having social media.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.240
From what I can find online, LiteOS, all they really say

03:07.240 --> 03:09.000
is it's built with React.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.080
So I'm not quite sure the details

03:11.080 --> 03:12.240
on the underpinnings of it.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.760
But it also seems like they're picking up

03:14.760 --> 03:16.960
the bill for the cost to run those maps right now.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.240
Wow.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.720
That is something.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.440
That's impressive.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.840
I would say that's probably a feature that a lot of users

03:22.840 --> 03:24.400
are asking for.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.720
And if you're trying to get around with this,

03:26.720 --> 03:28.280
I think it's there.

03:28.280 --> 03:28.800
It's there.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.960
So that sounds really quite amazing.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.000
The battery, I think if you're not using maps,

03:34.000 --> 03:35.360
and you're not using the hotspot,

03:35.360 --> 03:36.480
it lasts quite a long time.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.720
But it certainly doesn't if you're using those,

03:38.720 --> 03:40.600
let's say, advanced functions.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.320
You would hope that e-ink screen would

03:42.320 --> 03:45.760
mean that it has a week-long battery life or something

03:45.760 --> 03:46.520
like that.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.000
But it sounds like it's a kind of standard battery life

03:49.000 --> 03:51.400
if you're using sort of standard smartphone features.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.600
Yeah, exactly.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600
But that being said, I'm sure the battery in this

03:54.600 --> 03:56.040
is a fraction of the size.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.760
So pretty neat phone.

03:57.760 --> 03:58.280
There you go.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.680
It's the Light Phone 2.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.320
We'll have a link in the show notes.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.920
It looks like it's about $299 if you buy the North American

04:03.920 --> 04:04.760
model.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.320
And there's a pre-order with the next plan

04:07.320 --> 04:08.880
to ship mid-October.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.480
I haven't seen it yet, but I saw pictures on their website.

04:11.480 --> 04:14.440
And I think Brent's description of the original iPhone

04:14.440 --> 04:16.680
that size, maybe slightly smaller screen,

04:16.680 --> 04:17.480
that's about right.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.240
So there you go, Wes.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.480
Time to get rid of your Pixel and get yourself a Light Phone.

04:20.480 --> 04:20.980
Uh-oh.

04:20.980 --> 04:31.560
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.440
My name is Chris.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.600
My name is Wes.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.600
My name is Brent.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.560
Hello, gentlemen.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.260
You know, this episode is brought to you

04:37.260 --> 04:38.440
by the all new A Cloud Guru.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.840
They have the leading cloud Linux and modern tech skills

04:41.840 --> 04:44.200
training platform with hundreds of courses, thousands

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200
of hands-on labs.

04:45.200 --> 04:45.720
Get certified.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.640
Get hired.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.480
Get learning at acloudguru.com.

04:49.480 --> 04:53.120
Well, coming up on the show today, about a month ago,

04:53.120 --> 04:56.320
I switched to a new daily driver Linux distro.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.820
And I didn't say anything.

04:57.820 --> 04:59.400
Didn't want to mention it on the show.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.640
I just thought it would be, honestly, a fading thing

05:02.640 --> 05:05.440
that I just thought would a fling, a Linux fling,

05:05.440 --> 05:06.680
if you will.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.760
But then I started to realize, you know,

05:08.760 --> 05:13.000
there is an important place for fun in the Linux distro world.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And I want to share a little diamond in the rough.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.960
I even talked Wes into giving it a go and trying it out.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.760
We're going to tell you all about that later today

05:19.760 --> 05:21.640
and maybe even have a conversation

05:21.640 --> 05:23.600
about the place for fun Linux distributions

05:23.600 --> 05:25.000
in the overall ecosystem.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.680
So welcome in.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.280
And before we get to any of that,

05:28.280 --> 05:30.600
I have got to say time-appropriate greetings

05:30.600 --> 05:31.400
to our Mumble Room.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.240
Hello, Virtual Lug.

05:32.240 --> 05:32.740
Hello.

05:32.740 --> 05:33.440
Hello, Chris.

05:33.440 --> 05:33.940
Hello, Wes.

05:33.940 --> 05:34.440
Namaste.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.560
Hello.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.000
Hello.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.440
Thank you for being here, everybody.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.320
Yeah, we're going to need your support today.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.220
Yes, it does.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.400
It feels like it's an episode where we're

05:41.400 --> 05:42.320
going to need people's support.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.080
So we do have chapter markers.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.640
So I'm going to give you everybody a brief update

05:45.640 --> 05:46.880
on their reunion road trip.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.360
But if you just want to get to the Linux stuff,

05:48.360 --> 05:49.520
hit the chapter.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.360
But since our last episode, since we gathered together

05:52.360 --> 05:54.760
last time, my slides that I've talked about before

05:54.760 --> 05:58.040
on the show have been fixed, thankfully.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.000
It's great.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.120
Very happy.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.640
Working really good.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.160
The shop doesn't necessarily want

06:05.160 --> 06:07.120
me to give them publicity about it yet,

06:07.120 --> 06:08.760
because they're still in the R&D phase.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.160
But when they do, I'm going to be telling people about it,

06:11.160 --> 06:14.200
because life changer for us.

06:14.200 --> 06:17.640
And for a solid 15 minutes, I felt

06:17.640 --> 06:21.360
like Lady Joops was in the best shape of her life.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.600
And I felt amazing that my home, here it is, six years old,

06:25.600 --> 06:28.440
was better than ever.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.200
Like, I felt on fire.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.400
It was just great, and not in a bad way.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.800
About 15 minutes later, though, I

06:33.800 --> 06:37.300
experienced extreme disappointment,

06:37.300 --> 06:41.160
as I discovered a major issue with Lady Joops, my RV,

06:41.160 --> 06:44.280
while pulling out of the shop that fixed our slides.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.920
I literally discovered the next devastating issue.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.680
I didn't even make it 15 minutes with the victory.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.840
It was just awful.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.560
So I had to park it again.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.800
Our rear driver's side had a supposedly indestructible Sumo

06:58.800 --> 07:01.920
spring that was ripped away from its top mount,

07:01.920 --> 07:06.480
causing the spring to fall over onto our inner dually tire.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.360
I can only presume, because I apparently

07:08.360 --> 07:10.760
decided to take a tour of America's worst roads

07:10.760 --> 07:14.280
and between Colorado, parts of New Mexico, which

07:14.280 --> 07:15.840
parts of New Mexico are a lot better,

07:15.840 --> 07:17.680
but some parts of New Mexico are not,

07:17.680 --> 07:20.160
and Arizona, which is a hell-failed state,

07:20.160 --> 07:23.360
has the worst roads probably in the country.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.400
I can only imagine, because there are just

07:25.400 --> 07:28.520
entire sections of the road that are missing.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.280
So you literally can't have worse roads,

07:30.280 --> 07:32.700
because there are parts where there are no road.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.960
Did you take a piece of the road as a souvenir for your trip,

07:34.960 --> 07:35.440
I hope?

07:35.440 --> 07:37.260
I took a piece of the RV as a souvenir.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.600
That's what happened, is that driving around

07:39.600 --> 07:40.400
and all that stuff.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.800
It was really damaging.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.200
And when that spring fell onto our tire,

07:45.200 --> 07:46.400
it's there for a while.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.280
There's significant rub damage on the spring.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.280
So I don't know what the condition of that tire is,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.120
and a blowout there could be extremely, extremely dangerous.

07:55.120 --> 07:57.640
So I determined it was just too dangerous to drive

07:57.640 --> 07:59.880
with a broken rear suspension and a tire that had been

07:59.880 --> 08:01.480
significantly rubbed.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.520
I got the OK from the shop, and I never even

08:03.520 --> 08:06.000
got to leave their parking lot.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.400
No hookups either, of course.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.000
And this was the Friday before the long Labor Day weekend.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.240
About 3 PM, and all of Tucson had already shut down.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.740
No shops, no techs, no parts departments.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.320
Nobody was answering the phone.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.520
You're just stranded.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.480
Totally stranded, dude.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.160
Totally stranded on a Friday when

08:22.160 --> 08:24.640
we had been intending not only to be driving

08:24.640 --> 08:27.060
the entire weekend, but I had an event

08:27.060 --> 08:29.400
that I was going to where I wanted to potentially meet

08:29.400 --> 08:32.400
two new potential hosts on the network for a show

08:32.400 --> 08:34.020
that we were considering doing.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.680
And I wanted to have an in-person meeting with them

08:35.680 --> 08:37.760
to kind of suss them out, and talk to them, and see where

08:37.760 --> 08:39.560
they're at, and really get a feel for it.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.440
And now that's not happening.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.000
So this has an impact on my business, too.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.160
So we get stuck here the Friday before Labor Day weekend.

08:47.160 --> 08:47.880
We check Amazon.

08:47.880 --> 08:49.920
They've got these Sumo springs, but they're a week

08:49.920 --> 08:53.000
and change out, like into next week.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.280
And we just spent the weekend roasting in 105 degrees.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.160
Most days about 105.

08:59.160 --> 09:04.080
The sun from sunrise to sunset was beating down on Lady Joops.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.160
When I was doing LAN on Saturday evening,

09:06.160 --> 09:09.960
it got up to 122 degrees inside Lady Joops.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.680
It's crazy, right?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.760
Because it's a hot car in the sun.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.460
And when you turn off any kind of airflow,

09:14.460 --> 09:16.080
it just heats up in here like crazy.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.380
And we're constantly managing the generator temperature,

09:18.380 --> 09:20.880
and the inverter temperature, and the battery temperatures,

09:20.880 --> 09:22.840
because everything's working at its max

09:22.840 --> 09:25.600
to try to generate enough power to run air conditioning, which

09:25.600 --> 09:27.220
causes everything to overheat.

09:27.220 --> 09:28.800
And when it's 105 degrees outside,

09:28.800 --> 09:30.640
and the sun is beating down on the bays that

09:30.640 --> 09:32.440
contain your electrical system, it's

09:32.440 --> 09:34.800
an impossible, impossible battle.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.360
The food in our cupboards started to go bad.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.680
Like cleaning sprays started to separate and get gross.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.200
Up front where I'm recording, there's

09:42.200 --> 09:44.480
the smell of burning plastic.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.200
It starts around 10 AM and lasts all day,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.160
just the smell of plastic burning.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.320
I mean, we are literally baking our RV, and ourselves,

09:53.320 --> 09:55.040
and Levi in this parking lot.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.280
So we knew we needed to attempt a fix.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.120
Even if nobody was available, nobody could help us.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.080
We knew we had to do something, because we are dying here.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.000
I mean, I'm literally getting heatstroke like every day.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.600
When I record, I get heatstroke, because as I record,

10:08.600 --> 10:11.720
like this show right now, it'll get up to 130 degrees in here.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.680
It's absolutely mental.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.440
It is inhospitable to human life.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.260
Man was arrogant to ever build in Tucson.

10:19.260 --> 10:22.000
So we decided to try to do something.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.360
And we're from Seattle.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.400
We're used to 70s this day.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.200
I mean, Wes, what's the temperature right now?

10:27.200 --> 10:28.360
It's the beginning of September.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.440
What's the weather outside?

10:29.440 --> 10:31.040
Ooh, checking the weather report.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.440
It's 72 and partly cloudy today.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.360
Oh, oh, yeah, 72, right?

10:35.360 --> 10:37.480
So you can see, like, here I am, September.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.120
It's 105 degrees.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.920
The sun is beating down directly on the spot

10:40.920 --> 10:42.720
where our tire and our suspension is.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.720
We could only be crawling around on the ground doing stuff

10:44.720 --> 10:46.220
down there for like 10 minutes at a time,

10:46.220 --> 10:47.320
and then we're dying.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.960
So what we realized is we got to get out here like 5 AM, 6 AM,

10:49.960 --> 10:52.160
when it's only like 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.040
Only.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.000
And I took a pass at it, and I went inside,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.240
and Hadia went out, my wife.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.840
She took a pass at it, and she managed

10:57.840 --> 10:59.160
to hook the suspension up.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.240
She hooked the Sumo spring up using bungee cords.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.440
So it was hanging in place.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.840
At least it wasn't touching the tire anymore.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.320
And we thought, OK, we can make it 10 minutes down the road

11:08.320 --> 11:09.600
where we'd seen an RV park.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.840
We could test this.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.200
We can make sure it's working before we go.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.800
This is going to work out OK.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.160
This is about Sunday.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.760
This is Sunday.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.980
Wes and I recorded Saturday, so that way I could use Sunday

11:19.980 --> 11:22.120
to try to fix this for Linux Action News.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.520
And Sunday rolls around.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.240
Midday, we're feeling pretty good.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.720
We're ready to test it.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.080
And the first alert.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.360
You know when you get like the amber alert on your phone

11:32.360 --> 11:34.200
and it buzzes and stuff?

11:34.200 --> 11:36.240
The first one comes in.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.680
Severe thunderstorm alert.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.760
OK, all right, that sounds bad.

11:40.760 --> 11:45.680
The next one, major hail storm, massive property damage

11:45.680 --> 11:48.880
from these giant hail balls stay inside.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.160
I'm like, oh, God, that's going to probably destroy our solar

11:51.160 --> 11:52.040
panels.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.600
Then about 20 minutes later, maybe 15 minutes,

11:55.600 --> 11:58.760
we get a dust storm alert instructing everyone

11:58.760 --> 12:02.800
to remain indoors, not to travel, and to take shelter.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.520
I'm like, jeez, a dust storm too?

12:04.520 --> 12:06.600
And then about 30 minutes after that, maybe less,

12:06.600 --> 12:10.600
maybe 15 minutes, we get a very alarming and very serious

12:10.600 --> 12:13.680
tornado warning that a tornado is in the area.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.680
And it specifically says in the tornado warning,

12:16.680 --> 12:18.540
mobile homes will be destroyed.

12:18.540 --> 12:19.960
That's what it says in the tornado.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.200
We're sitting here in our RV, and we

12:22.200 --> 12:24.880
get a push notification that says mobile homes are

12:24.880 --> 12:26.440
about to be destroyed.

12:26.440 --> 12:31.480
As that clears, then we get a flash flood alert warning.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.200
This all is like within an hour, all of these alerts.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.920
And the wind, it starts picking up.

12:35.920 --> 12:36.800
And at first, we're like, jeez, it

12:36.800 --> 12:38.320
doesn't look so bad out there.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.120
We look outside, and it's clear blue skies.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.800
Oh, it doesn't seem so bad.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.680
And then I notice the awning starts to flap,

12:43.680 --> 12:45.000
and then it starts to flap more.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.040
So I pull the awning in, our only, only source of shade.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.860
And then the winds really pick up.

12:49.860 --> 12:51.160
It starts rocking the rig.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.160
And I bring up the radar of the storm,

12:54.160 --> 12:57.320
and I can see we're just on the edge of the storm.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.040
So it's way too windy and chaotic to actually drive,

13:00.040 --> 13:02.780
but we're not getting the brunt of this thing.

13:02.780 --> 13:04.820
There was nothing about this in the forecast, which

13:04.820 --> 13:06.620
I had been watching like a hawk, by the way,

13:06.620 --> 13:09.000
because it's literally life and death right now.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.080
So I watch it multiple times a day.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.080
There was nothing in the forecast about any of this.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.880
It just starts dumping rain on us.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.720
But we figured we can handle the rain

13:18.720 --> 13:19.880
because we're from Seattle.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.280
So we go out, and we start testing the rig

13:22.280 --> 13:24.860
in their parking lot, trying to get it to rock back and forth

13:24.860 --> 13:27.560
to see if our bungee patch will hold long enough for us

13:27.560 --> 13:30.320
to get 10 minutes down the road so we can hook up to power

13:30.320 --> 13:32.920
and at least run our air conditioning nonstop.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.560
And we test it in the driveway, and it seems like it holds.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.500
And so we set off towards the campground

13:37.500 --> 13:38.600
we had spotted earlier.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.720
And about five minutes into the drive,

13:40.720 --> 13:42.760
the rain picks up to monsoon level.

13:42.760 --> 13:46.000
I mean, it just starts slamming Tucson, raining so hard

13:46.000 --> 13:48.920
you could only see a few feet in front of the RV.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.160
And almost instantly, parts of the road begin to flood.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.280
Looking like almost a river rushing down the road.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.800
And thankfully, Joups' heavy butt could manage it,

13:57.800 --> 13:58.840
and so we kept on going.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.160
But I couldn't believe how fast it was happening.

14:01.160 --> 14:02.700
And when we arrived at the campground,

14:02.700 --> 14:04.920
the rain slowed down, but it continued to pour.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.160
So of course, I'm out there hooking up electricity

14:07.160 --> 14:08.840
because that's why I'm there.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.180
And it's still, even though all of this is going on,

14:11.180 --> 14:13.240
it's still 9,800 degrees outside.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.920
So you still need everything hooked up.

14:14.920 --> 14:15.960
You still need air conditioning.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.080
You need the water.

14:17.080 --> 14:20.200
So I'm out there just getting completely drenched.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.320
Horrible.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.480
Everything's dripping.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.240
And thankfully, power's good.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.080
AC's been running.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.140
We've been here since Sunday.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.920
It has been livable.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.320
With the AC going 24-7, both of them,

14:31.320 --> 14:36.320
it maintains about 86, 87 degrees in here during the day,

14:36.840 --> 14:39.720
during the afternoon, 87 degrees, maybe 88.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.820
We can really only bring it 20 degrees below

14:41.820 --> 14:43.340
whatever it is outside.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.680
So as the temperature skyrockets outside,

14:45.680 --> 14:46.900
we kind of go with it.

14:46.900 --> 14:48.720
We just have a 20 degree buffer inside,

14:48.720 --> 14:50.680
and it removes the humidity,

14:50.680 --> 14:53.440
which is historically high in Tucson while we're here,

14:53.440 --> 14:55.760
which has resulted in historic growth of bugs,

14:55.760 --> 14:58.240
which has meant we are covered in bug bites

14:58.240 --> 15:00.440
because they've never had this many bugs here before

15:00.440 --> 15:01.400
while we're here.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.560
It's been absolutely wild.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.380
And because it's the Labor Day weekend,

15:05.380 --> 15:08.040
we had no progress on getting parts.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.160
We had to wait until this morning, Tuesday,

15:10.160 --> 15:12.680
to start making as many calls as we could.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.240
Shops around here have been shockingly misinformed

15:15.240 --> 15:16.520
about how these Sumo Springs,

15:16.520 --> 15:19.640
which are extremely popular and well-known, how they work.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.000
It's been alarming, like some of these shops,

15:22.000 --> 15:23.560
what they do and don't know.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.080
And we're hoping to get some sort of temporary fix in place,

15:26.080 --> 15:27.600
maybe get them removed even

15:27.600 --> 15:29.720
so we can just make the drive home.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.900
Ideally, I'd love to have the shop

15:30.900 --> 15:33.260
that originally installed them fix it,

15:33.260 --> 15:35.360
but I don't know if we can make it up to Oregon.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.680
And the other issue is,

15:36.680 --> 15:39.640
now that we've ended up getting stuck here for so long,

15:39.640 --> 15:42.140
we've ended up pushing into another heat wave.

15:42.140 --> 15:46.940
And so our drive home is over 100 degrees in many places,

15:46.940 --> 15:48.400
all the way until Southern Oregon.

15:48.400 --> 15:52.280
California is gonna experience a massive heat wave next week.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.560
I-5 corridor will be over 100 degrees.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.240
When does that happen in California, right?

15:56.240 --> 15:59.280
And it's gonna be miserable everywhere.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.160
So it has actually crossed my mind, as a last resort,

16:02.160 --> 16:03.680
I've never really thought about this before,

16:03.680 --> 16:08.140
but I am now considering abandoning ship

16:08.140 --> 16:10.260
and putting jupes in storage

16:10.260 --> 16:12.720
and driving home in our chase car

16:12.720 --> 16:13.960
and then fly back down here later.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.520
But of course it's super expensive.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.520
Well, and that's just gotta be hard emotionally too, right?

16:17.520 --> 16:20.000
I mean, you're abandoning your home basically.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.520
Yeah, I didn't go on this reunion road trip

16:22.520 --> 16:23.600
to abandon my home,

16:23.600 --> 16:25.200
just after I got the slides fixed too, right?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.660
Like that wasn't the goal here.

16:27.660 --> 16:30.980
You don't go on a road trip to leave your vehicle behind.

16:30.980 --> 16:31.960
And yeah, it is our home.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.560
And it's like, so you'd wanna make sure

16:33.560 --> 16:35.420
it's really well taken care of while we're not here.

16:35.420 --> 16:38.600
And it's miserable because I don't know how safe it is

16:38.600 --> 16:39.600
to drive on this or not.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.280
I assume because the tire has been rubbed,

16:41.280 --> 16:43.240
I should get it checked out professionally.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.840
So I assume I shouldn't probably drive that far

16:44.840 --> 16:47.720
until I make sure my inner dually isn't gonna explode on me.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.520
I imagine that our temporary fix with a bungee cord

16:50.520 --> 16:52.880
isn't gonna last 1400 miles.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.960
In 100 degree weather, probably not.

16:54.960 --> 16:55.800
Right?

16:55.800 --> 16:56.680
And with roads that suck.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.140
And so we're using the crap out of our suspension system.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.520
It is become an impossible situation.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.680
And I feel like the shows will suffer because of it

17:04.680 --> 17:05.720
because I'm miserable.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.800
I'm barely making it through the days.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.040
There's almost every day I've gotten heat stroke,

17:10.040 --> 17:10.880
mild heat stroke,

17:10.880 --> 17:11.860
and I don't manage to recover

17:11.860 --> 17:14.240
until about an hour or two after the sun sets.

17:14.240 --> 17:16.960
And the days I record, the RV gets so hot

17:16.960 --> 17:20.060
that it never really gets down until like 10 p.m. at night

17:20.060 --> 17:21.480
and back into a reasonable temperature

17:21.480 --> 17:24.400
and reasonable being low 80s inside.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.600
So it's just, you know,

17:25.600 --> 17:28.460
it's like I didn't wanna come to Tucson for the meetup.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.400
I came to Tucson to get the RV fixed.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.420
My slide broke in May.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.160
And I waited until September

17:35.160 --> 17:37.160
to just try to wait out the heat.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.240
With three kids during summer break,

17:39.240 --> 17:41.720
I waited with a broken living room slide.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.480
So I wasn't in Tucson in the dead middle of summer,

17:44.480 --> 17:46.460
like in August or something stupid like that.

17:46.460 --> 17:51.340
And I still am getting screwed by this weather.

17:51.340 --> 17:53.240
It's just, it's horrible.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.400
It's been really rough.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.840
And so I don't really know what I'm gonna do.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.560
I don't know where I'll be next week.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.520
I don't know where I'm gonna be later

17:58.520 --> 18:00.040
for recording self-hosted.

18:00.040 --> 18:00.960
It's just been awful.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.720
Stay tuned for the next Linux Unplugged everyone.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.000
Hopefully there'll be one.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.240
Yeah, hopefully there will be.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.280
And you know, and then to make things extra difficult,

18:08.280 --> 18:09.960
the server is out at the studio.

18:09.960 --> 18:10.800
We haven't had a chance.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.920
There's nothing, nothing could be done while I'm not there.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.680
And so like that is,

18:14.680 --> 18:17.160
extra hoops have to be jumped through for production.

18:17.160 --> 18:17.980
And just all these things,

18:17.980 --> 18:19.560
like all these little things are adding up

18:19.560 --> 18:22.440
to make this end of the trip really difficult.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.380
And ironically, this is the wing of the trip

18:25.380 --> 18:27.080
I thought was gonna be smooth sailing

18:27.080 --> 18:28.760
because we'd have working slides.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.080
It was just gonna be Hadia and I.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.480
We went from three kids and three adults

18:32.480 --> 18:34.240
to just two adults.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.080
And smooth sailing with no hard deadlines.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.620
Like we didn't have any meetups to get to

18:38.620 --> 18:39.460
or anything like that.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.480
It was just take our time.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.960
And yet now here we are stuck in an area

18:43.960 --> 18:46.520
we never intended to be for more than a couple of days.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.560
And we're so desperate to get home now

18:48.560 --> 18:50.200
that we are gonna have to push like hell

18:50.200 --> 18:51.680
once we can get out of here.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.280
It's a totally unfortunate situation.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.680
And it's just sort of one of the random things

18:54.680 --> 18:57.800
that can happen on a road trip this long, I suppose.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.760
And the part shortage that's going on

18:59.760 --> 19:01.200
affects the RV industry as well.

19:01.200 --> 19:06.200
So funny enough, the shop in Oregon has the parts we need,

19:06.200 --> 19:08.280
but the shops here at Tucson don't.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.480
And so like, it's just one of those things

19:10.480 --> 19:11.680
where if we were back at home right now,

19:11.680 --> 19:12.780
we wouldn't have a part shortage.

19:12.780 --> 19:14.120
That shop happens to have stock,

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
but these ones down here, they don't.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.140
And where they would get their stock from

19:18.140 --> 19:20.500
is the shop we use back up in Oregon.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.580
Chris, may I ask how your tech infrastructure

19:22.580 --> 19:24.000
has lasted in this heat?

19:24.000 --> 19:27.060
There was one day where I shut everything down

19:27.060 --> 19:31.080
just because we couldn't keep up with the heat.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.280
And so I turned it off just to make sure,

19:33.280 --> 19:35.060
it was getting so, so hot.

19:35.060 --> 19:37.900
But otherwise it's been holding pretty well.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.980
Thankfully the road trip to Texas last year,

19:39.980 --> 19:41.800
I kind of, you know, I learned a few tricks

19:41.800 --> 19:43.200
to keep that stuff running.

19:43.200 --> 19:47.200
But yeah, not fun, not fun.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.040
It is great to have working slides again.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.720
And if it was, you know, in the mid eighties

19:50.720 --> 19:52.960
and I was stuck here, it'd be no problem, right?

19:52.960 --> 19:53.800
That'd be no problem.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.400
Even low nineties would work because again,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.160
we can get it down 20 degrees.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.800
So whatever the ambient temperature outside is,

19:59.800 --> 20:01.680
we can bring it down 20 degrees.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.160
Of course, some of that's offset by the fact

20:03.160 --> 20:04.300
that we're in direct sun,

20:04.300 --> 20:07.360
but at least now we're at a campground with power and water.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.560
So we can just turn them on and let them run.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.920
And we don't have to worry about using up gasoline

20:11.920 --> 20:12.760
and all that kind of stuff.

20:12.760 --> 20:13.800
Cause that was another problem of course,

20:13.800 --> 20:16.280
we were stuck, didn't have gas.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.520
So let's talk about good news.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.800
Let's talk about ingenuity.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.840
You know, that little Linux copter on Mars,

20:20.840 --> 20:24.280
it has really, really done well.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.160
I mean, above and beyond.

20:26.160 --> 20:29.200
We've talked before about how well it's doing

20:29.200 --> 20:31.540
because it was only supposed to fly five times.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.400
And yet the little helicopter on Mars

20:33.400 --> 20:35.600
has completed 12 flights now

20:35.600 --> 20:38.520
and given its stunning and unexpected success,

20:38.520 --> 20:43.520
the US space agency has extended the admission indefinitely.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.040
The little helicopter that could

20:45.040 --> 20:47.040
has become a regular travel companion

20:47.040 --> 20:48.780
of the Rover Perseverance.

20:48.780 --> 20:50.800
So given all of its awesome success,

20:50.800 --> 20:52.440
NASA says it's on board

20:52.440 --> 20:55.360
with keeping this thing flying indefinitely, if possible.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.000
Yeah, according to Josh Ravitch,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.800
the head of Ingenuity's mechanical engineering team,

20:59.800 --> 21:03.200
everything is working so well.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.360
We're doing better on the surface

21:04.360 --> 21:06.640
than we had ever expected.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.780
And we've actually been able to handle winds greater

21:08.780 --> 21:11.400
than we could really have ever hoped.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.960
To add onto that, you know,

21:12.960 --> 21:15.460
Ingenuity, it's not just a tech demo anymore.

21:15.460 --> 21:16.820
At first, that was kind of the goal.

21:16.820 --> 21:17.720
Could it fly at all?

21:17.720 --> 21:19.800
You know, would this all survive the landing,

21:19.800 --> 21:21.280
the harsh temperatures?

21:21.280 --> 21:25.140
But now they're actually doing real helpful science.

21:25.140 --> 21:26.360
According to Ken Farley,

21:26.360 --> 21:28.920
head of Perseverance's science team,

21:28.920 --> 21:32.320
photos taken by Ingenuity during its 12th flight

21:32.320 --> 21:34.400
showed that a region that they might have wanted

21:34.400 --> 21:35.560
to check out with the Rover,

21:35.560 --> 21:37.840
which of course takes a lot longer to get there,

21:37.840 --> 21:40.360
well, the photos showed it was kind of just boring.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.240
And so they might actually not send the Rover there.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.300
Okay, maybe that's boring,

21:44.300 --> 21:46.400
but that means valuable time is saved

21:46.400 --> 21:48.240
and they can go look for more interesting areas

21:48.240 --> 21:49.560
to do better science.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.940
That seems huge, actually.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.520
That seems like a great use of the Linux Copter.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.820
Yeah, it really does.

21:54.820 --> 21:57.520
And hopefully it's gonna keep going, right?

21:57.520 --> 21:59.480
I mean, in theory, it's been doing well,

21:59.480 --> 22:02.040
but there is an approaching Martian winter,

22:02.040 --> 22:03.920
kind of the reverse problem you're having, Chris.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.540
So we'll see, fingers crossed that Ingenuity makes it out.

22:07.540 --> 22:08.840
But regardless of what happens

22:08.840 --> 22:11.160
with our favorite first Copter,

22:11.160 --> 22:15.280
NASA now has a whole bunch of data from all those flights

22:15.280 --> 22:19.280
and is already working on a next generation successor or two.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.960
Maybe something in the 20 to 30 kilogram range,

22:21.960 --> 22:25.200
able to carry science payloads.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.440
Ooh, very cool.

22:27.440 --> 22:30.480
I mean, just as a reconnaissance little robot too,

22:30.480 --> 22:32.000
it's so awesome.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.320
And I could see the winter being particularly challenging.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.240
The great thing is if it survives,

22:37.240 --> 22:38.820
you know the software is gonna run.

22:38.820 --> 22:40.500
It's gonna just keep going, so.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.040
You just say that because it's powered by Linux.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.600
Yeah, that's right, that's right.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.560
Well, let's talk about our friends over at Plasma.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.400
Plasma's Wayland session is getting really, really stable,

22:51.400 --> 22:54.300
at least just recently following a bunch of fixes.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.920
And of course, KD developer, Nate Graham,

22:55.920 --> 22:58.180
continues to publish his weekly development summaries,

22:58.180 --> 22:59.280
outlining all of the work,

22:59.280 --> 23:00.960
which we are very appreciative here on the show

23:00.960 --> 23:02.680
and we read every single week.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.680
This week, he's got good things to say

23:04.680 --> 23:06.920
about the state of KDE on Wayland.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.040
Gazillions of bug fixes,

23:09.040 --> 23:11.840
including many for the Plasma Wayland session.

23:11.840 --> 23:14.520
It's finally reaching stability.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.400
I'm using it myself as a daily driver now.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.360
And at this point,

23:18.360 --> 23:21.640
my biggest annoyances are all with third party apps,

23:21.640 --> 23:24.800
not any KDE software.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.280
I know it's taken a while,

23:26.280 --> 23:29.800
but I think we're very nearly there.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.640
That's great.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.880
If you just add another three releases on top of that,

23:33.880 --> 23:35.240
it's probably gonna really be there.

23:35.240 --> 23:39.760
I kid, but some highlights of this Plasma 5.23,

23:39.760 --> 23:43.000
beyond just X-Wayland and Wayland support, of course,

23:43.000 --> 23:44.860
is there is now improvements

23:44.860 --> 23:47.640
to how the Plasma desktop experience is on Wayland.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.080
Like for example,

23:49.080 --> 23:52.600
virtual desktops are now on a per activity basis on Wayland.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.060
Again, that wasn't the case before,

23:54.060 --> 23:55.320
that was only an X11 feature.

23:55.320 --> 23:58.000
And Plasma 5.23 will now correctly identify

23:58.000 --> 23:59.320
the sending app for notifications

23:59.320 --> 24:00.680
from flat pack applications,

24:00.680 --> 24:03.520
both on Wayland and on X-Wayland.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.320
And there are fixes for multiple Nvidia GPU issues

24:06.320 --> 24:09.080
with the Plasma Wayland session as well.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.000
And as Nate said,

24:11.000 --> 24:13.040
these are really just the cream of the crop

24:13.040 --> 24:16.600
of a gazillion other fixes and improvements.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.320
KDE Plasma 5.23 is really looking like

24:19.320 --> 24:21.040
it will be a great release.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.680
I think it should arrive sometime in early October.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.560
Really looking forward to that.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.080
The daily driver I've switched to is Plasma based.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.920
They offer a bunch of different desktop options,

24:29.920 --> 24:34.560
but I went with the Plasma one and I am so happy.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.440
There's a few tweaks that have been done to this one

24:36.440 --> 24:37.520
that have made me extra happy.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.040
And I'll share those with you when we get to that point.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.120
But first, there is a pretty anticipated development

24:44.120 --> 24:45.120
with NF tables.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.140
The Linux kernel is, as you know, very fast moving,

24:49.140 --> 24:52.620
but sometimes it seems like a few things

24:52.620 --> 24:54.840
can take a long time to land.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.080
And I would say NF tables is one of those.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.560
Yeah, really this is a good example of just,

24:59.560 --> 25:01.520
sometimes it takes a long time to get stuff right

25:01.520 --> 25:04.220
or get it merged, get it to a place that's usable.

25:04.220 --> 25:06.900
And as usual, Jonathan Corbett at LWN

25:06.900 --> 25:09.380
has a really great write up on some of the history

25:09.380 --> 25:11.600
and what's going on with NF tables,

25:11.600 --> 25:13.000
which if you're not familiar,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.320
aims to replace the kernel's packet filtering subsystem.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.680
And it started way back in 2008,

25:19.680 --> 25:22.120
but it's still not being used by most,

25:22.120 --> 25:25.240
perhaps even many production firewalls.

25:25.240 --> 25:28.080
That transition may be getting closer though,

25:28.080 --> 25:31.040
because there was just NF tables 1.0

25:31.040 --> 25:33.480
released on August 19th.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.680
Now look, we're not gonna judge you firewall

25:35.680 --> 25:37.080
how you want a firewall.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.720
You packet filter how you like to packet filter,

25:39.720 --> 25:42.560
but some of us see a need for a change.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.440
And you know, that could include the fact

25:44.440 --> 25:47.200
that the kernel has more than one packet filtering mechanism

25:47.200 --> 25:48.040
so it's complex.

25:48.040 --> 25:50.080
There's one for IPv4.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.300
Of course, as you probably just guessed,

25:51.300 --> 25:52.760
there's one for IPv6,

25:52.760 --> 25:54.840
and then there's one for ARP and so on.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.320
And each one of those subsystems is mostly independent

25:57.320 --> 25:59.600
with a lot of duplicated work and codes.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.360
Shock, surprise, right?

26:01.360 --> 26:03.240
And beyond that, IP tables contains

26:03.240 --> 26:05.920
an excessive amount of built-in protocol knowledge.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.640
And I think some would argue it suffers

26:08.640 --> 26:11.480
from a lack of a proper API

26:11.480 --> 26:13.760
for people who want to manage it at scale.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.560
And so I think that,

26:15.560 --> 26:17.400
that has led people to look for an alternative,

26:17.400 --> 26:18.520
all of those things combined.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.120
It's not that IP tables is bad itself,

26:20.120 --> 26:22.040
it's just everything in totality.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.240
You know, for people who like to mess with firewalls.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.980
And really more seriously here,

26:26.980 --> 26:30.500
the core idea behind NF tables is to kind of throw away

26:30.500 --> 26:32.280
as much of that protocol aware

26:32.280 --> 26:34.600
and specific machinery that you can,

26:34.600 --> 26:37.160
and replace it with a simple virtual machine

26:37.160 --> 26:39.720
that could be programmed from user space.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.880
So, and administrators would still write rules

26:41.880 --> 26:44.360
referring to specific packet header fields and such,

26:44.360 --> 26:45.960
because of course that's kind of what you need to do

26:45.960 --> 26:47.600
when you're setting up firewalls.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.360
But then in this model,

26:49.360 --> 26:51.360
user space tooling would translate those rules

26:51.360 --> 26:54.740
into low level commands and load that into the kernel,

26:54.740 --> 26:56.200
which basically it means

26:56.200 --> 26:58.520
you get smaller packet filtering engine

26:58.520 --> 27:00.200
that is way more flexible

27:00.200 --> 27:03.640
and has the potential to perform a lot better.

27:03.640 --> 27:05.840
Me like fast packet filtering.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.480
You know, I think a lot of us have probably heard

27:07.480 --> 27:09.400
the name NF tables because it did make a splash

27:09.400 --> 27:10.920
when it was launched, I'd say.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.720
But then it just kind of, I don't know,

27:12.720 --> 27:14.380
it just kind of disappeared from view.

27:14.380 --> 27:17.960
In 2013, the project was essentially rebooted

27:17.960 --> 27:20.000
and got a lot of code or all of its code,

27:20.000 --> 27:22.520
I don't remember exactly, merged into the mainline kernel.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.600
And they did that as like job one.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.520
So they got done with that.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.920
NF tables found its way into the Linux 3.13 kernel

27:29.920 --> 27:32.160
back in 2014.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.520
That feels like a million years ago.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.680
And since then, kind of the hard work

27:37.680 --> 27:40.080
has been just filling in all the little gaps.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.380
The core engine was in the kernel,

27:41.380 --> 27:43.320
but you actually need to make NF tables

27:43.320 --> 27:45.200
sufficiently appealing that users

27:45.200 --> 27:47.520
would want to make the transition.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.740
The language that you use to write those filtering rules,

27:49.740 --> 27:51.680
it's gained a lot of new features since then

27:51.680 --> 27:54.080
for stateful tracking, address mapping,

27:54.080 --> 27:57.400
and all kinds of other stuff like handling large rule sets.

27:57.400 --> 28:00.080
There's also documentation to write, of course.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.400
There is an NF tables Wiki,

28:01.400 --> 28:02.840
which we'll have linked in the show notes,

28:02.840 --> 28:04.960
but it sounds like that's still one area

28:04.960 --> 28:06.920
that is maybe a bit lacking.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.080
Yeah, I think though the biggest challenge,

28:09.080 --> 28:10.880
and I bet people listening right now

28:10.880 --> 28:12.400
are thinking this already,

28:12.400 --> 28:15.580
it's that there's so many people

28:15.580 --> 28:17.840
that are using IP tables already.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.580
You know, they have their setup that they like.

28:21.580 --> 28:22.920
They don't want to mess with it

28:22.920 --> 28:24.840
because they've developed it over years

28:24.840 --> 28:26.480
through blood, sweat, and tears,

28:26.480 --> 28:29.680
and lots of hard lessons learned,

28:29.680 --> 28:31.240
and they just want it to keep working.

28:31.240 --> 28:32.920
It's been working for fine.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.280
Why switch to something like NF tables

28:35.280 --> 28:37.280
when IP tables is doing the job,

28:37.280 --> 28:39.880
and it's perfectly fast enough for them?

28:39.880 --> 28:42.640
I think that is going to be the biggest barrier to adoption

28:42.640 --> 28:43.880
and people switching over.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.600
Yeah, I mean, firewalls are a serious component

28:45.600 --> 28:47.000
of your security, right?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.480
Like you don't want to go changing this

28:48.480 --> 28:50.800
and suddenly realize that packets you thought were dropped

28:50.800 --> 28:52.080
are no longer dropped,

28:52.080 --> 28:54.960
or ports you thought were closed are suddenly open,

28:54.960 --> 28:58.840
but it may not be so bad because in some cases,

28:58.840 --> 29:03.040
users might be able to make that jump without even noticing.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.560
Linux distributions have carried support

29:04.560 --> 29:06.800
for NF tables for a while now,

29:06.800 --> 29:09.200
and work is being done to port some tools

29:09.200 --> 29:11.840
like Red Hat's firewall D to NF tables.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.120
So if you're using a higher level tool,

29:14.120 --> 29:15.780
once they've switched the backend out,

29:15.780 --> 29:17.360
you can just keep your rules and that engine

29:17.360 --> 29:20.500
will handle converting things from IP tables to NF tables.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.300
Right, or I suppose put another way,

29:22.300 --> 29:23.600
it's like if you're going to transition,

29:23.600 --> 29:25.480
maybe transition to this higher level tool,

29:25.480 --> 29:28.600
so that way when these kind of backend changes happen,

29:28.600 --> 29:29.440
you can move around.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.920
And I mean, it's deployed to a point, right?

29:31.920 --> 29:34.400
Like Debian got it in Debian 10 Buster,

29:34.400 --> 29:36.080
which was released in 2019,

29:36.080 --> 29:39.660
but Ubuntu didn't adopt it until 2104.

29:39.660 --> 29:41.260
So I mean, most districts do have it,

29:41.260 --> 29:43.800
but 2104 is a fairly recent release of Ubuntu

29:43.800 --> 29:45.080
to actually have it land.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.040
Yeah, really.

29:46.040 --> 29:48.540
As with all these things, it just takes a long time.

29:48.540 --> 29:51.520
I mean, in this case, 13 years,

29:51.520 --> 29:55.240
but with 1.0, with Netfilter declaring IP tables now

29:55.240 --> 29:58.120
a legacy tool at the latest Netfilter workshop,

29:58.120 --> 30:00.720
it seems like now is a great time to give it a shot

30:00.720 --> 30:04.320
and prepare yourself for what may be our eventual future.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.520
Neil, I can hear your ears are burning.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.760
You've got something to say about this.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.600
Go ahead.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.520
Firewall D 1.0 happened,

30:10.520 --> 30:14.840
and that's actually going to land in Fedora Linux 35.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.840
And it defaults to NF tables.

30:16.840 --> 30:20.340
So it actually will transition everything over.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.780
And if you're using most of the higher level

30:23.780 --> 30:25.360
default behaviors with Firewall D,

30:25.360 --> 30:28.680
like using services, telling it via add ports or whatnot,

30:28.680 --> 30:32.640
it'll seamlessly translate those into NF tables rules.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.760
Libvert has already been adapted for it.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.520
Container engines are in the process of being adapted.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.440
I think they're all done in Fedora.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.840
So across the board, generally speaking,

30:42.840 --> 30:45.840
with Fedora Linux 35, you're going to see NF tables

30:45.840 --> 30:47.360
being used, and you won't notice

30:47.360 --> 30:50.120
because it's all been done for you in the background.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.920
If Firewall D has been told by the user

30:52.920 --> 30:55.400
to add specific firewall IP tables rules,

30:55.400 --> 30:56.640
because you can do that.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.520
You can say, I want to add this IP tables rule

30:59.520 --> 31:00.660
and Firewall D will manage it.

31:00.660 --> 31:03.920
Then it won't auto flip, but otherwise it will.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.520
So in Fedora, it's already done.

31:06.520 --> 31:08.000
It's also the case in RHEL 8.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.420
They actually did it before Fedora did

31:10.420 --> 31:12.320
because initially it happened in Fedora.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.800
It got reverted once and now they're trying again

31:14.800 --> 31:16.320
and saying, this is now good.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.500
And of course in RHEL 9, it will be there too.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.340
I like that.

31:19.340 --> 31:20.160
That sounds good.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.520
A nice, smooth transition.

31:21.520 --> 31:22.720
That sounds appealing.

31:22.720 --> 31:26.560
Lino.com slash unplugged.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.960
Go there to get $100 in credit on a new account

31:28.960 --> 31:30.160
and you support the show.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.840
You know, a Linux content creator out there,

31:32.840 --> 31:35.600
Nick at the Linux experiment just went full time

31:35.600 --> 31:36.680
a few weeks ago.

31:36.680 --> 31:40.460
And yesterday, YouTube shut down his channel

31:40.460 --> 31:42.880
with no communication or maybe by the time you're hearing

31:42.880 --> 31:44.100
this probably a couple of days ago,

31:44.100 --> 31:46.560
they just deleted his channel, removed it completely.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.600
And then told him that if he didn't respond fast enough,

31:48.600 --> 31:49.460
he'd be gone forever.

31:49.460 --> 31:51.880
And then just kind of gave him the cold shoulder.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.880
And he had just gone full time.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.800
That's so scary.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.680
Imagine that your livelihood just like that

31:56.680 --> 31:58.220
taken away from you.

31:58.220 --> 32:02.360
And that's why I want to just say thank you to everyone

32:02.360 --> 32:03.840
who takes advantage of our sponsors,

32:03.840 --> 32:05.980
who understands the model that we have here.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.760
This is an independent business.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.440
You know, it's just a small team of us

32:09.440 --> 32:11.360
that are independently working our butts off

32:11.360 --> 32:14.000
to make content every single week for you.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.520
And the reason why we can stick around and do these shows

32:16.520 --> 32:18.300
is because you take advantage of our sponsors

32:18.300 --> 32:20.880
or you become members or you tell people about the show.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.320
And the great thing about Linode

32:23.320 --> 32:25.840
is it's a perfect partnership where we can work

32:25.840 --> 32:27.800
with a partner that gets what we're doing

32:27.800 --> 32:29.560
and you guys get what they do.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.560
Because like JB, they're independently owned

32:32.560 --> 32:35.120
and they've been doing this one thing for a long time.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.200
They've been doing it longer than we have.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.280
They have been focused on cloud computing for 18 years.

32:40.280 --> 32:43.840
I mean, that's really something that defines an industry

32:43.840 --> 32:46.380
and they have focused on just doing a really good job

32:46.380 --> 32:47.220
at that.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.200
And because they're Linux geeks along the way,

32:49.200 --> 32:51.520
they understood the reason why they should reinvest back

32:51.520 --> 32:52.520
into the community.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.780
They get how that works.

32:53.780 --> 32:54.880
They've helped projects out.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.420
They've helped out this network.

32:56.420 --> 32:57.960
I mean, they've really been there

32:57.960 --> 32:59.320
for a lot of different groups,

32:59.320 --> 33:02.280
including although we don't get to go to them anymore,

33:02.280 --> 33:05.440
some of our favorite events like Linux Fest Northwest.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.960
And as a long time Linux user,

33:07.960 --> 33:10.340
I really can tell that they are fans,

33:10.340 --> 33:12.960
that they have built tools around Linux

33:12.960 --> 33:14.840
before the technology necessarily existed.

33:14.840 --> 33:17.560
Like at the time when they became their own ISP,

33:17.560 --> 33:20.160
it was extremely uncommon to run Linux on your routers

33:20.160 --> 33:21.160
and on your switches.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.760
And I just, that was insane.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.580
Who does that?

33:24.580 --> 33:26.240
Who runs Linux on their firewalls, routers and switches?

33:26.240 --> 33:27.080
Nobody does that.

33:27.080 --> 33:27.900
Well, Linode did.

33:27.900 --> 33:29.040
They wanted to figure out a way to do it.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.440
And as a result, they have a flexible service

33:31.440 --> 33:33.440
that's been able to meet the needs of their users.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.000
And now they have 11 data centers around the world

33:36.000 --> 33:37.440
with nearly a million customers.

33:37.440 --> 33:39.240
And man, they've just built a product

33:39.240 --> 33:40.200
that you've got to check out.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.560
And that's why they're confident in giving you $100

33:42.560 --> 33:44.040
because they know if they give you $100

33:44.040 --> 33:45.320
and they give you 60 days to play with it,

33:45.320 --> 33:46.160
you're going to go on there

33:46.160 --> 33:47.180
and you're going to build something.

33:47.180 --> 33:48.020
You're going to try it.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.640
And you're going to see that it's faster.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.680
The UI is cleaner.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.080
The documentation is better.

33:52.080 --> 33:53.560
The API is fantastic.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.580
And the customer support is the best in the business.

33:55.580 --> 33:58.260
That's why I run my business infrastructure on Linode.

33:58.260 --> 34:01.360
So go to linode.com slash unplugged,

34:01.360 --> 34:05.080
sign up, support the show and get $100 to kick the tires

34:05.080 --> 34:06.600
and see what we've been talking about.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.840
Linode is the best way to host something

34:08.840 --> 34:11.160
and they're true real Linux users.

34:11.160 --> 34:12.960
So you can rest assured knowing

34:12.960 --> 34:14.520
that they love what they're doing.

34:14.520 --> 34:15.360
And I love it.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.120
I love it when that works its way into a product.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.340
Linode.com slash unplugged.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.360
You can't just use Linux for fun, can you?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.200
No, I only use it to get work done.

34:26.200 --> 34:28.300
You know that Windows is for fun.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.240
Right, it's only a serious tool.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.960
And you should never download a distribution

34:32.960 --> 34:35.520
just because you think you might have fun with it.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.260
Except for that's exactly what I did.

34:37.260 --> 34:39.280
A little while ago on July 22nd,

34:39.280 --> 34:42.600
I decided to give Garuda Linux a try.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.340
And I kind of laughed it off as a project

34:45.340 --> 34:49.400
because it looked like Linux turned up to neon 11 to me.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.680
And when it comes to ready-made arch based distributions,

34:52.680 --> 34:55.520
Endeavor OS and Manjaro really serve that purpose

34:55.520 --> 34:56.920
very, very well.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.680
And I just sort of instinctually kind of brushed it off

34:59.680 --> 35:02.000
thinking, yeah, that's what we need is another arch clone.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.280
Yeah, that's going to solve the problem.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.320
But then I decided, you know, I looked at their website

35:07.320 --> 35:08.800
and I liked a few things about it.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.220
I liked how opinionated it was.

35:11.220 --> 35:14.800
It felt like kind of a distro of before

35:14.800 --> 35:17.680
where they were going to kind of actually reminded me

35:17.680 --> 35:18.840
a little bit of Mandrake.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.440
I have to be honest with you.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.960
Where they've got some tools to manage the distribution.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.000
They've really picked a theme and identity.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.240
They embrace it and they've optimized it

35:27.240 --> 35:28.280
for the user desktop.

35:28.280 --> 35:29.800
And that's been their sole focus.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.720
And those are items that appealed to me.

35:33.720 --> 35:34.840
And I was ready just to,

35:34.840 --> 35:36.480
I was going to try an intermediary distro

35:36.480 --> 35:38.200
before our next review anyways.

35:38.200 --> 35:43.000
And so I decided to throw Garuda on my ThinkPad X1.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.240
And my initial impressions were that it was gaudy.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.480
That it was over the top.

35:47.480 --> 35:51.480
That it was a little, it clashed a little bit

35:51.480 --> 35:52.960
in a few places.

35:52.960 --> 35:54.480
But as I started to use it,

35:54.480 --> 35:57.760
I started to take it a little bit more seriously.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.840
And I started to notice that my system felt

35:59.840 --> 36:01.000
a little more responsive.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.680
You know, they use the Zen kernel, for example,

36:02.680 --> 36:05.240
which is, you know, you can argue for it or against it.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.540
But some people say it's great for desktop loads.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.640
They've chosen a CPU scheduler also

36:10.640 --> 36:14.000
that's maybe more tuned for desktop performance.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.360
And they've done things like they've enabled ZRAM

36:16.360 --> 36:17.400
by default.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.760
They've turned on an out of memory killer.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.480
And they're using ButterFS as default file system

36:22.480 --> 36:25.640
with ZTSD, ZSD compression.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.440
I don't know, Z standard compression I guess it must be.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.680
Z standard.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.280
Anyways, it's a formula.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.240
It's a recipe that I like.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.040
And so I kind of tried to encourage Wes

36:35.040 --> 36:35.880
to take a look at it.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.540
And you've got fresher first impressions than I do, Wes.

36:38.540 --> 36:41.720
So I'm curious to know, like, when you decided to bite

36:41.720 --> 36:42.960
and you went over to the website

36:42.960 --> 36:44.520
and you gave it a download,

36:44.520 --> 36:46.200
just curious what your first impressions were.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.480
Ooh, there's just a lot here.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.760
The theme kind of is intense.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.880
Yes, gaudy is probably a good word for it.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.480
But it's consistent.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.640
There's elements that I like.

36:57.640 --> 37:00.520
It all hangs together very nicely.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.640
And there's just a lot of attention to detail

37:02.640 --> 37:04.880
in areas I'm not used to.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.240
I think we're used to thinking about

37:06.240 --> 37:08.240
the kind of attention to detail in the distro building

37:08.240 --> 37:10.340
and maybe a bigger classic distro sense

37:10.340 --> 37:11.720
and all the hard work that Fedora does

37:11.720 --> 37:12.760
that we highlight on the show

37:12.760 --> 37:15.240
to build the next generation of the Linux desktop

37:15.240 --> 37:16.960
and integrate a lot of these low level tools

37:16.960 --> 37:19.160
or the Ubuntu team putting together

37:19.160 --> 37:20.960
an Ubuntu desktop release.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.760
But because it's built on Arch,

37:23.760 --> 37:26.600
you're basically just installing a bunch of upstream software

37:26.600 --> 37:29.740
and so you get these tweaks in other areas

37:29.740 --> 37:32.420
that you kind of don't on more mainstream distros.

37:32.420 --> 37:35.000
Yeah, you know, you can see this with Manjaro too.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.160
They provide you some tools to select your kernel

37:37.160 --> 37:38.380
and they give you some wizards

37:38.380 --> 37:41.900
and they work you through part of the setup process.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.840
What Garuda does differently is they take all of that

37:45.840 --> 37:48.640
and they kind of turn it up to 12 or 13 even.

37:48.640 --> 37:53.640
And as I used it, they call their KDE look Dragonfied

37:53.800 --> 37:56.040
and it's a variant of the sweet theme for Plasma.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.240
And as I used it, it dawned on me,

37:58.240 --> 38:02.740
I've always had a problem with Plasma's

38:02.740 --> 38:05.920
sort of look and feel compared to GNOME Shell,

38:05.920 --> 38:08.000
like an elegance factor that GNOME Shell

38:08.000 --> 38:10.740
just felt like a little smoother in terms of look,

38:10.740 --> 38:13.100
a little sharper, a little cleaner.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.840
And on Plasma, I was always kind of attempting

38:16.840 --> 38:18.520
to get to that normal level of polish,

38:18.520 --> 38:20.120
but never quite getting there

38:20.120 --> 38:22.400
and always left a little frustrated.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.860
And I often just kind of just sort of gave up

38:24.860 --> 38:26.000
and always just went back to Breeze

38:26.000 --> 38:27.600
because Breeze works with everything

38:27.600 --> 38:29.080
and maybe it's not perfect.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.340
Just becomes kind of a workstation focus.

38:31.340 --> 38:32.280
Yeah, you're like, okay, whatever.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.780
It's not as beautiful as maybe I want,

38:33.780 --> 38:36.780
but it works great, I love Plasma, so I'm happy enough.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.280
Where Garuda comes along and says,

38:38.280 --> 38:39.880
well, if it's not gonna be beautiful,

38:39.880 --> 38:43.380
what if we just embrace the shit out of being different

38:43.380 --> 38:45.800
and kind of like an elite desktop?

38:45.800 --> 38:49.260
What if we just kind of lean into it a little bit?

38:49.260 --> 38:50.740
And that's what Garuda has done.

38:50.740 --> 38:52.480
Like the terminal is,

38:52.480 --> 38:55.800
it's got like a kind of a blurred fade to it by default.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.860
They launch it with like NeoFetch output information.

38:58.860 --> 39:01.160
They've got a customized shell.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.000
The icons are very neon.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.480
The look is very, very unique

39:05.480 --> 39:09.020
and it actually has won me over, over time.

39:09.020 --> 39:12.760
And they have these management tools that I like

39:12.760 --> 39:15.840
that remind me of the Drake tools from Mandriva

39:15.840 --> 39:16.680
or the Drac tools.

39:16.680 --> 39:19.920
Like they give you one to help you install curated games

39:19.920 --> 39:21.800
and emulators, just check a few boxes

39:21.800 --> 39:22.760
and you can get everything.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.440
Like there's gaming software on there I'd never heard of,

39:25.440 --> 39:27.920
like a free Epic launcher replacement.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.520
I got that installed now.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.280
They have boot options to let you tweak kernel parameters,

39:32.280 --> 39:34.140
select the default OS that boots,

39:34.140 --> 39:36.360
disable Specter mitigations and a lot more.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.300
I mean, they just,

39:37.300 --> 39:39.800
they have tools for managing common butterFS things

39:39.800 --> 39:42.320
like getting an accurate free space reading,

39:42.320 --> 39:43.760
running a rebalance if you need.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.360
And it'll tell you, you don't need to do this.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.760
It'll say right there, this is not needed right now.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.480
Give you tools to manage the fact that you have butterFS.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.720
And then on top of all of that,

39:52.720 --> 39:56.440
they have enabled time shift snapshots by default.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.040
And not only can you use the GUI

39:58.040 --> 40:00.440
and a command line interface to restore snapshots,

40:00.440 --> 40:02.800
but they also put a menu entry in grub.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.720
So when you're booting up,

40:03.720 --> 40:05.920
you can just restore from a snapshot

40:05.920 --> 40:07.920
right there at the boot menu.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.320
That's glorious when you're working

40:09.320 --> 40:10.480
with an arch-based system.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.280
It really is like kind of a new,

40:12.280 --> 40:13.640
maybe not new is the right word,

40:13.640 --> 40:15.880
but a different way of using arch.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.080
Obviously the packages, right?

40:17.080 --> 40:18.040
Are coming from arch.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.180
It's a lot of that arch goodness,

40:19.180 --> 40:21.680
but where I'm used to building up an arch system

40:21.680 --> 40:23.800
for myself and kind of selecting stuff,

40:23.800 --> 40:25.480
I feel like with Gruta, for good or bad,

40:25.480 --> 40:26.660
I almost have to do the opposite

40:26.660 --> 40:28.760
because so much of that has been done.

40:28.760 --> 40:29.800
Like you mentioned the terminal,

40:29.800 --> 40:31.160
that's probably where I crossed the line.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.260
I'm like, I don't want you showing NeoFetch

40:33.260 --> 40:34.560
every time I open the darn thing.

40:34.560 --> 40:37.400
That's just wasting my cycles, but it looks really nice.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.020
It's a good first experience.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.440
And for some things, it might make more sense

40:41.440 --> 40:43.700
to start with this if you like most of what they do,

40:43.700 --> 40:45.120
to start with Gruta and then, you know,

40:45.120 --> 40:46.800
just tweak things back down a little bit

40:46.800 --> 40:48.460
if there's some stuff you don't need.

40:48.460 --> 40:49.320
So I'll give you an example.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.740
So I think they're trying to make arch

40:51.740 --> 40:53.660
not for regular humans.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.080
They're not trying to make arch for humans,

40:55.080 --> 40:57.800
like Ubuntu's making Debian for humans.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.120
They're making arch for geeks

41:00.120 --> 41:02.120
that want a powerful workstation.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.200
And you guys know that always pushes my buttons.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.040
I'll give you an example.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.400
Like you've ever had an arch machine

41:07.400 --> 41:09.680
where you have key ring issues eventually,

41:09.680 --> 41:11.360
like this happens to me on a machine

41:11.360 --> 41:13.680
that if I don't update it frequently enough,

41:13.680 --> 41:15.440
well, this has happened to some Gruta users.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.000
So the team put together a tool that goes through

41:19.000 --> 41:22.240
and works out these key ring issues during updates.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.200
It automatically updates your key rings in the backgrounds

41:24.200 --> 41:26.320
and it also lets you go through and install

41:26.320 --> 41:27.960
what they have as like a hot fix package,

41:27.960 --> 41:29.800
which resolves the issue.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.560
It's just, it's a tool that really is only applicable

41:32.560 --> 41:34.280
for a rolling distribution like arch

41:34.280 --> 41:35.520
that has something like that.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.040
It happens every now and then.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.400
And then this just smooths it out for you.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.280
And so they've built a few tools like that,

41:40.280 --> 41:41.120
like, and you know,

41:41.120 --> 41:42.480
or included tools that have been created

41:42.480 --> 41:43.980
by other distributions.

41:43.980 --> 41:44.900
There's a little bit of that too.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.880
Like they're using the same installer that Endeavor uses

41:47.880 --> 41:50.200
and timeshift of course is, you know,

41:50.200 --> 41:52.040
it's available for any distribution,

41:52.040 --> 41:53.040
but it's nice to see it.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.920
And it has its own look, but you can change that.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.240
And if you change the theme, if it's too much for you,

41:59.240 --> 42:01.100
you've still got a lot of great choices.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.360
Snapshots by default, butterFS by default,

42:03.360 --> 42:05.280
current plasma by default.

42:05.280 --> 42:07.960
I would also argue, although I think this is,

42:07.960 --> 42:09.560
people could see it the other way.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.260
I like that they're using the Zen kernel

42:11.260 --> 42:13.360
and I like that they're using a desktop scheduler.

42:13.360 --> 42:16.680
I think those things are tweaks and changes

42:16.680 --> 42:18.740
that I've begun making to my boxes.

42:18.740 --> 42:22.200
And in part, that's how I came across Garuda is I,

42:22.200 --> 42:24.840
and Wes knows this, since I got my X1,

42:24.840 --> 42:27.720
I have been on kind of this pursuit to make it faster,

42:27.720 --> 42:30.440
to make it perform as well as it did under Windows.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.560
I mean, I think you kind of want to forget that there's,

42:32.560 --> 42:33.920
you know, anything between you

42:33.920 --> 42:35.800
and exactly what you want the computer to do, right?

42:35.800 --> 42:38.240
Like when you see those apps take a while to launch,

42:38.240 --> 42:40.580
that seems to cause you physical pain.

42:40.580 --> 42:41.420
It does.

42:41.420 --> 42:43.480
Well, it really, it broke me after I,

42:43.480 --> 42:45.940
on a lark, tried Windows 11 on the X1,

42:45.940 --> 42:47.960
and it was faster and the battery life

42:47.960 --> 42:49.500
was significantly better.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.340
Ugh.

42:50.340 --> 42:53.720
And I'm like, no, this cannot stand.

42:53.720 --> 42:56.460
So I had been doing a custom arch install

42:56.460 --> 42:59.680
and I had done the like Alan Cox kernel

42:59.680 --> 43:02.960
and I was doing all my little tweaks to like pre-cache stuff

43:02.960 --> 43:04.200
and put the browsers in RAM,

43:04.200 --> 43:05.800
all the stuff I've talked about before.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.760
And I was building a lot of this myself anyways.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.600
And that's kind of when I discovered Garuda.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.640
And I thought, well, this is silly,

43:12.640 --> 43:16.080
but I'm exasperated at this, at this laptop at this point.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.280
I'm just going to throw this silly distribution on there.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.680
And I admit, I thought that way.

43:20.680 --> 43:21.520
And then about a week into it,

43:21.520 --> 43:22.880
I was like, that's not so bad actually.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.500
And I thought the first thing I'd do is change the theme,

43:24.500 --> 43:25.800
but I didn't.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.080
And that never happens.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.360
And so I stuck with it for a little bit.

43:28.360 --> 43:29.360
And now here I am.

43:29.360 --> 43:32.400
I'm like, man, I've been using this for more than a month.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.320
And I think this is my new go-to Arch.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.320
And I'm not recommending it for everybody.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.320
I still think Manjaro and mainline Arch,

43:39.320 --> 43:41.280
if you want to use Arch are the way to go.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.800
That's my official recommendation.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.400
But if you kind of line up with me

43:46.400 --> 43:48.640
and how you want your Linux desktop to perform

43:48.640 --> 43:51.520
and how you use Linux, it's worth a fun look

43:51.520 --> 43:53.080
because if nothing else,

43:53.080 --> 43:55.060
it's like visiting a version of Linux

43:55.060 --> 43:57.000
that used to be very common,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
where they had lots of apps and tweaks preloaded.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.180
They had management tools.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.060
They had a strong identity

44:03.060 --> 44:05.160
and they tried to solve a specific problem

44:05.160 --> 44:06.000
for a specific niche.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.380
And that's what Garuda does,

44:07.380 --> 44:09.560
including it has various different versions.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.820
Cause like Wes, I know you're a huge gaming guy now.

44:11.820 --> 44:13.940
So I installed the gaming version.

44:13.940 --> 44:14.780
Yeah. Right.

44:14.780 --> 44:15.600
Why not?

44:15.600 --> 44:16.440
It comes with steam.

44:16.440 --> 44:18.040
It comes with a whole bunch of handy tools.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.280
And honestly, that's one area where it is kind of nice

44:20.280 --> 44:21.400
because yeah, all right.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.400
I like to play games,

44:22.400 --> 44:25.360
but not that many and mostly on Linux.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.980
I don't keep up with the latest and greatest

44:26.980 --> 44:29.720
of optimizing Nvidia integrations with stuff

44:29.720 --> 44:32.640
or like little tweaks to make gaming go better.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.040
So if Garuda does, that's pretty useful

44:35.040 --> 44:36.520
cause it's exactly the kind of thing

44:36.520 --> 44:38.800
where I don't necessarily want to spend an hour.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.280
I might want to go play with NF tables

44:40.280 --> 44:41.840
rather than tweak my system for gaming.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.120
So I can get something out of the box

44:43.120 --> 44:44.520
that just makes it easy.

44:44.520 --> 44:45.340
That's great.

44:45.340 --> 44:46.180
Yeah.

44:46.180 --> 44:47.440
They also in their management tools,

44:47.440 --> 44:49.240
they have options to like check a box

44:49.240 --> 44:53.540
to turn on auto CPU fric or maybe you want thermal D.

44:53.540 --> 44:55.080
So they have a few things that just make it quick

44:55.080 --> 44:56.480
to play with that kind of stuff,

44:56.480 --> 44:59.160
which this was my take on it.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.120
It's just, they have a lot of tools

45:01.120 --> 45:03.360
that you can do something really quick.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.280
That's just an alternative to you going

45:05.280 --> 45:06.720
and looking up how to do it in the Wiki

45:06.720 --> 45:08.320
and then doing the same thing on the command line.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.400
Like it's nothing you couldn't figure out on your own

45:10.400 --> 45:12.720
if you're this type of user,

45:12.720 --> 45:15.520
but maybe you don't want to have to all the time.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.540
And it's neat to see them working on that.

45:17.540 --> 45:18.920
And it's interesting too, in the arch world,

45:18.920 --> 45:21.880
I feel that, you know, some other distribution sometimes

45:21.880 --> 45:23.320
I don't necessarily know where to look.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.480
You know, I might be curious what that GUI tool is,

45:25.480 --> 45:27.680
but because they kind of do it their own way,

45:27.680 --> 45:29.600
I don't always know like exactly how that's implemented

45:29.600 --> 45:32.320
under the hood, but because I mean, it's just on arch,

45:32.320 --> 45:33.680
you can kind of tweak it in Garuda.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.840
And then if you want to, yeah, go pull up the Wiki

45:35.840 --> 45:38.320
and go find out where all that lives under the hood.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.360
Yeah, and as far as I'm concerned,

45:40.360 --> 45:41.680
it's staying on this laptop.

45:41.680 --> 45:43.760
And the next time I need a quick arch box,

45:43.760 --> 45:46.640
I'm going Garuda because they're doing 98%

45:46.640 --> 45:48.280
of the tweaks that I would do.

45:48.280 --> 45:51.440
And also, I think it's one of the funnest distributions

45:51.440 --> 45:52.280
out there.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.120
It is a blast to try this thing.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.640
They have a clever community.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.480
They have what about eight members on their team,

45:57.480 --> 45:59.200
do you think Wes, roughly?

45:59.200 --> 46:01.040
Yeah, sure seems like it,

46:01.040 --> 46:03.320
and seemingly from across the world.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.360
And it's fairly new.

46:04.360 --> 46:05.840
I think it kind of came out last year.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.560
So it's been around for over a year now.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.440
And they've set up some services for their community.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.240
I didn't bother looking into how to sign up,

46:13.240 --> 46:16.120
but I did notice that they had a hosted Bitwarden available,

46:16.120 --> 46:19.760
hosted Nextcloud, a private pastebin alternative,

46:19.760 --> 46:21.840
collaborative like notepad thing.

46:21.840 --> 46:24.120
They had a few services that they would make available

46:24.120 --> 46:25.040
to their community.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.560
And they also make a start page available,

46:26.560 --> 46:29.520
which, you know, I don't need that, but it's nice.

46:29.520 --> 46:30.400
It's a good idea.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.960
And it's further extending open source,

46:32.960 --> 46:34.520
other open source projects too.

46:34.520 --> 46:36.120
Right, and I think it adds to that,

46:36.120 --> 46:37.680
that feeling of community, right?

46:37.680 --> 46:39.840
Like you feel like you're, it's not just like,

46:39.840 --> 46:41.280
for better or worse in the arch world,

46:41.280 --> 46:42.480
you're kind of left out on your own, right?

46:42.480 --> 46:44.520
Like they've got the Wiki and there's forums,

46:44.520 --> 46:46.360
but like you are the one who's doing this.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.440
And Groota feels just a little bit more,

46:48.440 --> 46:50.760
like people are out there to maybe hold your hand

46:50.760 --> 46:52.000
if you want to hold hands.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.720
You know, Chris, I was noticing those services

46:53.720 --> 46:56.840
when I went diving in to try to find out how active

46:56.840 --> 46:58.400
this project was.

46:58.400 --> 47:02.400
And I expected them to be charging a little bit of money

47:02.400 --> 47:04.640
for these services, but it seems to me,

47:04.640 --> 47:06.480
I couldn't figure out a way to give them money

47:06.480 --> 47:07.320
for the services.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.960
They're just kind of giving it to the community.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.200
There's certainly a donate page,

47:10.200 --> 47:12.360
but it'd be nice to see a project like this

47:12.360 --> 47:13.480
stick around for a while.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.600
So they have a couple of ways to contribute right now.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.240
The primary way they want you to contribute,

47:17.240 --> 47:21.400
the problem there is that platform is really only set up

47:21.400 --> 47:22.480
for monthly contributions.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.360
Where I basically, I wanted to send them 50 bucks

47:24.360 --> 47:25.680
and say, thanks for the great distro.

47:25.680 --> 47:26.920
I don't necessarily want to send them money

47:26.920 --> 47:28.280
every single month.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.720
I like to annually give to projects that I'm still using

47:30.720 --> 47:32.640
because my usage changes sometimes.

47:32.640 --> 47:35.720
And then the second way they recommended things,

47:35.720 --> 47:38.040
oh, also the first way they recommend things,

47:38.040 --> 47:39.520
you can go in there and set up an account,

47:39.520 --> 47:40.480
connect it to your PayPal,

47:40.480 --> 47:41.960
but then when you go to contribute monthly,

47:41.960 --> 47:44.160
cause I kind of just decided fine, I'll do monthly,

47:44.160 --> 47:45.360
then it doesn't let you use PayPal.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.440
So then you have to connect it to a bank.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.880
And so I bailed at that point,

47:47.880 --> 47:49.920
I switched over to just send them a PayPal payment,

47:49.920 --> 47:51.800
which they have a link for that.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.360
And I was going to send them 50 bucks.

47:53.360 --> 47:55.720
And then I got an error saying that their PayPal stuff

47:55.720 --> 47:58.040
isn't working and you can't send them money right now.

47:58.040 --> 48:00.360
And they're using open collective to track expenses

48:00.360 --> 48:01.480
and try to document everything.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.200
So they're doing it in an open governance way.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.360
So I like that.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.240
And when they get their payment stuff sorted out,

48:06.240 --> 48:07.160
I'll send them a few bucks

48:07.160 --> 48:10.360
because it's been a great little desktop for me.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.880
And I think they should keep it going.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.680
I think they're doing something fun and unique here.

48:13.680 --> 48:17.960
And even if it's just a testing ground for fun ideas,

48:17.960 --> 48:18.800
I love this.

48:18.800 --> 48:20.760
And that's where I kind of wonder

48:20.760 --> 48:22.920
if there is a place for the fun distro.

48:22.920 --> 48:25.120
Like hear me out for a second,

48:25.120 --> 48:27.120
but I think you could make the argument

48:27.120 --> 48:29.520
that experienced Linux users

48:29.520 --> 48:31.440
who know how to submit bug reports,

48:31.440 --> 48:34.480
who maybe can kind of suss out the nature of a problem,

48:34.480 --> 48:37.400
they can probably help reproduce that problem.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.360
I almost feel like we have an obligation

48:39.360 --> 48:41.980
to use more mainstream distributions

48:41.980 --> 48:45.280
like your Ubuntu and your Fedoras and even your Mints,

48:45.280 --> 48:49.680
because those distributions need people submitting bugs.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.560
And they need users who understand how to submit bugs.

48:52.560 --> 48:54.880
And that's us, right?

48:54.880 --> 48:59.400
But here we are using these sort of niche distributions

48:59.400 --> 49:01.160
that maybe don't have a bigger impact

49:01.160 --> 49:02.480
on the wider Linux ecosystem.

49:02.480 --> 49:06.400
And that's where I wonder if it's slightly irresponsible

49:06.400 --> 49:08.600
on somebody who considers himself a Linux advocates part

49:08.600 --> 49:10.200
to use a distro like that.

49:10.200 --> 49:12.040
What are your thoughts, gentlemen?

49:12.040 --> 49:13.320
That's kind of tough.

49:13.320 --> 49:14.160
You're right.

49:14.160 --> 49:18.000
I mean, it is out there and you're not using some stuff

49:18.000 --> 49:20.160
that's been customized by the distro as much.

49:20.160 --> 49:21.240
Maybe you're just relying

49:21.240 --> 49:25.040
on the more upstream arch packages.

49:25.040 --> 49:26.840
So I don't know, I have two minds.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.300
I think there is an element of truth to that.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.120
But I also think that maybe the kind of issues

49:32.120 --> 49:35.140
that you're going to run into as someone who gravitated

49:35.140 --> 49:38.480
towards this kind of optimized distro for certain use cases

49:38.480 --> 49:41.100
are probably different than maybe the wifi issues

49:41.100 --> 49:43.100
that someone might have as a new user

49:43.100 --> 49:45.140
trying to use an Ubuntu desktop.

49:45.140 --> 49:47.460
So I think it's still important that you contribute

49:47.460 --> 49:50.520
both to Garuda and also maybe start filing some bugs

49:50.520 --> 49:52.680
upstream for stuff that doesn't work.

49:52.680 --> 49:55.440
But I don't know that I would worry too much about it.

49:55.440 --> 49:57.280
Seems to me like a project like this

49:57.280 --> 49:58.800
might get someone more interested

49:58.800 --> 50:02.640
or like get their minds thinking about things

50:02.640 --> 50:04.160
they never thought of before.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.440
Like some of the features you mentioned

50:05.440 --> 50:06.960
that they just make very easy

50:06.960 --> 50:09.240
to just kind of click and turn on.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.300
Wes was mentioning that having it work by default,

50:12.300 --> 50:15.160
but then diving in with curiosity to see how it all works.

50:15.160 --> 50:17.640
That speaks to me and gets my ears up.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.480
That is exactly how I love to learn.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.560
So I could see a project like this

50:21.560 --> 50:24.040
just getting us a whole bunch more contributors

50:24.040 --> 50:25.960
than we originally had.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.560
Yeah, okay, ByteBidden,

50:27.560 --> 50:29.520
you had something you wanted to add on the subject.

50:29.520 --> 50:33.240
Yeah, so I jumped in with the Dragon Eyes gaming version.

50:33.240 --> 50:35.360
I was like, well, hit me with it.

50:35.360 --> 50:39.560
And I was astonished by all the tools they deliver with it

50:39.560 --> 50:41.040
or even giving you the choice

50:41.040 --> 50:44.600
because I didn't know half the choices that I got

50:44.600 --> 50:46.640
where I felt informed.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.800
Do I want an emulator?

50:47.800 --> 50:49.480
They got an entire page of that

50:49.480 --> 50:53.720
and I can now check that information.

50:53.720 --> 50:56.640
And only downside is that I can't get

50:56.640 --> 50:59.760
my Nvidia proprietary driver working,

50:59.760 --> 51:03.420
but that's where the ButterFast snapshot feature came in

51:03.420 --> 51:05.560
and I was like, back.

51:05.560 --> 51:08.000
And you can keep testing and testing.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.300
And well, the only thing is that the Dragon Eyes version

51:12.300 --> 51:14.880
is a bit too sparkly for me.

51:14.880 --> 51:17.600
So I will probably step back to a normal version

51:17.600 --> 51:20.360
and then use their tooling to get back on it.

51:20.360 --> 51:24.280
But also you can install like five different software

51:24.280 --> 51:27.360
boutiques and updaters and stuff like that.

51:27.360 --> 51:30.120
So whatever you want, they have the choice for you

51:30.120 --> 51:34.080
to just check the box, click install and it's done.

51:34.080 --> 51:37.760
Yes, they have now a third configuration screen

51:37.760 --> 51:40.040
that might be a bit troublesome

51:40.040 --> 51:42.920
if you want to check for a setting

51:42.920 --> 51:45.300
somewhere in one of those three.

51:45.300 --> 51:47.020
But yeah, it's really nice.

51:47.020 --> 51:50.160
And also a lot of things I found in Barchi

51:50.160 --> 51:53.160
where I was like Barchi is my home system,

51:53.160 --> 51:56.560
Geruda felt like a bit like a new home to me.

51:56.560 --> 51:58.280
Yeah, it feels like a new home to me as well.

51:58.280 --> 52:01.840
And I think my take on the using the niche distros

52:01.840 --> 52:03.000
versus putting your attention

52:03.000 --> 52:05.440
and focus on the mainstream distros is

52:05.440 --> 52:08.240
it means the onus is on me to recognize

52:08.240 --> 52:11.040
or at least attempt to recognize as best I can

52:11.040 --> 52:13.200
that if I'm encountering a bug,

52:13.200 --> 52:15.380
is it because I'm using a different scheduler?

52:15.380 --> 52:16.920
Is it because I'm using a Zen kernel?

52:16.920 --> 52:19.240
Or is it because I'm using a very opinionated theme

52:19.240 --> 52:20.660
and this app isn't rendering correctly?

52:20.660 --> 52:23.600
Like the onus is on me to figure that out,

52:23.600 --> 52:26.300
but potentially because it is an arch derivative,

52:26.300 --> 52:27.860
I'm using a lot of upstream packages

52:27.860 --> 52:29.000
and I could still have an impact

52:29.000 --> 52:32.160
on those upstream projects if the bug is legitimate.

52:32.160 --> 52:34.240
And I think if I'm willing to accept that compromise

52:34.240 --> 52:36.840
that, hey, the onus is on me to suss out

52:36.840 --> 52:39.160
the cause of this and that is something

52:39.160 --> 52:40.000
I'm willing to accept,

52:40.000 --> 52:41.980
then I don't think it is a bad thing.

52:41.980 --> 52:43.360
I think you can still have an impact

52:43.360 --> 52:46.800
and because the beautiful thing about open sources is

52:46.800 --> 52:49.920
if I report an issue with console on Garuda,

52:49.920 --> 52:52.800
it's going to improve the situation for somebody

52:52.800 --> 52:56.000
on a future version of Fedora using plasma as well.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.480
And so I say, you know what?

52:58.480 --> 52:59.300
To hell with it.

52:59.300 --> 53:02.720
Go use the fun distro for a little while, have some fun.

53:02.720 --> 53:04.660
That's why we got into this stuff.

53:04.660 --> 53:06.640
Stop taking it so seriously all the time

53:06.640 --> 53:07.800
and just have some damn fun.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.160
That's what I say.

53:09.160 --> 53:10.840
Also, I want to mention that our friends

53:10.840 --> 53:14.180
over at a Cloud Guru have a course on Linux web services.

53:14.180 --> 53:16.840
So it's a course that focuses on the tools

53:16.840 --> 53:19.080
and utilities used to configure web services

53:19.080 --> 53:19.920
on a Linux host.

53:19.920 --> 53:21.800
So you're going to install Apache.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.200
You're going to install squid, I believe, NGINX.

53:24.200 --> 53:25.400
You're going to set up virtual hosts.

53:25.400 --> 53:28.440
You're going to set up reverse proxying, which is dope.

53:28.440 --> 53:31.480
You're going to mess with HTTP and SSL, load balancing.

53:31.480 --> 53:34.400
It's all in there including how to collect Apache metrics

53:34.400 --> 53:36.720
and all that stuff on NGINX as well.

53:36.720 --> 53:39.680
So head over to our show notes or go to acloudguru.com

53:39.680 --> 53:42.160
and search for Linux web services.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.720
We will have a link in the show notes

53:43.720 --> 53:48.160
at linuxunplug.com slash 422.

53:48.160 --> 53:49.520
Thank you to a Cloud Guru.

53:49.520 --> 53:51.960
Now we have some email to get into gentlemen.

53:51.960 --> 53:53.040
What do you say?

53:53.040 --> 53:54.360
Time for some feedback?

53:54.360 --> 53:57.560
Well, yes, our mailbag today is quite on theme

53:57.560 --> 54:02.140
because Oren has finally switched to plasma.

54:02.140 --> 54:05.800
He writes, IJB, I finally did it.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.200
After the recent episode in which you guys talked about KDE

54:08.200 --> 54:12.560
plasma as a great alternative to GNOME, I finally switched.

54:12.560 --> 54:15.000
I'm an Ubuntu user who prefers his desktop environment

54:15.000 --> 54:17.200
clean and stable.

54:17.200 --> 54:19.980
I don't like to install plugins and prefer to just use

54:19.980 --> 54:23.600
what comes out of the box, which is why my GNOME desktop stayed

54:23.600 --> 54:26.640
the same pretty much all the time.

54:26.640 --> 54:30.520
I held off on KDE largely because every time you guys

54:30.520 --> 54:32.720
talked about it, it sounded like you'd have to configure

54:32.720 --> 54:36.960
and invest time to get the whole system into a usable state.

54:36.960 --> 54:40.000
But I have to say, after a quick install,

54:40.000 --> 54:43.440
I love every minute of KDE.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.160
I feel like a younger version of myself

54:45.160 --> 54:47.640
when I first started using Windows 95

54:47.640 --> 54:50.960
after spending way too long in DOS.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.460
I click on every setting KDE has to offer.

54:53.460 --> 54:55.160
I've been going over it for over a week,

54:55.160 --> 54:58.560
and I still find cool new things.

54:58.560 --> 55:00.000
There's nothing that compares to it.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.920
The system is fully customizable,

55:01.920 --> 55:04.480
but it also works great with the default settings

55:04.480 --> 55:06.320
right out of the box.

55:06.320 --> 55:10.800
From my side, I'm sold, and I'm never going back.

55:10.800 --> 55:14.560
Yeah, the trick is, Oren, is to still get your work done

55:14.560 --> 55:16.800
and not spend all your time playing with all the settings.

55:16.800 --> 55:22.240
That's why you didn't have the dock done this morning.

55:22.240 --> 55:26.400
Yeah, I was too busy playing with my plasma.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.040
I do love it.

55:27.040 --> 55:27.880
I do love it a lot.

55:27.880 --> 55:29.880
Thanks, Oren, for writing in.

55:29.880 --> 55:31.280
And I'm glad you like it.

55:31.280 --> 55:33.900
I think it's different folks, different strokes.

55:33.900 --> 55:36.600
We got a bunch of suggestions for DWM

55:36.600 --> 55:39.560
last week after I complained about wanting tiling

55:39.560 --> 55:41.960
on particular virtual desktops.

55:41.960 --> 55:44.240
But different desktops for different folks.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.980
But plasma is working really great for us.

55:45.980 --> 55:48.320
I think all three of us now are on plasma, right?

55:48.320 --> 55:49.520
Yeah, it's your fault, Chris.

55:49.520 --> 55:50.960
Thank you very much.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.760
All right, well, I'll take that blame.

55:52.760 --> 55:53.840
I'll take that blame.

55:53.840 --> 55:56.880
We do have a bit of housekeeping.

55:56.880 --> 55:58.760
And I just wanted to mention the lup lug,

55:58.760 --> 56:00.440
because I haven't been able to make it for a few weeks,

56:00.440 --> 56:01.760
because I've been dying in the heat.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.360
But the lup lug continues on a nice, chilled, relaxed chat

56:04.360 --> 56:05.640
with Linux friends.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.440
You can get information about our mumble room

56:07.440 --> 56:09.920
at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

56:09.920 --> 56:11.700
Go over there, enjoy.

56:11.700 --> 56:13.280
And we'd also love to hear from you.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.080
Fact, we'd love to do a feedback episode again.

56:15.080 --> 56:15.780
It's been a bit.

56:15.780 --> 56:17.080
So send your questions in.

56:17.080 --> 56:18.800
We're going to start collecting them.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.800
I just decided right now, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

56:21.800 --> 56:23.840
Send in your questions to the show about anything

56:23.840 --> 56:26.320
we've covered in the past that you'd like us to follow up on,

56:26.320 --> 56:29.040
anything about the show itself, or a technology stack

56:29.040 --> 56:30.240
that you got questions about.

56:30.240 --> 56:33.040
We'll take them at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

56:33.040 --> 56:36.040
And last but not least, join the conversation

56:36.040 --> 56:39.520
that continues every single week at jupiterbroadcasting.com

56:39.520 --> 56:40.320
slash telegram.

56:40.320 --> 56:41.560
You can go in there, hang out.

56:41.560 --> 56:45.320
There's members of our crew chatting in there all the time.

56:45.320 --> 56:46.920
Oh, I suppose I do have one more thing.

56:46.920 --> 56:48.680
So not quite last, but now this one is.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.240
But definitely not least, the stickers.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.960
Go over to jupitergarage.com and grab yourself a sticker.

56:53.960 --> 56:54.920
They're great.

56:54.920 --> 56:56.040
They're fresh.

56:56.040 --> 56:57.720
And they're high resolution.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.520
And they make your laptop just look better.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.000
That's at jupitergarage.com.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.160
We have a pick this week.

57:05.160 --> 57:07.800
And this one is useful because YouTube

57:07.800 --> 57:10.440
has a habit of just pulling down content these days.

57:10.440 --> 57:13.760
So how about something to replace that YouTube

57:13.760 --> 57:16.960
DL, which seems to be on the rocks these days?

57:16.960 --> 57:21.920
Yeah, YTDLP, a YouTube DL fork with additional features

57:21.920 --> 57:23.080
and fixes.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.040
How about that?

57:24.040 --> 57:25.800
I mean, I love me some YouTube DL.

57:25.800 --> 57:27.840
I probably use it, if not every day,

57:27.840 --> 57:30.320
at least several times a week.

57:30.320 --> 57:32.760
But that's the beauty of open source, right?

57:32.760 --> 57:33.840
You can take something, maybe it's

57:33.840 --> 57:35.480
not seeing as much investment or maintenance,

57:35.480 --> 57:37.000
or you just have some new ideas.

57:37.000 --> 57:37.640
You can fork it.

57:37.640 --> 57:38.520
You can remix it.

57:38.520 --> 57:39.800
You can make it better.

57:39.800 --> 57:42.480
Yeah, it has all kinds of interesting features

57:42.480 --> 57:45.440
that they've added on top of YouTube DL.

57:45.440 --> 57:47.240
In fact, some things are really simple,

57:47.240 --> 57:49.240
just like the way it displays different formats.

57:49.240 --> 57:51.280
But then other things are fascinating.

57:51.280 --> 57:54.560
You can mark and remove sponsor sections in YouTube videos

57:54.560 --> 57:57.320
by utilizing the Sponsor Block API,

57:57.320 --> 57:59.600
and it has built-in support for that.

57:59.600 --> 58:03.000
It supports all kinds of resuming scenarios

58:03.000 --> 58:05.800
that YouTube DL doesn't, including workarounds

58:05.800 --> 58:07.120
for when YouTube throttles you.

58:07.120 --> 58:08.760
If anybody's a heavy YouTube DL user,

58:08.760 --> 58:11.200
you run into this, where YouTube starts throttling you.

58:11.200 --> 58:12.440
It happens to me.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.640
They got workarounds for that as well.

58:14.640 --> 58:17.160
But we have a bonus YouTube pick as well,

58:17.160 --> 58:20.200
because I think the faster you can get content off YouTube,

58:20.200 --> 58:21.040
the better.

58:21.040 --> 58:26.040
And this one is YTMDL, or YouTube Music Download, YTMDL.

58:27.280 --> 58:31.080
It's an app that just gets songs from YouTube in MP3.

58:31.080 --> 58:33.000
It grabs all of the metadata you'd like, too,

58:33.000 --> 58:34.440
and takes care of that, like the artist name,

58:34.440 --> 58:36.240
the album name, all of that.

58:36.240 --> 58:37.720
Yeah, that's the added benefit here.

58:37.720 --> 58:40.920
I mean, sure, YouTube DL, you can tell it to download MP3,

58:40.920 --> 58:43.880
but YTMDL, well, it's gonna go out to sources

58:43.880 --> 58:47.000
like iTunes, Spotify, Deezer, Last.fm,

58:47.000 --> 58:48.840
and pull all that juicy metadata

58:48.840 --> 58:51.880
that if you want to add this to your personal collection,

58:51.880 --> 58:52.960
you really need to have.

58:52.960 --> 58:54.720
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that's pretty nice to see.

58:54.720 --> 58:57.360
And you guys know we're big fans of PeerTube

58:57.360 --> 58:58.680
here on this show.

58:58.680 --> 59:01.120
We think that's a great way for content creators

59:01.120 --> 59:02.360
that want an independent,

59:02.360 --> 59:05.440
under their control media platform for video.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.560
But there's a lot of other alternatives out there, too.

59:07.560 --> 59:09.880
So the great thing about these apps

59:09.880 --> 59:11.560
is they support just about every

59:11.560 --> 59:13.560
semi-popular video streaming site.

59:13.560 --> 59:16.520
So it's not just YouTube that they work with,

59:16.520 --> 59:18.520
but we mention it because that's the most popular

59:18.520 --> 59:19.840
and that's how they name them.

59:19.840 --> 59:22.160
You know, pick suggestions,

59:22.160 --> 59:24.040
another great use of that, contact form.

59:24.040 --> 59:26.040
You get the sense, I really would like people

59:26.040 --> 59:28.520
to email us in questions and ideas and stuff

59:28.520 --> 59:30.200
just to help us out while we're on this road trip,

59:30.200 --> 59:33.520
because my God, has it been miserable on this road trip.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.840
We could use the help, you know,

59:34.840 --> 59:37.240
and it's a great way to touch base with the audience.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.480
If you've got something that you've added to your workflow

59:39.480 --> 59:41.080
that you think other folks in the audience

59:41.080 --> 59:43.960
might benefit from, yeah, please do send it in.

59:43.960 --> 59:45.800
Bonus points if it's made with rest.

59:45.800 --> 59:48.280
Totes, wow, yeah, I mean, we love to play the horn.

59:48.280 --> 59:50.920
And then also, I'm still on the road for a bit.

59:50.920 --> 59:53.240
I don't know exactly what my sitchimication is,

59:53.240 --> 59:55.080
and I don't know how many meetups I'll be able to do,

59:55.080 --> 59:57.160
but check out colonytracker.live,

59:57.160 --> 59:59.400
and there's a micro meetup link there.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.100
And if you can't meet up with me,

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.800
but maybe you know something about the area I'm in,

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:04.800
because we have the live map there,

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.160
the tracker's still going.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.000
It looks like it's broken because it's been stuck

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.520
in the same spot for a while,

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.880
but this could be a way to help out.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.680
If you know a spot where I could store the RV,

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.240
potentially, if I have to bail,

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.880
if you know something about the area I'm in,

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.040
or if you'd like to meet up and grab a bite, potentially,

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.280
there's a micro meetup link at colonytracker.live.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.840
And I mention that because it sends a push notification

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.120
to me, and so I see those.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.160
We have a channel that we collect those in.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.520
So sometimes like the emails and stuff,

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.440
they'll slip through the cracks every now and then,

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.520
whereas that is a specific channel for that purpose.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.760
So something over at colonytracker.live

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.640
if you'd like to help out.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.320
In the meantime, if you do the Twitter thing,

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.160
you can follow the show over at atlinxunplugged.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.560
The entire network is at Jupiter Signal,

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.160
where we have all kinds of announcements

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.280
for podcast releases and other show news

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.640
and stuff like that.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.880
And if you work in the tech industry,

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.840
go check out Linux Action News.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.520
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:02.300
everything that matters in the world of Linux,

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.960
nothing more, nothing less.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.440
And sometimes that means it's a 15 minute show

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.760
when there's nothing going on in the dead of summer.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.800
And sometimes it means it's a 40 minute show.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.860
But what we do is we cut out all the BS

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:14.160
and we focus on just the stuff

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.640
we really think you need to know about

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.200
and we try to do the best analysis possible for you.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.320
That's linuxactionnews.com.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.760
And the show continues to roll on

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.440
regardless of where I'm at live on a Tuesday.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.760
See you next week.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.280
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.120
Yeah, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.640
Wherever I'm at, I just go by JB time.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.620
It makes it easier.

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.240
Links to everything we talked about today,

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.880
including the contact page, the mumble server,

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.880
our matrix community, how to subscribe.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.840
It's all at linuxunplugged.com.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:48.200
Links for this specific episode, linuxunplugged.com slash 422.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.360
And that's it.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.200
That's pretty much it.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.760
You can get links to everything right there.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:52.840
Thanks so much for joining us

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.880
on this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.720
Assuming I survive the heat,

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.000
maybe, maybe I'll even be lucky to get the hell outta here.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.640
Man should never have built in Tucson.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.400
Assuming all that works out,

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.560
see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.560
We'll be right back.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.560
All right, JBtitles.com.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:49.920
Everybody go over there and vote.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.000
Let's pick our title, see if we can name this thing.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.240
So I finally did it.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.080
I wasn't even gonna mention that I was using Garuda.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:56.920
I don't know why.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.520
I just thought like, I'll keep this to myself.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.520
You know, Chris, you kept it so to yourself

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.400
that even despite my living with you for what, two weeks,

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.880
I had no idea.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.720
Yeah.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.000
Well done, sir, well done.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.760
So did you guys see that Boiling Steam had an interview

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.360
with the CodeWeavers folks?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:16.800
And in that interview, they tried to clarify that,

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.240
hey, we don't think Valve meant that the Steam Deck

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.600
is gonna be able to run every Steam game

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.080
from a software perspective.

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.840
We think Valve just meant the hardware would be capable

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.760
of it if the developers put the effort

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.120
to get it working on Proton.

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.560
And I think that has been a massive misread.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.200
People, because of that IGN interview that Valve did,

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.680
it sounded like Valve was saying,

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:39.320
every game in the Steam library,

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.680
they're hoping to have run on the Deck

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.120
by the end of the year.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.880
And what CodeWeavers is saying,

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.760
the people that would be plumbing that,

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.760
they're saying, actually, it's just possible,

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.320
but it doesn't mean that every game will work.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.640
I think that's a huge difference

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.760
in what the narrative is out there right now.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.480
And it's gonna have a lot of people

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.240
who pre-ordered potentially disappointed

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.020
if they don't get the memo.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:09.400
We'll keep you updated on the rest of the news.
