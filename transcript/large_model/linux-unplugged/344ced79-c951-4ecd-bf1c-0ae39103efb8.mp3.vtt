Headline the anatomy of a linux user by ken stark, and i'm just going through here

00:05.520 --> 00:10.520
Her computer was a decent machine a mid 2005 asus desktop with a dell 19-inch monitor

00:10.960 --> 00:15.860
Unfortunately it had all the toolbars and pop-ups that a windows user can collect when not properly tendered

00:16.160 --> 00:20.080
After getting all the files off the computer we began to product the process of installing linux

00:20.080 --> 00:25.400
We sat together through the installation process, and I made sure she understood partitioning process inside of an hour

00:25.400 --> 00:28.020
She had a bright and new shiny pc linux os

00:28.020 --> 00:29.940
desktop and I think

00:29.940 --> 00:31.740
that right there

00:31.740 --> 00:33.740
pretty much

00:34.020 --> 00:38.900
Exemplifies most of the people that I end up switching to linux right it's that easy it is it's that easy

00:38.900 --> 00:45.100
And it you take hardware that already existed and is no longer useful, and we make it useful again

00:45.380 --> 00:48.380
There's a lot of power to that that is so happy hacking

00:48.380 --> 00:57.380
This is linux unplugged episode 147 for may 31st 2016

01:06.700 --> 01:13.060
Welcome to linux unplugged your weekly linux talk show where we've kicked your host out of his seat and made him the soundboard operator

01:13.220 --> 01:15.780
Where he let the batteries die in the mouse?

01:15.780 --> 01:21.980
My name is Noah. My name is Wes welcome Wes pleasure to have you here, Noah all right, so this week

01:21.980 --> 01:24.460
We have a ton of stuff coming up in

01:25.340 --> 01:30.700
Linux unplugged we're gonna be talking to Ryan from mycroft. We're gonna be talking about openSUSE

01:30.700 --> 01:33.260
I know that you've installed remix OS

01:33.260 --> 01:37.220
Which is you've somehow decided to take your useful laptop and relegate it to an Android device

01:37.300 --> 01:41.440
And we're gonna talk about Yubi keys which I have gone on the record numerous time extolling their

01:41.660 --> 01:44.220
virtues and as it turns out they have turned from a

01:44.220 --> 01:50.500
Open-source company into a closed-source company, and I just bought some but does that really matter. I don't know we'll find out

01:50.500 --> 01:54.740
We'll talk about it and of course every week. We have to welcome

01:55.300 --> 01:57.620
The mumble room which sometimes I forget about so hello

01:58.180 --> 02:00.180
mumble room

02:01.540 --> 02:05.900
Oh my gosh, we have we have a full mumble room and we have beer

02:06.780 --> 02:10.260
Those are my two favorite things in the whole world beer this week is

02:10.260 --> 02:14.300
Almeda Brewing Company Alameda

02:15.260 --> 02:18.460
All right, so gentlemen with the beer tell me how the beer is

02:19.420 --> 02:23.780
Hmm well, so hold on yeah, hold on still here. We got we I got him

02:23.780 --> 02:27.100
I got a beer and West got a different beer. I got the pale ale from Alameda

02:27.100 --> 02:33.700
I have their IPA the click a cat or clicky tat clicky tat. I think yellow wolf. It's pretty good. It's actually pretty good

02:33.700 --> 02:34.420
It's from Portland, Oregon

02:34.420 --> 02:39.540
It's from so the I'll be just be standing by in the background drinking well Brown by your drive, okay?

02:39.540 --> 02:42.500
Yeah, that's I I had to have a Desi there you go no back to you

02:42.500 --> 02:46.460
Yeah, polar bear is polar bear is on it. Just make sure to charge those mouse batteries

02:47.740 --> 02:50.180
So we have beer and so that makes for a good show

02:50.980 --> 02:52.340
I

02:52.340 --> 02:56.220
Don't know how many of you remember arch assault and arch assault

02:57.020 --> 03:00.420
for those of you who are not familiar is basically a

03:00.420 --> 03:08.980
A distro kind of like Cali except based on arch. It's a distro specifically designed for penetration testing and

03:09.380 --> 03:11.380
network security testing right

03:11.580 --> 03:15.780
obviously when you're doing network security testing and penetration testing one of the really important things is

03:16.420 --> 03:22.700
Is to stay up-to-date and to have up-to-date software and of course you want to be aware of up-to-date exploits

03:22.700 --> 03:25.620
And so you want to go to pull down the latest packages, and so there's a fundamental

03:26.420 --> 03:27.900
disconnect

03:27.900 --> 03:32.860
You know to to some degree anyway when we are trying to do that on a distro

03:33.100 --> 03:39.080
That is not rolling that is that is stuck in time right and so that's kind of where arch assault originally

03:39.660 --> 03:44.340
Kind of took off and I had the pleasure of talking with these guys back at Southeast Linux fest

03:45.300 --> 03:47.860
2014 I believe yeah, and we had a really good discussion

03:48.980 --> 03:55.060
And they were showing you know the the the gentleman that I talked to he really took the the project to heart and he really

03:55.060 --> 03:59.260
Spent a lot of time and effort and passion they had shirts they had you know little banners made up

03:59.260 --> 04:03.740
And this is when the project is at its infancy right and so him and his wife are sitting see people that excited about it

04:03.740 --> 04:08.100
Already yeah, yeah, you can you could feel the passion and him and his wife actually took the time

04:08.620 --> 04:14.920
To settle this stuff was a very well-branded project, and I understand that they have gone through some changes well turns out

04:15.580 --> 04:17.580
This week we learned that

04:17.660 --> 04:19.700
They have announced a new name

04:20.500 --> 04:22.500
So headline this is from softpedia

04:22.500 --> 04:29.620
Dot-com the team over at arch assault a new Linux operating system based on the famous arch Linux distro

04:30.180 --> 04:36.620
Designed for ethical hackers announced a few minutes ago on their Twitter account that they were changing the name to arch strike

04:37.340 --> 04:43.320
Designed from the ground up as a security layer to arch Linux the arch assault project provides security researchers and

04:43.580 --> 04:50.300
Hackers with one of the most powerful open source and totally free Linux kernel based operating systems for penetration testing and security

04:50.300 --> 04:52.860
auditing operations under the new umbrella band

04:53.300 --> 05:01.420
Called arch strike the project promises a bleeding-edge pen test distro to anyone who wants to join the fight for freedom of expression privacy

05:04.420 --> 05:09.620
On the internet and it can be considered a direct competitor to Kali Linux previously known as

05:10.420 --> 05:13.220
Backtrack has anyone in the mumble room

05:13.780 --> 05:18.200
Let's start with this has anyone in the mumble room participated in a penetration penetration testing

05:18.200 --> 05:21.100
Or have you have experience with Kali Linux? I?

05:22.500 --> 05:28.960
Have personally used Kali Linux for certain purposes. I can't legally say what?

05:30.300 --> 05:35.020
That I've had limited experience with it. They worked fairly smooth when I tried it a few years ago

05:35.020 --> 05:41.480
So I haven't had experience since then okay, so you have have you had a chance to try?

05:43.060 --> 05:46.920
Have you have you heard of archers alters as the first year you're hearing about it

05:46.920 --> 05:51.780
No, I've heard of arches Hulk. I'm sure other people have in the chat room. Yeah

05:53.480 --> 05:56.000
The have you have you played with it at all

05:57.160 --> 06:01.800
No, I haven't gone back to arch yet, so I'm debating going to arch

06:01.800 --> 06:08.040
Yeah, I'm not sure if I would have used for a pen testing to show outside of a work environment

06:08.960 --> 06:12.640
Well, I think so I I think I don't think this is geared

06:12.640 --> 06:17.760
Outside of that spectrum right because so nobody installs a penetration

06:17.760 --> 06:24.720
I mean well most most people most practical people that are not the star of a reality show

06:25.520 --> 06:29.720
Don't install a penetration testing distro as their daily driver, right?

06:29.720 --> 06:33.640
It's not it's not a terribly practical thing not to mention you have a bunch of software in there that you don't really need

06:35.300 --> 06:40.420
So I'm you know my thought on it is that I think that arch assault is basically

06:40.420 --> 06:42.580
designed to do what

06:43.980 --> 06:47.300
What Cali is doing except do it on based on arch no

06:49.700 --> 06:51.700
Yeah, that would be a fair assessment

06:52.380 --> 06:56.620
It's really weird because I have seen reader posts on reddit or other

06:57.180 --> 07:02.820
For websites where people all I'm gonna sell arch assault or Cali Linux

07:02.820 --> 07:07.980
And I'm like why you don't need to unless you're doing this work. You don't need to

07:07.980 --> 07:14.380
Use this operating system for that it doesn't make sense. Mm-hmm. I

07:15.580 --> 07:19.260
Think more had had something to say as well. Yeah, I go ahead were it

07:19.940 --> 07:24.260
Yeah, the I'm familiar with the guys from the arch assault and that arch strike team

07:24.260 --> 07:27.420
And I just wanted to point out that it's not actually a distro in itself

07:27.420 --> 07:31.460
It's more of a layer or a package set that goes on top of arch

07:31.780 --> 07:34.940
so you have your normal working arch installation or

07:34.940 --> 07:41.080
hand or gross or whichever variation you choose to use and then you can pull these packages in to give you all that

07:41.260 --> 07:45.140
Functionality and then if you want to later down run you just pull them all out and go away. Oh nice

07:45.140 --> 07:47.580
So way more useful to me. So you so

07:48.120 --> 07:53.860
So you're telling me that they they do intend you to run this as a daily driver and then just pull down

07:54.060 --> 07:56.220
This set of packages that you need to do your work

07:57.660 --> 08:04.500
Exactly. So it's actually an addition to whatever your daily driver is. They're not gonna make this OS version

08:04.500 --> 08:07.520
That's just for penetration testing and security tools

08:07.820 --> 08:14.500
It's I'm gonna give you all the packages you want that arch itself doesn't have and we're to keep them up-to-date and rolling as best

08:14.500 --> 08:19.720
We can gotcha my mind that works very like if I personally at least have a lot of arch based workflows as it's you know

08:19.720 --> 08:23.400
The main distro I use right would fit very well in that right a repo your package is there now

08:23.400 --> 08:25.980
You've built yourself a new pen testing laptop from your same install script

08:25.980 --> 08:31.180
So you touch on something that I think is is really pertinent. So Chris for example does not

08:31.180 --> 08:33.940
he lives inside of arch right and so

08:35.140 --> 08:37.940
Taking him outside of that takes him not only outside his comfort zone

08:37.940 --> 08:43.660
but it also decreases his efficiency right because he is the ability to find the tools and make them work in a given distro and

08:43.660 --> 08:49.160
so if you take somebody that lives on arch all day and all night and now you put them into a work environment and they

08:49.160 --> 08:55.260
Can bring in that that tool set that they need to do their job do their job and then relinquish it and go back to

08:55.260 --> 08:59.220
You know, whatever. I think that as a global idea

08:59.220 --> 09:01.620
I think opens up a lot of real possibilities for Linux

09:02.900 --> 09:07.580
Anyone else in the mobile room have any thoughts or experience with arch assault or if warhead if you have more dad

09:07.580 --> 09:11.920
I know that you're you're a pretty well heavily in communication with the guys that do this

09:14.500 --> 09:19.940
Anyone and yeah, I can't really add too much to it. The change actually happened quite a while ago

09:20.300 --> 09:23.660
It's just that somehow we realized that people had missed it

09:23.660 --> 09:30.360
So we added it to the recent Twitter's and now soft media has it it's been resubmitted across blogs across the net for like two

09:30.360 --> 09:31.620
days straight

09:31.620 --> 09:33.620
Yeah, that's about how it goes, right?

09:33.980 --> 09:38.020
All right. Well moving on headline from seuss.com

09:41.540 --> 09:49.660
Seuss Linux Enterprise 12 SP service back to beta and open QA status of QA automation and

09:49.660 --> 09:57.100
And the article goes on here to say in mid-may we have reached the beta phase of sluss 12 SP 2

09:57.100 --> 10:02.740
So I would like to look back a little bit and see what we've achieved and it's not it's also it's not just less

10:03.460 --> 10:06.640
in fact, there's some really cool stuff this one of the reasons I think we should talk about this is

10:06.980 --> 10:12.140
Sless and the other projects are now sort of interweaved and Richard could could tell you about that

10:12.140 --> 10:15.620
It's it's sort of fascinating because when you see a new beta of less coming that also means

10:15.620 --> 10:20.740
There's a new version of something for us average users coming too. I think is that right Richard?

10:21.260 --> 10:25.100
Yeah, I mean this is actually like the first time we've been doing this

10:25.660 --> 10:32.440
Full hog this this interweaved. It's a bit of an experiment still so the yeah the sluss 12 SP 2 beta

10:33.220 --> 10:37.620
Yeah, the beta phase has started beta ones just come out which

10:38.500 --> 10:40.500
that's basically like the

10:40.500 --> 10:46.340
The real go point for open suzer to now start working on a leap because that's the point where?

10:47.100 --> 10:50.220
You know sleepy two customers now have their hands on the sleigh code

10:50.220 --> 10:52.980
Well, if they have the hands on it open suzer has the hands on it, too

10:53.300 --> 11:00.400
So we've got that now in OBS and we've started building leap. So within like a day of well actually a day before that announcement

11:00.940 --> 11:02.600
We've already got

11:02.600 --> 11:07.620
Leap 42.2 out for one. So, you know sleaze in beta we're in alpha and

11:07.620 --> 11:12.980
And we're basically kind of following that that mirrored route all the way up to November

11:12.980 --> 11:16.300
So every time we have alpha 2 coming out

11:17.260 --> 11:20.980
Any day now because sleaze doing beta 2 any day now

11:21.740 --> 11:24.820
and you know following following this all the way along and

11:25.420 --> 11:30.380
Yeah, it's it's really it's really interesting seeing this whole thing working because we're doing

11:31.260 --> 11:33.260
really exciting things on both sides

11:33.260 --> 11:38.460
Like on the enterprise side this service pack is definitely going to be something special

11:38.460 --> 11:43.420
You don't normally see a an enterprise service pack that goes. Yeah. Okay

11:43.420 --> 11:49.780
We'll have a new gnome and a new kernel and a new system D and I've probably missed something big in there

11:50.780 --> 11:52.300
I do

11:52.300 --> 11:56.860
Have a question about leap. Does it have support for?

11:56.860 --> 12:03.220
It have support for does it have support for

12:05.860 --> 12:10.660
Backfires no, no, no not ZFS. It's a oh

12:12.060 --> 12:16.260
I can't believe it just slipped my mind. I thought about it and then a boom lost it

12:17.500 --> 12:20.220
When it comes back, it's fun. Yeah. Yeah, so

12:20.900 --> 12:24.260
You know Richard, I guess wait, can you give me some examples of?

12:24.260 --> 12:31.180
Some of the common common things that you've seen some of the big things that you've seen less being used for lately. Oh

12:32.940 --> 12:34.660
Slez is

12:34.660 --> 12:41.780
Slez is doing really well as usual in all of those kind of big heavy mission critical enterprise environments. I mean sues is doing

12:42.460 --> 12:43.980
Very well with that at the moment

12:43.980 --> 12:46.900
I'm not allowed to speak too much about it because we're a public company

12:46.900 --> 12:50.300
But you know figures are coming out soon and it'll be fun to talk about

12:50.300 --> 12:57.820
Because it's it's looking it's being used really heavily in those sort of big hefty mission critical environments. Let's 12 is really kind of

12:59.180 --> 13:02.380
Sues it in that place. So I joke with you guys from time to time

13:02.380 --> 13:07.580
But the reality is I do encounter a sues, you know in the wild and I actually I was working for a client

13:08.060 --> 13:14.220
Just a couple weeks ago that was using that was using sues enterprise and they were using it

13:14.220 --> 13:20.340
Actually in a lotus notes domino hosted environment. Are you familiar with that? Yeah

13:22.300 --> 13:29.740
It's actually it's so the the domino version was was version 8 5 3 and the lotus notes version was was 9 what they call

13:29.740 --> 13:33.820
social edition, but the cool thing was is that they came to me and they had a

13:34.580 --> 13:40.060
whole host of infrastructure that was hosted in this and they said our server died and we don't know what we're gonna do and

13:40.060 --> 13:45.340
So and they were hosting this on on on Susan so I was kind of learning the ins and outs and while I'm doing this

13:45.340 --> 13:49.780
I actually made a recommendation. I'm like, well, you know, it would take a couple days for us to get a server here for you

13:52.220 --> 13:54.460
We could take a couple days to get a server here for you

13:54.460 --> 13:59.660
but what we could do for the time being or for a permanent thing is we can rent you a server over a digital ocean comm

13:59.940 --> 14:06.240
And they were actually able to use the code do unplugged to get a $10 credit off there

14:06.240 --> 14:09.760
We guys cooking chicken, yeah

14:11.160 --> 14:16.080
They were able to get $10 off which got him the first two months cuz they were actually able to run that on a $5 rig

14:16.080 --> 14:20.840
And actually sometimes I think that people don't understand all the things you can do on just the $5 rig

14:20.840 --> 14:27.720
The thing that they fall down on in that $5 rig is of course storage, but guess what digital ocean is working on that

14:27.720 --> 14:32.640
I'm so excited. Are you signed up for the beta? Yes, I am. I'm signed up for the beta. That is neat

14:32.640 --> 14:34.640
Yes

14:35.280 --> 14:36.960
So they

14:36.960 --> 14:41.080
Basically the the one one thing that I have I have desired

14:41.080 --> 14:43.000
Well, there's actually two things I've desired from digital ocean

14:43.000 --> 14:45.160
One is I want to be able to custom upload my ISOs

14:45.160 --> 14:51.640
But because they have basically ever destroyed use anyway, not such a big deal. The second thing I want is more storage

14:51.640 --> 14:52.680
So this block storage thing

14:52.680 --> 14:57.440
I'm in the beta program and I think we're getting closer to actually getting it because I got an email from them

14:57.640 --> 15:02.080
Three days ago or four days ago and they wanted a survey about all the things I was going to do

15:02.080 --> 15:07.160
Oh, yeah, did you get that? I did. Yeah, so I answered that and and hopefully that means that we are getting

15:07.840 --> 15:10.800
hopefully that means that we're getting much closer to the

15:11.320 --> 15:15.280
It's actually having block storage is something I'm super looking forward to

15:17.880 --> 15:19.880
Now I want to talk about

15:20.400 --> 15:24.840
So I have numerous times gone on record and talked about how much I

15:25.640 --> 15:27.160
Like the Yuba keys, right?

15:27.160 --> 15:32.280
they have fundamentally changed the way that I do my job and at this point, I

15:33.640 --> 15:35.960
Don't know that I'd say I can't live without a Yuba key

15:35.960 --> 15:40.880
But I certainly can't live without the functionality and convenience that the Yuba key gives me. I mean, they're like it's um

15:40.880 --> 15:45.800
It's a little bit like a root of trust in your in the way you operate, right? So quick recap

15:46.800 --> 15:49.000
Yuba key what it's allowing me to do is

15:49.400 --> 15:55.080
Without giving up the private key store my SSH certificates on a hardware based token that literally never leaves my side

15:55.080 --> 15:58.320
And I say that as I'm looking around for it. I have two

15:58.320 --> 16:02.680
I have one that I wear around my neck that I've taken off because it jingles when I'm in the studio and the second one

16:03.240 --> 16:06.100
Is actually you can't see it, but it's it's just trust me. It's in there

16:08.960 --> 16:12.440
They have recently come out with the four and said that

16:13.200 --> 16:18.420
It is no longer going to be an open source device that they're gonna close source it now

16:19.560 --> 16:21.560
the critical question is

16:21.560 --> 16:27.360
It doesn't change anything because you couldn't really do anything with the source code anyway, right?

16:27.360 --> 16:31.640
It's a hardware based device and you still have to trust and you couldn't change the firmware on the device, right?

16:31.640 --> 16:34.120
And you still you're essentially you still have to trust the manufacturer

16:35.760 --> 16:40.400
Needless to say I am a little concerned how many people in the mumble room are using Yuba key

16:42.640 --> 16:48.240
Lots I see I I did just buy a Yuba key for before this news came out like oh, did you weeks before?

16:48.240 --> 16:55.760
Yeah, okay. Well, I'm not I'm not ready to hand up my Yuba key. There is a competitor up that I am in seriously considering

16:57.320 --> 16:59.800
And it is called the nitro key

17:02.080 --> 17:04.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it is

17:04.160 --> 17:04.400
Yeah

17:04.400 --> 17:04.680
Uh-huh

17:04.680 --> 17:11.160
So and what the nitro key is is it's kind of the same thing where you have a hardware based device that allows you to store

17:11.160 --> 17:13.240
A certificate now a couple things jump out at me

17:13.880 --> 17:16.240
The first is that it is an open source device

17:16.240 --> 17:19.620
So that I'm happy with it has an open source public post by Cardware public software software

17:21.040 --> 17:23.120
The thing that I'm not so big on is

17:24.160 --> 17:26.160
Look at the thing, right?

17:27.040 --> 17:31.680
If I go up here and look this is a very large device

17:33.360 --> 17:35.360
Also, it's a very plastic looking device

17:36.800 --> 17:41.400
The Yuba key is sleek and the Yuba keys I got to tell you I have had one on my lanyard

17:41.400 --> 17:43.400
I when I first bought it actually bought two

17:43.400 --> 17:46.940
Actually, I bought a lot more to it, but I bought him for everyone in the company, right? Everyone in my company gets

17:47.200 --> 17:50.680
Yeah, yeah, we issued about and because if I fire somebody I

17:51.800 --> 17:53.800
Asked them for the Yuba key back. They give it back to me

17:53.800 --> 17:59.260
I know that those servers are still secure because that Yuba key has never given up that private duplicate. You're right

18:01.240 --> 18:03.360
But I bought two for myself

18:03.680 --> 18:07.960
Originally and the idea was I was gonna have one around my neck and I was gonna leave one at home and my fireproof safe

18:07.960 --> 18:10.640
It's kind of like a backup because I have contracts

18:10.640 --> 18:14.320
with certain places that you know, um, I

18:15.160 --> 18:16.920
Don't know really what I want to share in the air

18:16.920 --> 18:21.440
But I have contracts with certain places that have very very high you need guarantees

18:22.440 --> 18:23.480
security protocols

18:23.480 --> 18:28.740
And so I am NOT allowed to access the the SSH files if I want to add a key

18:28.740 --> 18:33.280
I have to write out a justification form and I have to explain everything and I have to give the key and I have to

18:33.280 --> 18:36.860
Send it in then they have to make a change. It takes like three weeks and it's a real pain and so

18:36.860 --> 18:41.420
Absolutely to avoid all that, you know, this has really changed everything, but I wanted to have two of them one

18:41.420 --> 18:43.420
I kept it with me and then one I kept secure

18:43.860 --> 18:45.860
and

18:45.980 --> 18:50.500
What I noticed was that it was originally I was concerned that it was going to get broken or damaged

18:50.500 --> 18:54.580
That's why I needed a backup turns out like those things are indestructible. I put my through by washing machine

18:54.580 --> 18:57.100
It has fallen out of my Wow. I'm driving down the interstate

18:57.620 --> 18:59.620
And you got it back. Yeah

19:00.380 --> 19:04.540
My laptop has fallen over on top of it. Like they are practically indestructible. I

19:04.540 --> 19:11.020
Can't say the same about this thing. It it does not look like it has the same build quality as

19:12.020 --> 19:14.440
The Yuba key and that's a little concerning to me

19:15.340 --> 19:20.900
Mumbo room, even if you guys don't have experience with the the Yuba key. Do you guys have any opinions or thoughts?

19:21.700 --> 19:27.100
Yeah, I do the nitro key. I looked at their website and they're really lacking in detail

19:27.660 --> 19:33.780
Like does that does it even retract? Does it have two slots like the Yuba key does with the long press and the short press?

19:33.780 --> 19:38.420
And it just seemed like there was no real comparison between the different models, right?

19:38.980 --> 19:44.140
It's quite early. I think for the for the company. So I have to wait and see I think if I'm not mistaken

19:44.140 --> 19:47.300
It's based on the FST zero token that's already working with G knock

19:47.300 --> 19:50.820
And so yeah, it does have a couple key slots and everything. It's similar to the way the Yuba key works

19:51.060 --> 19:57.460
Okay now in terms of the open PGP stuff. Now, what is your thought William about what about the

19:57.980 --> 20:01.020
About the lack of of Yuba key being open source. Does that matter?

20:01.020 --> 20:05.540
It doesn't really matter to me because I still had to trust them as a manufacturing partner, right?

20:05.540 --> 20:11.140
Like they are ultimately manufacturing it. They are, you know planting the firmware on it at build time. You can't change it

20:11.140 --> 20:16.340
It's impossible thing. I don't necessarily like about the nitro key. Is that you can change the firmware and

20:17.500 --> 20:20.940
Typically with Gina since they are using Gina it will wipe all the keys on there

20:20.940 --> 20:24.840
But I feel like you could probably flash it in such a way that it won't necessarily wipe the keys

20:24.840 --> 20:30.160
And so the security of that whole environment is kind of questionable, especially with that cheap plastic case

20:30.160 --> 20:34.860
That's easy to take off right see and that's that's see and you're hitting on kind of where where I come at it

20:34.860 --> 20:40.700
too is it it feels like the Yuba key was built for commercial enterprise grade use and it feels like the nitro key is like

20:40.700 --> 20:42.700
somebody's really great garage idea

20:43.580 --> 20:50.860
Basically, I would like to weigh in that, you know there we we used Yuba keys here for quite a lot of stuff

20:50.860 --> 20:56.940
Especially for folks who are jumping into servers all the time, but Red Hat released an open source app on

20:56.940 --> 21:01.700
On at least it's on Android. I don't know if it's on iOS called free OTP

21:02.420 --> 21:07.400
It's essentially one-time password generator, but software, you know

21:07.400 --> 21:12.360
So you can you can load that up on your phone and use it to generate your one-time pass

21:12.540 --> 21:14.940
And it works with everything that we've got deployed

21:15.620 --> 21:21.540
You can also use it in place of the g-auth indicator a Google indicator app. It's quite wonderful

21:23.180 --> 21:25.180
Yeah, you know the thing is I I

21:25.180 --> 21:31.700
I just there's something about me and I'm sure I'm gonna catch flack for saying this especially after Sunday's episode

21:31.700 --> 21:35.500
But I have a problem with the idea of Google two-factor authentication

21:36.220 --> 21:40.220
When I'm logging into my Google account on a Google server with a Google password

21:40.220 --> 21:46.120
And then the two-factor authentication I have is a software app written by Google put on a Google device. I

21:46.620 --> 21:48.380
mean

21:48.380 --> 21:50.380
That's a lot of Google

21:50.380 --> 21:56.700
iPhone man. Yeah. Yeah. Well the software still written by Google, right? I just the thing that I like about my YubiKey

21:56.700 --> 21:59.140
What when it comes to two-factor authentication is like I feel like

21:59.420 --> 22:06.380
The parties involved like last pass and YubiKey totally separate entities and really have nothing to gain, you know from working with each

22:06.380 --> 22:09.940
I just I guess because Google have anything to gain from

22:10.580 --> 22:15.700
Sidestepping their authentication parameters. They can already do that internally. Anyway, I would imagine that's kind of my point

22:15.700 --> 22:20.540
What do they really have to gain from somehow subverting what they're trying to do with these different applications?

22:20.540 --> 22:26.780
That's exactly my point when it comes to last pass might my last pass vaults encrypted client side with it with the with the key

22:27.100 --> 22:31.820
You know, there's two-factor authentication that is totally separate from last pass with whereas Google is you know

22:31.820 --> 22:39.060
You're making my point is they you're essentially you're essentially saying like it's basically to keep the honest people honest outside of Google because if Google

22:39.060 --> 22:41.060
Really wanted to get to your stuff your host anyway

22:41.780 --> 22:43.780
If I'm not misunderstanding you

22:43.780 --> 22:48.860
Yes, but you're still using that two-factor for your Google services, so yeah

22:49.900 --> 22:51.900
well, anyway, so I

22:51.900 --> 22:57.660
Just there's something about me that likes having having those two separate. Maybe I admit maybe that's just maybe that's fun

22:57.660 --> 22:59.900
Maybe I'm just maybe I'm an old fuddy-duddy. I don't know

23:01.100 --> 23:02.540
but I

23:02.540 --> 23:05.340
Haven't quite decided if I'm if I'm ready to jump ship on

23:06.340 --> 23:09.300
On YubiKey or not. I feel like it could go both ways

23:10.300 --> 23:12.300
anyone else in the mumbo-room have thoughts or

23:12.300 --> 23:16.580
Opinion on the on the whole YubiKey situation, even if you haven't used it. I'm interested what you think. I

23:17.580 --> 23:20.460
Think they should have kept it open source. Keep it free software

23:21.300 --> 23:23.900
Okay, why do you say that? Why do you think it matters?

23:25.260 --> 23:29.540
Because Williams right at the end of the day you're trusting it rather the manufacturer publishes the spec or not

23:29.540 --> 23:31.060
You're you're essentially you're trusting them

23:31.060 --> 23:36.220
I mean unless you have an electrical engineering degree and can go verify these things you're trusting the manufacturer anyway, right?

23:36.220 --> 23:41.980
The hardware if it's got the code in the hard way, and you can't change it. That's fine

23:42.540 --> 23:43.980
but if

23:43.980 --> 23:49.980
You but it does have access to it and you can change the hard software on the hardware

23:49.980 --> 23:53.340
You should have access to the source code

23:54.300 --> 23:56.300
GPU G and a that

23:56.860 --> 23:58.860
Yeah, the GPL

23:58.860 --> 24:04.020
Please offer foundation. I'm a member here. Yeah, I'm gonna throw back to you William. What was your response to that?

24:04.020 --> 24:08.700
My response was the YubiKey does not allow you to change the software. It's physically fused onto the board

24:08.700 --> 24:10.700
Like you can't change it once it's printed

24:12.940 --> 24:16.700
And so I'm where is there and correct me if I'm wrong and correct me if I'm wrong

24:16.700 --> 24:23.740
Somebody correct me if I'm wrong doesn't Richard Stoneman himself advocate as it'd be okay to have binary blobs as long as they can't be changed

24:23.740 --> 24:25.740
Yes, he does

24:25.740 --> 24:31.260
He'd use the microwave example, I think for this where if your microwave has software running on it that you can't change. That's fine

24:31.900 --> 24:34.300
And the YubiKey is kind of the same thing. It's a black box

24:34.300 --> 24:39.980
So if you can validate that it works correctly then and the software can't be changed. That's fine, right Ryan

24:39.980 --> 24:41.980
You're thinking there's a security

24:41.980 --> 24:43.180
implication here

24:43.180 --> 24:47.740
Well, it's just the ability to audit, you know, that's what that's what for me

24:47.740 --> 24:54.540
Brint makes open source more secure. And so I I can't say that I really understand the reasoning here

24:54.540 --> 24:59.180
I understand that it's a simple tool that generates, you know based on a counter, you know

24:59.180 --> 25:03.740
The one-time password, but I don't like the ability to audit. I mean, I can

25:05.260 --> 25:09.260
So, let's back up for a second first of all, that is one

25:09.820 --> 25:14.620
Very well, that is one component of the YubiKey, right? There's a lot of different ways to do it

25:14.620 --> 25:19.260
Very well, that is one component of the YubiKey, right? There is the there are three components the YubiKey

25:19.260 --> 25:22.460
There is the smart card identification, which I'm using for SSH authentication

25:22.620 --> 25:26.060
There's the one-time password authentication. Then there's the U2F standard. So

25:27.980 --> 25:33.660
So it is a little bit more complex than just it is it is it is spinning out a random number generator

25:33.980 --> 25:37.420
Coupled with a you know an algorithm to spin out a one-time password there

25:37.580 --> 25:41.420
There is there so there is something to be said about like I eventually am

25:41.420 --> 25:45.980
You know in trusting that the SSH certificate that I wrote onto this device

25:47.180 --> 25:53.020
You know is is secure. So there's some argument to be made there. I just I question how valid it is in the world and I think

25:54.060 --> 25:55.900
Was it wizard Jed you were going to say something?

25:55.900 --> 25:56.380
Yeah

25:56.380 --> 26:00.940
I was going to say you can test every single one of these things in a really basic scenario

26:01.100 --> 26:04.220
And the only thing you can't do and I believe it's for the YubiKey Neo

26:04.380 --> 26:09.900
It has a an NFC that would be more difficult to test but it should also be just as easily tested

26:09.900 --> 26:13.100
Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't be that hard to test

26:13.740 --> 26:15.980
All right. Anyone else have closing thoughts on YubiKey?

26:16.860 --> 26:22.060
Yeah, I think with the trust issue. I personally trust an open source company more than a closed source one

26:22.460 --> 26:27.180
Um, but I mean if all you're doing is using it as a two-factor authenticated to get into your google account

26:27.260 --> 26:29.100
I don't think it really matters

26:29.100 --> 26:35.660
If you're using it for sort of encrypting your email that is super sensitive. I'd I'd be a bit more wary

26:36.380 --> 26:37.580
well, I mean

26:37.580 --> 26:43.740
So it to some some degree I am trusting that every server that I own or run has my YubiKey

26:44.380 --> 26:47.340
ssh certificate in it. So I I mean there is a certain level of trust there, but

26:48.380 --> 26:55.580
I'm hoping that they um that by them doing this that doesn't um that they're not doing this to their older products

26:55.660 --> 27:00.540
So you still have those available that are open source that you can use nothing

27:00.620 --> 27:04.460
I've read suggests that they are doing this with any of their older stuff

27:04.460 --> 27:09.500
It seems like all of this is is their new production, right? I don't think they're changing any of the old stuff

27:10.140 --> 27:17.260
I want to talk about Krita 3.0 Krita 3.0 was released today the team at Krita releases 3.0 the animation release

27:18.380 --> 27:24.220
Wrapping up a year of work. This is a really big release animation support integrated into Krita's core

27:24.620 --> 27:32.220
Instant preview for better performance painting and drawing with brushes on big canvases ported to the latest version of qt platform and many bigger

27:32.220 --> 27:39.180
And smaller new features and improvements to mention now. I know we have a number of different graphic artists in the community

27:39.180 --> 27:41.500
I know. Mr. Rotten corpses. I know Odyssey Westra is

27:42.220 --> 27:44.300
Has anyone had experience using Krita?

27:47.180 --> 27:51.900
No one huh? Well not in any professional sense, how about in an unprofessional sense

27:52.940 --> 27:59.100
And I guess like, you know, you're using this in place of GIMP or something like that. Well, here's why I ask wizard is because

27:59.100 --> 28:01.580
There is a lot to be said for

28:02.780 --> 28:06.620
An application that is easy and approachable and Wes

28:06.620 --> 28:10.940
I know that you you and I kind of fall into this at the same time like you and I have very busy

28:11.500 --> 28:15.180
Professional lives and so when it comes to our to enjoy software

28:15.180 --> 28:18.380
We have to find software that's easily approachable and we can just sit down and do something right?

28:18.380 --> 28:22.140
I mean if it's going to take more than a half hour to really get going or have some sort of progress

28:22.140 --> 28:26.060
There's there's not I can't do that every day, right? Like maybe maybe a weekend if it's important software

28:26.060 --> 28:29.340
But if it's really gonna be useful to me, I need to be able to figure it out pretty quick. Yeah

28:29.340 --> 28:33.580
And and I feel the same way like I you know, I want to sit some sit down and bang something out

28:33.580 --> 28:37.180
And one of the things I have used, you know, I found I found the GIMP to be

28:38.220 --> 28:39.500
totally

28:39.500 --> 28:44.940
Unintuitive I I can't I can crop pictures in the GIMP and I can make some minor changes, but really

28:45.740 --> 28:49.100
The way I see it is like I can do all the things I've always been able to do in GIMP

28:49.100 --> 28:53.100
But I haven't really learned how to do anything new and different quite some time. Whereas it feels like

28:53.100 --> 28:56.140
Other software, it's a lot more easy to explore or I'm actually excited about the new features and

28:56.940 --> 28:58.940
Krita is always talking about stuff

28:58.940 --> 29:04.540
So wizard, I want to go back and ask what how how is it from somebody who who is not an artist?

29:04.620 --> 29:06.860
Because I'm certainly not she's man stick figures

29:08.140 --> 29:12.620
Yeah, so I mean I struggle with stick figures sometimes how is Krita when I sit down and you know

29:12.620 --> 29:16.460
I'm looking at the I'm looking at the user interface. It actually looks you know

29:17.260 --> 29:20.060
I guess fairly approachable. I mean there's an awful lot of tools and buttons

29:20.060 --> 29:26.060
It is it's uh for for people that might have used, you know, proprietary software in the past

29:26.060 --> 29:32.860
It's it's kind of a nice mix of you know, the Corel Draw of the past and uh, kind of photoshop of today

29:33.180 --> 29:37.740
And it's and it's a good mix. It's not like uh, oh lord. Where why is this all messed up?

29:37.740 --> 29:42.460
Why is everything everywhere else? Like you kind of get with GIMP and the best they don't mean that in a bad way, but

29:43.180 --> 29:47.340
It's a very different from what you would expect it tends to take a little while to figure out

29:47.340 --> 29:51.420
But it's it's kind of what you would expect where you expect things to be. It's like, oh, okay

29:51.500 --> 29:56.700
Everything's fragile here along the left side. Oh, okay. Oh, there's the layering tool. There's this tool

29:56.940 --> 29:58.940
Everything's where you would expect it to be

29:59.420 --> 30:05.020
And it doesn't it doesn't take that learning curve like you need with GIMP where it's like, oh, okay

30:05.020 --> 30:09.900
I see layers here. But you know, where is the patterns menu? Oh the patterns is behind it. It's a weird tab

30:10.860 --> 30:14.140
You know and I I can speak, you know, they're apparently they're not here today

30:14.140 --> 30:18.060
You know and I I can speak, you know, they're apparently they're not here to talk for themselves

30:18.060 --> 30:21.820
but I I can tell you having talked to people like rotten corpse and people like odyssey westward that

30:22.700 --> 30:27.260
You know, honestly restress told me on numerous occasions if it wasn't for projects like krita in my paint

30:28.300 --> 30:31.020
He is a graphic designer would be on windows or mac

30:31.580 --> 30:37.660
And so the important thing is even if you don't use tools like krita and I certainly don't I mean i'm i'm i'm

30:38.780 --> 30:41.660
You guys probably have more art in your pinky finger than I have my whole body

30:41.660 --> 30:44.220
I'm just not an artsy guy but uh

30:45.180 --> 30:48.320
It's important to remember that these projects are fundamentally

30:48.940 --> 30:55.660
Are are fundamental cornerstones to the people that are in that field and so uh, and I think it's a society like we

30:56.460 --> 30:57.740
If someone wants to just get started

30:57.740 --> 31:02.460
Maybe they're like in high school and they don't have money for professional software or they're just starting out in whatever

31:02.460 --> 31:06.140
You know whatever age it's important for you to have free tools that are really

31:06.780 --> 31:09.100
That can actually do what you want to do and let people be creative

31:09.100 --> 31:13.520
Exactly exactly you you you you you lower that barrier to entry

31:13.760 --> 31:18.080
And you take somebody that has that creative spirit and you give them professional grade tools and say here you go kid

31:18.640 --> 31:21.040
Have some fun that you know, that can be a really empowering thing

31:22.320 --> 31:24.320
Gentoo how many people use gentoo?

31:24.720 --> 31:32.160
Uh, this again comes from soft pd headline the gentoo linux operating system has received an updated live dvd iso image dubbed choice edition

31:32.160 --> 31:39.060
Which brings the latest gnu linux technologies according to the announcement gentoo linux choice edition live dvd has been released in celebration

31:39.760 --> 31:45.520
Of the continued collaboration between gentoo developers and the community. It looks like it brings some of the latest software

31:45.920 --> 31:49.200
releases such as the kde plasma 5.6 desktop environment

31:50.400 --> 31:52.400
what

31:52.720 --> 31:54.720
There's some sort of troll in the background folks

31:54.960 --> 32:00.000
Um, so but how many people how many people are using yeah and zfs, right?

32:00.000 --> 32:05.200
I was getting there uefi support and zfs on linux. How many people are using gentoo?

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
Is anyone using gentoo in the mumble room?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.440
Have you used gentoo?

32:09.440 --> 32:12.880
Yeah, I know a lot of x gentoo guys. Yeah, what are they on now?

32:13.520 --> 32:15.520
tumbleweed

32:15.520 --> 32:19.120
I've used it in the past. I don't have anything current. I've run it on a wee back in the day

32:19.120 --> 32:21.120
That was a lot of fun. Mm-hmm

32:22.240 --> 32:25.840
So chris and I were talking about doing a gentoo review have you heard about this?

32:25.920 --> 32:29.120
Yeah, I I think you should I would also run if you guys are installing it on things

32:29.120 --> 32:30.800
I would do it, too

32:30.800 --> 32:31.840
That sounds like a blast

32:31.840 --> 32:37.920
So the the fact that zfs on linux is becoming such a big thing and you can tell these early adopters things like arch

32:38.000 --> 32:40.400
linux and things like gentoo, you know now

32:41.280 --> 32:46.320
That tells you where the drive is for a given file system, right zfs is is a big deal

32:46.400 --> 32:48.880
And what's funny is I still can't get it to work on abuntu

32:50.080 --> 32:51.120
Yeah, I know that's funny

32:51.120 --> 32:53.840
And I can kind of see gentoo as an interesting thing for like our container world

32:53.840 --> 32:59.220
Like maybe you want to make yourself a really tiny minimal gentoo user land and since everything runs on x64

33:00.240 --> 33:03.600
Virtualized things anyway, like the architecture doesn't matter as much and just run it like that

33:03.600 --> 33:07.200
You know gentoo folks they are they're much like chris and his arch love, right?

33:07.280 --> 33:10.240
They use it once they get hooked on that train. They use it for everything

33:10.240 --> 33:13.120
And so i've got a really close friend of mine. He has it in his living room

33:13.600 --> 33:18.240
It runs his projector his tv projector thing. It runs his media center and then for a living

33:18.240 --> 33:22.080
He actually he hosts a website and he runs all of his

33:22.080 --> 33:27.280
Uh all of his servers on gentoo as well because he becomes so familiar with it

33:27.280 --> 33:27.760
Yeah

33:27.760 --> 33:31.600
And the thing that he always says that he likes about it is that he can build that installation

33:31.840 --> 33:37.280
To serve that given purpose in the living room. It's a media center in his in a server. It becomes his you know, his web server

33:37.760 --> 33:40.960
um, and so I I think that it's important to get these

33:41.440 --> 33:46.320
You know these features things like zfs that is going to fundamentally change how he can run it in on his server

33:46.480 --> 33:50.160
Anyone in the mumble room have thoughts about zfs on on gentoo?

33:50.160 --> 33:55.760
And not zfs on gentoo. How about zfs on linux in general or anything related to the current topic?

33:56.560 --> 34:03.360
Does anybody know if they've actually got the zfs module compiled on that live cd or are they compiling it on the user's workstation?

34:04.240 --> 34:08.080
You know, I don't know. Maybe if we do a gentoo review i'll be able to answer that for you

34:08.960 --> 34:12.000
Yeah, because that that would actually be my question because you know

34:12.080 --> 34:15.200
Ubuntu is going the way of having it pre-compiled and you're pulling it down and

34:15.200 --> 34:20.640
Well other distros debbie and then I believe there's a couple others that are coming out and trying to do this dkms module

34:20.640 --> 34:22.640
Which is built on the system. That'd be

34:23.200 --> 34:25.680
That'd be an interesting way to see it. Like how are we doing this?

34:25.680 --> 34:30.720
Are we doing it the nvidia way of compiling on the system that you're on or are you pulling down as a binary?

34:32.160 --> 34:35.920
So in it for those of us like myself who are ignorant explain to me

34:36.640 --> 34:43.220
Why that's important. Why does it matter if it's if I understand that that the the perception is that a dkms

34:43.220 --> 34:45.700
Dks ms module is not going to be as

34:46.660 --> 34:48.660
stable reliable

34:49.140 --> 34:53.300
To start with the simple like I am not a lawyer thing but based on the free software

34:54.020 --> 34:57.160
Uh the sff sff and software freedom conservancy

34:57.780 --> 35:02.100
The the simple part is is basically with all this open source stuff

35:02.900 --> 35:06.420
If you you know you as an individual user can do whatever the heck you want

35:06.980 --> 35:11.240
But the gpl brings with it certain responsibilities for distributions

35:11.240 --> 35:14.440
and so if a distribution is

35:15.240 --> 35:21.400
Breaching the gpl the conditions of the gpl are very clear in this they can lose their right to distribute gpl

35:21.880 --> 35:23.880
licensed software so

35:23.960 --> 35:28.920
You know if you want to you know from a very narrow reading but you know, obviously ubuntu think otherwise

35:29.000 --> 35:34.920
But you know ubuntu effectively are currently risking their right to ship gpl software. So

35:35.720 --> 35:37.000
the

35:37.000 --> 35:43.400
The you know, if you're just if you're doing like a debian or or you know, other others are ship the source

35:43.640 --> 35:45.640
Users compile whatever the heck you want

35:45.960 --> 35:48.600
That's generally seen as a loophole around all of that

35:50.360 --> 35:54.840
But of course, yeah, if you know, how do you know it's going to compile properly?

35:54.840 --> 35:58.520
How do you know it's going to work properly? There's more things to go wrong there because

35:59.080 --> 36:01.000
Like your kernel is going to move

36:01.000 --> 36:05.160
Then you need to make sure that's going to recompile properly blah blah. There are definitely more moving parts. That's for sure

36:05.160 --> 36:10.360
Well, there are more moving parts. You know what? I like I like operating systems like centos and redhat that are predictable

36:10.920 --> 36:13.080
And they just they have a nice even flow

36:13.480 --> 36:16.520
You know what else I like I like when I can learn about those things

36:17.080 --> 36:23.720
In a structured manner without having to guess and and and stab and search around the internet at places like linux academy

36:23.880 --> 36:30.440
where I just got done doing my uh, my my redhat my redhat 7 training and now I realize that they are still releasing

36:30.440 --> 36:35.160
Different versions of redhat 6 i'm thinking now I should go back because I still got a couple clients on 6

36:35.320 --> 36:36.920
Maybe I need to go back and

36:36.920 --> 36:38.280
Brush up on six skills

36:38.280 --> 36:43.320
They still have the ability to I can still go take a course and brush up on that because now everything's changed

36:43.480 --> 36:48.840
And I don't know about you west, but I have I have I fundamentally changed my behavior to

36:49.480 --> 36:52.520
Everything is system d now, right? I go to stop a service system d

36:52.520 --> 36:58.840
I go to start a service system d I go and enable like the whole check config to to enable something and service to start something

36:58.840 --> 37:04.440
That my brain no longer works that way everything is I honestly it's it is until you go back to a six box

37:05.480 --> 37:09.320
Then you're then it's not so great lost but you have linux academy to fall back on

37:09.480 --> 37:12.680
So, uh linux academy is a great place to to go and learn about

37:13.080 --> 37:18.040
Uh linux linux academy dot com slash unplugged and if you go to linux academy dot com slash unplugged

37:18.360 --> 37:25.640
You can get a great uh, a great deal on signing up for linux and here chris has so kindly pulled up the redhat certified

37:25.640 --> 37:31.160
engineer exam now if you're not familiar with the the the structure of certification in redhat

37:31.240 --> 37:36.920
The first the entry level is the the csa the certified system administrator and then from there is the ce

37:37.320 --> 37:40.600
which is the certified, uh engineer and then after that is the

37:41.080 --> 37:45.720
Ca which is the certified architect and I don't remember exactly what the numbers are off the top of my head

37:45.800 --> 37:47.800
But the last time I was talking with the redhat employee

37:47.800 --> 37:52.760
He was there like they're like show shockingly low like the amount of certified architects in the world

37:52.760 --> 37:55.320
like there's just there's a handful of them and like

37:56.200 --> 37:58.540
I gotta tell you guys if you have one of these certifications

37:59.000 --> 38:01.720
Maybe not so much the csa because that's kind of the entry level one

38:01.880 --> 38:05.240
But definitely when you start approaching the ce and definitely if you get the ca

38:05.560 --> 38:10.040
Man, you write your own ticket. That is a marketable skill to have because there are so few people

38:10.120 --> 38:11.480
It's a lot of trust you can get yeah

38:11.480 --> 38:13.400
And the other thing students, you know, it's gonna come with the you know

38:13.400 --> 38:19.320
It's gonna come with a decent salary too because you know and and so and you can learn all of this stuff on linux academy

38:20.520 --> 38:22.520
uh the uh

38:22.520 --> 38:23.800
the uh

38:23.800 --> 38:30.120
the the the the site is structured for people that are busy professionals that don't have a lot of time and

38:30.520 --> 38:36.280
That has fundamentally enabled me to learn the things I need to learn it and again i'm comparing this

38:37.000 --> 38:43.240
You know from from being going to a week-long class and now taking this class online at night. Yeah for sure. I think do

38:43.560 --> 38:49.160
Uh for me, it's not even just about how busy I am. It's about how the how they break down the individual courseware

38:49.160 --> 38:53.320
Yes, and so that I just look at that and I go okay. That's something I can accomplish. That's something I can do and

38:54.760 --> 38:58.200
I no longer have this big nebulous question of this task. I want to complete

38:58.280 --> 39:05.480
I have a very specific range of time. I need to commit and instructions and comprehensive study guides I can use and it's like, okay

39:05.720 --> 39:09.800
I'm i'm ready for you to just pick that nugget and say i'm gonna i'm gonna tackle that nugget

39:09.880 --> 39:11.480
I love that too. The nugget system is really cool

39:11.480 --> 39:14.200
Like you just want to do a deep dive and they got availability planners, too

39:14.280 --> 39:17.880
Just go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to support the show

39:17.880 --> 39:20.520
So, uh while i'm on the mic

39:20.680 --> 39:25.560
Why don't I take over and start talking about something i've wanted to chat about for a little bit. It's the mycroft project now

39:26.040 --> 39:29.800
Mr. Ryan was going to join us last week, but we got our wires crossed on timing

39:30.360 --> 39:32.920
And that's actually sort of works out because there's something now

39:33.160 --> 39:37.480
I want to talk about it's not directly related to the mycroft project, but it's sort of the power of open source

39:37.960 --> 39:40.760
So let's get started by saying hey ryan. Welcome to linux unplugged

39:41.320 --> 39:43.320
Hey, i'm glad to be back as always

39:43.800 --> 39:46.200
Now I i'm assuming you saw this morning

39:46.200 --> 39:53.400
This uh, super super cool gnome extension that brings mycroft for the desktop right into the gnome shell

39:54.120 --> 39:56.120
Look at that. Yeah

39:56.520 --> 40:02.040
It looks like it's professionally done. I mean, it's really really slick and this is just a great example of

40:02.280 --> 40:07.560
What's one of the great benefits of having something like this be open source. So ryan what the heck what's new with the microsoft project?

40:08.680 --> 40:12.920
There's a lot new. Um, so last week we released the code

40:12.920 --> 40:17.560
Uh mycroft core, which is kind of the piece that ties it all together out to the

40:18.040 --> 40:23.800
Open source community. Um, we know that it's an alpha. It's got a lot of bugs. We're going through and fixing them and

40:24.360 --> 40:26.760
Honestly, you know once we put it out there

40:27.480 --> 40:30.040
Immediately, you know, we got so much great feedback

40:30.040 --> 40:36.280
But we also got like so many people trying it in so many new environments that now we're kind of just in crazy

40:36.280 --> 40:43.560
Patching mode. So we'll be probably doing that for another week or two, you know, just trying to fix it all the bugs people found but uh,

40:44.040 --> 40:46.920
So be ready for an alpha experience

40:46.920 --> 40:51.400
But I encourage everybody to come play with it and even install this extension and provide feedback

40:51.960 --> 40:54.040
this we it was so ironic because

40:54.600 --> 41:00.360
I was actually talking to a group and we have a we have a slack channel that you may can join you uh,

41:00.680 --> 41:03.400
The documentation tells you how to do that

41:03.400 --> 41:09.320
Um, but we were talking about start starting to make a gnome extension and then somebody linked me to this gnome extension

41:09.320 --> 41:11.640
Oh, okay, and it was right before you pinged me on twitter

41:11.800 --> 41:17.560
And so I learned about it just as we started talking about possibly talking about today, but it's awesome

41:17.560 --> 41:20.520
It's freaking awesome, and i'm so happy to see it

41:21.240 --> 41:27.000
So, uh, you seem like you've been pretty busy these days. How are how are things now in an open source project?

41:27.000 --> 41:31.240
That's getting some attention like some interest from other parties. I have things

41:31.240 --> 41:33.400
Do they feel like they've leveled up in difficulty for you?

41:34.120 --> 41:38.920
Absolutely, absolutely leveled up in difficulty, but you know, the thing is

41:39.640 --> 41:46.520
We're making jarvis an open source jarvis, you know, so it's we knew from the beginning. It wasn't going to be easy

41:47.080 --> 41:48.600
and so, uh

41:48.600 --> 41:55.320
As the project has grown I I actually we've hired four interns to help just manage all the little tasks good. Nice

41:55.640 --> 41:59.640
And so, uh, we're we're also leveling up our account

41:59.640 --> 42:05.480
We're also leveling up our capability to try and keep up with the the difficulty as things, you know

42:06.200 --> 42:09.560
Increase but the cool thing is is we're in the right space, you know

42:10.120 --> 42:12.360
Well, I would say it seems like there's a lot of attention here

42:12.360 --> 42:15.160
I mean everyone's aware of google home just was announced

42:15.160 --> 42:16.600
Of course, we don't know when it's going to ship yet

42:16.600 --> 42:24.060
Everybody's familiar now with the amazon echo and the big rumor coming ahead of wwdc is third party api integration

42:24.440 --> 42:28.680
With siri which apple seems to have directly linked to the information to put the word out there that

42:28.680 --> 42:33.560
Third party integration is coming to siri. So it would seem every major player and then of course, let's not forget

42:33.720 --> 42:35.720
Microsoft has that adorable cortana as well

42:36.200 --> 42:41.160
You ever wonder if they see like this type of movement in the open source community?

42:41.640 --> 42:45.000
And adjust accordingly, you know, you see like parsi mac parser

42:45.560 --> 42:49.320
you know get released and you ever wonder if they they see like

42:49.800 --> 42:51.160
uh

42:51.160 --> 42:54.840
A project like adapt our intent parser get dropped out there and they're like, oh, well

42:54.840 --> 42:59.640
We don't want a whole bunch of people adopting that, you know, so let's let's put something else out there

42:59.960 --> 43:03.720
That ties kind of people into to our, you know ecosystem

43:04.040 --> 43:05.240
So, I mean it's all great

43:05.240 --> 43:11.100
We're making use of everything that these guys drop, you know and and evaluating them and seeing how they can improve microsoft

43:11.560 --> 43:13.880
But it's just and it's great. It's great

43:13.880 --> 43:17.800
That's what this whole point of this project was was to introduce an open source alternative

43:17.800 --> 43:25.640
You know into the into the environment and to give people like us a chance to integrate this stuff into

43:26.120 --> 43:28.360
you know, for instance gnome, yeah, we're

43:29.560 --> 43:32.360
We're not going to be able to necessarily grab, you know

43:32.420 --> 43:39.080
Cortana or would we really even want to like and integrate that into our linux desktops and into

43:39.640 --> 43:42.360
You know these various random devices around our home

43:42.360 --> 43:48.200
and so that's the whole point since the beginning was to provide a platform to enable people to do that and

43:49.160 --> 43:55.240
You know just last week we we finished tech stars, which is an accelerator. It's like y combinator

43:55.240 --> 44:00.200
it's one of the big accelerators in the nation and that was powered by tech stars and sprint and

44:00.760 --> 44:02.440
We got a lot of value out of that

44:02.440 --> 44:08.760
But uh, you were asking about a video and I totally forgot that uh, josh's keynote was recorded there

44:08.760 --> 44:12.120
And he talks about how open source has you know?

44:13.080 --> 44:17.400
Rose to the occasion to rule like mobile and the desktop and how you know

44:17.400 --> 44:23.080
This is just another space where it makes sense when you have this ubiquitous technology. That's going to be everywhere

44:23.240 --> 44:25.000
What about to have it be open?

44:25.000 --> 44:25.720
So okay

44:25.720 --> 44:28.120
I follow you there ryan and I agree this is

44:28.680 --> 44:31.880
And fundamentally an area that we have to have a great solid open source solution to

44:31.880 --> 44:39.420
What about that ecosystem though? Like what makes google home attractive is that it ties in with the entire google ecosystem?

44:39.560 --> 44:45.320
And all of the third parties that will integrate with it simply because google is a name that gets their respect

44:45.400 --> 44:47.400
And so they're just so they'll work with google

44:47.560 --> 44:53.320
Um, how do you compete when it seems like that is going to be one of the larger feature sets of these devices?

44:53.800 --> 44:55.800
good question, so

44:56.120 --> 44:58.120
the answer is that

44:58.120 --> 45:00.920
uh, we don't you know the the answer is that

45:00.920 --> 45:03.880
That sure you can have a google home device

45:04.360 --> 45:10.280
That's this black box, you know that that you talk to but what about voice enabling? You know your oven?

45:10.360 --> 45:13.400
What about voice enabling? You know the random?

45:14.020 --> 45:17.480
Internet of things that are around your house or the new device that you create

45:18.040 --> 45:21.400
Yeah, you we don't have we're looking at this all you're looking at this all wrong

45:21.480 --> 45:28.040
It's it's what we're what what microsoft gives us an opportunity to do is to make voice command ubiquitous

45:28.040 --> 45:34.120
Throughout the house, you know to to it doesn't have to be we we keep pushing down

45:34.760 --> 45:40.840
What this stack can run on and the idea is to get it on the smallest micro processor possible?

45:41.080 --> 45:47.400
So that your garage door opener can be voice enabled, you know, that's the goal and and to make voice

45:48.200 --> 45:52.280
Be everywhere, you know and and uh, do you need to talk to your microwave?

45:52.280 --> 45:59.240
Not necessarily, but it'd be freaking awesome if you could you know, uh same with the oven preheat to 375 degrees

45:59.320 --> 46:04.360
And set a timer for 10 minutes, you know, this is something that I don't necessarily see

46:05.080 --> 46:06.680
um people

46:06.680 --> 46:14.520
I don't see people adopting google and echo and amazon solution simply because if i'm ge and i'm

46:15.140 --> 46:19.720
Installing, you know one of those stacks if if they come available to where you can do this

46:19.720 --> 46:25.800
If i'm installing it on an oven, I now my relationship with my customer is shared with amazon

46:26.360 --> 46:29.160
You know and everything they say is going to be hoovered up by amazon

46:29.640 --> 46:34.920
And it's the same with like a sonos speaker or a bose speaker if you were to put amazon's

46:35.240 --> 46:39.880
You know technology on that speaker if you ask the speaker. What's the best speaker in the world? What is it going to say chris?

46:40.920 --> 46:43.560
Is going to say the amazon echo. That's right

46:43.560 --> 46:50.360
That's right. And so amazon like, you know, I know that that you can load amazon, uh the echo

46:50.680 --> 46:53.960
software onto raspberry pi, but the the question is

46:54.840 --> 46:59.560
Do you want that relationship with amazon to permeate everywhere? It's like when you ask siri

46:59.560 --> 47:05.880
What's the best smartphone siri says the iphone of course, uh, you know boy it's so it's it's bigger than any one device

47:05.960 --> 47:07.960
That's for sure. And it's it's

47:08.600 --> 47:12.120
It's almost the raspberry pi of ai and voice

47:12.120 --> 47:15.800
Where you can you can build it into anything and then give that all of a sudden

47:15.880 --> 47:16.920
There's lots of devices out there

47:16.920 --> 47:19.880
But the raspberry pi is when everybody knows you take a device like this and all of a sudden

47:20.120 --> 47:25.160
You can put a computing you can put a computer in something that was never possible to have a computer at a price point never

47:25.160 --> 47:31.160
Possible before yeah, and the thing is this is the big thing for years and years and years. We thought the most

47:31.640 --> 47:35.160
Innovative way to talk to your computer was to point and grunt

47:35.880 --> 47:40.280
And now we're at a point where that computers can understand what you're saying

47:40.280 --> 47:44.440
And they can understand natural language and respond to that and that's powerful

47:45.240 --> 47:49.240
You know that's going to change what we perceive to be computers

47:49.800 --> 47:54.680
And what can be a computer because we they you need a speaker and a microphone in this case

47:55.080 --> 47:58.760
And then you can have a conversation with this device and make it do what you want it to do

48:00.600 --> 48:03.400
Wizard jet actually has a good use case for talking to your oven go ahead wizard

48:04.360 --> 48:08.360
Yeah, you know, uh when everyone goes out and they realize oh I left my oven on you

48:08.360 --> 48:12.440
You can actually go down and ask your phone. Oh, did I leave the oven on? Hey my craft?

48:15.240 --> 48:17.160
Yeah, I try it

48:17.160 --> 48:25.080
so the so some things that I i've been waiting to tell your audience, you know is is uh, we would we we've seen a

48:26.520 --> 48:28.520
Successful funding around

48:28.600 --> 48:34.120
So we'll have more details on that soon, which means that we're we're in this for the long haul

48:34.680 --> 48:35.880
and uh

48:35.880 --> 48:42.520
And we're going to be working with every community that will work with us to try to get the microsoft core

48:43.160 --> 48:49.980
To permeate, you know throughout open source projects that you know, be it applications or or desktops

48:50.360 --> 48:56.220
Or or anything, you know, I I used home assistant the other day home assistant.io

48:56.760 --> 48:58.760
Which is a really cool project

48:58.760 --> 49:03.480
And I noticed that they used you know, some really simple google speech to text

49:04.040 --> 49:05.640
to do

49:05.640 --> 49:11.820
Pretty simple commands and this is another place where you know microsoft might be able to help extend that capability

49:12.440 --> 49:19.080
And so if you're if you're involved in a project that you think could benefit from voice, you know enablement

49:19.320 --> 49:23.400
um, please come over and hang out with us and talk with us because

49:24.040 --> 49:27.720
This is this is something that where we don't have to be behind this time

49:28.120 --> 49:28.440
I mean

49:28.440 --> 49:32.440
We're we might be a little behind as far as like if we're talking about the desktop

49:32.440 --> 49:38.360
because windows 10 has had cortana for a little while but but there's now an option and the only thing holding it back

49:38.920 --> 49:43.400
Is getting you know people contributing and porting it over to the different desktops and

49:43.720 --> 49:47.400
And making sure that it's easy to use and enable and we saw that with the gnome extension

49:47.480 --> 49:51.160
But unfortunately, there's just not enough people on the team to be an expert

49:51.880 --> 49:54.840
In how to integrate into each of the desktop environments

49:55.160 --> 50:01.400
So i'd love to see you know this permeate as an option for people who want to voice enable their their

50:01.400 --> 50:07.960
Uh desktop and and maybe even their linux powered phone and i'm looking at poppy

50:08.040 --> 50:11.560
Even though i'm sure he's not listening right now, but i'm but i'm looking at him

50:13.640 --> 50:19.000
So uh stereo blow you made a you made a comment in the chat room about the importance of some sort of

50:19.400 --> 50:22.440
Open dictation system something like that. Could you expand on that a little bit?

50:24.040 --> 50:30.680
Yeah, i'm not sure if people have tried to use a dictation on linux, but it's not that easy to get a

50:30.680 --> 50:33.080
uh working uh dictation

50:33.800 --> 50:37.160
uh going I mean you have the option of using something like

50:37.800 --> 50:40.840
um dragon naturally speaking or something

50:41.480 --> 50:43.960
but uh having a open

50:45.320 --> 50:48.840
Dictation technology would be just great on linux. Mm-hmm

50:49.960 --> 50:54.920
I like the idea too of all of these really interesting chat applications that are coming out now like you have

50:55.320 --> 50:59.480
A silent circle and of course telegram and all these could use

50:59.480 --> 51:06.620
Is they're working on early versions of bots, but wouldn't it be interesting to see them integrate some sort of micro functionality

51:07.960 --> 51:09.000
Yes, that would be very cool

51:09.000 --> 51:14.360
So it's kind of like the perfect time to be the plumbing of this kind of stuff because there's a lot of stuff in development

51:14.360 --> 51:16.920
Want it and if we have like a really good friendly

51:17.640 --> 51:19.640
Open source upstream. That's awesome

51:20.280 --> 51:24.120
And it sounds like you guys will be a good horse to bet on it with the funding going successfully

51:24.200 --> 51:26.200
It'll be around for a while. So that's good news, too

51:26.200 --> 51:32.360
Yeah, and the other thing is you know one thing that holds us back in the in the keep that the jupiter broadcasting community can

51:32.360 --> 51:40.280
Help with is we just need people to test on all different mics, you know, unfortunately, uh, we found some people whose laptop

51:40.280 --> 51:42.680
Mics give them a really really difficult time

51:42.680 --> 51:49.720
But that's great information to have and that's great information to take and and try to adjust the experience work

51:49.720 --> 51:56.140
Everywhere, you know and we can only get that like we're not an enormous company. We don't have uh, you know

51:56.220 --> 52:00.220
20 million dollars and 100 engineers to throw at throughout a problem

52:00.220 --> 52:04.780
So the best thing that people can do for us is to come over and provide us with feedback

52:04.860 --> 52:06.860
And we're not perfect and we're not going to be perfect

52:06.940 --> 52:10.380
You know, we're not it's going to be it's it's rough to do what we're doing

52:10.380 --> 52:16.060
But the the best way to accelerate that process is to get feedback and and contributions

52:16.060 --> 52:20.060
And so, um, I probably say the same thing every time but you know

52:20.140 --> 52:25.180
We could really use the help of the open source community to help us kind of drive development and drive testing

52:25.580 --> 52:31.980
So if people are if people have time and they want to contribute to a project we could really use the uh, the eyeballs

52:32.060 --> 52:37.660
In the in the hands. Yeah, excellent. Thanks ryan. I think that would be really that's probably uh, you're helping out with the mics

52:37.660 --> 52:40.140
That's something anybody can do without any development skills, uh swift

52:40.220 --> 52:43.020
You had a you had something you want to mention regarding simon real quick as we wrap up

52:43.020 --> 52:49.740
Yeah, I was going to talk about that. You can use that as dictation software. Yeah, it's not the prettiest in the world

52:49.740 --> 52:56.380
But it is nice. Yeah something for people to look into so ryan. Well, thank you for stopping by and uh, giving us an update

52:56.540 --> 52:58.860
It's a project. We've been following for a while here on the show and we can

52:59.660 --> 53:02.380
I continue to find every single time we talk fascinating

53:02.860 --> 53:09.580
So yeah, i'm I hope to uh, I still hope to head over your way and hook up. Uh, lady jupiter that would be amazing

53:10.540 --> 53:12.540
We'll make it worth your time. Yeah

53:12.540 --> 53:16.060
Okay. All right. I'll help you do that. Lady jupiter knows how to party. That is a great

53:16.860 --> 53:20.700
As linux fest can attest, uh, so before we go any further speaking a party, you know

53:20.700 --> 53:23.900
It's a party for your pocketbook ting go right there to go

53:23.900 --> 53:28.540
So get yourself just a great cellular plan go to linux.ting.com to get our discount and support the show

53:28.940 --> 53:34.620
It's your own terms wireless. So they got cdma and gsm you get to pick from which is dead simple

53:34.860 --> 53:37.740
Which means if you have a better gsm signal in your area

53:38.220 --> 53:40.620
Switch over to that if you have better cdma signal you can switch over to that

53:40.620 --> 53:43.660
You're gonna get that. I love that flexibility. I love also

53:43.820 --> 53:46.780
Well, I suppose what I really love about it is it's six dollars for the line

53:47.260 --> 53:50.620
And then it's just your usage on top of that. That's the brilliance. That's where it's just simple and straightforward

53:50.620 --> 53:52.620
It's how wireless should have been from the beginning

53:53.340 --> 53:54.540
No contract

53:54.540 --> 53:58.940
No other termination fee. No, you go to linux.ting.com you get 25 off your first device

53:59.340 --> 54:03.340
If you got a compatible device and you might you get 25 in service credit

54:04.220 --> 54:07.420
Now the average ting bill for per line is like 23 bucks

54:07.420 --> 54:11.500
They're doing a giveaway of the anzatel one touch idol 3, which is a pretty decent

54:12.780 --> 54:19.180
Freaking gsm 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch. Oh nice. Yeah android phone. I know so we got details on their blog

54:19.260 --> 54:24.380
Right now you beat free. You can't be free wess. You can't beat free phone and then that ting service

54:24.460 --> 54:26.140
You're paying nothing nine dollars for a sim

54:26.140 --> 54:31.340
If you just need a sim card, uh, then they have great devices including the volt 2 for 66 bucks

54:31.580 --> 54:35.820
If you're just looking for a nice android phone to just make calls and stuff. That's or do like telegram, right?

54:35.820 --> 54:39.580
It perfect the netgear zings back in stock. That's great. That's great

54:39.660 --> 54:44.060
They also have the uh, the old nexus 5 if you want something for under 200 bucks

54:44.060 --> 54:45.580
That is a google experience phone

54:45.580 --> 54:49.260
And of course, I got the 5x and the 6p and the internet phones and the samsung phones and all of them

54:49.900 --> 54:55.100
Yeah, they got them all you go to linux.ting.com go there. Try them out. Like I said, there's no contract

54:55.100 --> 54:58.780
There's no other termination fee. There's really no risk. They have a savings calculator right here

54:58.940 --> 55:01.980
You go there you plug it in you see how much you would save and you know what wess

55:03.340 --> 55:05.020
Girl, you're gonna save

55:05.020 --> 55:09.660
So much wess. I can't okay. I can't wess. I can't you just have to go there for me

55:09.660 --> 55:13.660
Yes, I can't linux.ting.com. You got to go there and try it out

55:13.660 --> 55:16.780
See what i've been talking about that supports the show looking at what they got

55:17.100 --> 55:21.900
Reading their blog learning more about the company maybe doing their savings calculator all of that's a way to support the show

55:22.140 --> 55:27.340
And maybe save yourself some money. It's a great service. I've been I mean i'm like two and a half years now or something

55:27.820 --> 55:30.800
Because it's almost freaking june which is crazy linux.ting.com

55:30.800 --> 55:32.800
Linux.ting.com

55:33.200 --> 55:37.760
So wess, uh, I don't know if the does the mumble room know that we asked you to sacrifice your laptop once again

55:37.840 --> 55:39.840
I'm, not sure we did talk about it pre-show

55:39.840 --> 55:40.800
Yeah

55:40.800 --> 55:46.160
So, uh, i'll bring i'll bring the brown bear back in for this segment because I know he might have more interest in this

55:46.160 --> 55:49.680
Than I do, but I I will confess I was the one that asked you

55:50.480 --> 55:55.760
To do this. That's true. And you've actually gotten sacrifice. You've gotten remarkably further than I expected

55:55.840 --> 55:59.440
Uh, I am I am damn impressed when I looked over at your machine and saw what you've been up to

55:59.440 --> 56:05.840
So ladies and gentlemen, uh, we asked wess for the good of the virtual lug and our audience

56:07.200 --> 56:11.120
Take a look at what might be a desktop linux competitor someday

56:11.920 --> 56:17.940
Remix os for the pc. What is it wess? Well, it's a combination of remix os and android x86

56:18.560 --> 56:24.960
Uh, and it's android on your laptop. Oh, that's what i'm running it on here anyway, and it's a it's kind of like a

56:25.120 --> 56:27.120
It's like a regular desktop experience

56:27.120 --> 56:32.880
Uh, maybe like a little windows 10 ish, but they've got like a pseudo desktop with like your android icons. It doesn't

56:34.160 --> 56:36.080
It comes with like a guest mode

56:36.080 --> 56:40.000
So you can start out and you can just run it like a you can burn it to a cd or a usb

56:40.240 --> 56:45.680
And then run it in guest mode and it'll just be like a regular live cd without persistence or they have the uh, a resident mode

56:46.080 --> 56:50.720
They call it where it will make itself like a little loopback image file and and write on there

56:50.720 --> 56:53.680
So that's what i've been doing i put it on a usb drive and edited grub

56:53.680 --> 56:57.760
And had to do a little futzing with grub that maybe that's my fault. Maybe that's their fault

56:57.840 --> 57:03.360
You know, it's hard to say but i've got it running and it doesn't come with play services

57:03.440 --> 57:07.600
But play services they have like a easy install for play services that took I don't know a minute

57:07.680 --> 57:12.000
You just reboot and then the play store was there. So i've been able to install telegram. I've got slack

57:12.400 --> 57:14.640
I've got google drive you did you got all those up?

57:14.880 --> 57:16.880
There have been some couple caveats like google drive

57:16.960 --> 57:18.960
I I can download the show notes as a pdf

57:19.120 --> 57:22.800
I have not been able to get it to actually show me the show notes and be able to edit them

57:22.800 --> 57:27.520
Uh, but telegram works slacks working great do this for me if you don't mind

57:27.520 --> 57:32.160
Can you look and see if any what go pay is on there and here's and here's here's why I say that

57:32.800 --> 57:35.920
We have a payment solution for for for the you know

57:36.160 --> 57:40.720
So we do we we offer services in some weird places and i'm i'm an entrepreneur, right?

57:40.800 --> 57:44.960
So I never tell somebody no so somebody calls me and says yeah, see if that installs and runs

57:45.920 --> 57:49.360
Somebody calls me and says will you come service me at my rv or?

57:49.360 --> 57:53.280
Or in the middle of a park in the middle of a parking lot or where some other weird places we've done

57:53.600 --> 57:57.440
Somewhere you'll be able to get this right? Yeah, I have no problem going out there and doing service

57:57.520 --> 58:01.760
The problem is billing somebody that I met in a parking lot or billing somebody at their rv

58:02.480 --> 58:05.600
That poses a challenge. I'll send you an invoice. Yeah, right

58:05.680 --> 58:08.080
And so and you know my my front desk staff they get you know

58:08.160 --> 58:12.880
They get all hot and bothered anytime something isn't like laid out for them. And so one of the only in a foreign language

58:13.600 --> 58:17.760
No, no, no, it's it's normally in it's normally in it's normally in english

58:17.760 --> 58:19.600
uh

58:19.600 --> 58:25.680
Yikes, okay. All right. Well, but it might work. Maybe we have to change the user agent or is that a thing?

58:26.480 --> 58:28.160
The thing is though

58:28.160 --> 58:31.280
I hate using tablets for that kind of stuff

58:32.080 --> 58:34.800
It would be much more convenient if they could just boot into a vm

58:35.840 --> 58:37.840
Type in the credit card number run it that way

58:38.000 --> 58:39.280
and um

58:39.280 --> 58:43.280
And so this kind of thing is not it's really not my wheelhouse, right?

58:43.280 --> 58:48.560
like so for one I have a hard time really getting behind wanting to run android on a

58:48.800 --> 58:51.600
Taking a perfectly good usable laptop and then running

58:52.240 --> 58:54.240
android on it

58:54.320 --> 59:00.320
No, I feel yeah, I mean I I don't think i'll keep it and it is like android is it's okay on my phone

59:00.960 --> 59:02.960
It works on the phone, but it's not perfect

59:03.120 --> 59:07.600
Well where I do see a lot of value coming in is there is in any way go pay is one example

59:07.600 --> 59:09.280
But I think there are others

59:09.280 --> 59:14.400
There are a lot of applications that are not written for linux, but they are available on the play store, right?

59:14.560 --> 59:18.480
Absolutely, and so the ability to have to be able to run those applications

59:18.560 --> 59:21.520
Especially if I can virtualize if I can get it to run in a virtual box man

59:21.520 --> 59:25.360
Now we're cooking with gas in the front right burner. I I you know, the you know

59:25.360 --> 59:29.360
What go pay isn't even available. It's not a windows app. It's not available on macOS

59:29.360 --> 59:33.920
Yeah, it is only available in ios or android and and you're seeing that more and more

59:33.920 --> 59:36.800
There's a lot of applications that are only available

59:36.800 --> 59:42.000
Inside of a mobile atmosphere and so and as a person who wants to use a desktop for everything

59:42.560 --> 59:45.760
There is I I think that there is a lot of value to be had in

59:46.560 --> 59:49.840
Being able to virtualize that stuff and being able to run that on my laptop. Totally

59:50.320 --> 59:54.960
Now how have you have you run any intensive applications something like plex?

59:55.520 --> 59:59.680
Or any sort of game? I do have plex installed. I've not tried actually watching it yet

59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.600
I maybe I can get youtube going though

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.760
I will say it has been nicely integrated like my function keys for brightness and sound those are working right out of the box

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.960
No kidding. I mean it hasn't been slow. It seems to be compositing and accelerated wi-fi seems to work

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:17.760
Okay, wi-fi was there like in the installer process like no since then it's been just perfect

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.000
you know a lot of this leads me to wonder the direction that google is traveling and I I

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:29.440
I would not be at all surprised if in if in 10 years when you buy a macbook pro it's running ios and when you

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.440
buy a

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.600
A chromebook it's running android

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.800
I think that you know as these companies continue to invest more and more money and time and effort and

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.560
Into their mobile operating system and as companies start to develop apps

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.960
And put their infrastructure in you know a mobile atmosphere. In fact, I was doing contracting for a company just last week

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:53.520
And they had an app that I had to send all of the information into them

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.240
Right was not available from web browser could not do it from a desktop had to be done on a smartphone

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.960
In fact, they actually told me when you know when we were negotiating the contract out

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.120
They said, you know, we want a subcontract we want you to do xyz and we need you to

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:12.320
Use our app because that's how we it's actually it's honestly was kind of creepy because they they actually they could take control of the webcam

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.080
so they and the microphone so that they could see what was going on and

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.720
Again, this brings me back to

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:22.080
I think it would be really useful to be able to virtualize something like that

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:28.160
And have something like that available to me so that I can you know, I can complete the the assignment

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.160
But at the end of the day, then I can shut it down

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.480
I know and heck i'm installing that on my phone, right?

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.000
It just so happens that I happen to have an android tablet that I don't really like and didn't really want

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.840
Right, right. And so I you know, I just I load it on there

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.360
In fact, I have a google account specifically for things. They don't want to use but well youtube

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.960
Wow

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.320
And that's surprising playbook

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.760
I I don't know if you can hold that up to the the camera and they they can see the playback is remarkably smooth

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.440
If you can't see that

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.720
Yeah, i'd have to hear it with sound to know if you know, it's syncing up and stuff like that

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.120
So we'd have to maybe look at that a little bit closer

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.640
But based on what i'm seeing here, I think that's I think that's great performance and you know, the thing is really

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.760
What is that a core i5? Yeah, so I mean it's got like way more hardware

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.640
A little less ram than I should be proud of

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.280
So, you know, I I think that there's a lot of use cases mumble room do you guys

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.240
Uh, what do you guys think about running android on a laptop?

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.960
I would run it in a vm. Okay depressing

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.960
Depressing why why is it depressing? I'll do it in a vm as well

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.480
so

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.520
Now i'm gonna run, you know, all of these other os's in my laptop or in my computer. It's like well

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:45.280
It's like well, i'm gonna have all these off-baked experiences because nobody actually targets

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.000
The thing that i'm using

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.960
right, i'll just keep letting layers so that I have

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.200
um crappy experience on my laptop supporting these

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.560
Half-baked infrastructures. Mm-hmm. No, thank you

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.400
Now you say that you say that as a developer or as an end user?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.320
both

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:09.440
Okay, right as a developer. I don't want to target a thousand platforms. I want people to adopt one thing

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.960
But at the same time, um as a user I look at it's like

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.480
I'm if I support these type of things these will become of uh incentive for developers, right?

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.040
and no

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.400
Okay

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:29.360
I you know, I I how about outside of just uh, how about outside of of development or sandboxing security concerns?

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.440
Does anyone see this as being like?

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.440
Man, you know, I would use linux more if there were just more apps available

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:39.840
So now this really enables me to do that and i'm going to blow away my linux installers anyone thinking that route

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.280
I'm not i'm thinking the users might be like that

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.800
I'm actually thinking I already explained to my I know

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.680
Grandmother my father how to use android phone now

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.800
Now I don't have to explain the same thing to them again how to you know use uh google docs

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.760
on their computer because the experience

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:12.000
Is the same if I use remix os or a similar android pc thing, right? So they they have one

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.840
Sort of device in their pocket and the same experience on their desktop

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.800
It could be used for for users like that who are not power users

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.000
um

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.880
They just want to streamline the experience everywhere, right?

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:32.960
You know what non-power users should just relegate themselves to alexa google now and things like that

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.080
Not actually touch the machine and uh one thing or not

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.080
These will actually save us

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.280
And then we can actually focus on getting linux as a platform

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.040
Which if you think about it works on windows on linux in solaris in bsd

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.640
And android is based on it. So why don't we just rip android and keep the linux layer?

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.640
Which actually is what we need so that binaries work target that platform instead

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:01.920
Actually runs everywhere already. I find this. Uh, well, okay a couple of things about this that strike me is kind of nice

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.360
First of all nice or not. It definitely looks a lot like windows 10

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:11.840
But what I really think they've done right is the window controls the window border so you can use the android apps in a windowed environment

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:19.280
The window borders match the header color of the application. So it really looks nice. Yeah, it looks it looks like those

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:25.120
Applications are meant to be borderless windows and now that even desktop environments are dropping scroll bars

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.040
It doesn't look that weird to have an application with no scroll bars. It just looks like

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:34.480
A desktop app. I mean when you look at that, I wouldn't even know those are necessarily android apps, right? Yeah

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.880
Yeah, no for sure. It you know

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.600
And I think as that line gets blurred

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.320
I I see that as kind of a problem to be honest with you

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:46.080
I mean it it's great from the from the familiarity standpoint the press was saying, you know

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:50.880
how you know, you can show your parents to use this and the other but the thing I do get a little bit concerned about is

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:55.520
I like my desktop. I like I like my desktop operating system

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.640
And and it seems like every day we take steps to make

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.480
The desktop a little bit less relevant and mobile a little bit more relevant

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.880
And it seems like this is one more step in that direction

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.480
No, no

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:11.360
No in that case would gb more comfortable with running something like chrome os where you can run android apps

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:14.240
But you're keeping a more stock linux experience under the hood

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.640
You know, I feel like chrome os is the closest i've I have gotten

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.760
to uh to mainstream linux

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.560
That I could live with but it misses the beat

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.800
I mean we discussed this on linux action show a couple weeks ago

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:31.440
it misses the beat because one is we start to fall into this fallacy of

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.560
our team's winning rather than

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:41.200
We actually have a good solution chrome os. Let's face it is really not a whole lot better than mac os or windows

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.760
It technically has a linux kernel

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.320
And it technically has a linux shell

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.680
And that's pretty much where it ends and then

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.880
We're stuck. I mean I can't install gimp. I can't install inkscape. I can't install libreoffice

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:01.120
I can't install I mean all of the things that I want to do with a linux installation feel like a traditional linux desktop

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.120
Linux desktop, right and all the freedoms that come with a linux desktop and all the you know

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:09.680
And the other thing is too is and i've said this before on the air and it is worth repeating because it applies to both

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.960
Chrome os and it applies to android on a laptop

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:21.120
I don't fundamentally trust those operating systems. And so I will not put highly sensitive information pictures videos documents, whatever

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.280
on a chrome os laptop or on a

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.880
Or on an android laptop and you know actually and to second that

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.320
All of those important files are encrypted with lux and I don't know about you

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.320
But I haven't really found a way to get lux to work

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.640
On chrome os or on android. I have not tried but uh, you're right

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.080
it's just

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.480
As far as the um

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.880
thing you mentioned earlier that um, you

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.680
still want your uh

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:59.120
Classic desktop experience and you don't want that mobile thing to take over that battle is already lost. Uh,

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.600
I think two or three years ago. I talked to uh,

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:05.200
Uh, I think he was a backend developer at tablo

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:10.100
Okay, and he said their user base is growing and it's growing steadily

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.800
But the desktop user base

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.080
Is stagnant all the new users that come in are phone and tablet users

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.360
So this is the next generation

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.360
well

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:30.160
It's a growth trend that just continues in that direction, right? So the next generation of consumers are all

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.760
People who want that mobile experience. Well, I have to be honest with you

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.520
I'm, really hoping what that means

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.880
is that it opens up a void in the desktop space and allows linux to take more of a foothold because I think that

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:46.480
I think that windows has been dying a slow death for a long time and I I I

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:52.080
I continue to hold that hope that that mac os really isn't making any serious headway into the desktop space

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:56.880
Uh, and so, you know, they're you know, really their their eggs are, you know a lot in mobile as well

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:02.080
Um, so hopefully they just it kind of leaves that void and you know a lot of people do that a lot of people are

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.200
You know, they see laptop and desktops as the old generation the old way of doing things

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.440
Um, and if that's the case great leave that kind of stuff to me and that's what my generation

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.040
Maybe there are different types of people where like you just don't need it and okay

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.120
That's fine and you can zoom and create to the level that you can on those devices

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.520
Well chris said it best when we were at system 76

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:26.560
He goes yeah tablet living works great and mobile living works great until you need to get real work done. Then you need a laptop

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.760
Um, so it is what it is. Hey guys, then you buy an ipad pro

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.160
Yeah, which doesn't have a key which doesn't have a keyboard and is really more of a tablet and runs ios and so that's you know

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.400
You have these new microsoft tablets the surface book, you know

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.280
Yeah, i've tried getting linux to run on those those I haven't you know

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:49.040
Had much of a chance to get that to work well either. Hey guys, you know

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.720
One of the things that I uh, I come here every time I come here

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.320
I i'm excited to work with chris and i'm excited to meet up with rikai and have a chance to chat with wess and whatnot

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.440
but

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.720
The other thing I always try to look at is what is the network doing?

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.560
What changes is the network making what direction is the network growing?

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.200
And as a you know as a person on the outside

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.320
I always thought I kind of had a decent idea because I think chris does a really good job of keeping people up to date

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:23.520
but he he has been working night and day for the you know months to make some of these fundamental changes possible like the

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.920
Streaming services there are streaming servers that are going out to the different services and providing you guys with an uncut feed

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.760
of

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.720
All of the shows here and that's huge. Yeah, it's huge

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:39.680
but the the thing that I think often gets overlooked is a lot of people are great at doing addition on the internet and

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.200
Not so great at doing subtraction and the reality is that there's a cost associated with that, right?

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.000
When he is when he is paying rikai

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.440
To you know to to work on all of this stuff or when he's having me do all this stuff when he's having other

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:57.680
People come in and you know and try to get all this infrastructure not to mention actually pay for the physical infrastructure itself

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.440
And let me tell you

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:04.720
I mean I was here I watched firsthand how carefully he was counting

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:10.000
Costs trying to make every single penny count because we had to stretch it as far as humanly possible to make this possible

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.400
And then you get to the end of it and it's like well

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.600
We still aren't going to be able to make this work quite the way we really want it to well

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.640
We'll find a way we're gonna we're gonna shoehorn this we're gonna shoehorn that or we're gonna we'll we'll outsource this and thank god

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.360
we have you know resources like digital ocean that allow us to expand that but

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.460
I see so many people that they will pay for a ten dollar netflix subscription

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.640
My in-laws and I was showing chris the text this earlier

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.680
My in-laws have a netflix subscription that they don't use they pay every month for a netflix subscription

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.760
But because they bought one of these smart tvs that turned out to be outdated like in six months

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.080
By the way, I I think I did mention this to them like six months ago when they bought it

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.480
I imagine like I was like, you know smart tv not a great choice

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.640
And so the smart tv goes out of date and so this netflix app isn't working and I don't know

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.280
Working and I find out about this and i'm like, well, you know, you could buy

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.560
You know one of the little streaming sticks or whatever and stick in there and i'm explaining this to my in-laws and then it dawns

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.560
On me they are paying ten dollars a month

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.600
For content that they don't even watch right and don't touch and the reason for that is well

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.920
I think it's a couple fold one is I think they they buy into the netflix experience

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.400
They buy into the netflix desire that they have access to this on-demand content in the back of your mind

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.200
You know, you can watch it whenever you want exactly you never do exactly and and then second of all

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:27.360
It's they put it on you know, you put it on automatic, you know draft or whatever and you just forget about it

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:35.200
So I guess what i'm asking you guys to do is why not do that for jb the people here

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.200
I promise you the people in this building

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:42.400
Are working twice as hard than most of the people at netflix to bring you content and the thing is we don't restrict the content

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:47.600
We give it to you in labor respecting formats. We give it to you in the the the most common formats

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.360
You just you you download it and we don't even charge you for I mean you go to the website

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.120
You just download it and all we're asking in return is that if you appreciate the content if you like what we do here

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.680
You know, I used to have a friend he used to say

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.000
Gratuitous, uh, it was uh rabbi lapin. He used to say, um

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.020
gratuity is

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.600
Is what you give people with president's faces on them and their tokens of appreciation, right?

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.920
And and you know, there are so many different levels that you can contribute now

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.120
um, you know i'm looking here you can get started at three bucks three bucks a month and

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.440
That's a great way to say. Thank you

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.320
And the thing is like I think a lot of people fall into this they say well

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.720
I don't know if I you know, I don't know if that really does anything

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:35.440
You know, the reality is if everyone that said that just signed up for three bucks a month

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.920
Which by the way is a third of the cost of netflix

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.160
So if you think about it, you're you're getting it at like 66 percent discount nothing

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.640
Yeah, exactly and it it does a lot

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:48.880
Of course if you can afford to help more than you know, and people do we get emails in all the time

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.680
And you know, we don't always read them because it's quite frankly

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:54.800
There's no good content weight to read flattering emails sometimes

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.720
But there's a lot of people that have said the network has helped them get a new linux job

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.240
The network has helped them, you know double their income because absolutely, you know, they're now working in a different field

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.420
So I would just encourage you guys if you like the content we're producing here go over to patreon.com

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.760
And sign up to be a patron

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:14.800
If this became a wider spread thing

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.880
If more people were involved in the patreon and putting their voting with their their money

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:26.160
Chris and the entire network becomes beholden to them and them alone

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.920
And so really you are you are you're not only saying thank you. You're not only saying

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.320
Uh, we hear we see the content that you're doing. We appreciate the content that you're doing and we thank you, but you're also

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.960
You're also buying a piece of power, right?

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.720
You're also buying that that little bit of this is what I want to see done

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.960
And you know, we try and listen to that. So we're at

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.400
3981 now every time that i've been here

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.960
I kind of have i'm starting to get a record like if I come here

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.200
And I and I make some ridiculous promise then something ridiculous happens, right?

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:03.120
Right. I I don't know what I mean. I wore a window shirt. I mean, what else do you want from me? You know

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:09.040
Uh, but I think it would be super cool if we could get to 4 000 patrons now that is

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.480
That is what 19 patrons. It just had 19 people 19 people sign up

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.720
We'd have like four that's a really nice that is doesn't that have a nice ring to it really does

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.240
It has a nice ring to it

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.120
I think that that would go over I I think then chris would be like

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.200
No one west do not totally screw up the show when we let them do it and then and then our beatings are way less

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.840
Severe they are they are he doesn't get nearly as he doesn't get nearly as as as upset with us

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.800
And we might even get to eat tonight. Yeah, if only we could get 19 patrons. So let's try to make that a goal

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.500
Let's see 19 patrons. We get 19 people to sign up for patreon.com

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.960
slash today

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.760
I'll have to think of something. I don't know what I again I just you know a window shirt. I don't know

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.680
What else am I gonna do?

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.680
um windows tattoo

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:58.720
To that ain't gonna happen too far 10 000 patrons. It's not no it's not gonna happen

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.700
Like even if they were my patrons, I know patreon.com

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.440
Today anyone else in the mumble room have any closing thoughts?

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.600
Not necessarily about patreon but just about linux in general you guys come on now

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.960
We are

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.720
You what? Yeah, I guess so I guess everything has

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.640
Either we have gone through and said everything humanly possible or everyone is totally tuned out because we totally screwed it up

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.120
But that's all right

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.120
All right. Well, thank you very much

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:38.000
Thank you very much mumble room for being a part of the linux unplugged this week

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.600
I really appreciate the opportunity to step in here for hair master chris

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:47.200
Well, he's out getting some much-needed rest and then he can just kind of pop in here when he has great things to say

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.080
The hair doesn't maintain itself folks. No, no, it sure doesn't. Thanks a lot west for being here. I really appreciate it

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.300
It's wonderful to see you know it great. Well, we'll see you right back here next week

01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.300
So

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:17.300
I've never installed gnu slash linux zombies don't run linux

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:24.360
Is and the value of this is negative

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:34.360
So

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:50.280
So get it out of here

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:03.320
You know one thing I uh one thing i'd really like I wish that soundboard thing had like a waveform so I could see

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:09.560
When it's about to hit the thingy. Yeah, I have one that does that wouldn't you? Yeah good show. No a good show

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.920
Thank you. Good show. Oh boy to get warm in here or what? Yeah

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.320
I changed

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:21.240
I literally changed mid show I changed so that all that stuff about patreon air conditioning would be amazing. Oh my god

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.560
Thank you mumble room. You guys are great. Think about how much longer they can work

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.960
But you can't run it during the show, right?

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:33.320
Dot com well if we got a unit that's across the yard and then we ducted it over here what we would do is

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:37.560
Then we would run it into the furnace and then the essentially the furnace would be the distributor of the cold air

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:41.080
That's the plan. You tell the real central air. Yeah, i've been looking into this

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:45.720
It also means our furnace here in the studio is 18 years old now, so we'd have to replace the furnace, too

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.300
Just get the whole job done. Jimmy titles

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:55.080
Now we all gotta go boat. Oh, did you have fun noah? Yeah. Thank you. Good good

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.200
Uh, the talking gnome noah's arch the gnome talks back

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.440
Arch will strike kelly down titles on android. Oh, that is a pretty that's a more solid implementation than I expected

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:06.680
Me too. That's what honestly. Yeah

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.440
There was some reason I was like wanting someone to run android or I was wanting to run android

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:12.760
I would use it like it's totally if there was an android app

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.160
I had to have yeah, or if I had a device like this that I wanted to have a sling tv on or something

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.160
Like that, okay. This will fix your android

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.320
You got angros on that usb

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:25.000
I like how every time you get on mic these days you paint me as like this

01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:31.560
Unmovable arch user who is so in entrenched into arch. All right. All right. All right, mr

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:37.480
Hot shot like like I couldn't point the machine running a running a distribution under the arch. Are you really?

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.520
I mean, this is kind of unfortunate because that's running mint right there

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.320
You see that mint menu right there, yeah, yeah

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:49.800
I I just I just I just if it's here's where my

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.960
Point to the machine that's that's not running arch that you didn't install for a review

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:59.080
Well, okay, that's true. But also it just comes down to this if it's a computer. I want to install software on

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.560
Then I don't use ubuntu

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.040
That's just that's the calculus if it's a machine if it's a computer

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.360
I'm gonna install one piece of software on like mumble and skype

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:10.920
So two pieces of software then it's no big deal to run a ubuntu can handle that just fine

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.200
You know, it's really easy to install telegram from the play store on android

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.360
Yeah, you know, maybe you should oh, whoa

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:22.440
What if skype was better on that on remix os and it is on desktop linux?

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.080
Then we could start using that for our calls

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.480
Actually just something quickly on telegram

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:34.200
I didn't I didn't realize this I just got an ubuntu phone the first time ever and the telegram client on ubuntu

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:38.520
Like ubuntu touched is beats the crap out of the android. I've heard it's really good

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.120
Stickers yet

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.120
It's uh, I don't know

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.600
I'm going to send you a message. Let's see

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.920
Okay, because last time I checked

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.640
um even support stickers, which is like

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:59.320
You know what, you know what, oh my god, I don't know i'm not normally this guy

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.600
But this guy on reddit was giving me so much crap for how I covered

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:05.960
The own cloud story in the linux action show this sunday

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.160
and then I just realized that both frank

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:11.560
and

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:17.640
Joss tweeted out our coverage specifically. I was referring people to it, which gives me the sense that we were probably close to the mic

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.480
Yeah, I saw that nailed today. What's that?

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.360
They've got more news today

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.960
the uh foundation

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.960
Yeah from own cloud inc

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:32.120
Like if you if you have a look at it like

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:37.960
If you look at that in the context of everything that yos and frank and everybody said about why they left

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.480
like

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:42.520
The pieces are starting to come together. It's like it's pretty clear to me

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.400
This is why they left

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.800
This foundation

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:53.960
Yeah, because like they like think about frank's initial bit of like who owns the community blah blah blah

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.040
then look at the foundation thing and

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:59.480
There's only two community elected seats on that board

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:05.880
There's four corporate seats where any company can effectively buy their eligibility for that board

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:11.240
There's one own cloud appointee. So that's out of a seven person board. The community's only two people

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.320
And that's the kind of thing that I could see getting

01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:19.400
When you put that in the context of frank stuff that that's all looking really interesting

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.920
Dude, you're totally right. Like I was reading that all backwards. I thought the foundation was a reaction to

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.400
You know some of this bad

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:36.280
It's press that they were getting because of people leaving but I bet you're right. I bet it's the opposite. I

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.160
Mean the weird the weird thing with me I read that announcement and I read their their current spec and it's like okay

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.840
I mean, I know i'm biased i'm, you know chairman of open sues of heaven's sake but

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.840
looked at their rules and foundation charter and it's like

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.280
They took everything out of the open suzer board spec

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.920
And like ripped out the community part

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.040
Yeah, people say i'm creating fud in this in the subreddit. I don't

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.560
I find that I find that subreddit. Sometimes I just can't I can't track their same thinking. I don't think it's spreading fud

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.960
I think it's I think it's like I guess

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:11.000
What is exactly the fud of it? What's fun about saying these these people?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.640
And not only did I not cover it when it first started happening because it just seemed like drama

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.880
But I waited till like multiple people left and another organization reported in this case. It was pharaonic

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:20.600
I think even like I I don't think necessarily you did anything wrong

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.360
But even if you covered it in a poor way

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.520
I think it was clear that your intentions were there like you you've you've discussed that quite clearly

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.760
I don't even yeah, I I guess when I look at it

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.720
I I guess it feels like it feels like we're walking the line of

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.440
If you talk about this stuff that equates to spreading fud and that's the line that makes me uncomfortable

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.280
Don't say the bad things just don't ever talk about the bad things

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:47.000
I think the bit the subreddit is trying to get onto and and I I agree with this part if this is a subreddit's point

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:53.080
of there's a distinction between own cloud inc and the own cloud community and I think

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:58.920
Yeah, what frank is trying to allude to actually part of the problem is that people don't see that distinction. So

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:05.000
Your coverage is kind of evidence of that because you didn't really make a distinction between the two so you kind of equated

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Well, no, I did specifically say

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.360
Well, no, okay. So when we started the coverage, I did specifically say that there are two different entities

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:17.240
But I think I I think it's because I am of the opinion that if frank and joss and others leave

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.840
It's it is a bad sign. It's not necessarily they're doomed, but I am

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.960
Honestly of the opinion that it is a bad development for them

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
I don't think that's necessarily

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.760
Bad analysis either. I think that is a concerning development

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:37.400
I have no idea what they're planning besides. I have a pretty good suspicion. They're going to announce something tomorrow and

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:42.520
obviously frank is a keynote speaker at open suzer conference later this month, but um

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.920
the you know

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:50.440
This could be like the libra office of the open office for own cloud. Hmm. Interesting

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.000
Yeah, I I don't know if that's true this is purely speculation

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.680
My end but you know, you know everybody said the same with libra office

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:04.440
What are these crazy guys doing getting all idealistic and you know skipping away from that and it kind of worked out all right for them

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.440
Well, you know i've had a lot of conversations with frank

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:11.560
um, and he seems like a pretty intelligent individual and he seems like he's a pretty he's

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:17.240
He very much is a big picture kind of person and uh, I I I think

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.520
For that kind of project. He's a good person to be involved

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:26.040
And so I just think it's a little unfortunate and hopefully if it does kind of go like the way of libra office open office

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.240
Um, hopefully it'll sort of work out the same way. It has long-term, too

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:35.080
For them, I don't know. This is linux unplugged episode 147

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.920
For may 31st 2016

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.520
Like what month is it what month is it?
