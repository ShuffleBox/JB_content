00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 438, a special holiday edition.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Hello friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
My name is Chris.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
My name is Wes.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
And my name is Brent.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
And because it is a special edition, we have a bunch of friends joining us today.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Welcome back to the show, Joe.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, sir and Drew.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
How do you do?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
And of course, this is our annual predictions and review episode.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
So before we go any further, before we get into those,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
let's say hello to our virtual lug.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hello, Chris.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Hello, everyone.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Hello, you guys.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm really glad to have you here today because there's some of these

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
that you're on the record for.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
So it'll be good to get your takes on it.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Suckers.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah, you're going to have to own up just like we will.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
In fact, why don't we start with that?

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
We're going to start with the review, then we'll do the actual predictions

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
with just a disclaimer off the top of the show here.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm in a weird situation.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
This is the backup recording gear.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Like I bring, yes, I do.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I bring a backup podcasting backpack.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
And like my just in case something goes wrong and I get stranded somewhere,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
I can still do a show, go bag.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
And that's what's been deployed for today's episode because everything

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
that happens to me seems to be really my own fault when I think about it.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I decided to go out into the woods for a white Christmas,

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
went to one of my favorite spots, got a nice white Christmas,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
and then we got inundated with one of the biggest storms we've ever had

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
in my lifetime here, especially where I'm at, you know,

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
temperatures around five degrees Fahrenheit, snow every day.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
It's just been a wild, wild cup.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Well, it's been about a week now that I've been here

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
that I've been stuck.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
And now we're almost out of gas.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
We're almost out of propane.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
We're almost out of water.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
But I wanted to get Linux unplugged done.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
We wanted to get it recorded.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
And then I'm going to try to get out of here because it is cold

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and the RV is frozen.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
So things sound a little weird.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
If there's something that doesn't seem quite right,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
that's what's going on right there is this is the backup backpack.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And it's going to be a little hokey, but we've been testing stuff.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
We've been sorting things out.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
And I'm hoping that when we get done with the shows,

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
the roads will have melted enough that we can safely make it out of here.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Although I'm not actually sure we can get our slides in

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
because our slide toppers are icebergs right now.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
So we'll see.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
So I'm just going to focus on the show.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Just going to focus on the show.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Although this was the week I was right now.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
This was like this is like work on projects in the studio time.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And instead I'm stuck here in the woods.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Thank goodness I brought the Starlink dish with me.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, this is a really battle testing the old Starlink setup.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
And so far so good, right?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
It's battle testing everything.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It's the opposite of Tucson.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
It's bizarro Tucson where I had a problem of things overheating.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Now I have a problem of things getting too cold like my batteries.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
They can't get lower than 25 degrees Fahrenheit or else they stop taking a charge.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
So like I got to continually stress the system and keep the inverter going.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
So that way it vents heat into the battery bay.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I've had to get up every two hours for the like last six nights

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
because I got to make sure the temperatures are OK.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
So while the show's going, the temperatures drop.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And then as soon as we get done doing the show, I have to like generate a big load, a big noisy load.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
So that way I can warm the batteries up.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
That's the game I've been playing.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Well, you're up all night.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm sure you've been stewing over your predictions, huh?

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And perhaps lamenting what you said last year.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I know I have.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, boy, oh, boy.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
These aren't looking good for me, Wes.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
I like your predictions a lot better than mine.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
We've all got some here.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
So I say we start owning it up.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
Now, just to remind folks that haven't listened before,

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
we have some predictions we'll be getting to, but we have to be concise.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
We have to be very specific.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
And we have Joe along to play arbiter and judge to make sure that we comply with the rules.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
You're going to keep us in line, right, Joe?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, I'm the referee.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You've got to be specific.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
It's got to be quantifiable.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
We've got to be able to measure it next year.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
That's right.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
And you have to we're going to try to get everybody to state it in a nice, concise way.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
So that way it's something that's easily reviewable and provable,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
which is what we're going to do now.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
So what do you say?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
Since Drew is our guest, we start with Drew this year.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
So get yourself ready, Drew, because I don't know how many of these came true,

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
but each one of them had super sound reasoning,

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
starting with your Chrome OS prediction from last year.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
I predict in 2021 that Google will release an official ISO image for Chrome OS for x86 computers.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Drew, I checked and this didn't actually happen,

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
even though they bought that company that essentially did this.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, no, I totally thought this was going to happen.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
And then it didn't.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
You can get Chromium OS.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
It's not technically official, but there is no Chrome OS.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
So, you know, it's like you think you see that you see all the tea leaves like kind of you're reading them

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
and you see, gosh, you know, they've they've been kind of having like this kind of side x86 port that they've maintained now.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
Now they just bought this company when their entire focus is rebasing Chrome OS for x86 PCs.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And then nothing, nothing, just nothing.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Is this just to tell that x86 is really on the way out?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Maybe.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah, but why not use that same tech to make Raspberry Pi images of Chrome OS?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Seriously.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Be a good way to, you know, increase the user base.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
People want to try it out.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
All right, Drew, now this next one.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
Yeah, I feel like you were you were you were kind of recently into the new gig and looking at what was going on in the marketplace.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And this one seemed really solid.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
I predict in 2021 that Rancher ownership will change hands.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Rancher OS would be sold and it didn't happen.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Nope. Missed that one, too.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Now, what was your thinking on that one?

05:57.000 --> 06:06.000
Just that SUSE tends to kind of fluctuate a lot and, you know, it's hard to go wrong with the SUSE bet.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
You know what I think happened is some new leadership came in and they recognized some of this stuff is their best product.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, absolutely.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
So leadership had a change of heart.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
And otherwise, I think you would have got it.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Now, this one, this one you got right.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I predict in 2021 that VMware will go independent.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And that has happened.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Dell has spun off VMware.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Hey, oh, completed. Done.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Give me that point.

06:28.000 --> 06:35.000
You got it, sir. Nicely done.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
This may be our only win.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
I don't know. I don't know about that.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
All right. What do you say?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Should we do poppies?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
How you feeling, Poppy?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
You ready to do some of yours?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Yeah. OK. All right.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Now this one, actually, I think you're going to start out with a win from last year.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
I predict in 2021 Canonical will neither IPO nor be bought by Microsoft.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Turned out you got that one.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Did you have insider information?

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Hmm. Yeah, I might have done at the time.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Not anymore.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
But even though not anymore, I'd be happy to keep that one running for a couple more years.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah. OK. All right.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
You'll double down.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So and you're including the IPO in that.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Yep. OK. All right.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Well, one of our first M1 predictions was made by you.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Here's how it went.

07:23.000 --> 07:34.000
In 2021, Hector Martin and collaborators will get 90 percent of the hardware in the first generation M1 Max booting on Linux.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
OK, I feel like this is the first one where we got to we got to kind of discuss it a little bit.

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
And then Joe's going to have to make the final call because what do you think the GPU accounts for in that setup, Poppy?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Like is GPU 10 percent or is it more like 20 percent?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, I was thinking more, you know, 90 percent functionality.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I know I said 90 percent of the hardware.

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
I felt like, you know, could you get it working the same way that you put Linux on a ThinkPad?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
It 90 percent works.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.000
You could probably say 90 percent like the fingerprint reader doesn't work or, you know, some small part that you don't use doesn't work.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't know. I've seen pictures of people running M1's with Debian and it looked pretty good.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Yep. Using GNOME with LLVM pipe or whatever it is to do CPU accelerated graphics.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
So what do you think, Judge?

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
I think until we get an installer, it doesn't count at all.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
It's zero percent.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Oh, no, that's unfair.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
That's unfair.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
If you said 90 percent, you know, ThinkPad fingerprint reader at 90 percent.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, it's not there, right?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
With if you're using LLVM pipe.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, exactly. I don't think that it's it's there.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I think the problem is the final 10 percent takes 90 percent of the time.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Right. True.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah, we did just see some more patches land like two days ago to enable more of the T1 and T2 hardware.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
That looks really good.

08:51.000 --> 08:58.000
So, I mean, you know, I would be surprised if we're sitting here at this time next year and it's not correct.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
I got to feel like I don't know about full GPU acceleration, but just about everything else does seem there.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And I mean, some some people might be happy with just that.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
I personally just want headless Linux for server purposes. So, you know, that's all I need.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
All right, Poppy, CentOS was on our mind and you have our first CentOS prediction from last year.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Here's how it went.

09:21.000 --> 09:29.000
In 2021, Red Hat will do something disliked by the community, which intentionally makes life hard for the ROX Linux developers.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Hmm. I'm thinking through and I can't think of an example of this.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah, I'm not really in that community and I don't keep an eye on CentOS and Rocky and all the others.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
So I don't really know. I thought we would have heard about it if they had. So I don't think so.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
OK. All right. Well, keep thinking on that.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
Maybe we could return to that in the prediction section of the show because it seems like there's that's pretty ripe right there.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
There's got to be something going on. Why don't we stick with the Mumble Room?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Byte, you had a prediction about risk and it went like this.

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
I think in 2021, there will be a credit card sized computer with a full-fledged RISC-V CPU.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
A credit card sized computer. So you're thinking like Raspberry Pi size? Is that what you meant?

10:13.000 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, around about. So, yeah, with developer boards, they could be twice the size, but yeah, more like Raspberry Pi.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Ref slash judge, whatever I keep calling you. What do you think?

10:26.000 --> 10:34.000
I think that we have seen some that are getting towards that size. It's not very powerful. I can't remember what they're called though right now.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
There has been a lot of progress towards that anyway.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Beagleboard test one.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
That's it.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Oh, all right.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
So it's a win.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Hang on. I have that board and it's prototype, but it's not out yet.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Oh, wait. Does prototype count? Does that count?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
It was limited to 300 developers, I think.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
How do you get one then?

10:57.000 --> 11:05.000
Because I pretended to be a developer, but they discontinued it and they've said there will be another one, but it's not this one.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
So that's not a publicly available device.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Uh oh. Do we have to retract the win?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I think we might have to.

11:13.000 --> 11:19.000
Boy, that's tough. I see a lot of flutter about it, you know, last January. So it was looking good throughout the year, but I guess not.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
What a shame. That was a close one. That was a close one. All right, Wes Payne, prepare yourself.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
We're going to do your predictions. And you started with one that I really, really hoped would materialize, but I don't think it did.

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
I predict that in 2021, GNOME finally fixes their plugin problem with a new API they've announced.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
That means a misbehaving plugin can no longer crash your whole dang shell.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I don't think so, Wes.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Nope, definitely not.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
I was hopeful. You know, there's been a lot of interesting GNOME developments this past year, that's definitely for sure.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
Plenty of drama and active community discussion as well, but not a lot of progress there.

12:06.000 --> 12:15.000
No, something like that would have been so great for end users and distro makers, but it seems we're still a bit out from something like that materializing.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
Now, this next one, I feel like you're going to get it right, just not necessarily yet.

12:21.000 --> 12:32.000
I predict that in 2021, the first Rust based kernel module will be widely distributed, either optionally in the main tree or shipped by Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I don't think that happened. No, it didn't.

12:34.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, a lot of progress, even just this December, the V2 of that big old patch set was set out, seems like it's now using the stable Rust, so that's getting a lot closer to shipping.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
They've got support from people like ARM, Google, Microsoft, all are interested in seeing this happen.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
So it seems almost inevitable at this point, but yeah, maybe next year.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
Yeah, and it seems like when it does happen, we're going to start probably with a device driver, right?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And then it'll kind of grow from there.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah, you know, little bits, standalone, independent functionality that, you know, get the community comfortable with it.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
We'll keep our eyes out. We'll keep our eyes out.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
And then your last one was probably the spiciest of them all.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
And I think if I recall, my reaction was sort of like, what?

13:15.000 --> 13:25.000
I predict that Linus Torvalds will make an announcement sometime in 2021, and he's stepping back to some degree from his day to day involvement with the Linux kernel.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
You know, the other thing is, I don't even know if he would make a public announcement or if it was just something he would slowly ratchet down over time.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
Right, sort of slink away. That's a good question.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
There definitely was an announcement, though, which I think I'm glad of, right?

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
I mean, we've got a nice, a lot of nice emails out on the mailing list and plenty of RC postings, et cetera, from Linus this year.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Well, he'd be missed.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah, he's been, actually this year, he's been really consistent with the releases.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
Only a couple of delays for pretty reasonable reasons with the kernel releases.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
And he always kind of puts like a cute little note in there explaining what the reason was for the delay.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
And it's always just such a human reason, like, oh, man, the airport was just packed and traffic was just awful.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
So this one's making it out a little late. It's just something to see that, you know, it's so human.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
All right. Time to own up to mine, I suppose. And then we'll get to the predicting here.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
We do have a couple of extra bonus ones I might slip into, but.

14:22.000 --> 14:32.000
Well, I am really kind of bummed to say that my first prediction, I feel like we are absolutely no closer to than when I made this prediction in 2020.

14:32.000 --> 14:45.000
And our manufacturer in 2021 will come out with an ARM SOC that matches or beats Apple's M1 on Geekbench.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Geez, that just didn't happen at all.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
Unless you count the M1 Pro and Max.

14:52.000 --> 15:02.000
No, damn it. I do not. Damn it. I really was like I thought Samsung would have an ace up their sleeve like they, you know, this is their business.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
They must have seen this coming. They just surely were just not totally caught off guard.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Right. Like they weren't just totally flat footed.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
No, they were. And they're still working on their damn response.

15:12.000 --> 15:19.000
And Qualcomm as well. And so, yeah, I couldn't I don't even know if I'd want to make this that prediction this year.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Who knows? It may not even happen this year. It's pretty pathetic, actually.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Apple just lapped them. Hey, at least Asahi's doing well, huh? Yeah, that's true.

15:26.000 --> 15:37.000
Yeah, that is true. In fact, Apple just recently made a change to Mac OS, the latest point release that is going to make it easier for Asahi Linux long term.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
And and Hector Martin thinks it's a change that was made implicitly for Asahi Linux.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
It's like one of those like sneaky little changes that makes life simpler.

15:46.000 --> 15:52.000
I have not played this next one. I wanted to save it for myself, but I do feel like there's going to be maybe some debate.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It depends on how specific I got.

15:54.000 --> 16:02.000
I predict that system 76 will begin in 2021 to maintain their own genome shell packages.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
So I said begin to maintain. Does Cosmic count as their own genome shell packages?

16:08.000 --> 16:15.000
I think so. Yeah, you do. I'm surprised. All right. It seems like they're headed in that direction, at least.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
So begin. Yeah. OK, so you're going to give this one to me.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
I am. Yeah. Wow.

16:25.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah. Only because you qualified it with begin sneaky tactic there, Chris. Can I interject for a moment?

16:32.000 --> 16:40.000
So if you look in the system 76 PPA, which is where they build a lot of their stuff, there are no shell packages in there.

16:40.000 --> 16:47.000
No, no, no. They are in there. So just to validate that they are maintaining, to some degree, some known shell packages.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
And I'm glad you showed up today. Here we go. Thanks. Thanks, Poppy.

16:52.000 --> 17:01.000
Good. Poppy with the science. Yeah. So I also just dropped a link in the chat above their GitHub repo for their known shell with a few patches they add on top of it.

17:01.000 --> 17:09.000
I am elated just because I had resigned myself to not having a single win here because like this last one, I can't really verify.

17:09.000 --> 17:17.000
I have found out a rough estimate since the last time Microsoft released numbers, but I made this prediction about WSL.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm going to say that in 2021, it becomes public that a distribution has more users on WSL than physical installs in the wild.

17:26.000 --> 17:35.000
And this just didn't really seem to happen. From what I can tell, I saw an article quoting three million to four million active daily WSL users.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
But I don't actually know if that's true. And I don't know how current the numbers are.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
And I don't know if that surely that's larger than some distros.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
But no distros come out and said, we're the largest WSL distro, etc, etc. You know, it just doesn't seem like it happened.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
You were very specific about it. And I think that was your downfall here.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
You said that it would become public, first of all, so not just a leak or whatever.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
And also, you said that there'd be more WSL for a particular distro than there would be physical installs.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
So, no, I'm afraid this is an absolute fail. I think it is. I agree.

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
That's OK. I got one win, so I'm feeling pretty good going by the odds now. Our buddy Alex couldn't make it today.

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
He had something come up, but he did make this prediction last year and he wants to submit it again for this year.

18:19.000 --> 18:30.000
I predict slash hope that a Western Digital easy store 20 terabyte hard drive will cost two hundred and fifty dollars or less at some point in 2021.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
The supply chain shortages just really messed up that prediction.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
It may have happened if things had just continued to tick along like we expected.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
But we had no idea what we were in store for for supply chain issues.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
No, we did not. But gosh, yeah, here's hoping that one comes true for all of us data hoarders.

18:45.000 --> 18:56.000
Right. I agree. I agree. We also, by the way, should mention we made a few predictions in Linux Action News and I have a Raspberry Pi prediction in Linux Action News for that episode.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
But Alex did make one regarding the Raspberry Pi.

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
The next major release of the Raspberry Pi, maybe the Pi 5, will have an option for a proper storage system.

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
So that's MVME or M.2 SATA or just a genuine SATA port.

19:12.000 --> 19:27.000
Negative. Pi 4 was released in 2019 and it was not updated, hence maybe my prediction in LAN.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Sorry, Alex. Maybe next year.

19:31.000 --> 19:39.000
Linode dot com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a new account and you go there to keep this here show going.

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Man, I tell you what, I am so glad that I sink the essentials like clips and ISO images up to Linode.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
It's like my go bag digitally. I have stuff up there that is just easily accessible or even better.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
Easy to spin up on Linode when I'm in a pinch. That's where we've built everything in the last couple of years.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
It's really the cloud for a Linux geek. They have 11 data centers worldwide and they've been hard at work for 18 years,

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
creating the best experience for running applications on Linux. That's it.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Nobody can just touch that kind of experience and passion.

20:06.000 --> 20:13.000
If you like to build something yourself or deploy one of the many one click stacks, Linode has excellent options for you.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Either way, you're going to get started fast, quick and easy.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
That matters because if you get an inspiration for an idea, you can get something up and running in just seconds on Linode.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
And they've been rolling out screaming fast NVMe storage.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
They have AMD epic processors in their CPU rigs and they have the best customer support in the business.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
You add it all together, it makes a lot of sense.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Customer support is great. Super fast rigs. A Linux culture that runs deep.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
And it's a great way to support the show, too.

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
There's a lot of reasons to choose Linode, but that $100 might be the biggest because you can really go try it for yourself and let me know what you think.

20:46.000 --> 20:54.000
Linode.com slash unplugged. Get $100 for 60 days on a new account and you support the show. Linode.com slash unplugged.

20:57.000 --> 21:05.000
Well, now that we've seen how we did last year, I suppose it's time to make some predictions about 2022.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Gosh, I feel a bit foolish even just saying we're going to try to do that, but do what we must.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Yeah, especially after that go.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Well, perhaps I'll give it a start here.

21:14.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm going to predict that Canonical announces a Flutter-based desktop environment.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
You madman. A whole desk like a Unity 3 kind of project that is Flutter-based?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah, like that.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Mad lad.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
Ref, you got any specifics you want out of this before we have them lock that one in? It seems kind of straightforward to me.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
Announce, not release.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Announce, not release. Yeah.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Aha. Good catch.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah, otherwise that's all good.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
All right, let's lock it in Wes.

21:44.000 --> 21:50.000
I predict that in 2022 Canonical will announce a Flutter-based desktop environment.

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
I would be really, really excited to see that happen just because what a fun thing to follow.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Don't know if it'd ever be for me, but yeah, it'd be interesting to see that.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Right? Yeah.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm curious about Popeye's reactions to this, whether he's smiling or rolling his eyes or, I don't know, crossing his fingers.

22:09.000 --> 22:15.000
Well, when we did our predictions on the Ubuntu podcast, the last episode of the Ubuntu podcast a couple of months ago,

22:15.000 --> 22:23.000
we had a bonus prediction that all three of us gave, which was by the next LTS in 2404, Ubuntu desktop will no longer be Gnome Shell-based.

22:23.000 --> 22:29.000
And then we discussed it a bit and the outcome we decided was there'll be a new desktop and it will probably be Flutter-based.

22:29.000 --> 22:37.000
The way to do it, right, would be you get the LTS out the door and then you make the announcement and you start iterating between this LTS and the next one.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
That's the only way they could do it.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, you kind of got that anchor-based LTS for folks that are a bit nervous, perhaps.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.000
Right, which also gives strength to your announce, but not release.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Fingers crossed.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I think that's good.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
You want to try your second one?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah, all right.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
Well, so I went spelunking in some of our past years and I realized in the past I made a few U-specific predictions, Chris.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
I thought I'd rekindle that past tradition.

23:01.000 --> 23:09.000
I'm going to predict that after doubling down on Tumbleweed on the server, you're going to start using it on the desktop in 2022.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
That seems insane to me at this point.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
I don't know.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
I mean, so any desktop at all or my primary daily driver?

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
So I'm thinking it's in the category when you're trying to get work done on Linux.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
That's a Tumbleweed machine, whether that's like a laptop or your office workstation upstairs.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I think you've got to be specific here.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
I think you've got to say either the laptop or the workstation upstairs with the funky screens.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I think, yeah, I think that's good.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
I feel like I could give you a hint, but I don't want to.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Like, should I help you or should I stay competitive?

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I don't know.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
That's fair. That's fair.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
All right. Well, I'll go with the laptop.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Okay. All right. Lock it in.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
I predict that in 2022, Chris will be using OpenSUSE Tumbleweed on his laptop.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
Good call, because that ThinkPad would be the first place I try it.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Because, you know, it's such a guaranteed to work standardized hardware base.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
That's my go-to.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
So I think that was a good call.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
The desktop has been running Arch for a very long time, and it takes a big upset.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Like, I haven't even put Fedora on that thing yet.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
So, oh, boy, yeah, that tells you right there.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
Okay, Brent, I'd love to hear your first prediction for 2022.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Yeah. Okay, here we go.

24:25.000 --> 24:33.000
I predict that in 2022, Ubuntu snap by default another major Linux desktop application.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
So either LibreOffice or Thunderbird, to be more specific.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
So two possibilities there, Ref. You good with that?

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah, I think if you're going to be specific about those two applications.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
I didn't want it to be too broad. That's no fun, right?

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
So having a little bit of some specifics.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
Plus, they're two, I don't know, fairly large applications, not just like a small tool or something.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
So that feels right to me.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Okay. All right.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Log it in.

25:00.000 --> 25:09.000
In 2022, Ubuntu will snap by default another major Linux desktop application, either LibreOffice or Thunderbird.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
All right.

25:10.000 --> 25:15.000
It is locked, and I'm surprised I didn't think of that one, to tell you the truth.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
That seems likely.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
I'm thinking through that list, which one's probably the biggest pain in their butt,

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
and which one could build off of a relationship they've already established?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
It's Thunderbird there, right?

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
They've already done this with Firefox.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
It seems like Thunderbird would be the next step.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
I don't know.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
How many people use Thunderbird versus LibreOffice?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Who will it affect?

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
I was curious about this one because there's been a bit of backlash in the past,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
and yet it seems to still be the direction they're going.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
So I don't know.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I'm interested to see where this gets.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
I suppose it might get weighted by what's hardest to build to, like with Chromium.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Right.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
That's what I wonder.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
I mean, just from past insights to this, for something like this to happen,

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
would it have to be initiated by LibreOffice or Mozilla slash Thunderbird,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
or would it be initiated by Canonical, do you think?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
No, not at all.

26:03.000 --> 26:07.000
I mean, in the case of Firefox, as you know, it was initiated by Mozilla,

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
but for others, it's initiated by Canonical.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
I think this is understandable, especially given that both of them are already snapped.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
They're already available in the store.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
They're already maintained by Canonical employees.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
So I think it's a bit of a no-brainer that, yeah, this almost certainly would happen.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
And you get bonus points, maybe, if both of them are done.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Ooh, nice.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
I'll take that.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah, I think that's fair.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Phobe's here rooting for us today.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I love it.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Okay, great.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
So those are pretty solid.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
I like that.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
I could see that happening.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And I think you got one more for us.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I do.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
I think this one might have been on all of our minds,

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
but I decided to make it a little bit specific.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
It has to do with Steam.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
I think the Linux monthly usage stats might go really high this year,

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
so I predict that they might just double.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Hmm, okay.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
So we'll see the Steam user base double.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
So it's going to be above 2%, just a little bit above 2%,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
you think, by this time next year?

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
Well, double, I kind of had to look into this

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
because I figured Joe would be on me to be more specific.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
So gamingonlinux.com has the Steam Tracker,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
and currently, at least November 2021,

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
they have stats that it's at 1.16% of their platform.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
So doubling that 2.32%, I think, would be reasonable.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
That's something measurable, right, Joe?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
Does that work?

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Yeah, I think what you've got to say in your lock-in

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
is specifically that the gaming on Linux Steam Tracker

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
will show that it is 2.32% or more.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Okay.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Just as an aside, a little math,

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
and that brings it to almost 3 million users,

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
which would be very interesting.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
All right, lock it in, Brent.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
Steam's Linux monthly usage stats from gaming on Linux

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
will double to 2.32% at some point throughout 2022.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
I think if you just go even above 2.3%, that'd probably be a win.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
Drew told me this was maybe one of his predictions too.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Drew, did I steal your thunder?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Yeah, a little bit.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
I was going to aim for 3%.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Ooh, I like it.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Three, bold.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
I actually, my initial thought was to triple,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
but then I did the math on the actual numbers,

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
and I thought, no, that's not going to happen,

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
but maybe you're splitting that.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
Yeah, and I will say what's really going to make or break this

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
is if Steam Deck users get tracked as Linux users.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
That's a very good point.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
That's a very good point.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
I would imagine they would.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I don't see why they wouldn't, but perhaps...

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Hang on, that assumes that they don't install Windows

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
on their Steam Deck immediately.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
That's a risk.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
I can't see this happening.

28:42.000 --> 28:48.000
In fact, I would say I can't see the Linux Steam percentage

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
going above 1.2, 1.3.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Wow.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Tell us more.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Why?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
It's a percentage, and the other numbers are going to go up as well,

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
and Linux isn't in a bubble,

28:59.000 --> 29:03.000
and there are people who are buying Windows machines as well,

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
and I just can't see that the Steam Deck has enough market penetration

29:07.000 --> 29:12.000
and enough staying power for people who keep the OS that's already on there

29:12.000 --> 29:15.000
for it to sustain all the way up to 3%.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
That's a gigantic jump.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
Poppy, I think you should lock in a counter-prediction to Brent here.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
Okay.

29:21.000 --> 29:28.000
In 2022, the Linux Steam numbers, as represented by gaming on Linux,

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
will not crest more than 1.2 or 1.3%.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
A brutal counter-prediction.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
I love it.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.000
Drew, why don't we stick with your predictions now?

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
What do you see in the works for 2022?

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
I see more vulnerabilities being exploited.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Specifically, we're going to talk about log4j,

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
and I'm going to predict that a log4j exploit attack

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
will cause greater than $100 million in damages to a single business.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Okay, so the way we would validate this is seeing a headline

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
of like 100 million damages or more due to vulnerability exploit?

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Mm-hmm.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
How do you feel, Ref?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Yeah, I think that's quantifiable.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
All right, lock it in, Drew.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
I predict that in 2022, an attack against the log4j exploit

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
will result in greater than $100 million in damages

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
against a single business.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
I hope you're wrong on that one, you know?

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I do, too, because, you know, I work for a business

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
that could be affected by log4j,

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
although we have done our due diligence and closed the gaps,

30:37.000 --> 30:42.000
but they're finding more and more stuff about it every day, so...

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
It seems inevitable there's going to be something way down the stack

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
that we're not even looking at today that they'll discover.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
In the chat room, the orange one says there was another log4j vulnerability

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
released just as we're live now, so...

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Oh, wow.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Go figure.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Gosh.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Okay, all right.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
You got anything that's going to make me look forward to 2022?

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah, I wanted to have a positive one going into 2022,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
and that's going to be...

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
I think that System76 is going to release separate key cap sets

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
in different colorways and profiles for the launch keyboard.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Shenanigans.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Shenanigans?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
I call them shenanigans.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
You're too close to them.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
You've got insider knowledge, Drew.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I actually don't on this.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
I have not actually hang out with anybody at System76

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
in a couple of months now.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Okay.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
All right.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
I believe you, so you want to lock it in.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
You good with that disclaimer out of the way?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Sure.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Okay.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
All right, Drew, lock it in.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I predict that in 2022,

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
System76 will release key cap sets in different colorways and profiles

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
for the launch keyboard.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Dang it, I guess I'm going to have to finally buy a launch in 2022 then.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
And hook it up to that framework you're going to get.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Right.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Ref, we could do a bonus round with your...

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
You have one prediction from last year.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
Do you want to own up to it?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Okay, I kind of remember what it was now.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
All right, here it is.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I predict that in 2021,

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
you'll be able to use everything up to a browser in future.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.000
Ooh.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Ooh.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
I don't think that one played out unless there's some fork, right?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
Okay.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
No.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
The idea of my prediction is that it's totally silly

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
and very unlikely to happen.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
So do you have one for 2022?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
I do.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
All right.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
It's ridiculous.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Okay.

32:28.000 --> 32:32.000
I predict that Bitcoin is going to go over $1 million.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Ooh.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Whoa.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
Whoa.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
I mean, since you're predicting,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I'll play ref here and I have no problem with that.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I think that's a pretty easy one to measure.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
I think it's wild, but it's easy to measure.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
So you want to lock it in?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Okay.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
I predict that at some point in 2022,

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
All right.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
So it just has to touch it and forbid there.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah, even if it crashes totally afterwards.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I don't think it's going to happen really,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
but wouldn't it be amazing if it did?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
It would be the number one story.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Everybody would be talking about it.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Every time Bitcoin price starts to go up,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
it becomes like this fascination with the mainstream media.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
And then the price drops back down and they stop talking about it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
But if it gets over $100,000, then there'll just be crazy mania.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
And then it'll get to $200,000, $250,000,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
then half a million, and then a million.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Who knows?

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
Hmm.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
You know, just a couple of quick interesting Bitcoin stats.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
In 2021, they reached 90% of all Bitcoins

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
that will ever be mined have now been mined.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
So their last 10% to 21 million is going to be a long,

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
hard slog for miners,

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
which likely implies that their cost to mine will go up,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
which is probably going to mean the cost of a Bitcoin is going to go up

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
because the miners have got to recoup their investments there.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
So, you know, there is some pressure there to bring that price up.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
You never know.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
Yeah, or they'll just all give up and go home.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
Yeah, everybody buys Ethereum and cashes out a Bitcoin.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Yeah.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Yeah.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
All right.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
I've got a couple of predictions that I'll lay down

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
and see if you guys will accept.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
I'll start with one that I'd really like to see happen

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
because I think it'd be good long-term for them.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
If they pull it off right,

34:19.000 --> 34:26.000
Flat Hub will begin a process of monetizing in some way in 2022.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
And I could see this being either via pay-what-you-want app sales,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
or I could see it being sponsored apps on Flat Hub.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
But it's a way for the Flat Hub resource to start to produce some revenue

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
and ideally some revenue that developers of applications could share in

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
and would be motivated to go publish their apps on Flat Hub.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
Any thoughts?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I mean, I can narrow that down,

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
but my general idea is Flat Hub monetizes in some way in 2022.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
So they have been working on this for years,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
and so it's definitely on the cards.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
I just wonder when they'll finally deliver it.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Yeah, all these things feel like we predict them,

35:03.000 --> 35:06.000
and then it takes like another two, three years for it to actually happen.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Like they happen.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
It's just we always kind of get the timing wrong.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
We think it's going to happen sooner than later,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
and we think things that are going to happen a long time down the road

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
happen sooner than anyways.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
We mess up the timing.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
I suspect there may be intentional delays after they hear our predictions,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
but I don't know.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Messing with us, for sure.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
For sure, Wes.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
What do you think, Rev?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Do I need to get more specific?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Or can just Flat Hub monetize us in 2022?

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
I think that just monetizing is a bit too vague.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I think we need some specifics somehow.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah, some amount of like,

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
is this like income received for the whatever foundation or nonprofit behind it?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
How do we quantize this?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
You know what I'm inclined to do?

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
I'm inclined to say they, to just get specific then,

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
and say they launch a pay-for-what-you-want model in 2022.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
I think the bigger thing to aim for that you might want to go for

35:52.000 --> 35:59.000
is that they will add a paid system that limits applications you can install

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
until you've paid for them.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Because pay-what-you-want means you can still install anything you like.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
But if they add the guardrails so that it's impossible to install this thing

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
until you've paid for it, and once you've paid for it,

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
you have the entitlement to own it and install it again and again and again,

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
that's a big thing, I think.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
How do they pull this off technically, right?

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
Because they're now pre-installed in a lot of different distributions,

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
app stores and app centers.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
So I remember having a conversation at Academy maybe three years ago

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
with the Flatpak people where they were saying,

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
you know, would SnapCraft be interested in collaborating on this

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
and having a common platform for buying software on Linux?

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
And I didn't think that was likely given that we'd already developed a paid model

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
which was then shut down and hasn't reared its head again.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
So I know they've been working on for exactly that method,

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
for being able to pay for something and be entitled to use it

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
and have some authentication server or something that says,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
yes, you own that thing or no, you don't.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
Isn't the problem here that people don't buy software anymore?

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
They download the software for free and then sign in to that software

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
for their paid subscription.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
You know, what we need is like some sort of distributed ledger

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
that has like a specific token that tracks who owns digital goods.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
You know, that would solve these kinds of problems.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
You're onto something.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So let's see here.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
This is really tricky because the more I think about it,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
technically the longer they stay free,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
the more integrated they've become into just standard desktop workflows

37:34.000 --> 37:40.000
and then to just throw a monetized strategy on there seems tricky.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
How about sponsored apps?

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
They'll have sponsored featured apps on Flat Hub.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
How about that?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah, well, that's something they could do.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
I think they'd get some pushback for it, but they could certainly do it.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
All right, I'm going to lock that in then.

37:53.000 --> 37:59.000
I'm going to say that in 2022, Flat Hub will feature sponsored applications.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
I hope.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
I mean, I hope they make some kind of revenue, for goodness sake.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Yeah.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.000
All right, now, if I didn't just give it away,

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
here's my second prediction.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
This one I think is probably one of the riskier predictions,

38:12.000 --> 38:19.000
but I think in 2022, an open source project will use some kind of NFT,

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
not a silly JPEG, but some kind of NFT to raise funds.

38:23.000 --> 38:29.000
Now, I think this is risky because NFTs are already getting associated with scams

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
and all kinds of silly stuff.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
You see pushback from the gaming community,

38:33.000 --> 38:37.000
and there will be people in the open source community

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
who probably do something kind of scammy with it, you know,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
because that's a thing that happens.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
There's grifters out there.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
But if you zoom out a little bit and stop thinking about monkey JPEGs

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
and you think about it as a way to prove digital ownership of a good,

38:51.000 --> 38:57.000
you could start to see how a project could make an NFT out of a pull request.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
Maybe something got merged and you make an NFT out of a screenshot of that.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
I mean, there's all kinds of stupid ways you could sell something

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
that a free software developer is doing as an NFT,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
and they could make a few dollars here.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
Now, here's the other thing.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Now, despite what you might like about cryptocurrencies

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
or what you might think about it, if you look at the last year,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
there's been about 100% value gain for Bitcoin.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
And if you look at the year before that, it was 160%.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
So it's possible that developers could actually raise funds

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
using an asset that goes up in value over time.

39:27.000 --> 39:33.000
So you buy this NFT pull request from the VLC project

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
and you pay them $100 in Ethereum.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
And at the end of the year, that Ethereum is now worth $300.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
And they cash it out and they've just made a profit on that.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
That could be something we start to see happen in the podcast index.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
They're starting to do this lightning network monetization strategy for podcasts.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
We could see something like that with open source.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
But I think it's going to be something in the NFT space.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
There'll be some of us that think, ah, this is a horrible idea.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And there'll be some that actually go for it.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
And there'll probably be enough people that they'll raise money.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
It might even bring people from outside the Linux community into this action

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
because I mean, NFTs are super popular right now.

40:08.000 --> 40:15.000
So my specific prediction would be an open source project uses an NFT to raise funds.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.000
Yeah, well, that's easily quantifiable. We can easily test that.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
It's a terrible, terrible idea, but it's almost certainly going to happen.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Right. I think so, too. All right.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
So to lock it in, I'll say this.

40:27.000 --> 40:35.000
In 2022, an open source project will use NFTs or an NFT alone to raise funds.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Will there be cute pictures involved?

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
I mean, you know, just as a side prediction.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I mean, I don't think so. I mean, I don't know.

40:41.000 --> 40:48.000
We need for this concept to work, you know, to show that you can raise funds for projects using digital scarcity.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
I feel like you're going to have to have a respectable project that does it in a respectable way.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
And the first few that do it are going to set the pace.

40:56.000 --> 41:06.000
It's either going to blow up and be a grifter thing or it's going to be a reasonable way to buy one off unique things from open source projects that they can use to raise funds.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
And it may not work out great either way, but somebody is going to try it.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Who?

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
I would think for it to really work, it would need to be a project that is known just outside the Linux community,

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
but a project that Windows and Mac users are familiar with, too, that maybe there's like a soft spot for, like some nostalgia, like VLC.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
OBS. OBS. Come on.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
OBS would be a great one, even Audacity possibly, but that's not going to happen.

41:29.000 --> 41:35.000
But something that is recognized in the broader community, because what from the little bit of following of all this NFT stuff that I've done,

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
what I've noticed is it's drawing in a lot of the normals, people who are not like high end extreme geeks.

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
It's definitely got that, too. But normies are coming into this.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
It reaches outside the tech circle more so than I would have expected.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
There's a certain distro that I think might do it, but I'm not going to say it on air just in case.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
I don't want to upset them.

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
Okay, okay. I wonder. I wonder, but I think I know which one you're thinking of.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
You know, I got a couple of grab bag items in here we could cover real quick.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Alex said that he hopes we'll see a made for home assistant certification program launch.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Oh, that'd be neat.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.000
And like I said, he's also predicting the 20 terabyte hard drive for under 250 again.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
He's slotting that one in.

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
When we were going over this, I think the deck was probably the biggest question mark.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
Like, what's the deck impact going to be over 2022?

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Will there be deck OS clones that are, you know, available as a desktop distro?

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
Like, what's that going to be? Will it even ship?

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Will it even ship? Yeah, I suppose that's a question right there.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Yeah, I hope so. That'd be a blunder.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
I feel like it is. Like, that's probably what the delay was about a bit, was getting to something more doable.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
I think they had to reassess. Hopefully now they've got themselves a realistic timeline.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
But, you know, Valve time.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
Wes, did you throw the Ubuntu uses ButterFS by default in 2210 in the grab bag?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Was that yours? No, that wasn't me. That was me.

42:58.000 --> 43:05.000
I was thinking maybe there might be a ButterFS in stream or like some version of one of the clones that sneakily added ButterFS back in maybe.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Oh, man, wouldn't that be nice?

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
Like a set of packages you could install on CentOS stream to get ButterFS support?

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Yeah, yeah. Oh, a boy can dream.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
A boy can dream.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
And I noticed none of us had a specific Asahi Linux prediction.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
I made one in LAN, I think, but we didn't have any in this show about Asahi Linux.

43:23.000 --> 43:29.000
I thought you'd be all over that, Chris, since you've been following it so closely, but seems you went a little further out.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
It's so hard to know, right? It's so hard to know.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
You don't want to tempt fate, right?

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
Right. And like we were talking about earlier, that stuff is, that last 10% is really, really tricky.

43:38.000 --> 43:47.000
I thought about a stretch of saying maybe, you know, if enough of that stuff gets merged upstream, maybe Arch Linux ARM gets some support.

43:47.000 --> 43:54.000
I didn't have anything specific for Starlink either, although, man, talk about a lifesaver right now.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
It really has been just so great to be able to be.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
I was out here in the woods, did not plan to broadcast, did not plan to stream from here.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
I just got stranded, but I brought it with me and set it up, had to log in, change my service address.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
And then waited about 10, went for a walk, came back in about 15 minutes and it was all online.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
And, you know, I'm getting 100 megabits from the freaking woods. It's great.

44:17.000 --> 44:21.000
And, you know, it's cold out, right? I mean, at night it's down to five degrees Fahrenheit.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
And that thing is actually what I've been doing.

44:24.000 --> 44:30.000
I wasn't sure how well it would do, but at night I've been turning it off to save power because we're in a pretty precarious situation.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
And I just don't have any power to spare. So I turn it off at night using a smart plug and home assistant.

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
And then in the morning I turn it on using the same system and it boots up in about three, five minutes.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
It's connected to the network and the system just switches over from cellular to Starlink.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
And then when I turn it off, it switches back to cellular. So that's worked out pretty good.

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
That's great. Did you get some hero shots of, you know, like, of course, the Starlink shining in its rugged terrain?

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Actually, for our live stream tweet today, if you check my Twitter profile,

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
I have a shot of the Starlink out in the little dishy out in the snow.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
I have a Starlink prediction. You do?

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
Well, I think Starlink might add data caps this year to their subscriptions.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
You shut your dirty mouth. I know. I'm not saying I want it. I'm not saying you want it.

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
I'm just saying they got they got to do that at some point, right? Oh, no, I hope not.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
You know, it has been so great not worrying about that anymore because it's such a pain in the butt on cellular.

45:22.000 --> 45:31.000
I'd pay I'd pay more. You know, they could nickel and dime me. I think it would be relatively high, but like unlimited unlimited just seems impossible.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
Yeah, especially when when you run out of bandwidth, your solution is like more ground stations and more satellites.

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
So it's not it's not like when you're when that's what you got to do, that does take a lot of resources.

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
You just got to think of it as funding Starship. That's what you're doing.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
Yeah. Funding Elon's personal Mars Society is probably what we're doing.

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
OK. All right. Well, I'm feeling pretty good about these, you guys. This is a good range.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
Anybody have anything that we wanted to get in that we missed before we wrap it all up?

46:00.000 --> 46:09.000
It's a pretty good line up here. I feel like most of these have a pretty good shot compared to last year's batch, which were pretty bad.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
So we've got the orange one in the chat room and he has a prediction that I really hope happens.

46:14.000 --> 46:20.000
You want to read it for us, Brent? Yeah. The prediction is in 2022, we see native Wayland support for Zoom.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.000
Yes. Yes. It's about damn time. It really would be.

46:25.000 --> 46:32.000
And two bit has a prediction that due to supply chain issues, more electronic manufacturers will look to making their devices more repairable.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Another good year for right to repair would be nice to see.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
Twenty twenty one was I feel like the best year for right to repair we've seen in a decade.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
So it'd be great to see that trend continue. Let's keep that momentum going.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Yeah, here's hoping. Amen. From West's lips to the universe's ears, I say.

46:48.000 --> 46:54.000
All right. Well, we got them all in here. I think we're going to start wrapping it up so that way I can hopefully escape the woods.

46:54.000 --> 47:03.000
But remember, Linux Unplugged now is moving to Sundays at we're going to start around 12, 12, 30 Pacific at JBLive.TV.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
So join us over there. We usually get the stream started a little early and then, you know, the show gets going.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
Sometimes we're a little slow, but we we aim for just that we're going to aim for for every Sunday.

47:13.000 --> 47:18.000
And we'd love to have you hang out in our Mumble room. You can get information at that at Linux Unplugged dot com slash Mumble.

47:18.000 --> 47:23.000
We also really appreciate your feedback. It's a great resource for the show for ideas and discussions.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
You can send that in at Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

47:27.000 --> 47:33.000
And if you're not going to be able to join us on Sundays anymore, if you've only been alive Tuesday listener, thank you so much for for joining us live when you could.

47:33.000 --> 47:40.000
And for most of you downloading, which is the vast majority, what this is going to mean is you're probably just going to get the show a day earlier.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
You know, you're going to get one maybe maybe even a little earlier than that.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
That's going to be the major change for the most people listening is the show will just come in a little bit earlier.

47:48.000 --> 47:59.000
So and hopefully we'll be on Sundays, we'll be always having a hoot and hollering good time because it's the weekend and not the middle of the work week and the middle of one of the busiest work days for me is Tuesday for whatever reason.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Less stress, more fun. Linux Unplugged 2022. Lock that in.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
I say, Wes, thank you, everyone, for joining us.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Links to nothing really, because we didn't talk about much, but user Linux Unplugged dot com.

48:10.000 --> 48:39.000
And for one last time, thank you so much for joining us on a Tuesday and we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

48:40.000 --> 48:48.000
You.
