00:00.000 --> 00:07.900
This round of applause is dedicated to one and only Carl George right there. Mr. Carl,

00:07.900 --> 00:13.480
I have to thank you. I don't think I've eaten better this year. I ate so well while I was

00:13.480 --> 00:14.880
visiting Texas Cyber Summit.

00:14.880 --> 00:15.880
Incredible.

00:15.880 --> 00:16.880
Right?

00:16.880 --> 00:17.880
Yeah.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.880
You were very welcome, sir.

00:18.880 --> 00:19.880
Highlight of the trip.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.920
Yeah. Thank you very much, Carl. Also, thank you for driving us around.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.720
You created a lasting good impression of San Antonio, I've got to say. I mean, I want

00:28.720 --> 00:29.720
to go back.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.720
I agree.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.520
I like food a lot, and driving is just kind of a way of life in Texas. Everything's so

00:34.520 --> 00:35.520
spread out.

00:35.520 --> 00:39.920
We are so, so thankful, though, because we travel to these places that we have never

00:39.920 --> 00:42.360
been before. That was my first time in San Antonio.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.360
Same.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.200
Jesus, I'm sure you've been in San Antonio plenty of times.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.920
Yeah, as a kid, but not as of recent, so.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.000
So you wouldn't necessarily know all the great spots.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
No.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.480
Yeah. And you go there, you don't know where you're at, you have no way of getting around.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.680
Especially in a big place like Texas, right?

00:58.680 --> 01:03.640
And thankfully we do these shows, and so we have listeners in those areas, and they sort

01:03.640 --> 01:10.000
of are our tour guides in a way. It's so awesome. And the great thing about Carl is if he suggests

01:10.000 --> 01:11.680
we go to a place, we don't even debate.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.680
No, no question.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.400
Which, in a group of people, Carl, you've seen this, in a large group of people, right?

01:17.400 --> 01:20.560
You could spend like a half hour trying to figure out where to go eat.

01:20.560 --> 01:23.520
And you end up with something not so great.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.840
Oh man, we ate so good.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.840
My main concern was, I just didn't want y'all to come to town, and then just go, you know,

01:29.840 --> 01:33.240
walk around the Riverwalk, and then get back home and say, yeah, well, San Antonio was

01:33.240 --> 01:35.360
fine. I wanted y'all to have a better experience than that.

01:35.360 --> 01:41.960
No, and you have that local experience, so you know that hole in the wall. Well, except

01:41.960 --> 01:46.200
for in San Antonio, it's more like that hole outside that has outside seating, but great

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
food.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.320
Right, like the carnitas place that had one menu item.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.840
Yeah, when the guy asked if what else was on the menu, and the lady just looked at him

01:52.840 --> 02:05.320
like, uh, there is no other item on the menu.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.080
Hello friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 323. I'm Chris.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.080
I'm Wes.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.080
323?

02:12.080 --> 02:13.080
Nicely done.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.080
Is that even a thing anymore?

02:14.080 --> 02:15.080
It is now.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.120
You've been here since episode 100, so nicely done to you too.

02:18.120 --> 02:24.000
Well, Mr. Payne, we have a great show. We're going to have our first look at Ubuntu 19.10,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.920
which is likely releasing just as a, well, maybe when you listen, it kind of depends

02:28.920 --> 02:33.600
on your schedule, but just about as you listen to this, Ubuntu 19.10 is releasing. We've

02:33.600 --> 02:39.720
got some big community news, including a new KDE Plasma, and even more changes for Gnome

02:39.720 --> 02:47.820
Shell, which, oh boy, it just got a new Gnome Shell, yeah, it's wild. Plus, not just myself,

02:47.820 --> 02:53.480
not just Wes, but Mr. Cheese and Mr. Drew are here to give you their takes on 19.10.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.480
Hello gentlemen.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.480
Hello.

02:55.480 --> 03:01.080
Hi. Nice to have you here. We all ended up trying out 19.10 for various reasons and all

03:01.080 --> 03:04.680
walked away with different notes, so I think this is going to be a really good one. And

03:04.680 --> 03:08.200
of course, we've got our virtual lug. Hello there, Mumble Room.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.200
Hello.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.200
Hello.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.200
Hello.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
Oh, hi.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
Oh, hi.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.200
Howdy.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
Hey there.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
Look at that, a healthy showing.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room. Good to have you here. So let's start

03:17.800 --> 03:22.000
out with the community news this week, because we're going to be talking a lot in Gnome Shell

03:22.000 --> 03:26.360
and MatÃ© later today, so I thought we'd kick things off with some Plasma news. Version

03:26.360 --> 03:33.440
5.17 is out today as we record. The big thing here for me is I'm all about, I like that

03:33.440 --> 03:37.400
color grading, and Night Color is built in. It's a color grading system that helps your

03:37.400 --> 03:43.800
eyes relax as the sun sets, as they put it, and it is now in X11. It also recognizes when

03:43.800 --> 03:45.160
you're giving a presentation.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.320
I love that.

03:46.320 --> 03:52.680
It turns on D&D on that screen. That is straight up brilliant. That's next level D&D.

03:52.680 --> 03:56.000
I mean, if you're like me, you have friends who send you embarrassing messages right when

03:56.000 --> 03:57.720
they know you're giving a presentation.

03:57.720 --> 04:02.200
That's actually a great prank. That is really great. But also, just sort of as a meta feature

04:02.200 --> 04:07.400
for 5.17, things are thriftier than ever with Plasma.

04:07.400 --> 04:12.760
Oh, yeah. It starts so fast. I'm actually running 5.17 right now. I updated it before

04:12.760 --> 04:18.360
doing the show. Pleased to say my Neon install is doing just great, honestly. They finally

04:18.360 --> 04:22.840
ditched Bash for some of the scripts that run as you're starting up Plasma, right? So

04:22.840 --> 04:27.120
you get past the login screen, you've entered your password, you have work to get done.

04:27.120 --> 04:31.360
Before it was totally synchronous. It runs Bash, it waits for the script to complete,

04:31.360 --> 04:32.360
and then you get a desktop.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.080
I mean, I love Bash, but it's not the fastest thing on the planet.

04:35.080 --> 04:39.880
So now they've rewritten it in C++, and it's totally asynchronous. So login can just start

04:39.880 --> 04:43.000
right once you're authenticated.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.160
That's nice. That is very nice. As well as many, many, many, many other features that

04:49.160 --> 04:55.440
are in Plasma, including some system settings, improvements for Thunderbolt support. In fact,

04:55.440 --> 04:57.720
overall, there's just been general improvements to system settings.

04:57.720 --> 05:02.000
Oh, yeah. Tons of improvements to system settings. And there's more stuff for like ksysguard,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.040
which can talk about cgroup limits, which you probably have if you're running a whole

05:05.040 --> 05:07.800
bunch of containers or doing fancy system D stuff.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.600
Yeah, I also like that they put some stuff in there for visualization of the NVIDIA GPU

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
stats.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
Sexy.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.600
That's really nice for Ubuntu users, since the NVIDIA binary driver is now on the ISO.

05:19.600 --> 05:29.000
But one of the main new features of Plasma 5.17 display manager kwin is fractional scaling

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
on Wayland.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.040
That's a fancy term. What does it mean? Well, it means you can scale your desktop to suit

05:34.040 --> 05:38.840
your high DPI monitor perfectly, right? You might not need like, a two time scaling that

05:38.840 --> 05:43.400
might be too much. You can dial it down now with fractional support. So you won't have

05:43.400 --> 05:47.300
tiny or gigantic fonts and icons on those 4k screens.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.000
I like it on a 4k screen because I can get a little more real estate without having to

05:51.000 --> 05:52.480
be too tiny.

05:52.480 --> 05:57.040
And also, I mean, kwin's Wayland support has come a long way, right? I mean, we've been

05:57.040 --> 06:01.320
covering it on this show for years. This was one feature that it's kind of it's kind of

06:01.320 --> 06:05.120
been missing. It's been a standout missing feature that's finally corrected.

06:05.120 --> 06:11.120
Yeah. Also, something that's coming back. If you're an old desktop KDE user and you

06:11.120 --> 06:17.760
miss the ability to close windows with the middle click, it's back, baby. It's back.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.560
Is that just going to confuse some people?

06:19.560 --> 06:23.600
Here's why it's nice. It's a great way when you've got a couple of windows up, you can

06:23.600 --> 06:25.840
close a window without changing focus.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.560
I will say three mouse buttons strictly better than two.

06:29.560 --> 06:34.520
Way better, right? Who doesn't want three mouse buttons? What am I in the 80s? Also,

06:34.520 --> 06:40.340
here's a funny one. You can now on X 11, which wasn't really super easy before, properly

06:40.340 --> 06:44.820
map the super key, you know, the little windows can. Yeah, that must have taken some work

06:44.820 --> 06:48.720
in the back end, you know, deep engineering, I think on that one.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.640
It did take some work in the back end. Having done that in Marte over like 18 months. It's

06:53.640 --> 06:54.640
hard work that

06:54.640 --> 06:59.520
What is it? What is it that's so dang hard? Because it has been a very top requested feature

06:59.520 --> 07:00.520
of plasma desktop.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.720
I mean, is it just that X is old and broken?

07:02.720 --> 07:09.840
No, it's it's the fact that anything could have a key bound to super. So when that gets

07:09.840 --> 07:15.920
picked up, you need to pass that event along all through the chain of windows so that any

07:15.920 --> 07:21.680
window that's got that in their key bindings can respond when they have focus and it has

07:21.680 --> 07:23.880
to touch lots and lots of parts of the system.

07:23.880 --> 07:32.760
Yeah. All right. So I've waffled on this last item here. But let's talk about it. Discover

07:32.760 --> 07:36.560
plasma software manager lets you install, remove and update applications. It's been

07:36.560 --> 07:41.320
improved in this release. It includes better progress bars for the first time. And different

07:41.320 --> 07:47.000
like UI feedback indicators that tell you it's working. And they've added icons to properly

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
demonstrate snap applications to help to help you get just some more information. And they've

07:52.000 --> 07:56.800
helped with better feedback on connection issues. However, maybe we'll get to this in

07:56.800 --> 08:01.680
a little bit. But having gone through a few different desktop environments in the last

08:01.680 --> 08:07.680
couple of days to try out 1910 boy does discover feel like the absolute least favorite part

08:07.680 --> 08:13.400
of the worst. And I hate to say that about free software that people are working really

08:13.400 --> 08:14.400
hard on.

08:14.400 --> 08:19.000
It's not that it's necessarily terrible. It is usable. I do use it from time to time.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.720
It's just that the competition has gotten a lot better, frankly. Yeah, I don't I don't

08:22.720 --> 08:27.640
know what the solution here is, because they have diligently worked to make this better

08:27.640 --> 08:35.000
for a while. And it still seems like it's behind everything else. And I don't know what

08:35.000 --> 08:39.520
would be better. And I obviously couldn't write something better myself. But boy, does

08:39.520 --> 08:45.080
it feel like the weaker spot of the desktop right now. But it is nice to see some of these

08:45.080 --> 08:48.520
improvements, some of these informational feedback things will go a long way and at

08:48.520 --> 08:52.560
least making it much, much, much more usable than it has in the past. So they do seem to

08:52.560 --> 08:56.480
be taking in the right direction. Yeah, I mean, continue to work is always appreciated.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.520
You do wonder though, it's like, well, when you just start over, yeah, need to figure

09:00.520 --> 09:04.720
out quite what's wrong with the core there. Well, speaking of core core boot is coming

09:04.720 --> 09:10.540
to Comet Lake chips on system 76 laptops, at least two of them, the new 14 inch galgo

09:10.540 --> 09:17.120
pro and the new 15.6 inch starter pro laptops will ship with core boot firmware, rather

09:17.120 --> 09:22.560
than a proprietary BIOS. Now, as you probably know, and has been pointed out by Mr. Michael

09:22.560 --> 09:28.040
liable over at for Onyx, these laptops still have Intel proprietary blobs because of course

09:28.040 --> 09:32.960
they do. So it's probably best to think of them as more open than most laptops rather

09:32.960 --> 09:37.760
than being completely open. Yeah, yeah. But still, system 76 is just one of a handful

09:37.760 --> 09:43.680
of PC vendors shipping computers with core boot. purism comes to mind as another but

09:43.680 --> 09:49.360
frankly, system 76 has more compelling and more options for laptops. Yeah, honestly,

09:49.360 --> 09:53.200
this is great to see. I mean, I've I've played with core boot a little and for me the biggest

09:53.200 --> 09:57.200
the biggest blockers, but I just didn't have hardware that was, you know, supported by

09:57.200 --> 10:00.680
it. I think it's a great option. And we need people in this space working on it keeping

10:00.680 --> 10:06.160
it modern. I think it lost a lot of momentum after you know, EFI support sort of went mainstream.

10:06.160 --> 10:10.680
If system 76 can keep things working nicely on modern hardware, that should help everyone.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.640
I just thought of this now. I should have thought of it before the show. If anyone at

10:14.640 --> 10:20.800
system 76 wants to let me know, is this guaranteed to now be a thing for all future galgos and

10:20.800 --> 10:25.480
darters? Like will all future darters and galgos just guaranteed have this or is this

10:25.480 --> 10:30.880
just this current line? What do you think of this wimpy? Well, I think it's a great

10:30.880 --> 10:37.000
step towards you know, freeing firmware in computers from proprietary bits and pieces

10:37.000 --> 10:44.200
that we can't really know what they're poking around at. And coincidentally, while I was

10:44.200 --> 10:50.320
at ubu con last week, I was reacquainted with an organization that I've worked with in the

10:50.320 --> 10:59.560
past who are also doing some interesting things with core boot. That's a tease. All right.

10:59.560 --> 11:08.600
There's this outfit in Portugal called LibreTrend. Wimpy. You're such a tease sometimes. I know.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.860
And we did some work with them having Ubuntu Mate pre-installed on one of their devices

11:13.860 --> 11:22.720
few years ago, which was a core boot device. And it was like a NUC equivalent type device.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.640
Anyway, they sort of went dark for a couple of years and they went away back to the drawing

11:27.640 --> 11:35.720
board and they've come back last year with a new desktop machine, which kind of looks

11:35.720 --> 11:42.820
like a Mac Mini. And that is a fully core boot enabled device. And they're very proud

11:42.820 --> 11:49.080
of that. But more importantly, they're doing work with the LVFS project to deliver core

11:49.080 --> 11:58.160
boot firmware updates via LVFS. So that is coming soon. And they also have two laptops,

11:58.160 --> 12:04.840
the Wildebeest and the Wildebeest Pro, neither of which are core boot at the moment. But

12:04.840 --> 12:09.720
what they're doing is they're gauging interest in those two devices to see which of the strongest

12:09.720 --> 12:16.780
sellers in order to determine which device they invest the time and effort into getting

12:16.780 --> 12:23.800
core boot on. And again, this LVFS work. So they spent about two years doing the engineering

12:23.800 --> 12:30.560
upfront for this LibreTrend LibreBox, they call it, which was fully engineered from the

12:30.560 --> 12:38.040
very beginning to be core boot. And it's also got TPM2 modules for full disk encryption

12:38.040 --> 12:43.760
and stuff like that, all in hardware. But for the laptops, they've decided they can't

12:43.760 --> 12:48.680
afford that kind of investment each time they do a device. So they're testing the waters

12:48.680 --> 12:52.960
as to which is the more popular unit in order to determine where they put the engineering

12:52.960 --> 12:53.960
effort in.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.400
What do you suppose the long term benefit for the user is?

12:57.400 --> 13:03.240
There's a growing trend, isn't there, to sort of create these devices that do have unencumbered

13:03.240 --> 13:11.280
firmware. And there's clearly a large enough niche of users that desire that to support

13:11.280 --> 13:16.560
the, well, first of all, the R&D and the expense of working on this. But there's several companies

13:16.560 --> 13:21.520
around the world doing this now. So I think they're really looking out for that niche

13:21.520 --> 13:24.880
of users that really cares about their privacy.

13:24.880 --> 13:29.760
What a thing. We're becoming a market that actually needs to be addressed. What a hell

13:29.760 --> 13:30.760
of a thing.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.760
That's a nice feeling.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.360
It really is. Gnome Shell's getting better. And we're going to talk a lot about Gnome

13:35.360 --> 13:41.600
Shell, or Gnome Shell as I call it, in a little bit. But what you're about to get on your

13:41.600 --> 13:46.600
latest version of your favorite distro is already out of date. But don't worry, it's

13:46.600 --> 13:47.600
mostly fixes.

13:47.600 --> 13:54.980
Yeah, Gnome Shell 3.34.1 is heavy on those fixes. I mean, you've got stuff like allowing

13:54.980 --> 13:59.840
the editing of app folder names, making menu animations more consistent, improving performance

13:59.840 --> 14:04.880
when enabling and disabling extensions, which, hey, I sometimes have to do that, fixing screen

14:04.880 --> 14:10.360
dimming on idle, crash fixes, and a variety of animation fixes, which all that doesn't

14:10.360 --> 14:12.880
sound like a lot, but I think it adds up to something noticeable.

14:12.880 --> 14:18.520
Yeah. Plus, there's also code for Wayland full screen compositing bypass, which is a

14:18.520 --> 14:24.040
big deal for full screen video and games. But the other thing to watch with these future

14:24.040 --> 14:29.880
gnome developments, sorry, Gnome developments is what happens with Mutter.

14:29.880 --> 14:34.940
Oh, yeah. Okay, so they've got some fixes for Java applications, which I know, I know,

14:34.940 --> 14:40.720
but it's still nice to have. Plus fixing the startup of X11 session services on Wayland,

14:40.720 --> 14:46.000
better screenshot and window animation support when scaled, optimizing the booting of untransformed

14:46.000 --> 14:51.700
off screen stage views, various other scaling fixes, and fixing the num lock state for the

14:51.700 --> 14:56.940
native backend. Plus a whole bunch of crash fixes, which, hey, as someone who's complained

14:56.940 --> 15:00.960
about that before, it's really nice to see.

15:00.960 --> 15:05.760
Yeah. It does feel like each release is a big deal.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.440
Yeah. And I think that's what matters here is this is a point release with a lot of usability

15:09.440 --> 15:13.840
and just like, day of, you know, everyday use improvements. And you don't have to wait

15:13.840 --> 15:16.440
for something like gnome 3.36 coming in March.

15:16.440 --> 15:22.400
Yeah, right. Or four or whatever. It really feels like a remarkably different time than

15:22.400 --> 15:26.360
when canonical announced that they were ditching unity seven, doesn't it wimpy?

15:26.360 --> 15:30.480
Yeah, I suppose so. I mean, it's sort of really growing with momentum now. I mean, it's, you

15:30.480 --> 15:36.520
know, it's got all of the mainstream distros shipping it as the default desktop experience

15:36.520 --> 15:37.520
now.

15:37.520 --> 15:43.080
Right. I mean, hearken back to that era. I was one of the individuals that was pretty

15:43.080 --> 15:49.080
outspokenly concerned about performance and stability issues. I don't know if you noticed.

15:49.080 --> 15:53.480
And we switched out our whole studio off of gnome shell because of it. I don't feel like

15:53.480 --> 15:54.640
that would be an issue today.

15:54.640 --> 15:58.920
Yeah, well, hopefully not. I mean, you know, there's a lot of people that have put a considerable

15:58.920 --> 16:05.440
amount of effort into improving that situation. And in fact, as we talk, there is a gnome

16:05.440 --> 16:11.360
hack fest taking place in the Netherlands this week. And there are two members of the

16:11.360 --> 16:18.080
Ubuntu desktop team, Marco and Seb, who are both present there working on, you know, crushing

16:18.080 --> 16:24.620
precisely these kinds of issues. I know that closing the gap between x11 and Wayland is

16:24.620 --> 16:26.920
one of the objectives of this week's hack fest.

16:26.920 --> 16:31.060
Oh, that's great. It really seems like there's been enough back end work done in the past

16:31.060 --> 16:35.040
few years that now some momentum can actually happen. Right. And some of the user facing

16:35.040 --> 16:37.680
features things that we notice, well, those are improving.

16:37.680 --> 16:44.600
I think very much so. We'll get to it here in the review in a moment. But I was really

16:44.600 --> 16:50.280
worried we weren't going to be able to even begin to solve the gnome shell problems that

16:50.280 --> 16:51.280
we had.

16:51.280 --> 16:55.280
We had an episode here where we debated, like, is this whole thing junk? Should we even continue

16:55.280 --> 16:56.280
to building on it?

16:56.280 --> 17:00.280
Well, I had a real crisis of faith because here's all these top distributions shipping

17:00.280 --> 17:07.020
it as the default shell, and it just didn't meet my my muster. Like, too slow, too many

17:07.020 --> 17:09.600
different issues, crashes all the time.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.640
Takes down my whole environment.

17:11.640 --> 17:18.080
Right. And I was extremely worried that so many of the problems were fundamentally at

17:18.080 --> 17:23.460
the core of gnome shell that they were not solvable. But really smart people have looked

17:23.460 --> 17:30.480
at this and they've been solving a lot of problems. And it really has become a example

17:30.480 --> 17:34.680
of how different companies with different goals and different priorities can come together

17:34.680 --> 17:39.120
and improve a common piece of free software. It's a pretty good example. It's not perfect

17:39.120 --> 17:43.440
yet. It's not all solved yet. But it has it has become

17:43.440 --> 17:48.240
we have a fantastic desktop environment as a result, right? Much more, much more better,

17:48.240 --> 17:51.480
much more improved, much more usable, much, much faster. All of the bunches you can really

17:51.480 --> 17:55.680
give it. So I think it's really kind of time we kind of get into some of that because he

17:55.680 --> 17:59.720
can't really keep talking about some of these without getting into the review itself. Before

17:59.720 --> 18:07.320
we do that, we should probably do a little housekeeping because there's recently been

18:07.320 --> 18:11.240
a batch of brunches. Oh, my. So many. A batch of brunches, Wes.

18:11.240 --> 18:14.840
A batch. Maybe batches. I don't know. So for those of you that are not familiar

18:14.840 --> 18:19.480
with this phenomenon, Brent here, who joins us on the mumble. Hello, Brent.

18:19.480 --> 18:23.860
Oh, hey. Hey, there. Turns out great interviewer. And he really

18:23.860 --> 18:27.600
gets down. You know, I think he does this thing called listening. It's it's new. You've

18:27.600 --> 18:34.160
never tried it. Wow. Wow. Cuts deep. See, I listen to that. And Brent just is. He's

18:34.160 --> 18:38.480
a great conversationalist. And so we created this concept Brunch with Brent with Brent

18:38.480 --> 18:43.000
because he also, by the way, makes great brunch. He sits down with somebody and he has a conversation

18:43.000 --> 18:52.080
and it just is great podcasting. And so recently, a batch of brunches has been released, including

18:52.080 --> 19:01.160
a chat with Angela Fisher and Alan Jude. Both. You got to go check out extras dot show.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.920
You know, I guess one really neat thing to say about the chat with Alan is that you were

19:04.920 --> 19:09.880
able to visit him in person. Did you go to his house? Yeah, I happened to be about an

19:09.880 --> 19:17.160
hour away. Alan lives in the same province as I do. So he's near Toronto. And I got to

19:17.160 --> 19:21.080
I basically said, Hey, Alan, I'm I'm near you. Is there any way I can come crash your

19:21.080 --> 19:25.560
place? And he said, Yeah, yeah, come by. It happened to work out perfectly. It was his

19:25.560 --> 19:30.160
normal podcasting day, but they had recorded some in advance. So he had the whole day off.

19:30.160 --> 19:34.480
So he and I just kind of hung out for a long time and had a great conversation. And I think

19:34.480 --> 19:39.760
that just got released today. So it's a great chat. I listen back and it was a lot of fun

19:39.760 --> 19:43.680
listening back. So I think everybody's gonna enjoy it. What I've just learned is be careful

19:43.680 --> 19:48.920
letting Brent stay at your house. He will interview you as someone who has been interviewed.

19:48.920 --> 19:53.040
You end up telling Brent things you didn't expect. That's right. There's a brunch with

19:53.040 --> 19:58.360
Wes, a brunch with cheese. I believe you're on the docket sometime, huh? Perhaps I'm coming

19:58.360 --> 20:03.000
for you. Yeah, I wanted our brunch to be in person, though. You know, you're just hungry.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.660
I felt like first of all, I did want to eat. And second of all, I felt like if I'm going

20:07.660 --> 20:12.640
to expose all, it needs to be in person. So extras dot shows where you catch that we also

20:12.640 --> 20:19.780
just released a reverse proxy basics, and we have a container basics coming out. Alex

20:19.780 --> 20:25.960
and I sit down with Wes on the reverse proxy basics, talk about nginx traffic, or traffic

20:25.960 --> 20:31.240
as they like to call it. And then in the next one, we get down into the dirties of containers.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.000
Oh, there's a lot of good detail there. And I talked a little bit more about my setup

20:35.000 --> 20:39.960
and my kind of realization that it's more than just hype. There's a practical like even

20:39.960 --> 20:43.920
if you're an old school sys admin, there's a real practical angle to using this technology.

20:43.920 --> 20:49.520
Yeah, right. I mean, Alex is working with containers every day. So good advice. There's

20:49.520 --> 20:53.840
other shows we haven't even talked about yet that are on extras dot show like office hours

20:53.840 --> 21:00.560
with Chris operation safe escape with Wes L and a guest production meetings chats with

21:00.560 --> 21:05.380
people from Linux Academy. And we're going to also do a summary of our visit to Texas

21:05.380 --> 21:10.480
cyber summit extras dot show slash subscribe. Just grab that. Yeah, you know, it's a place

21:10.480 --> 21:13.840
where can do a little experimentation. Yeah, if you like what we're doing, you want to

21:13.840 --> 21:20.780
see things we're trying follow extras, a batch of brunches and more at extras dot show. Also

21:20.780 --> 21:25.560
now up on the Linux Academy community section. That's a free section of the Linux Academy

21:25.560 --> 21:31.400
platform where you can sign up without subscribing. We've released a new batch of courses L's

21:31.400 --> 21:36.120
in charge of this and she has some great ones cloud formation, deep dive, database administration

21:36.120 --> 21:41.960
and SQL language basics. And that's never getting old. I mean, you gotta you gotta learn

21:41.960 --> 21:48.920
to Google Cloud functions, helm deep dive, and the one that I'm going to be taking the

21:48.920 --> 21:56.840
ansible playbook deep dive. Finally. Wow. It's a little aggressive, Wes. I'm right here.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.540
Check those out. We'll have a link in the show notes. You can sign up without having

21:59.540 --> 22:04.560
to pay and get access to all that stuff. And L's always curating that releasing new stuff

22:04.560 --> 22:09.600
over there. So check that out. And extras dot show. Wow. That's a lot of stuff. Are

22:09.600 --> 22:14.280
we good? You good, Wes? You go with? Oh, yeah. Can I? Can I move up? Please do. Okay. All

22:14.280 --> 22:19.520
right. Again, kind of aggressive. You know, I don't think we mentioned to the chat room

22:19.520 --> 22:22.920
that they should be bang suggesting as we go along. Yeah, well, it sounds like J. Bob

22:22.920 --> 22:28.000
might be having some issues. Oh, really? Well, that's what chat room. Thanks. Thanks. I don't

22:28.000 --> 22:31.560
know. I haven't. I did some just suggesting earlier. We got to move that J. But so that

22:31.560 --> 22:38.400
J. But is Yeah, no, it's down. Yeah. Well, yeah, we're getting a bad gateway. Oh, start

22:38.400 --> 22:42.920
up the West bot. What do you think? memory? It does do that. Yeah. I mean, how much memories

22:42.920 --> 22:48.760
on that box? Yeah, like eight gigs. So you know, it's on the RAM for that for that J.

22:48.760 --> 22:53.680
But Dang it. It happens. I think what we're gonna do is we're gonna I mean, not to be

22:53.680 --> 22:57.040
that guy, but I think we're gonna containerize it. And then we're just gonna put it on a

22:57.040 --> 23:04.600
supported system. Because that's on an arch box from like 2013. So it's insane. We really

23:04.600 --> 23:09.120
should probably move on. And it kind of works sometimes. Yeah, I mean, you just got to go

23:09.120 --> 23:13.360
in there and then restart it and then get in the console and then get the TCP IP stack

23:13.360 --> 23:17.460
back online and then get the thing all running again and then get its custom web server up

23:17.460 --> 23:21.560
and go. And then once you've done all of that, and you've forwarded the DNS, you're good

23:21.560 --> 23:28.080
to go. So I don't know, you know, we're probably gonna have to make some changes. That's I

23:28.080 --> 23:32.920
mean, it's only perfect that we talk about this though, because 1910 is it's kind of

23:32.920 --> 23:37.280
like one of those releases that you're not going to want to install on a system like

23:37.280 --> 23:42.000
JBOD because you want that running for years. This is this is not the long term support

23:42.000 --> 23:46.640
version of Ubuntu. Right? It's a it's a place to try out new things and maybe preview some

23:46.640 --> 23:50.440
of the features you will enjoy in a long term support in the future. Right. So how do you

23:50.440 --> 23:55.160
say the name the code name? Eon? I don't know. Eon? Yeah, let's go with that. How we doing

23:55.160 --> 24:01.680
wimpy? Is it Eon? You pronounce it 1910. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Actually, yes. Confirmed.

24:01.680 --> 24:06.440
We did try to look it up. Right? I mean, you wouldn't try to define what it is. Did you

24:06.440 --> 24:10.280
Yeah, I thought maybe we should have some definitions. I'd like to know. Yeah. Yeah,

24:10.280 --> 24:14.600
I know. I've been really appreciating. It's just it's a silly thing. But Popeye's been

24:14.600 --> 24:20.040
doing these live streams. Oh, they're great. And so I learned a little insights recently.

24:20.040 --> 24:26.160
You see, the they canonical referred to it as the code name during the development cycle

24:26.160 --> 24:30.560
West, but as it nears release, one of the final changes is switching over to 19.10.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.080
That sounds small, but it's probably a big deal. And then once it's released, it's referred

24:34.080 --> 24:39.920
to as 1910. So get it right. Well, it's not out yet. No. Although if you think by the

24:39.920 --> 24:44.880
time people listen to this, it probably is so don't screw him up. Right. But we I mean,

24:44.880 --> 24:48.520
this is kind of our first look, right? Because it hasn't been officially released. We've

24:48.520 --> 24:51.860
been playing with it though. And really, the whole crew has I think our intention is to

24:51.860 --> 24:57.840
continue to run it for the rest of this week, and then give you a report on some extended

24:57.840 --> 25:02.920
experience with some specific things next week. But we did want to give it a first look

25:02.920 --> 25:07.200
this week because we have been running it. Even on our trip to Texas Cyber Summit, West

25:07.200 --> 25:14.280
got Ubuntu Monte installed on his ThinkPad T480. And I have been running the main line

25:14.280 --> 25:19.680
Ubuntu with GNOME Shell on my system. Mr. Bacon, what have you been running?

25:19.680 --> 25:24.720
I was running the beta for a couple of days and then switched over to the latest daily

25:24.720 --> 25:25.720
of Monte.

25:25.720 --> 25:30.800
Ah, okay. And then Mr. Drew, are you on GNOME Shell? Are you on what? What desktop?

25:30.800 --> 25:36.120
I started on the official Ubuntu desktop, which is, you know, they're rebranded GNOME

25:36.120 --> 25:43.280
Shell. But then I switched over to the more bland GNOME session, just because, you know,

25:43.280 --> 25:44.280
more comfortable there.

25:44.280 --> 25:49.220
You're a Fedora guy. I know. Okay. But all right. So mainline. All right, very good.

25:49.220 --> 25:55.340
So these are a collection of experiences. I'm going to try to sneak in some other flavors

25:55.340 --> 26:00.580
over the next week and give you a more comprehensive review in the following episode, as well as

26:00.580 --> 26:06.320
some performance testing and other things with the whole ZFS stack. But as far as our

26:06.320 --> 26:10.520
first looks go, I thought, let's talk about some of the headline features. So we'll get

26:10.520 --> 26:16.000
to GNOME Shell here in a moment, because it's really, it really, really shines in this release.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.120
But I think the one that's going to get a lot of news attention is the ZFS support.

26:22.120 --> 26:29.120
In this version of Ubuntu 19.10, ZFS version 0.8.1 is shipping with features like native

26:29.120 --> 26:34.480
encryption, trimming support, checkpoints, raw encrypted ZFS transmissions, project accounting

26:34.480 --> 26:42.060
and quota, and some back ports from 8.2 that did rocks, and I assume others determined

26:42.060 --> 26:51.640
were appropriate. So we have a pretty solid ZFS implementation. But on top of that, there's

26:51.640 --> 26:57.200
a lot of work that went into making the rest of the stack ZFS ready. What I'm thinking

26:57.200 --> 27:00.280
of Wes is things like grub.

27:00.280 --> 27:05.920
Oh, yeah, right. So there's this project called ZSYS. And the goal really is to make a lot

27:05.920 --> 27:11.520
of the ZFS advanced in basic concepts easily accessible and transparent to anyone because

27:11.520 --> 27:15.040
maybe you're a sys admin, and you're familiar with ZFS, you're like, Oh, yeah, I mean, it

27:15.040 --> 27:20.360
makes sense for my big, my big pool of information, but you have the time and need to go study

27:20.360 --> 27:24.860
up, review, understand how the system works. ZFS still has a number of great features.

27:24.860 --> 27:29.200
If the software between the user and the system can help the user take advantage of those

27:29.200 --> 27:35.320
right stuff like automated snapshots, rollbacks, offline instant updates, easy backup support

27:35.320 --> 27:41.880
with ZFS replication, right? I mean, come on, those are all amazing features. Unfortunately,

27:41.880 --> 27:46.160
desktop Linux hasn't really integrated those. Yeah, I mean, because this is an awkward spot,

27:46.160 --> 27:51.420
right? Unless you're running the latest Ubuntu, they're all there, but nothing's really fully

27:51.420 --> 27:56.920
incorporating them. Yeah. So that's why Canonical has been developing a new user space demon

27:56.920 --> 28:01.320
called ZSYS. And it's going to cooperate with things like grub and it's got some patches

28:01.320 --> 28:05.680
and better support for grub. And it's also going to interact with the standard ZFS tooling

28:05.680 --> 28:09.840
to sort of smooth all the little gaps and make sure all those advanced features can

28:09.840 --> 28:14.400
actually be enabled. And it's not necessarily grub dependent. However, this does mean that

28:14.400 --> 28:19.740
they're shipping now a patched version of grub that lets you boot right on ZFS on root,

28:19.740 --> 28:23.960
as well as support other functions. Yeah, I mean, well, as long as the installer gets

28:23.960 --> 28:27.860
the system ready, you've been playing with it, Chris. Yeah. So this obviously was the

28:27.860 --> 28:32.600
thing we wanted to really try because this is a bigger commitment than just including

28:32.600 --> 28:38.680
ZFS in the main installation. There is software that's being patched. There's this ZSYS layer

28:38.680 --> 28:46.040
here. And there is a lot of thought being put into pre configured data sets, if you

28:46.040 --> 28:50.360
understand what ZFS is a bit. So I thought, well, let's give it a go. Because you've got

28:50.360 --> 28:57.900
two things here. You've got the core ZFS support of Ubuntu 1910. And then you've got the installer

28:57.900 --> 29:05.120
support. These are two separate things. And what's really brand new in 1910 is the installer

29:05.120 --> 29:08.680
support in Ubiquiti. And that's what I really wanted to give that a go. And there's a couple

29:08.680 --> 29:14.100
of limitations you need to be aware about right here right now. Number one, it's automatic

29:14.100 --> 29:19.480
mode only. Number two, it's going to take over the entire disk. So everything on that

29:19.480 --> 29:23.980
disk is going to be rewritten. Yeah, you can't install with ZFS on an existing installer

29:23.980 --> 29:27.800
next to existing installs. And if you need to make customizations, well, you're going

29:27.800 --> 29:32.740
to have to do that after the install is finished. The custom partitioner does not support ZFS.

29:32.740 --> 29:37.760
So that is an after install thing. So be aware of that. Number three, and it's not a big

29:37.760 --> 29:42.040
deal. But the installer is going to make it look like it's doing extended for so you just

29:42.040 --> 29:48.240
need to be aware of that too. And that's actually because under the hood, it is using extended

29:48.240 --> 29:53.680
for for some stuff and then moving it over to ZFS later. And so it just requires a lot

29:53.680 --> 29:58.880
of patchwork to Ubiquiti to display it. And it just didn't make it in time for 1910. So

29:58.880 --> 30:03.080
these are the caveats you need to be aware about if you want to use it. I was comfortable

30:03.080 --> 30:07.600
with all of these things. My workstation here at the studio, we talked about this recently,

30:07.600 --> 30:13.160
it's a pretty old install. It started life as neon 1604 ran really great, which was then

30:13.160 --> 30:22.040
upgraded to neon 1804, which is kind of around the point I decided to try out X F C E. And

30:22.040 --> 30:27.280
then I converted it to as Ubuntu 1804 install that also had no show installed. So I could

30:27.280 --> 30:32.500
check things out on Whalen a little bit here and there. And this is gross kind of kind

30:32.500 --> 30:37.980
of began to fall apart. But it was a it was a solid install from like 2016. So I wrote

30:37.980 --> 30:41.940
it as long as I could. I thought it's at a point now where I need to reinstall. I don't

30:41.940 --> 30:47.720
have to, but I need to. And 1910 is here. Let's do this shit. So I wipe out the whole

30:47.720 --> 30:53.520
system after backing everything up. ZFS on route using the big, bold, all caps, experimental

30:53.520 --> 30:59.120
option in the Ubiquiti installer. Hit that next button, rock that install option. And

30:59.120 --> 31:06.960
I get everything installed and my goodness, it is glorious. I mean, it's fast. It's beautiful.

31:06.960 --> 31:12.280
It is the fastest my computer has ever felt. And the software centers packed full of snaps

31:12.280 --> 31:17.360
and other apps ready to go. Slack, Telegram, Chrome, slam it on my system. And I've got

31:17.360 --> 31:24.160
an AMD GPU. So not a single proprietary driver is loaded. I am rocking this thing. Three

31:24.160 --> 31:29.100
screens, two of them vertical. It's good to go. I love this. Oh, what's this, Gary? Oh,

31:29.100 --> 31:33.160
this has really gotten pretty great. Look at this. It picked up my GNOME online account

31:33.160 --> 31:38.440
stuff automatically. Wow, this is such an amazing experience. Well, time to go home.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.720
Shut the computer down, go home, spend the night with the wife and kids, come back to

31:42.720 --> 31:51.020
work in the morning, hit the power button, system fails to boot. Dead. This is when I

31:51.020 --> 31:55.960
realized I was in a bit of a situation. So if I go into grub and I reload the previous

31:55.960 --> 32:01.600
kernel, the one that came on the daily ISO, I could boot pretty good. Couldn't get a home

32:01.600 --> 32:07.600
directory, couldn't get a VAR, but I could get the system up. If I boot on the new kernel,

32:07.600 --> 32:12.360
I could get to a busy box shell and that was it. And that's when I realized that I had

32:12.360 --> 32:16.400
hit a bit of a situation. You really didn't take the experimental thing seriously, did

32:16.400 --> 32:22.400
you? I mean, I was on fire, Wes. I was on fire. And this was a hard, hard right turn

32:22.400 --> 32:27.520
and I was not expecting it. And I sat with it. I thought about, you know, troubleshooting

32:27.520 --> 32:34.440
here and there. But what I realized is I'm going to take advantage of the super solid

32:34.440 --> 32:40.240
ZFS support that is in 1910. And I'm going to go ahead and bypass the installer support.

32:40.240 --> 32:47.520
Root on ZFS, for me, has a lot of potential in a little while, but not a lot of potential

32:47.520 --> 32:50.640
today. Do you know what I mean? Like, you could kind of visualize how that would be

32:50.640 --> 32:54.560
handy. Right. I mean, we've seen other systems, things like FreeBSD, other other systems with

32:54.560 --> 32:59.480
with longer ZFS support, or maybe things like OpenSUSE, right? With with ButterFS, like

32:59.480 --> 33:04.080
you can get a lot of benefits with ZFS on Root, with snapshots, rollback, integration,

33:04.080 --> 33:08.320
perhaps with the package manager to make sure the system stays in a consistent state. Right.

33:08.320 --> 33:13.320
Could you see like a grub entry, last snapshot. So when my system fails, I just load that

33:13.320 --> 33:18.200
and boom, I'm right back to where I was right before I did that update. Right. But you don't

33:18.200 --> 33:22.540
really get that right now. Yeah. And you're risking a little bit of complexity. Right.

33:22.540 --> 33:28.800
So the ZFS support in Ubuntu 1910 is top notch. The Ubiquiti installer is limited today.

33:28.800 --> 33:34.480
So what I did on my next reload after I gave it a thought is I went get ready for this

33:34.480 --> 33:42.680
extended for for my root XFS for my home and ZFS from my data partitions, which I just

33:42.680 --> 33:46.160
set up later after the install was done with G parted and you know, just put them just

33:46.160 --> 33:50.480
toss them an SFS tab and a big deal. Right. So basically, you've decided that on 1910,

33:50.480 --> 33:55.500
at least, maybe just skip that setup, unless you specifically want to play with it and

33:55.500 --> 33:59.640
enjoy the, you know, the consistent ZFS support we've enjoyed for a while on Ubuntu. I'm going

33:59.640 --> 34:06.080
to give it I'm going to give the ZFS on Root a go again. But I really do he did rocks warning,

34:06.080 --> 34:10.980
you know, he says this is this is legitimately an experimental thing we're doing in so much

34:10.980 --> 34:16.600
that the format of the way we lay out the disk may change and it it may not be compatible

34:16.600 --> 34:22.120
with what we decide to go with in the end. This is what I loved back in the day about

34:22.120 --> 34:28.320
these interim releases of Ubuntu. They were really the try something out, try something

34:28.320 --> 34:34.000
new, deploy the new desktop environment, deploy the new compositing back end, deploy the new

34:34.000 --> 34:38.760
frickin file system, right? I mean, that's the only way to get some of this stuff ironed

34:38.760 --> 34:42.600
out, right? I mean, you can test all you want behind closed doors, you can play with a limited

34:42.600 --> 34:46.720
number of systems you have available. But until the people who are actually going to

34:46.720 --> 34:51.840
use it use it, you can't fix all those books, you've got to put it in production. And that's,

34:51.840 --> 34:55.520
that's what these interim releases have been about in the past. But it really feels like

34:55.520 --> 35:01.080
the good old days. If you love living on the edge a little 1910 really makes you feel right

35:01.080 --> 35:05.940
at home in that regard. So that's, that's where I stand with the ZFS support for my

35:05.940 --> 35:10.840
production systems. For systems that I'm going to depend on from a day to day basis. I will

35:10.840 --> 35:15.240
not use the ZFS on route experimental installer feature, but I am going to use the hell out

35:15.240 --> 35:19.000
of the ZFS support that is there. I'm just going to use it a more traditional manner.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.320
Yeah, I mean, that's still fantastic. And I expect by 2020, it'll probably be a different

35:23.320 --> 35:24.320
story.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.880
Yeah. Wimpy sounds like you perhaps had some feedback here.

35:26.880 --> 35:35.320
Yeah, the the way that the ZFS on route is implemented changed quite a bit literally

35:35.320 --> 35:41.000
in the last few days. And it sounds like some of you early adopters there with the daily

35:41.000 --> 35:42.800
images got bitten.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.500
I suspected as much.

35:44.500 --> 35:50.420
As of yesterday, it's all fine again. It's still carrying an experimental flag for the,

35:50.420 --> 35:55.520
for the reasons that you highlight, Chris, which is the implementation may change slightly

35:55.520 --> 36:01.880
between 1910 and 2004 based on, you know, feedback and such and how people get on with

36:01.880 --> 36:08.120
things. But if you know, when the final release is out, if you want to test ZFS, you shouldn't

36:08.120 --> 36:10.040
run into the issues that you've just described.

36:10.040 --> 36:14.440
Yeah, I would expect so. I still think maybe for my day to day production systems, I would

36:14.440 --> 36:20.720
avoid it on route. But unlike my, my computers that are not like the end of the world, if

36:20.720 --> 36:25.080
I do an update, and there's an issue, I think I'm going to give it a go again. And I obviously

36:25.080 --> 36:26.600
am using it on the data partitions.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.520
It's just making me excited. I'm looking forward to when this improves.

36:29.520 --> 36:33.920
Yeah, I mean, this is how you get there, right? So let's talk about desktop environments for

36:33.920 --> 36:42.720
a moment. So you spent most of your time with Matei. I spent most of my time in GNOME Shell.

36:42.720 --> 36:52.160
From the GNOME Shell side, I would say it feels like a supercar now. Man, I am so hooked

36:52.160 --> 37:00.200
on the GNOME Shell setup. I mean, I've been riding pretty happily with Fedora recently.

37:00.200 --> 37:09.600
But whoa, I mean, I got to see what Fedora's setup is. But I mean, everything is so smooth.

37:09.600 --> 37:13.920
It's so fast. But more than that, and this is something that Ubuntu has always done really

37:13.920 --> 37:20.760
well with, but good God, the fonts look great. I've been I've been working with XFCE for

37:20.760 --> 37:29.400
quite a while. And to sit down on this computer, I get a sense of peace when I look at the

37:29.400 --> 37:34.560
fonts on my screen. I know that sounds so stupid, but there's something about when they

37:34.560 --> 37:43.280
nail it, and my mind isn't distracted by what's wrong with it. It's just perfect. That's how

37:43.280 --> 37:49.240
looking at the screen feels with Ubuntu 19.10. I can't go back. And I don't know what I'm

37:49.240 --> 37:54.560
going to do now about my laptop. I don't know what I'm going to do because I actually hate

37:54.560 --> 38:00.200
being in this position because I don't want to base all my setup on a frickin 19.10 because

38:00.200 --> 38:04.600
I got LTSs everywhere and I'm pretty happy with Fedora on the laptop. But I can't remember

38:04.600 --> 38:09.840
the last time I've come on the air and been this enthusiastic about how something performs

38:09.840 --> 38:19.220
and looks on my screen. The fonts are so perfect. The performance is so butter smooth. The Yaru

38:19.220 --> 38:30.140
theme is perfect now. It just looks like a professional grade desktop theme. I like both

38:30.140 --> 38:36.660
the light version and the dark version of it. I'm not going to change it. I'm not changing

38:36.660 --> 38:45.960
the defaults. And that doesn't happen. I always mess with the defaults. So for me, this is

38:45.960 --> 38:54.560
the release that brings me back to GNOME. After two years of jumping from Plasma and

38:54.560 --> 39:02.780
then XFCE, I can't go back. I really like it. So for me, and maybe it's the time I've

39:02.780 --> 39:07.640
spent in XFCE that makes it such a strong contrast for me, but the animations are no

39:07.640 --> 39:13.340
longer a detraction. They are an improvement to the experience where as before I found

39:13.340 --> 39:20.080
them distracting and aggravating. They now give the desktop a sense of direction. Things

39:20.080 --> 39:25.220
are smooth. It's just, what about stability? Because that's been one of your problems in

39:25.220 --> 39:30.520
the past. Yeah, I can't fully speak to that because I had to kind of nuke and pave halfway

39:30.520 --> 39:36.960
through this for the ZFS stuff. So I will have to give you maybe more on that next week.

39:36.960 --> 39:42.360
Initially pretty good. However, I do have this issue that plagues I think just DisplayPort

39:42.360 --> 39:47.440
on Linux, because it's been an issue on Plasma. It's been an issue on XFCE. And now it's an

39:47.440 --> 39:52.360
issue on GNOME Shell, where when my screens go to sleep, they just completely get crazy

39:52.360 --> 39:57.000
because I've got two verticals and then one horizontal in the middle. Windows move around.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.480
Sometimes one screen doesn't even turn on. Orientations just go crazy. And that's still

40:01.480 --> 40:02.480
an issue.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.480
See, the problem is you're getting up from your computer. And if you just didn't do that,

40:05.480 --> 40:06.480
then you wouldn't hit this button.

40:06.480 --> 40:11.200
Well, I do have a workaround. And I thought this was because I had this dirty Nvidia graphics

40:11.200 --> 40:17.560
card. So then I switched over to an AMD graphics card. And I was hoping that because it was

40:17.560 --> 40:23.960
a fresh install with no other previous drivers, just always the free AMD driver, maybe it

40:23.960 --> 40:31.340
would... No, no, no. So my workaround is I have Caffeine installed as the extension.

40:31.340 --> 40:35.280
So I use that during the day. So the screens just stay on during the day. And then when

40:35.280 --> 40:42.680
the computer goes to sleep at night, I have a XRender script that I run because I'm back

40:42.680 --> 40:49.800
on X with Ubuntu, which has been fine. So yeah, I'd love to hear your impressions of

40:49.800 --> 40:53.680
Amate. And then we'll go around the horn. And I know Drew ran into a few issues, so

40:53.680 --> 40:56.400
I definitely want to cover those. But I'd love to get your Amate experiences.

40:56.400 --> 41:01.120
I feel like I've been on the opposite journey in some ways because I've been sticking with

41:01.120 --> 41:07.240
KDE neon and plasma for the for the past year or so. And it's been great. It's making me

41:07.240 --> 41:11.440
think about some of those animations because playing with Monte for the past week or so,

41:11.440 --> 41:16.840
it's been nice. And I will say I frequently just feel like it's so snappy and quick. There's

41:16.840 --> 41:22.080
a few areas where it's almost too quick. And, you know, it feels like there could be a little

41:22.080 --> 41:26.240
animation there. So I'm not sure exactly what I want out of a desktop. It's making me question

41:26.240 --> 41:31.680
a lot of things. I'm not sure I get the most benefits from all of the fixes in in Monte

41:31.680 --> 41:37.000
because there's a ton of work going on for for better support of high DPI in particular,

41:37.000 --> 41:40.100
and better support for Nvidia graphics and gamers. And of course, you're on Intel with

41:40.100 --> 41:44.340
low DPI. Yeah, and I haven't tried gaming on it yet either. Right. So life pretty decent,

41:44.340 --> 41:48.600
but battery life has been great. And even then, as someone who's deployed Monte mostly

41:48.600 --> 41:53.120
for family members, you know, people with either like a need an appliance type application

41:53.120 --> 41:58.400
or just are used to a more traditional desktop. It's the best Monte experience I've had in

41:58.400 --> 42:03.440
a long time. And kind of the first time in a while I might consider using it every day.

42:03.440 --> 42:09.080
When we recently talked a lot about the improvements in this 1910 release this paper cut release,

42:09.080 --> 42:14.640
but kind of what kind of now getting to this point. When you look back at this 1910 release,

42:14.640 --> 42:20.400
what's the feature for you that I think will stick with you the most? Well, there's not

42:20.400 --> 42:31.120
one, but so I think the notification center is a big deal for me personally. And I actually

42:31.120 --> 42:37.360
made use of it at UbuCon last week with great success. I was able to put it into do not

42:37.360 --> 42:43.000
disturb mode. And I gave my presentation and nobody saw the telegram messages from my wife.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.760
So that was a massive win. You know, it's that's a simple thing. And I've I've been

42:47.760 --> 42:54.120
wanting that for ages. So Jason, who implemented all of that stuff, I can't thank you enough.

42:54.120 --> 43:01.000
You know, I really like that notification center. I think the I've got a laptop that

43:01.000 --> 43:09.680
does well two laptops that support high DPI. So the high DPI improvements are hugely obvious

43:09.680 --> 43:15.440
to me. And anyone that's got a high DPI machine and has used Marte in the past, you will immediately

43:15.440 --> 43:19.780
see the improvements. And we've not finished all of those yet. We're very, very close.

43:19.780 --> 43:23.800
We've got some more visual quality improvements to come in the next release, which will land

43:23.800 --> 43:29.360
in time for 2004. I particularly like the fact that now we've got invisible window corners.

43:29.360 --> 43:36.280
So you don't have to have pixel perfect, you know, grabbing on the window corners to you

43:36.280 --> 43:40.320
know, seems like a simple thing turns out to be actually incredibly difficult to implement

43:40.320 --> 43:48.680
properly. Yeah. And then the Ubuntu Marte has adopted indicators, you know, app indicators

43:48.680 --> 43:56.280
from Ubuntu for several releases now. And this release is the first time it's really

43:56.280 --> 44:04.120
all nailed, you know, they don't scale weirdly, they all work, the date time indicator and,

44:04.120 --> 44:10.880
you know, interacting with evolution and everything, you know, it's just it's just lots of those

44:10.880 --> 44:16.360
improvements. And then there's a ton of fixes, you know, it's just it's just, it's not perfect,

44:16.360 --> 44:20.680
but we're really getting close to where we want to be now. So I'm very, very happy with

44:20.680 --> 44:25.680
this release. Looking over Wes's shoulder, it does seem like it's been it's been really

44:25.680 --> 44:32.400
solid. And I noticed that when we install Chromium, if you do like a pseudo apt install

44:32.400 --> 44:36.840
Chromium, what is it? What's the package Chromium desktop or I can't remember the exact

44:36.840 --> 44:43.560
package name. It kicks off a script that then installs the snap version of the package.

44:43.560 --> 44:50.840
And seamlessly, very seamlessly. And I'm, I'm pretty impressed because that makes Chrome

44:50.840 --> 44:55.920
and Chromium probably make some of the most sense for an application. But I did a little

44:55.920 --> 45:02.760
digging. And I, I think this now makes it possible to install Chromium on versions of

45:02.760 --> 45:09.080
Ubuntu that basically would no longer be able to run Chromium. And that must be applicable

45:09.080 --> 45:15.160
to other districts to like 1404, for example. Yeah, the tricky thing here is he's not so

45:15.160 --> 45:23.600
much running Chromium on 1404. It's actually getting the tool chain required to build Chromium

45:23.600 --> 45:30.160
for 1404. Yeah, there's a chicken in the egg. Yeah, yeah. So you know, when, you know, if

45:30.160 --> 45:35.920
you if you say 1404 is now in its extended security maintenance, and we've got 1604 and

45:35.920 --> 45:42.600
1804 and 2004 just around the corner. So let's take 1910. For each of those four versions.

45:42.600 --> 45:48.720
That's a separate build of Chromium that we have to build one on 1404 one on 1604 one

45:48.720 --> 45:54.320
on 1804 one on 1910. And of course, it's 1904 as well. So there's actually five different

45:54.320 --> 46:00.080
builds. And because the tool chains have changed tool chain has changed significantly between

46:00.080 --> 46:04.480
1404 and where we are today, there's several different build configurations that you have

46:04.480 --> 46:11.120
to manage along the way there. So by just building the snap, which runs a single build,

46:11.120 --> 46:17.960
runs on all five of those versions of Ubuntu, plus 50 other Linux distributions, we cut

46:17.960 --> 46:26.160
our investment in time to maintain Chromium considerably, you know, four or five times.

46:26.160 --> 46:30.880
So that's the motivation for doing this with Chromium, because there's a new release every

46:30.880 --> 46:36.280
six weeks, it's fast moving. And now we have a mechanism to continue to deliver it across

46:36.280 --> 46:38.860
the entire family of supported Ubuntu.

46:38.860 --> 46:42.400
And the the shim had been done before, right? Like things like LexD already, if you installed

46:42.400 --> 46:49.440
the package just gave you the snap? Yes. So LexD, I think was probably the first first

46:49.440 --> 46:53.720
package where we did the same thing. And for similar reasons, you know, it means you can

46:53.720 --> 46:58.840
maintain one version of the thing rather than, you know, half a dozen. You know, when you

46:58.840 --> 47:03.000
do something like this, which to Wes and I makes a lot of sense, especially with something

47:03.000 --> 47:06.400
like Chromium, you're going to get people that react in the extreme, they're going to

47:06.400 --> 47:11.880
extrapolate this to mean everything's going to snaps. And the the really sinister thing

47:11.880 --> 47:18.200
about it is when I pseudo apt install, it's still installing a goshdarn snap. I didn't

47:18.200 --> 47:22.640
do a snap install. I didn't apt install. Why didn't I get a DEP? And they're going to construe

47:22.640 --> 47:25.960
that to mean everything's going to snaps.

47:25.960 --> 47:32.400
Yeah. You know, obviously, there are people who will react in that way. I pasted a link

47:32.400 --> 47:38.320
in IRC you can include in the show notes, a blog post on the Ubuntu blog that Popey

47:38.320 --> 47:48.840
wrote that details this in some detail to explain what I've said and a few other things

47:48.840 --> 47:58.400
in much more detail. But the plan is not to replace everything in Ubuntu with snaps. We've

47:58.400 --> 48:05.440
done this with Chromium because we have to choose wisely how we invest our time and for

48:05.440 --> 48:11.440
the desktop team, which is relatively small, this represents a big labor saving. And it

48:11.440 --> 48:17.680
means we can invest our time in other improvements in in the desktop, such as you know, improving

48:17.680 --> 48:21.400
the fluidity and performance of you know, gnome shell and other things.

48:21.400 --> 48:27.080
Sure. Well, we tried it out on the Ubuntu mate install here. And I was happy to report

48:27.080 --> 48:34.440
that we had native open and save dialog boxes. We had access to the webcam, we had WebGL.

48:34.440 --> 48:39.840
So I mean, it was a perfectly usable, perfectly functional show from it right now. Yeah, you

48:39.840 --> 48:44.880
really wouldn't know. And I think that's the type of application where they have a custom

48:44.880 --> 48:48.880
toolkit like that, that is also kind of funky that sometimes you can't guarantee will look

48:48.880 --> 48:54.240
right. And whereas this snap actually gets the right GTK theme and everything. It was

48:54.240 --> 49:01.520
a great experience. I'm impressed. So I think it's not bad. And I wanted to now move over

49:01.520 --> 49:06.120
to cheese and drew because I know they both had very different experiences. So cheese,

49:06.120 --> 49:09.840
why don't we start with yours? I know you spent some time with both of them. So start

49:09.840 --> 49:11.720
wherever you think is probably best.

49:11.720 --> 49:18.000
Well, let me start with saying the bare metal that I was testing it on is a potato. So it's

49:18.000 --> 49:25.000
a Dell and spirit on 3147. Not much better than some of the older atom chips. So it's

49:25.000 --> 49:30.600
not a very good machine. It's one of these two in ones. Initially, I tried pulling down

49:30.600 --> 49:36.800
the GNOME version, the stock version. And for whatever reason, GNOME likes to default

49:36.800 --> 49:42.920
with the hid gyro and hit accelerometer kernel modules and stuff like that. So again, I was

49:42.920 --> 49:51.720
faced with a rotated 180 degrees and flipped 90 degrees login screen. So quickly ditch

49:51.720 --> 49:57.800
that, jumped over to the mate beta, found a couple of little bugs in the installer,

49:57.800 --> 50:03.320
which were just like VLC and Google+, which have since been fixed in the daily. They were

50:03.320 --> 50:09.600
fixed, I think, well before I'd noticed them. Another little bug that I noticed when switching

50:09.600 --> 50:16.600
to the Redmond theme in mate was that some of the mounted icons were pretty large. I

50:16.600 --> 50:20.360
don't know why anyone would necessarily want to switch to the Redmond theme, but it's there

50:20.360 --> 50:25.880
if you do. But that was really the only kind of graphical glitch that I saw. I did also

50:25.880 --> 50:32.960
have, whenever I tried to use the experimental ZFS install from the installer, the installer

50:32.960 --> 50:39.100
did crash on me, which I wasn't expecting much. And it's on this little laptop.

50:39.100 --> 50:44.200
And it's also still in the development cycle. So when we do this phase of the first look,

50:44.200 --> 50:49.040
like that kind of stuff is expected. We'll do our follow up thoughts next week.

50:49.040 --> 50:54.440
We went through several days with the ZFS install not functioning on the dailies. So

50:54.440 --> 50:56.280
we know that's fixed now.

50:56.280 --> 51:00.800
Yeah. And when you do like a regular like extended four or whatever, it's totally fine.

51:00.800 --> 51:08.680
But my overall experience was really great. And mate works great on that older hardware.

51:08.680 --> 51:13.840
You know, I haven't had any real issues with it. I love that I'm given the choice now between

51:13.840 --> 51:18.760
the full install and the minimal installs. So immediately, you know, I picked up on that.

51:18.760 --> 51:24.400
I love how mate gives me a welcome screen. Just a nerd like that, because I think anyone

51:24.400 --> 51:28.880
that's going to be new to a system coming from Windows or Mac or something like that,

51:28.880 --> 51:32.000
that's going to give them kind of that little extra help.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Nothing beats the boutique.

51:33.000 --> 51:38.840
Yeah, dude, it's great. So I've had overall a really good experience with it. You know,

51:38.840 --> 51:43.680
I will likely keep running it. And then once the final version comes out, I'll switch to

51:43.680 --> 51:50.960
the final, played some installed steam, played some steam games, ran great. I have also heard

51:50.960 --> 51:58.920
issues with people that have had their audio inputs or output switch from HDMI to their

51:58.920 --> 52:04.200
USB headset. And I'm guessing that's just something on enumerating. I loved watching

52:04.200 --> 52:08.800
Popeys live stream the other day where he installed to live. I noticed what was really

52:08.800 --> 52:13.880
cool about that. And thanks, Popey, because now I'm in the land of looking for ThinkPads.

52:13.880 --> 52:20.200
Oh, my God, you got him going on ThinkPads for like a solid few minutes. It was I never

52:20.200 --> 52:22.720
I mean, you see you want to see Popey light up asking about things.

52:22.720 --> 52:26.560
I know I'm waiting on him to like one day just lay them all out around him and just

52:26.560 --> 52:29.800
go through each one and talk about it. That'd be a great video.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.440
I know. I know. I actually think it's a problem.

52:33.440 --> 52:39.920
I think the Linux and ThinkPads, it's like hand in hand. I mean, it's not a problem.

52:39.920 --> 52:45.040
Cheesha, not alone. The number of people that are in the Ubuntu podcast telegram channel

52:45.040 --> 52:50.920
exchanging notes about ThinkPads, they're buying on eBay. You know, Popey needs to be

52:50.920 --> 52:56.200
on commission. I think there's going to be no ThinkPads left on eBay as a result of these

52:56.200 --> 52:57.200
live streams.

52:57.200 --> 53:02.360
Absolutely. All the off lease ThinkPads have been bought up now in the last two weeks.

53:02.360 --> 53:06.840
But I did notice I think he was on the 220, the X220 or the X240. I don't remember which

53:06.840 --> 53:07.840
one he was using.

53:07.840 --> 53:08.840
It was the 220.

53:08.840 --> 53:11.440
Okay, the fingerprint scanner works out of the box now.

53:11.440 --> 53:18.040
Oh, yeah. I've got news about fingerprint scanners. Yeah. Go on. Go on. Yes. Yeah. So

53:18.040 --> 53:25.880
that was something that happened in the 1904 cycle and has been improved in the 1910 cycle.

53:25.880 --> 53:34.360
And it's still the case that the more modern biometric chips used in fingerprint scanners

53:34.360 --> 53:44.520
are not supported by fprintd because they have, you know, a proprietary driver effectively.

53:44.520 --> 53:52.600
And fprintd will only talk to an open driver. So I don't know when we're going to conclude

53:52.600 --> 53:58.360
this work. But I was talking to my colleague Marco about this over the weekend. And he

53:58.360 --> 54:05.360
was saying that he's got the fingerprint reader working on I think it's the T480 or something

54:05.360 --> 54:12.720
like that. And he's written a shim that wraps around the proprietary driver. So fprintd

54:12.720 --> 54:18.720
can talk to it. And he was showing me this because I was saying, oh, yeah, problem isn't

54:18.720 --> 54:26.320
none of the new ones work. And then he unlocked his laptop with his fingerprint reader. So

54:26.320 --> 54:29.560
I'm not quite sure what the scheduling is around that. But I know it's something we're

54:29.560 --> 54:35.600
working towards. Is there a you don't have to say who, but is there a is there an enterprise

54:35.600 --> 54:41.360
client that's driving this need? Because this seems this seems like, ah, yes, it seems like

54:41.360 --> 54:45.440
that's one of those things. Well, good. That's what I love about open source. One particular

54:45.440 --> 54:50.080
really important enterprise client can drive something that the rest of us benefit from.

54:50.080 --> 54:55.280
And my final note would be, you know, big congrats to the whole team over there, what

54:55.280 --> 55:01.480
they've managed to do, especially with 15 year anniversary. You know, right, right here

55:01.480 --> 55:08.180
on us last week, makes me feel super old. But I know I'm proud to be, you know, a user

55:08.180 --> 55:11.560
of Ubuntu and have been for a long time. And I really appreciate all the hard work you

55:11.560 --> 55:16.080
guys do. Yeah, I think you're you're really nailing it with the 15 years like this is

55:16.080 --> 55:23.840
this is amazing. And here we are back on GNOME two. All right, so Drew had had a go. And

55:23.840 --> 55:27.680
what I love about Drew's perspective on this is he had a chance to really kind of look

55:27.680 --> 55:32.440
at it from a production grade workstation desktop. And some things were great, and some

55:32.440 --> 55:37.240
things weren't so great. So what did you run into? And what was good? And what wasn't good,

55:37.240 --> 55:46.080
right? So the standard desktop experience was phenomenal. As you saw, the speed improvements

55:46.080 --> 55:51.580
and all of the animation improvements and everything that's gone into both the GNOME

55:51.580 --> 55:57.960
version and the Ubuntu desktop, you know, skin of the GNOME version are great. They

55:57.960 --> 56:06.320
are doing wonderful work there. Everything is smooth and just buttery and really, really

56:06.320 --> 56:12.980
a joy to use. And as far as stability, you know, I've been using it a little longer than

56:12.980 --> 56:20.520
you have. I've been running it for about a week on the beta. And I haven't had any crashes

56:20.520 --> 56:28.320
or really any issues under normal workstation use cases. The only time that I've had issues

56:28.320 --> 56:35.880
is when I start to go into pro audio land. And there I did have some problems on my laptop

56:35.880 --> 56:43.440
specifically when I would load up Jack and start using my audio interface, which is connected

56:43.440 --> 56:51.040
via USB. Every now and then, and I never figured out what triggered it, it would just drop

56:51.040 --> 57:00.480
the USB connection and switch over to the internal sound card. So not great. And I did,

57:00.480 --> 57:04.000
just because this is a production machine for me, go back to Fedora on this one, and

57:04.000 --> 57:07.800
I haven't had it happen again. So I don't think it's a hardware issue. I don't think

57:07.800 --> 57:13.920
it's an issue with the interface, but something either in Ubuntu studio controls or something

57:13.920 --> 57:22.120
in the USB subsystem is causing some interrupt on that. Other than that, that's really, I

57:22.120 --> 57:28.760
mean, that's the only issue that I've really had. I will say that I tried a bunch of snaps

57:28.760 --> 57:34.660
as well, just to see how that's coming along. And I do think that snap support is getting

57:34.660 --> 57:40.760
a lot better every time I look at it. They are still launching a little slower than I'd

57:40.760 --> 57:48.720
like, but I know that's still being worked on. And realistically for application support,

57:48.720 --> 57:56.620
I think snaps and Flatpak are both really great ways to deliver standard desktop applications.

57:56.620 --> 58:01.200
I'm not sold on it for low-level stuff yet, but I'm getting there.

58:01.200 --> 58:07.760
Yeah. I completely agree with your assessment. They're really solid now, including the open

58:07.760 --> 58:12.340
and save dialog boxes, looking right, getting access to your individual devices without

58:12.340 --> 58:17.620
making it a battle. But it's really down to the launch time. It's still not quite where

58:17.620 --> 58:22.120
I'd like it to be. Now, the nice thing with something like Chromium is I launch it pretty

58:22.120 --> 58:29.760
much once a day, and then it's open all day long. But I can kind of see the groundwork

58:29.760 --> 58:31.960
for 2004, you know what I mean?

58:31.960 --> 58:40.420
Yeah, absolutely. And this looks so much like an interim release between 1904 and 2004.

58:40.420 --> 58:46.640
It's just crazy. You see all of the work that went into 1904, polished up, made better,

58:46.640 --> 58:54.120
and some other iterative improvements on top of that. Going into the 2004 stretch, it really

58:54.120 --> 59:00.440
looks like it's shaping up to make just a real killer LTS when that comes around. I'm

59:00.440 --> 59:01.880
really excited about that.

59:01.880 --> 59:07.160
Yeah, that's my take too. And I look at it, I mean, this is a stupid, bad, horrible analogy

59:07.160 --> 59:13.440
that I shouldn't make, but I kind of look at 1910 as a bit of, you know, it's a fun

59:13.440 --> 59:18.380
mod car. It's a race car, it's super fast, but sometimes the turbo's a little too powerful

59:18.380 --> 59:23.360
and you blow a bolt. And the LTS is like, it's your commuter car. It's your safe, predictable,

59:23.360 --> 59:25.400
it's going to turn every time you...

59:25.400 --> 59:26.400
It's your Volvo.

59:26.400 --> 59:31.760
Yeah, it really is just like a really predictable, reliable car. And that's where the LTS is.

59:31.760 --> 59:37.320
And it depends on which type of driver you are. Do you like to have a little fun? And

59:37.320 --> 59:42.400
maybe sometimes drive a little too fast? Then maybe 1910s for you. Do you want to know that

59:42.400 --> 59:46.880
every single day you're going to get to your destination? Then the LTS is for you. That's

59:46.880 --> 59:52.160
kind of standard advice, but it is more applicable with the 1910 release than I think it's been

59:52.160 --> 59:57.920
for a few years. And it's really something to see where we're at now with Gnome Shell

59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.480
and where we're at now with Snaps. These have all been these concepts that we've been building

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:08.960
to and we've been seeing get implemented over time. And 1910 is a representation of what

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:15.240
I think Canonical had as a long-term vision. It's really close in 1910. We're not a hundred

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:21.520
percent yet, but we're really close. And so if you're interested in that at all, it's

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:28.600
worth checking out. Now, which flavors for you? Is ZFS slower? Is there other kind of

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:36.040
overhead costs with ZFS like memory usage compared to XFS and extended for? That I can't

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.800
tell you fully yet. That's something we're going to spend the next week investigating,

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.640
benchmarking, and we'll follow up. Now that 1910 is going to be officially released, we'll

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.720
follow up with some of that stuff. Give some of those things a try.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.000
I'm thinking I might give Kubuntu a try.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:01.240
Yeah. Kubuntu 1910 looks particularly good as well. I think I'm tempted to also try that.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.920
And then before you know it, the new Fedora is going to be out. It's too much, Wes.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.260
And then you're looking at like when 2024 makes it, it's going to be a nice supported

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:11.680
release too. So it's just a great time to be a desktop Linux user.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.520
It's true. Oh, hold on. A production note here from the back office. They're telling

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.280
us to move on. It's time to mention the picks. Should we do that?

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.760
Let's do it. We got some great picks today.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:25.760
Well, I moved over to a Gnome shell and I realized there wasn't a great menu editor

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.080
built in. Like basically all of the other desktops, you just right click on the menu

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:34.840
and you can edit it. Gnome's like, no, no, we don't got that for you. So I have two different

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:41.280
picks for you. I have this problem with my monitors that I gripe about on occasion. And

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.240
you can install an application called, what is it, A-Rander, which just gives you like

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:47.240
these really...

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:48.240
X-Rander.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.560
Well, A-Rander uses X-Rander to create scripts for X-Rander.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.040
Just like a nice little desktop. You lay out the screens how you want. It gives you the

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.040
script.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.400
But then you have this problem where like you want to be able to launch super easy because

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.920
your screens are all screwed up and you'd like a single click or a command you can execute.

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:08.120
Well, that's where making a desktop file comes in and adding it to your menu. And my friends,

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.800
if you have ever wanted to add something to your menu, to your launcher, this is where

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:18.680
menu Libre comes in from Sean M. Davis. It's a menu editor, straightforward basic menu

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:24.040
editor that works on anything that follows the standard. Also a shout out to app editor.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:31.680
If you are on elementary OS, this is a nice looking menu editor that I'd love to have

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:36.560
on every other desktop, but that's in the App Center. And either one of these two applications

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.200
depending on what fits your needs, allow you to add things that you can then search by

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:46.600
hitting the super key either on Plasma or Mate or Gnome Shell or Xfce, anything that

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.800
follows this free desktop standard for the.desktop file.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.560
That's great because otherwise it's kind of like black magic to me and I don't want to

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560
go messing with those files.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:54.560
Yeah.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.560
I can just...

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.320
How do you get stuff in that launcher? How do you make it searchable? How does this work?

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.840
I got a shell script, I want to be able to search for it and execute it. This pick will

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:09.280
help you do that. So check the show notes for that, linuxunplug.com slash 323. But then

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.240
Mr. Bacon coming in with the last minute sneaky pick.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240
He did sneak in there.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.480
He's got a sneaky pick. So tell us about Wavemon.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:24.120
So Wavemon is one of those curses apps that I previously used to use all the time. I found

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:29.920
myself using it at Texas Linux Fest just to kind of check it out. But basically it'll

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:35.960
allow you to monitor your wireless networking via Inker. This gives you a nice little output,

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:42.280
letting you know what your signal is, letting you know your throughput, what your rate is,

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:47.480
what your drop rate is, letting you know what channels you're on, all those sorts of things,

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:51.960
all those little details that you might need to know, especially if you're doing any other

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:58.760
sort of wireless work. So I would highly recommend checking out Wavemon. Beemon is also another,

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.880
which is a bandwidth monitor, another tool that I quite frequently used to use all the

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.600
time. But Wavemon's a great one.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.440
Are we throwing in Kismet too? Who just literally threw in Kismet here in the last second?

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440
Did somebody throw in Kismet?

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440
Drew, did you do that?

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.440
Yes.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.440
Nice.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.440
All right, let's do Kismet.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:22.480
I just wanted to point out that there's Kismet as well. Kismet is also for monitoring wireless

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.280
interfaces, but it's more along the lines of long-term monitoring. So you can set up

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:35.520
like little nodes in various spots. I used to use them for businesses where we'd have

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:41.920
to make sure that Wi-Fi was solid every single square inch of the place. So throw little

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:48.080
sensors around and then monitor them with Kismet and make sure that everything was up

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.840
and running properly. So if you need something with a little more power and a little more

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:56.000
long-term monitoring in mind, Kismet's a good choice too.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.560
Sounds like my house could use that.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.920
Yeah. Four picks, the quad picks. How about that? Also, I got to take a moment. I got

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.560
to take a minute. Well, not really, but I got to take a moment and I got to say...

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.600
Maybe like 40 seconds? I don't know.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.360
How great has Drew done on Choose Linux? We hired Drew as an editor and then when the

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:23.720
situation arrived, he stepped up to Choose Linux and between him, Elle, and Joe, it has

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.360
turned out so great. Drew, you have done so well.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360
I love it.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.640
I just want to take a moment here because I don't know how many people listen to this

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:35.600
show have checked you out on Choose Linux, but if you enjoy Drew on this show, he's really

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.600
at home on the Choose Linux show now. So go check out Choose Linux as well.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:44.680
It often brings the much-needed voice of reason, I would say. I mean, Joe's sat in his ways

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:50.800
sometimes and Elle's a very passionate person. Drew, you just get it right. That's my personal

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800
take.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:57.660
I'll take it and I appreciate it. Yeah. Anybody who has any interest in Linux, I highly encourage

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:02.080
you to take a listen. We've got a new episode coming out soon.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.560
I always do. Also, go check out Wimpy over at the Ubuntu podcast, the ubuntupodcast.org.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.320
That is a staple of my week. I love every single episode. It's like hanging out with

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.320
friends, Wimpy.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.320
Aw, thank you very much.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.600
Thank you. Thank you for doing it. It's really nice to have you all back together now for

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.000
a few episodes. It feels like we're back at home now. Everything's good.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.080
It's nice and solid. Yeah. Something's going to change now, I know it. I just know it.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.080
It is.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:33.600
Dang it. I totally call it. All right. Well, I think that wraps us up, though. We'll move

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:39.880
on to getting to testing, benchmarking, and just living with Ubuntu 19.10 on a day-to-day

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:46.880
basis. We'd love to hear your experiences as we conclude our review next week. So tweet

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.440
me. I'm at chrisles. The show is at Linux Unplugged?

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.040
I don't know. The network is at Jupyter Signal.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.180
You can also tweet Wes. He's at Wes Payne. And Cheese, what are you at? Cheese Bacon,

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.180
for God's sake?

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.180
At Cheese Bacon.

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:04.000
That's like a contact page, right? LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
You're kidding me.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah, for real.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.400
No. No. And then that would be a way to have a long-form response?

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.360
Oh, yeah. If you want to ramble in an email, don't go on too long, just for our sake, because

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.360
Chris isn't going to read it.

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:24.080
Wow. You hostile Wes. Are you noticing this? All right. Well, that's true. You're right

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.080
about that.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.120
All right. One more thing before we get out of here. A little news flash.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.920
Oh, wait, wait. Do you want? Hold on.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.960
Do you have a news flash soundboard clip?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.960
Of course you do.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.800
Yeah. I mean, if you're coming at me with that, we're going to do it properly. Are you

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800
ready?

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800
I'm ready.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.360
This is CNN breaking news.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.360
It's cheese breaking news.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.660
So, at the beginning of the show, we were talking about Core Boot, and I reached out

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:53.280
to Emma and I asked her about the plans for Core Boot on future machines. And she has

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:58.360
sent back to me that there are no plans to go backwards on their open hardware software

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:05.680
mission. So, it's safe to assume that they will be building 100% Core Boot, Daughters,

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.280
and Galagos in the foreseeable future.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.440
That is great news.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.440
Wow.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.840
That is great news. Thank you for the real time follow up right there. I appreciate that.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.560
That is so, so cool to hear. Let's end it right there on that good news. We can't top

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:23.400
it. Join us live, won't you? We'd love to hear your thoughts. You can always get right

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:28.120
in our ear holes by getting in the mumble room. All the details are in our IRC room

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:35.080
at IRC.geekshed.net pound hashtag Jupiter broadcasting. And then once you're in there,

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.760
you can just do bang, that's exclamation mark, mumble and it will give you all of the

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.720
info you need to jump in our mumble room and share your thoughts or you can share them

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.640
in the IRC room. Don't worry.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.400
Every Tuesday. So, just set that aside.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.880
If you can't make it next Tuesday, don't worry. We'll be back every single Tuesday

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.480
over at jblive.tv and then your RSS feed at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe. We'll see

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:24.760
you back here next Tuesday.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:45.080
Well, there you have it. JBtitles.com. Let's go title. You guys remember that archive.org

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:51.320
has them emulators? They added a whole bunch of more games, eh Cheesy?

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.560
Yeah, so they added 2500 more games.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.560
What?

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.560
What?

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.560
That's too many.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.080
That's too many games in your browser. So super cool. I thought, you know, poppy and

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.960
wimpy also might appreciate that since they're retro gamers. And then doing a little more

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:06.960
digging.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.960
Wait, did you just call them old?

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:12.360
Old school gamers. Old school gamers.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.320
It doesn't matter which way you dice it, it's kind of accurate, right?

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:23.960
It is. Well, and this is coming from a dude who's old too, so. But I also ran across Exodos,

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:30.440
which you can pull down their torrent and they're 7000 DOS games. I'm assuming a lot

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.480
of these 2500 that were pushed up to archive.org are there if you wanted to play them in your

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:41.960
own DOS box. But they've already been configured to work under DOS box. So they're freeware

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.520
shareware games that I've guessed just have eventually gone free. So take a look at those

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.760
if you want to get your old school gaming on for sure.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.560
You guys are good for the rest of the show, right? Because I know what I'm doing with

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560
the rest of my day.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:02.040
Can I admit something? I have gotten into something that is shameful. And it's I blame

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:08.640
the algorithm. I blame YouTube. So back in the day, I back in the early I don't know

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.360
whatever it was 90s or whatever I played this game. It was my it was the it was the game

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.760
that really drew me in. And it was called Star Trek the 25th anniversary. It's one of

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:21.640
those games I started playing at 8pm. And then I looked up at the clock the next time

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:26.760
and it was 3am. And I'd been playing all night. And I found this dude who has been playing

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:35.640
them online in 35 minute increments. And I'm like on part 12 of his journey of playing

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.400
this game at 35 minutes at a time.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.800
Do the multiplication there.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:46.000
It's so bad was so I maybe I'll take a break and I'll go check out archive.org. Cuz I think

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.900
I think I don't know it feels like after a while it's like what am I doing with myself?

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:55.000
But what I do is I put it up while I'm working. You know, so I'm working away. Got myself

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.760
a little extension for Firefox so I can do video picture and picture for YouTube and

01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.760
I just go to work.

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.680
I will admit I'm browsing the list right now.

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.360
What I like to that they all fire up within the browser. So it's all emulated within the

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:12.160
browser. I'm not sure what they're doing there to do that. But this might also be the moment

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:19.160
you want to set up an emergency hotkey. So when your boss walks in, my boss, my boss

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.760
Yeah, I think you gotta worry about your boss.
