1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Open source knows no bounds, Mr. Westpain.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,320
A team of astronomers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,960
has successfully developed software

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,000
that can simulate the complex vibrations that stars produce.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,320
Listen to that.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,520
It's not remarkable.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,160
In a way, it is, though.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,360
Kind of lovely.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,200
It's really impressive.

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,720
I don't really think I never would

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,720
have seen the day when open source software was

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,560
simulating the sounds of stars.

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,280
How the heck did they pull this off?

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,000
Actually, it's pretty neat.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,920
So as the stars undergoing fusion and outputting

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,880
a bunch of energy, there's just fluctuations that happen.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,000
And those can tell scientists a lot

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,800
about the structure and undergoing dynamic processes

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,040
within the star.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,520
You can measure that stuff with telescopes.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,560
And then, so really, this is two different pieces of software

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,280
combined together.

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,900
Because on one set, you have the simulation software,

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,320
which is used to build models that

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,800
can be checked against measurements from our sun,

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,760
for instance.

27
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,400
And then the other side is the software

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,360
that takes those oscillations in the star,

29
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,400
and that can be in brightness or temperature

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
or in the radius of the star itself,

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,160
and then converts those to the sound waves we hear.

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,700
Now, as you might have guessed, it

33
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,100
does have to pitch shift it up by a thousand or a million

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,440
times or so.

35
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,480
Yeah, because these starquakes, as they're called,

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,280
happen a little infrequently.

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,960
So you have to speed it up a bit to really enjoy it.

38
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,080
And if starquake isn't good enough,

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
this whole field is astro-seismology.

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:47,960
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 301 for May 14, 2019.

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,720
Oh, hi there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

42
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,640
My name is Chris.

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,480
My name is Wes.

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,760
Hello, Mr. Payne.

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,640
We've made it over the 300 hump.

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,600
Ooh, I'm proud of us.

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,320
Lucky 301.

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,760
I feel like it's a lucky episode.

49
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,280
This is one of those special episodes

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,280
where we can actually claim thousands of miles and dollars

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
went into its making.

52
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,160
We did our research.

53
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,880
Yeah, we went to Red Hat Summit last week in Boston.

54
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,760
And I don't know what I went in expecting,

55
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,200
but I walked away with some stories, some impressions,

56
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,640
and a completely different perspective on Red Hat

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
and the upcoming IBM merger.

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
I feel like you maybe have had the same impressions,

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
same kind of takeaway.

60
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
Oh, yeah, but we're not going to spoil it now.

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,160
And we've got a lot more to talk about in this episode.

62
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,660
That's right.

63
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,760
We've got community news.

64
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Plus, we've got a chat with someone very special

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,480
later on in the show who's going to help

66
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,180
us identify if our Linux box has been compromised.

67
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,100
It's really awesome.

68
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,000
It's part of a study group we're doing later.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,760
But before we get to any of that,

70
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,680
we've got to bring in that virtual lug,

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,560
time appropriate.

72
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,280
Greetings, Mumble Room.

73
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,600
Hello, everybody.

74
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,100
Hello.

75
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,600
Hello.

76
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Hey, what's up, man?

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,840
Wow, hello to cheese.

78
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,920
Hello to Neil.

79
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,040
Hello to Elle.

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
Hello to Brent.

81
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,720
Hello to Alex.

82
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,680
Hello to Bruce.

83
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,440
Hello to Cassidy from elementary OS.

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
And we have, what is that, Demd in there.

85
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,080
We also have, I'm going to say Mario.

86
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
It's not Mario.

87
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,160
But the first part of it's Mario.

88
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,320
So I'm saying Mario.

89
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Neil Burner and Turth are all in the virtual lug today.

90
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,040
Close enough.

91
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,320
Yeah, thank you.

92
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,120
Thanks for being generous on that one.

93
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,160
You can participate, too.

94
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,400
More information at irc.geekshed.net.

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,360
Once you get in there, pound Mumble, irc.geekshed.net.

96
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,880
And there's hashtag Jupiter Broadcasting for the chat room.

97
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,440
All right.

98
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,320
Well, let's get through some community news,

99
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,600
because we do have so, so, so much to talk about today.

100
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
Very excited to share some exclusive clips

101
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,080
from Red Hat Summit.

102
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,880
And I was really trying to wrap my head around how

103
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,720
we were going to even put a trip like that into the show.

104
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,880
I went to Boston.

105
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,920
Wes went to Boston and cheese.

106
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,040
And we went and got in as press.

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
We were able to attend the press track.

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
And we could have come on the show today

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,560
with a bunch of canned interviews from spokespersons

110
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,400
and just really railed you with spokesperson interviews.

111
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,280
But not only would that sort of be high-level information,

112
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,400
but it would kind of come across as a sales pitch.

113
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,240
And that's not really what we wanted to do.

114
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,360
And I thought, you know, Wes, not a lot of people

115
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,400
get an opportunity to do something like this.

116
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,360
And as somebody who's done trade events in the past

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
for years and years and years, I went to Red Hat Summit.

118
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,640
And I just came away with a completely different mindset

119
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,680
about a lot of things.

120
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,760
And I thought, maybe we can encapsulate some

121
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,000
of that into the show.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,720
Like, what's the experience like?

123
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,800
And what kind of insights do you get into Red Hat

124
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
when you attend an event, when you get really close like this?

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,520
It was definitely a new view for me.

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
And I had a few assumptions going in that probably

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,360
didn't bear out.

128
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,120
I was right on a few things, too.

129
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,640
But it was just a lot bigger and more complicated

130
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,920
than I could have ever dreamed.

131
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,120
Yeah, so I'm really excited with our take on it.

132
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,040
And so stay tuned for that.

133
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Neil was at Red Hat Summit as well.

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
And he's in the Mumble Room with us.

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,520
Hey, but a big story out of GitHub today.

136
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,040
And I thought maybe Wes could help us break it down.

137
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,520
Apparently, GitHub now is offering a package registry

138
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,040
that you can publish and consume packages within your own org,

139
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,040
or you could publish to the whole world and make it public.

140
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,120
What is this?

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,880
OK, really, it's more efforts in their goal

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,560
to create and enable you to create end-to-end DevOps

143
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,840
workflows that include your code, CI, and deployment solutions,

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,640
especially if you're integrating and leveraging GitHub's APIs,

145
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,200
actions, webhooks, and all the permissions-based infrastructure

146
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,560
that already exists.

147
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,640
So that's a lot of what you just said there.

148
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
It's pretty thick.

149
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,520
But to cut through it, if I'm already

150
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,360
pretty deep in the GitHub infrastructure,

151
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,280
maybe I use it for some authentication stuff,

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
this just makes it easier.

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,640
Yeah, I mean, you already have your packages up there.

154
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,680
So if you're going to go build a Ruby package today,

155
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,600
maybe you keep your code, it's open source, it's on GitHub,

156
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,720
well, you've got to go work with other providers, maybe

157
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,520
like RubyGems, or you're managing

158
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,640
your own private repository that, if you're lucky,

159
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,360
integrates with GitHub.

160
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,560
But you probably have to have separate authentication

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,000
and manage actions, which, as you will recall,

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
perhaps GitHub just recently has their own,

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,040
they call them actions, but sort of CICD-type platform

164
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,160
that can perform automated deployments or updates

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
or distribute software.

166
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,160
Yeah.

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,620
You had to have separate things.

168
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,480
And Nexus, or one of the other big competing artifact

169
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,760
repositories, GitHub's saying it's just easier.

170
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,640
We'll do it for you.

171
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,800
We have first class CDN support.

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960
And during the beta, it's free.

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,400
What is the consumption side like?

174
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,640
As a user, how do I add these repositories to my system?

175
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,720
Is it dependent on the language I'm using?

176
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,600
What is the consumption side of it look like?

177
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,360
Yeah, exactly.

178
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,200
So they're not reinventing the wheel.

179
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,400
Right now, they have support for Docker, Maven, NPM,

180
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,440
NuGet, which is for the.NET platform, and RubyGems.

181
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,760
And you notice.NET in there.

182
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,560
For me, what was missing was Python support.

183
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,080
So that kind of shows that there's maybe

184
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,400
a little Microsoft influence going on there.

185
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,780
Maybe not.

186
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,920
Basically, all those clients have different ways

187
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,520
that you can say, add this additional repository,

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,040
or I would like to interact with this repository.

189
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,700
And now GitHub is implementing all that stuff

190
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,640
in their own back end, which it sounds like they hope.

191
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,840
They did use the word hope.

192
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,040
I don't know what that means.

193
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,680
They hope to open source this summer.

194
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
What?

195
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,720
That does sort of trigger me a little bit when you get that.

196
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
Oh, yeah, I totally hope to make, like, FaceTime.

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,520
Apple hopes to make FaceTime open source one day.

198
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
We're getting there.

199
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,280
So they have some examples set up.

200
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,400
In a limited beta, you can go request access

201
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,600
if you'd like to give it a try.

202
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,640
And really, you know what, there's a release tab

203
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,520
right there when you go look to find stuff.

204
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
Now there's just an additional sub-tab there

205
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,140
that says packages, and it'll show you

206
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,320
all the different packages.

207
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,720
It uses all the metadata you might have in your readme

208
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,280
to populate all the package information for you.

209
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,120
And if you've already set up team access to controls, who

210
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,920
can update and push to your repo,

211
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,440
those will work with the packaging system as well.

212
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,840
The teams aspect's nice.

213
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,120
I could definitely see that's maybe the big push here.

214
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,160
That's probably the main focus right there.

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,280
Yeah, that is a Microsoft move.

216
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,400
OK, well, I thank you for explaining that to me.

217
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,860
I saw that story go by, and I knew you'd

218
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,360
be able to break it down for me.

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,080
Now I have a question for the class today.

220
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,120
And maybe we can solve it, or maybe the audience

221
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,040
can send me in some feedback at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

222
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,880
But my 10-year-old son, Dylan, he's

223
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,200
had a Dell XPS Sputnik laptop for three years now, I think.

224
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,120
That sounds like something we've talked about.

225
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,440
One of the older generations?

226
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,160
Yeah, I remember the version of elementary OS

227
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,120
he first had was based on Ubuntu 14.04.

228
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
And he's running whatever the most current version you

229
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,960
can run on 32-bit hardware is.

230
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,920
But that's where the problem lies,

231
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,640
is it's an old XPS that's 32-bit only.

232
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
And Linux really is moving on.

233
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,760
And this is where it's hitting me,

234
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,480
is Dylan is getting limited on some of the things

235
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,360
he wants to do with his computer,

236
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,800
and he feels like it's time for an upgrade.

237
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,400
And of course, all this is incredible.

238
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,920
It's like going back in time.

239
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,800
All of his friends are telling him to get Windows 10.

240
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,360
Wait, really?

241
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,120
Yeah, yeah, because they want to play it.

242
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,480
That Windows peer pressure, man.

243
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,240
It's just the games.

244
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,800
It's all games.

245
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
For them, it's all games.

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
It's all about the games.

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
100% about the games.

248
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,800
Nothing but the games.

249
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,480
And you didn't just tell them about Proton.

250
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,560
That wasn't your solution.

251
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,180
I was going to go into the whole pitch.

252
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,280
But I wasn't sure what to even do,

253
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,480
because this isn't something I want to spend

254
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,960
an incredible amount of money on.

255
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,520
But he's taken really good care of it.

256
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,000
It's still, three years later, nothing wrong with it.

257
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,800
And it's clearly learning and using the system.

258
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Yeah, and he's maintained it, and he's added to it,

259
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,720
and modified it.

260
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,600
And he's gotten accessories hooked up,

261
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
and external monitors, and all that kind of stuff.

262
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,260
So I like to encourage it.

263
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,920
So I thought I should get him another long-lasting laptop

264
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,640
that would run Linux really well.

265
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,320
And I really, really like my T480,

266
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,640
with the one major exception, is it

267
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,200
doesn't have dedicated graphics.

268
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
And a big part of what he wants to do is play video games.

269
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
So Intel integrated isn't going to cut it.

270
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,600
And I can't do any GPU for him, because it's like,

271
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
that's going to be fidgety, complicated.

272
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,080
And he wants to take it to his friend's house to play games.

273
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,440
So it's like its number one job.

274
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,760
So it'd be nice to have it internal.

275
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,520
Well, there may be a solution starting at the end of May.

276
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Lenovo is adding the AMD Ryzen Pro-powered line

277
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,520
to its ThinkPad lineup.

278
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,120
The new T495 and T495S, and also the X395 laptops,

279
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
are all powered by AMD's Ryzen 7 Pro processors

280
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,240
with integrated Vega graphics.

281
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,760
So I have questions about that with the audience.

282
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,360
But that seems like a promising hardware setup.

283
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,400
Yeah, both of the T models are 14-inch laptops,

284
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,560
and the X395 is 13 inches.

285
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,840
And really, they look almost identical

286
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,560
to the Intel-based laptops, because they are.

287
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,660
Lenovo just took the same frames and stuck AMD APUs inside.

288
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,960
Yeah, really, that's just the biggest differences.

289
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,720
According to Lenovo, the second-gen AMD Ryzen 7 Pro

290
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,640
processors, combined with the integrated Vega graphics,

291
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,160
should provide an 18% improvement in performance

292
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,060
over previous T4 models.

293
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,040
If you go with the base T495, you're

294
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,240
looking at something like $939.

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,400
Anything else starts at around $1,089.

296
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,820
Yeah, so I mean, I think that puts it in the running.

297
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm also going to look at the System76 lineup.

298
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,920
I really don't want to spend probably more than $1,100.

299
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,520
That's sort of like my max, I think, for this kind of thing.

300
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,320
For the kid laptop.

301
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
It's a high risk, you know?

302
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,360
I think that does seem like a pretty decent idea.

303
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
They are rugged.

304
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,640
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,800
And I would imagine those would run Linux great.

306
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,240
I was going to recommend the Pinebook Pro,

307
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,000
but it might not be so well for games.

308
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,480
Yeah, yeah, that has crossed my mind a lot,

309
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,160
or something equivalent.

310
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,760
But it really does come down to he

311
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,120
wants to run games that run on x86.

312
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,720
And if it doesn't solve that problem,

313
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,760
then he's going to continue to think about Windows

314
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,480
every now and then.

315
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,080
Because every now and then, he brings it up.

316
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,680
So could my computer run Windows, Dad?

317
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Oh, you poor man.

318
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,480
Well, Dylan, not really, no.

319
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,160
Oh, no.

320
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,360
So I got to make sure that I measure twice and cut once

321
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,160
on this next move here.

322
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,320
It's important.

323
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,680
And maybe for ultimate gaming performance,

324
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,760
we'll load them up with clear Linux this time.

325
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Now, I'm very excited to report that I

326
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,280
think another one of my predictions

327
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,440
is chiming right along, along with dark mode

328
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,600
for the web and a few others.

329
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,840
We now have some clear Linux hype,

330
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,480
as well as a clear push for clear Linux on the desktop.

331
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,960
And not only is it well known now

332
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,240
for its performance on Intel systems,

333
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,680
but they've made some big user desktop-friendly changes

334
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,280
recently.

335
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,600
Yeah, this week actually just saw some further improvements

336
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,880
to their relatively new graphical installer.

337
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,560
They actually only added this last year.

338
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,520
Before then, it was just a text installer,

339
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,920
which Michael Areable definitely prefers.

340
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,280
I think I might as well, because honestly, their text

341
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,160
installer is pretty solid.

342
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,000
But now, they also have a graphical installer that,

343
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,600
I mean, it looks pretty much up to par with Anaconda

344
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,240
or Ubiquiti.

345
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,480
Yeah, and I think that was the straw that

346
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,040
broke Jason's back over at, you know,

347
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,600
Jason Evangelo from Forbes and also from Choose Linux.

348
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,040
He gave it a go now that they have

349
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,080
the new graphical installer.

350
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,800
And he wrote up his impressions over at Forbes.

351
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
And I bet we'll be hearing more from him about it

352
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,040
in some podcasts soon, too.

353
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,080
But I'll link to that in the show notes

354
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,760
if you want to read his impressions.

355
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,040
And he talks about how it ships with Flatpak support out

356
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
of the box.

357
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,680
And they have 4,000 applications in bundles.

358
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,120
So there is quite a bit of software,

359
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
more than you might expect.

360
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,400
It doesn't run so good in a VM, I've discovered.

361
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
I've discovered that.

362
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,760
Another interesting clear Linux news item

363
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,600
is if you're in the Portland, Oregon area at the Intel Hawthorne

364
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
campus, I think it's called, the Hawthorne Farm,

365
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,560
in the HF3 auditorium, they will have their very first

366
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,200
clear Linux meetup.

367
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,740
I'm always hanging around there.

368
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,440
I am actually really, really tempted to go.

369
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,240
I'm kind of looking into it.

370
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,960
It's next week.

371
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,120
It's May 22, 2019, at 3 PM to 8.30 PM.

372
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,500
There's going to be refreshments.

373
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,360
It looks like there'll actually be a dinner break, too.

374
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,400
But there'll be some demos, some architecture overviews,

375
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,760
and some hands-on workshops.

376
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,480
Does it say who might be there from the project?

377
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,320
No, but they talk about a panel being there.

378
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,200
So that seems like it's a pretty good chance of some people

379
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,160
to know what they're talking about.

380
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,520
And since it's an Intel project at an Intel campus,

381
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,360
I'm really kind of, I mean, Portland's

382
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,600
like a four-hour drive from here.

383
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,960
I'm kind of thinking about it.

384
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,920
It just would take up a huge chunk of the day.

385
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,400
It's a whole day there, yeah.

386
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,600
But that seems really neat.

387
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
So I'll link to that in the show notes, too,

388
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
if you're in the area and you might be able to go.

389
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,420
It's interesting how they kind of started

390
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,940
with technical foundations.

391
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,360
I mean, you can see how Intel would have their own Linux just

392
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,600
to, you know, they work with computers.

393
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,640
OK, sure.

394
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,160
And now they're kind of bootstrapping a desktop

395
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,960
community around it.

396
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Interesting to watch.

397
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,120
Yeah.

398
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,800
Yeah, and totally called it.

399
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Sorry, I just got to get my, you know.

400
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
Fair enough.

401
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,040
And then I just, now I'm sort of following the ULauncher

402
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
project, because God bless it if it doesn't make XFCE just

403
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,720
perfect.

404
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,520
Yeah, ULauncher on top of XFCE.

405
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,200
You mean it fixes the flaws in your inferior desktop, Chris?

406
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,760
Wow.

407
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,260
Wow.

408
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,200
No, I'm just kidding.

409
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,920
Wow, dude.

410
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,400
You're coming at me over here.

411
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,380
You're coming at me with this.

412
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,880
I know.

413
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,960
That's totally unfair, man.

414
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,920
Shots fired, guys.

415
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,080
It does sort of lack in the launcher department, though.

416
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,160
I mean, the toolbar icons are all good and stuff,

417
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
but I don't want to take my hands off the keyboard.

418
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,360
It's 2019.

419
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
That's right.

420
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,520
I want to party like it's 1980.

421
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,160
So I install ULauncher, and then I just have a Control Space,

422
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,560
and I type in the first three letters of any application,

423
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,840
Enter, and they launch.

424
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,080
And they're making a move.

425
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,520
Obviously, they have to move from Python 2 to Python 3,

426
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,520
but they're also extending their API.

427
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,040
They're temporarily dropping support

428
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,300
for OpenSUSE and CentOS, and they're

429
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,640
seeking for contributors.

430
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,520
If you need a great application launcher for your desktop,

431
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,920
give you go.

432
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,840
Give you go a go?

433
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,920
Give you launcher a go.

434
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,840
Try you go.

435
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,560
It's ULauncher for humans.

436
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,160
You go.

437
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,600
All right, so I just thought we could ask the room,

438
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,000
take the temperature of a phrase that's gotten kicked around

439
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,880
a lot over the years.

440
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,640
In fact, I don't think any of us have ever

441
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,800
declared it in the 13-plus years of broadcasting

442
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,480
on this network.

443
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,600
But is 2019 the year of the Linux desktop?

444
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Isn't every year?

445
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,040
No, no.

446
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,560
Let's just do a little math here.

447
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,280
Yeah, can there ever be one year?

448
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,400
What are the rules?

449
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,560
Here's the math of it.

450
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,820
Number one, all Chromebooks in 2019 shipping

451
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,680
will support running Linux applications

452
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,920
and launch Linux environments.

453
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,640
But bigger than that, obviously, that's a huge deal.

454
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,160
Let's not just dismiss it, but bigger than that,

455
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,360
the Windows subsystem for Linux version 2

456
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:44,840
will be shipping a Linux kernel, a 4.19 LTS Linux kernel.

457
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,980
Windows 10 will have an embedded Linux system in it

458
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,640
if just, let's say, a small percentage

459
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,800
of the nearly billion users they plan

460
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,800
to have with Windows 10 fires up the Windows subsystem

461
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
for Linux.

462
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,280
We may, over the course of the rest of 2019,

463
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,760
end up with more users than we've ever had on the desktop.

464
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,480
It'll just be a Windows desktop, but they'll

465
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,680
be using a Linux kernel in a Linux user land.

466
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,960
I'm very, very conflicted about this,

467
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,640
because the Chrome OS one is easier to state.

468
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,840
It's like, OK, because of Wayland,

469
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,120
they're able to pull this off reasonably well.

470
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,880
But for Windows, it's like, well, yeah, they're

471
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,400
running a Linux kernel, but they're

472
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,800
gimping it so that running desktop applications is not

473
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,320
going to be easy or usable.

474
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,400
No, you just get better desktop applications.

475
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Right, and so it's my feeling about this

476
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,880
is it'll actually incentivize people to pull away from Linux.

477
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
Sure, because you can run your Linux games.

478
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
You can run Adobe Photoshop.

479
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,360
You can have Adobe Premiere.

480
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,840
And you can run your Linux command line stuff.

481
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,040
Right, and virtually all Linux games

482
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,640
compiled to natively on Windows.

483
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,600
So if you're already on Windows, why

484
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,920
would you run the Linux version?

485
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,880
And it's a pain in the butt to actually make

486
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,480
the Linux version of a game actually run in WSL,

487
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,000
as someone who has actually tried.

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,480
It is annoying and difficult. So I'm very conflicted,

489
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,640
because on one hand, it shows that Microsoft recognizes

490
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,360
there's no substitutes or imitations for a Linux kernel.

491
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,400
But on the other hand, it feels like a defeat wrapped

492
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,800
in a victory, because it will make it easier for people

493
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,920
to just completely ignore Linux and run Windows

494
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,000
full time for everything.

495
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,240
On the other hand, there are environments

496
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,560
where you literally don't get a choice.

497
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,160
And this opens that door.

498
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,400
I mean, I used to work in an environment where

499
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,480
I was forced to run Windows for work.

500
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
And if I had had this as an option,

501
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,920
I would have totally used it then.

502
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,600
Yeah, so I think that's just it.

503
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
So I want to make it clear.

504
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,920
I'm playing devil's advocate.

505
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,240
I don't necessarily think the applications are better.

506
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,640
And I think the fundamental issue is it's still Windows.

507
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,840
It's still Windows.

508
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,280
But if you are forced to use it, if you

509
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,040
are in a constrained environment,

510
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,680
this is a great opportunity.

511
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,840
And it absolutely is an admission from Microsoft

512
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,760
that developers want true blue Linux.

513
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,960
It's good today.

514
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,560
It gets more people using Linux.

515
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,440
It gets more people in the Linux user land.

516
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,880
It actually, in a funny way, also

517
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,480
makes it easier to transition from Windows to full desktop

518
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,200
Linux, if you think about it.

519
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
I think we should acknowledge, too,

520
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,960
that many of the people who stay on desktop Linux

521
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,160
are there because they want to for philosophical reasons

522
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,200
or because they enjoy it.

523
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,760
But acknowledge that there are trade-offs they make.

524
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,280
So we, by and large, I think, collect people that know that

525
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,040
and like the Linux desktop.

526
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,320
So if they can discover it through Windows,

527
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,480
that might mean a new influx of Linux users

528
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,800
that would have never been brought over to our platform.

529
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm wondering, Alex, if you think

530
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,560
this is going to be a good thing and see where I'm going,

531
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,040
where people will try it out, they

532
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,920
can get familiar with the Linux user land, and then move over.

533
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,480
Or if you think it's more like Devil's Advocate, Chris,

534
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,600
that says people are going to stick with Windows now

535
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,800
and just use the utility command line.

536
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,920
Do you think there's a clear winner or loser here?

537
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,300
Is it that simple?

538
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,960
I still flirt with Windows.

539
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,920
I have a VM that runs with PCI pass-through for a graphics

540
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,360
card.

541
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,040
It took me the longest time to actually switch and make

542
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,200
it stick on the Linux desktop.

543
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,560
I think I agree with the previous caller

544
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,940
that it's going to make it harder for some people

545
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,320
to actually ditch Windows.

546
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,920
It's going to be too comfy for a lot of people.

547
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,960
And then putty is fine as it was.

548
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,880
Yeah, I think largely the year of the Linux desktop is coming.

549
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,400
Is it this year?

550
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,600
It's every year, isn't it?

551
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,100
It is.

552
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,760
I know.

553
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,440
It's so funny.

554
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,480
It's just such a cliche thing to throw out there

555
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,040
that this whole conversation feels

556
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,360
like it's getting cliche, to be honest with you.

557
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,560
And I think it's hard to really gauge long term

558
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,080
where this is going.

559
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,440
To the point I was trying to poke you with there,

560
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,720
it's like, is this a good thing, is this a bad thing?

561
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,960
To clear it up, it's a good thing today.

562
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,760
It may be a bad thing tomorrow.

563
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,260
It depends on how long Microsoft can

564
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,560
continue to convert their brick and mortar on-premises clients

565
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,160
to Azure clients.

566
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,640
As long as that low-hanging fruit exists,

567
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,720
then this is great.

568
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,640
This is great because it makes Microsoft more money.

569
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,880
Getting people into their software as a service, AKA

570
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,800
Azure, is fantastic.

571
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,680
So everybody wins.

572
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,720
Once all of that low-hanging fruit has been plucked,

573
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,320
and now they need to sort of tighten down

574
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,380
the ratchets a little bit, they need to leverage the ecosystem

575
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,080
a little bit, they need to maybe create a little more lock-in

576
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,200
to get a little more revenue, then things could change.

577
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
But that could be 5, 10 years down the road.

578
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,680
So you just have to just accept it for what it is today.

579
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,000
It does mean more people using open source.

580
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,720
And there's so many areas of improvement.

581
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,760
Cassie, I'd love to get your take on areas of improvement

582
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,360
or just this overall story, and then I think we'll move on.

583
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,040
Yeah, I think it's kind of twofold.

584
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,120
One, it's Microsoft trying to just stop bleeding users

585
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,320
to Linux, but also Mac OS with that Unix kernel.

586
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,080
Developer tools tend to be aimed to Mac OS more than Windows.

587
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,920
So I don't know that it's really going

588
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,640
to shift people who would be using Linux anyway.

589
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,760
It's really just people who might be leaving Windows

590
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,960
to Mac OS or Linux.

591
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,640
But then also, it just drives home

592
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,760
why Linux-based desktops should focus

593
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,220
on user experience and their own ecosystems

594
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,320
instead of just happening to run a Linux kernel.

595
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,040
That Linux kernel is awesome and amazing

596
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,060
and has enabled so many incredible things,

597
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,120
but it's not the end-all, be-all experience of every desktop.

598
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,520
That's a good point.

599
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,920
That's a good point, Cassidy.

600
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,080
It's like you have thought about that before.

601
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,560
That's the impression I'm getting there.

602
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,840
I agree with Joe from LAN, where it's

603
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
like where is Apple's developer story?

604
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,080
Microsoft's is very, very clear for us all to see now.

605
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,320
Well, I think you have to keep in mind

606
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,580
that Microsoft's quote unquote story is about getting

607
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,280
you to use Azure.

608
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
All roads lead to Azure.

609
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,120
That's right.

610
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,800
Right.

611
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,640
Yeah, that's as I always say.

612
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,080
And so that's where this plays a big role in that.

613
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,680
There's Windows Subsystem for Linux.

614
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,400
Apple, they couldn't give two shits.

615
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,560
They're not trying to sell a hosted service for you

616
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,120
to develop on.

617
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,180
It's not a platform.

618
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,120
They want you to write apps for their phones.

619
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,160
And so they don't need a big, strong Linux play.

620
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,560
They don't need that, whereas Microsoft

621
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,040
does need that to be part of their quote unquote developer

622
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,000
story, as we like to say now.

623
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,080
All right, hold it there.

624
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,920
Hold it there, because we have to continue on.

625
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,840
And I have to cover a couple of things

626
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,240
that we just need to clear out before we get to the Red Hat

627
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,440
Summit stuff, because once we get to the Red Hat Summit

628
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,560
stuff, we're going full force.

629
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,640
So a little housekeeping first before we continue.

630
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,960
First and foremost, we've sort of sneaky

631
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,240
launched a new show, just like out of nowhere.

632
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,560
It was just something we started doing.

633
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,880
And then we're like, OK, we should probably publish this.

634
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,400
Whoops.

635
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,280
It's the Friday stream, fridaystream.com.

636
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,340
We just released A Fluffle of Fools.

637
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,080
You can meet Drew and learn just what a Fluffle might be.

638
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,960
Yeah, and also the best 39 seconds from the Red Hat

639
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,560
Summit.

640
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
Not in this show, no.

641
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,040
Yeah, we decided to save it for the Friday stream.

642
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,760
It's worth it.

643
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,920
Plus, we were also caught up in the middle of an Uber Lyft

644
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,860
protest.

645
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,720
So we busted out the microphone and got a little audio of that

646
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,040
for the Friday stream.

647
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,420
But the Friday stream is really just a chance

648
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,800
for you to come meet the crew.

649
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
It's sort of just a chat show.

650
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,860
We have a larger crew now that works full time on these shows.

651
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,440
So we have a little more time to dedicate to stuff like this.

652
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,680
And we wanted to have a moment to connect with our community.

653
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,200
So we are doing it live.

654
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,520
We don't do as many live shows anymore.

655
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,080
So we'll have a chat room going.

656
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,740
And we'll bring on different members of the crew each week.

657
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,320
And tell stories, and give each other a hard time,

658
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,440
and chat with the community.

659
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,640
And talk about things that are going on in the community

660
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,160
as well.

661
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,240
So it's really a show about nothing.

662
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,400
So fridaystream.com.

663
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Way to sell it, Chris.

664
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,920
A show about nothing.

665
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,200
Yay, that's a classic, isn't it?

666
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,680
We all like Seinfeld, right?

667
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,320
So check it out, fridaystream.com.

668
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,840
And slash three is the latest one.

669
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,960
Now, there's an event coming up that we

670
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
haven't talked a lot about because so much is going on.

671
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,880
But we're very excited about Texas Linux Fest.

672
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,560
2019's Texas Linux Fest is just around the corner,

673
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,160
May 31st and June 1st.

674
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,360
And rumor has it, Elle is involved to some degree.

675
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,520
Remind the audience, Elle.

676
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,400
Of course, not me.

677
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Of course, I remember Elle.

678
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,400
But you're somewhat involved at Texas Linux Fest this year.

679
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,560
Yeah, this is my third year to be involved.

680
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,760
And I'm going to be helping coordinate all the volunteers

681
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,220
this year, making sure that things run smoothly.

682
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,120
Look at you.

683
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,880
You are humble about it, but she's

684
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,320
like the glue holding the whole thing together.

685
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,200
And so it's important to us and Elle that everybody goes.

686
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,680
Maybe you weren't considering going to Texas this year.

687
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,360
Well, here's an opportunity.

688
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,600
Texas Linux Fest, we'll have a link in the show note.

689
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,360
Registration is now open.

690
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,480
What can we say about it, Elle?

691
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,680
Where are things at right now?

692
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,080
What stage in the event planning is it at?

693
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,560
Give us a little behind the scenes information.

694
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,460
Behind the scenes, I think things

695
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,680
are kind of closing up on getting all of our speakers

696
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,440
organized.

697
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm so excited because there's so many talks

698
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,040
that I want to attend.

699
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,120
So I can only imagine that other people are

700
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,520
going to be really excited to see the lineup.

701
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,520
And it's available on the website now.

702
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,960
The actual conference center has been organized.

703
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,800
And we know we're going to put everything.

704
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,920
But we are short on volunteers.

705
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,960
If anyone can donate a little bit of time,

706
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,080
I'd be really thankful.

707
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,200
OK.

708
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,720
I'm going to be down there.

709
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,880
She's going to be there.

710
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,160
Elle's going to be there.

711
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,700
And of course, Alex is going to be there.

712
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,600
So come say hi to your friends from Linux

713
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,200
Unplugged at Texas Linux Fest this year in just a little bit.

714
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,760
Links to that stuff in the show notes, of course.

715
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,840
I should also mention, come watch us live.

716
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,680
Hang out with us.

717
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,120
Join the Mumble Room, all that stuff.

718
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,600
Get it converted in your local time

719
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,320
at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

720
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
jbliv.tv for that, yes.

721
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,840
OK.

722
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,760
So Red Hat Summit came and went.

723
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,320
We've wanted to go for years.

724
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,440
And to Red Hat's credit, they've invited and accepted.

725
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,200
And it's just never freaking worked out.

726
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,320
It's a really, really expensive thing to pull off.

727
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,440
So it's in Boston.

728
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,760
And Boston's not a cheap place to live.

729
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,400
The hotel rooms per night, per person, were like $3.80 a night.

730
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,880
So we immediately decided, that's way too much.

731
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,480
Let's get an Airbnb.

732
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,920
So we got a crew Airbnb, which was a ton of fun.

733
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,000
And we got it in South Boston, just 2.6 miles

734
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,200
from the convention center.

735
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,560
So it was just a cheap Uber ride away, or Lyft ride,

736
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,160
assuming they were working that day.

737
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,660
And it was a pretty remarkable week.

738
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,840
We got in really late.

739
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,080
We got in around 11 PM.

740
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,400
All of us arrived at the airport,

741
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
which I'm just going to be frank here.

742
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,640
The Boston airport's the worst airport I've ever been to.

743
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,640
We got in at 11 and then spent an hour trying to find cheese.

744
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,520
Cheese was just lost.

745
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,600
Turns out, too, you can't go through certain areas

746
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,080
of the airport without re-going through security.

747
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,400
So when we were leaving, we got trapped in the airport

748
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,900
straight up for four hours.

749
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,080
Because Hadia, the problem child that she is,

750
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
just got her name changed.

751
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,320
Well, not just, but we were married not too long ago.

752
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,120
You know, she changed her name to your name.

753
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,680
You should come out and acknowledge that.

754
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,600
Honestly, what's great, too, is her ID

755
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,240
showed up the day we got back with her new name on it.

756
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,120
No.

757
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,980
But TSA doesn't like it when you have

758
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,000
one name on your boarding pass and a different name on your ID.

759
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,460
They make you do the extensive, extensive,

760
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,040
we're going to touch all your parts security check.

761
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,960
Oh, she got a pat down.

762
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah, she sure did.

763
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
So once we got through all of that,

764
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,520
we woke up really early, Tuesday morning, as you can tell.

765
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,000
And we got right inside the Red Hat Expo

766
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,800
and started getting the feel for things.

767
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,560
And I tuned in on something.

768
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,120
We're inside the Red Hat Summit Expo Hall.

769
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,040
There is a lot of people, and there's also a lot of Red Hats.

770
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,600
I already have Red Hat envy.

771
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,120
God, I'm the worst.

772
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,440
I feel like the people walking around with the Red Hats

773
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,920
are like the more dedicated.

774
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,880
Oh, they're the cool kids of the event, obviously.

775
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,680
Yeah, definitely.

776
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
I have that same feeling.

777
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,120
I feel like we're underdressed without a Red Hat.

778
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,460
Turns out we were actually dead on.

779
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,960
Later on, I tried to get myself a Red Hat.

780
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,840
I went to their swag store, which was reasonably priced.

781
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,720
And I asked them about the Red Hats.

782
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,040
They're like, oh, no, no, no.

783
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,920
We don't sell those hats.

784
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,400
In fact, the hats are so coveted that Monday night,

785
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,880
a gang of thugs came in and stole a bunch of fedora hats.

786
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
You have to earn these hats, apparently.

787
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,000
Or you have to be a vendor that spends so much money

788
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,840
with Red Hat that they give you a hat.

789
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,280
Third option, which we may have researched,

790
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,080
they're about $23 online.

791
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,040
Yeah, yeah.

792
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,780
Could I clarify something?

793
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,360
You get a woollen Red Hat fedora as part

794
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,520
of New High orientation.

795
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,760
I was lucky enough to go through two of those last year.

796
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,520
So I had one in Europe and one in the US.

797
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,840
So I actually have two hats.

798
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,160
So ha ha.

799
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,600
Oh, you bastard.

800
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,160
Oh, oh, that's great.

801
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,280
Yeah, no, it was funny because it wasn't just the hats.

802
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,800
There's other things, like there's badges with flair.

803
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,120
There's red shoes.

804
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
There's red jackets.

805
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,580
There's other things that sort of signal different status

806
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,080
in the Red Hat community.

807
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,480
Like, I started picking up on that stuff pretty quickly.

808
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,400
And it was fascinating.

809
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,240
But it didn't feel like aggressive or bad.

810
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,040
No, you can just tell there's a lot of pride

811
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,960
about people being there.

812
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,680
Yeah, people that are prideful, like season

813
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,920
pros have been there since the late 90s.

814
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,560
And they just kind of went all out.

815
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,240
It's kind of fun to see.

816
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,280
It was pretty great.

817
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,160
And of course, we always had Mr. Wes Payne,

818
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,820
as I called him, the badge watcher.

819
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,680
Wes Payne, badge watcher.

820
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,200
So he's our dedicated badge observer,

821
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
checking out the company names, the styles.

822
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,960
What do you see in Wes?

823
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,160
So far, a lot of big industry.

824
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,060
We got Lockheed Martin and a lot of academics.

825
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,880
I've seen probably six or seven university badges represented

826
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,380
already.

827
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,560
So clearly big deployments of Rel out there.

828
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,340
Oh, yeah.

829
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,840
All right, Bacon's got his new lens.

830
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,120
Time to go inside the Expo Hall.

831
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,760
Bacon's got his new lens.

832
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,000
Now, let's fast forward to the keynote.

833
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,680
This was great.

834
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,280
So instead of being in the morning,

835
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,360
God bless them, they did it in the afternoon

836
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
after everybody was kind of done doing their thing.

837
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
So you didn't have to get up super early.

838
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,760
They transformed the second half of the Expo Hall

839
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,560
into a magic show.

840
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,240
They turned off the lights.

841
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,440
They pumped it full of steam, of fog,

842
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,800
from fog machines from a Hollywood set.

843
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,720
They bought tons of them, because this

844
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,040
is a ginormous Expo Hall.

845
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,720
Huge space.

846
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,440
You could fit probably a 747 in this Expo Hall.

847
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,720
And then they set up, is it fair to call them lasers or light

848
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,360
beams?

849
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
Very strong lights in any case.

850
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,400
Creating a triangular entrance tunnel into this glowing red

851
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,640
room that had a multimillion dollar stage.

852
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,680
Huge screen.

853
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,880
Huge screens with their own light effects and steam effects,

854
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,720
where Jim Whitehurst was up on stage giving the Jim talk

855
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,880
show, where he had a disappearing set of chairs

856
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,280
and tables that would be absorbed

857
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,200
into the background of this multimillion dollar set,

858
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,600
and then would slide back out right as he needed them.

859
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,200
It was very cool.

860
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,400
The impression was like, wow, they spent some money on this.

861
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,240
Polished, polished, polished.

862
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,920
Yeah.

863
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,260
But you mentioned Lockheed Martin there in that last clip.

864
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,680
And that was one of the more interesting guests.

865
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,800
Red Hat really had a message here.

866
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,880
We are big.

867
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,000
We've got ExxonMobil.

868
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,960
We've got BP.

869
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,560
And we've got Lockheed Martin.

870
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,880
And because we're working with secure US government systems,

871
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,520
timelines are even longer.

872
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Our ability to continue to stay ahead of the threat

873
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,540
is increasingly becoming an exercise in insanity.

874
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,880
So over six years ago, we attempted

875
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,040
to implement agile methods into this environment.

876
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,480
This guy is really intense.

877
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,280
I mean, he's military grade, Chris.

878
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,800
He really is.

879
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,360
Wow.

880
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,160
They had a bunch of different speakers up there,

881
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,360
like large financial institutions as well,

882
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,560
like DBS Bank.

883
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,240
Please welcome DBS Bank Group Chief Information Officer

884
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,680
and Head of Group Technology and Operations, David Bledhill.

885
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,800
DBS Bank.

886
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,480
And then after each major presenter

887
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,120
would come out on stage, Jim Whitehurst

888
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,480
would come back out and make sure to really touch

889
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,560
on a couple of key points.

890
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,160
They wouldn't necessarily talk about Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

891
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,680
In fact, I don't think it was ever mentioned, really.

892
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,280
But they would talk about culture and open source.

893
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,600
I think that is such an important lesson for everyone

894
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,240
here.

895
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
Technology is hard.

896
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,000
But culture is really the critical aspect.

897
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,720
David, thank you so much for being here

898
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,120
and sharing your story and the success that you've had.

899
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,840
It's fantastic.

900
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,280
Thank you so much.

901
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,680
These massive corporations would come up on stage

902
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,400
and talk about how Red Hat worked with them

903
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,680
to change their culture, change their culture.

904
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,280
Literally every presenter from Volkswagen to ExxonMobil

905
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,080
to Deutsche Bank to Delta said that.

906
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,800
And you picked up on, there's an undertone there.

907
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,480
There's a bigger message that Red Hat's trying to convey.

908
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,760
Yeah, I mean, really, by culture, a lot of what they mean

909
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,120
is, how do you do your business?

910
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,760
Some of these companies are large and they are not

911
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
IT organizations.

912
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
They're making planes or they're running a bank.

913
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,200
And IT is critical to their business.

914
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,520
But they're not a tech company.

915
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,280
Red Hat is and is basically saying,

916
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,880
we can drag you into the future.

917
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,480
We've got hybrid cloud offerings.

918
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,960
We can support you in the cloud.

919
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,440
We can support you on prem.

920
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,400
We can help you make that journey wherever

921
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,520
you need to get.

922
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,280
And we'll be your partner, all powered by open source.

923
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,400
We can help you speak open source.

924
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,280
We can help you speak community.

925
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,580
We can teach you how to do continuous integration

926
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,440
and deployment.

927
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,700
We can teach you how to do much faster paced development.

928
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,080
We can bring you into the agile future.

929
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,560
That's what some of the people said up on stage.

930
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,520
There's a big message there.

931
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,640
The entire night, though, there was

932
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,280
moments that were hilarious, which

933
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,880
we saved for the Friday stream.

934
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,240
There were moments that were awkward,

935
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
I mean, legitimately, when Ginny from IBM was up on stage.

936
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
Yeah, just a bit.

937
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,760
The moment that got the absolute most applause when

938
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,960
she was up on stage was when she said Red Hat would

939
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,280
remain independent.

940
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,720
That got the absolute most applause.

941
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,080
In fact, what really I think most people were excited

942
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,160
to see, strangely enough, but was clearly

943
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,360
measurable by the crowd's reaction,

944
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,720
was Satya Nadella from Microsoft.

945
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,960
Absolutely.

946
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,600
I mean, you and I, too, right?

947
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,840
That's who we were there to see.

948
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,960
Boy, it was a weird thing.

949
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,000
It was a weird thing.

950
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,320
So the moment we had all waited for all night.

951
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,800
Possible without open source.

952
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,600
And so I'd like to welcome that on stage,

953
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,800
a partner who's been embracing open source in a big way

954
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
recently, and somebody you probably

955
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,600
wouldn't expect to see on stage in Red Hat 7.

956
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,520
Please welcome Microsoft team executive officer, Satya

957
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,020
Nadella.

958
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,000
Huge reaction.

959
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
The man himself, Satya Nadella, coming out on stage.

960
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,280
The chairs have just swung out from behind a hidden door,

961
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,760
giving themselves a nice handshake.

962
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,560
And Satya is sitting down now at the talk show seats.

963
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,520
They're pointing up to the Microsoft and Red Hat logo

964
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,840
that's huge and glowing just behind them.

965
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,160
Within a couple of moments, it becomes clear

966
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,520
Satya is not just there to represent Red Hat

967
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,360
and how far they've come in the collaboration

968
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,040
between the companies, but they're also

969
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,560
there to announce a new product on Azure.

970
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,000
We do have a more significant announcement

971
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
we're making tonight in our work together

972
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,120
with Microsoft Azure and Red Hat OpenShift.

973
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,080
And you want to tell us a little bit about that?

974
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,200
No, first of all, it's fantastic to be here with all of you

975
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,560
at the Red Hat Summit.

976
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,140
And as you said, we've been working for multiple years now.

977
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,120
And today, in fact, is the general availability

978
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,360
of the Azure OpenShift service.

979
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,760
So it's fantastic to see that out.

980
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,260
All right.

981
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:16,760
Yeah.

982
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,260
Yeah.

983
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,440
OpenShift 4 was a big deal at Red Hat Summit

984
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,200
as well, which, Alex, that's your area, isn't it?

985
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,280
Yep, it is.

986
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,360
The Azure story with OpenShift is a really interesting one.

987
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,040
I don't know if you want to get into it or not, but.

988
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,120
Can you give me the elevator version of it?

989
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,960
I'd be curious.

990
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:40,000
Well, if you look at Amazon and ECS,

991
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Google with Google Kubernetes engine,

992
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,360
Red Hat is in a really unique position

993
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,240
of being able to offer a managed Kubernetes platform, if you

994
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,600
like, on premise, but also with Azure now in a structured way.

995
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,520
So it's a very enterprising proposition

996
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,720
and not really interesting for people interested

997
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,020
in Linux desktops, perhaps.

998
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,280
But in terms of the enterprise story,

999
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
it's a really powerful one because now people

1000
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,920
can run Red Hat in their data centers,

1001
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,600
but also in Azure to get the power of Microsoft's cloud,

1002
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,720
et cetera.

1003
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,680
So there's a lot of synergies, corporate synergies there.

1004
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,280
Yeah.

1005
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,640
Yeah, and they love those.

1006
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,120
There's a lot of those.

1007
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,600
It was interesting, too, to see the amount of partnership,

1008
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,720
too, right?

1009
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,520
Microsoft gave them a lot of access

1010
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,880
so that they could actually set up and co-support

1011
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,280
this new partnership.

1012
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,080
That was a big thing, right?

1013
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,920
They wanted to push this phrase that we're not

1014
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,040
working with Red Hat.

1015
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,840
We are partnering with Red Hat.

1016
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,540
And I don't know what the difference is,

1017
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,960
but that's what they were telling us.

1018
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,520
That sounds good.

1019
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,280
So that was day one in a nutshell.

1020
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,960
There's a lot going on.

1021
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,480
This is a very, very well-run event,

1022
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,920
from the visual assets on the displays,

1023
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,320
on the ground, to the logos.

1024
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,800
The new logo was everywhere.

1025
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,360
You never saw the old logo.

1026
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,280
They must have spent millions on new swag.

1027
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
I keep dropping the term millions, but I mean it.

1028
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,200
I have been to some events, and these things cost money.

1029
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,640
I have an idea of what these swag items cost

1030
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,720
and all of that.

1031
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,840
Millions is not an exaggeration.

1032
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,280
And they have the new logo everywhere rolled out,

1033
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,800
top-level execution on the event.

1034
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,920
But an area that people attending might not normally

1035
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,080
get some insight into that I'd like to share with the audience

1036
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,800
is how they work with the press.

1037
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,700
And I had an opportunity to have a conversation

1038
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,360
with a few individuals to get insights

1039
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,200
on their opinions on this, too.

1040
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,120
And it's an interesting model, because it's

1041
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,480
very information-dense.

1042
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,040
They keep the press very, very busy.

1043
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,560
They dedicate rooms for the press to go into to work.

1044
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,480
They get connectivity.

1045
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,360
They give you some snacks and some beverages.

1046
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,840
And then they dedicate Q&A session rooms,

1047
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,800
where they distill the big, fancy, flashy announcements

1048
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,700
down into more information-dense, shorter

1049
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,700
sessions with the press.

1050
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,360
And there's maybe 80 press there in the room.

1051
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,160
They have several presenters.

1052
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,760
They'll usually have a high-level business person,

1053
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,120
like the project manager, and then somebody

1054
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,000
on the team who's intimately familiar with how

1055
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,120
the software actually functions.

1056
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,380
And each one of them gets about 10 minutes to speak.

1057
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,920
And then the press can ask questions.

1058
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,000
And it's very systematic.

1059
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,920
They all have slides.

1060
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,840
It's very well done.

1061
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,320
They provide power and chairs and all of that for the press,

1062
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,020
so that way you can actually take notes.

1063
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,680
And they really work to kind of efficiently convey information.

1064
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,960
They follow up very quickly with emails afterwards,

1065
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,160
including slides and information like that,

1066
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,960
and make people very available.

1067
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,440
So it's extremely well run.

1068
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,240
And it's, of course, in their best interest,

1069
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,120
because that gets the information out.

1070
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,800
I want to give you a little taste of that.

1071
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,000
They kept us really busy on day two.

1072
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,760
Well, the first press conference of the day just wrapped up.

1073
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,200
The one note that they kept hitting a couple of times,

1074
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,920
besides the announcement of OpenShift 4, which

1075
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,960
a big thing about that was Kubernetes,

1076
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Kubernetes, Kubernetes, oh, by the way, serverless.

1077
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,560
But the thing that they kept touching on, aside from that,

1078
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,520
is at the core of all of this is Linux.

1079
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,400
We didn't hear that yesterday.

1080
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,080
Today it was, all of this innovation

1081
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,360
is made possible because it's riding on top of Linux.

1082
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,320
And as the industry is changing like crazy,

1083
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,960
Linux is the foundation that remains the same.

1084
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,360
So if you build for Linux, you're

1085
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,600
going to build for the future.

1086
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,200
That was a good message to hear from them,

1087
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,560
because they really, otherwise, it's all been about open source

1088
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,320
and not really talking about Linux.

1089
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,880
What jumped out at you, Mr. Payne?

1090
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,000
There really has been an emphasis on platforms

1091
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,100
and building platforms.

1092
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,680
And I think that's where Linux comes in,

1093
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,080
because yesterday was focused on business outcomes.

1094
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,800
But underlying all of that, you have to have stable technology.

1095
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,240
And there is, obviously, frustration

1096
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,640
in the industry of, well, I built it for this release,

1097
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,760
and does it still work?

1098
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,880
So we also saw a lot of emphasis on the RHEL model

1099
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,560
as a relationship, a subscription that

1100
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,720
is a relationship.

1101
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,280
You're not pressured to upgrade.

1102
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,960
You get support.

1103
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,400
So you have a stable base that you can rely on.

1104
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,960
And I think that's the theme with the hybrid cloud offerings,

1105
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,080
too, because there's sort of this tacit acknowledgment

1106
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,360
at the summit that everyone's using open source.

1107
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,520
Your developers are using it.

1108
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,720
You're just going to find your way into your products

1109
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,600
no matter what.

1110
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,140
But it can be difficult to use, because it doesn't always

1111
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,940
come with a manual.

1112
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,200
It doesn't always come with an operator's guide.

1113
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,080
That's what Red Hat's selling.

1114
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,360
Yeah, great point.

1115
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,460
And they talked about some of their features,

1116
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,840
like Insights, which are essentially metrics collections

1117
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,120
to help you do some predictive analysis.

1118
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,680
And they're backporting that to, I

1119
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,720
think they said as far as RHEL 6.7, which is still supported.

1120
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
So current supported versions of RHEL

1121
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,520
will get one of these new analytics features

1122
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,760
that they're talking about.

1123
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,400
Mr. Bacon, I know a couple of things jumped out at you,

1124
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,760
like the numbers they were tossing around

1125
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,560
around the world economy that passes through Red Hat servers.

1126
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,840
Yeah, they said 5% of the world's GDP

1127
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,480
passes through RHEL servers, which to me,

1128
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,920
when that statement, when Stephanie uttered that

1129
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,360
statement, literally made the hairs on my arms stand up.

1130
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,920
That's a huge number.

1131
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,840
And I think that it shows that Red Hat really

1132
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,960
is a big player in the world economy.

1133
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:03,440
And the enterprise of the world.

1134
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,600
Yeah, yeah, there's no escaping that conclusion

1135
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,120
from this press conference.

1136
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,840
And I had a lot of good stuff.

1137
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,760
And I love seeing the love for Linux up there

1138
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,080
on the slide a few times.

1139
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,960
Saw that up there a few times.

1140
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,720
I love seeing that.

1141
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,840
Good press conference, lots of good information.

1142
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,160
You know what else we saw up on the slide that surprised me

1143
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,000
was VS Code mentioned up there a couple of times.

1144
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,800
It's everywhere.

1145
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,360
Yeah, VS Code up on a Red Hat slide.

1146
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,200
OK, so I see Carl has joined the mumble room just

1147
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,320
at the perfect time.

1148
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,800
Hey, Carl, welcome to the show.

1149
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,640
How's it going, guys?

1150
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,120
Hey, good.

1151
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,440
So stand by one second here, because I'm just

1152
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,280
about to get to the expo hall.

1153
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,640
Holy crap, what an expo hall.

1154
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,640
Holy crap.

1155
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,840
I mean, I don't really know what else

1156
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,320
to do other than just play this clip of my raw impressions.

1157
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,120
The press briefings are done.

1158
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Lunch has been had.

1159
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,960
And now the moment I have been waiting for since we got here

1160
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,360
and saw them unboxing everything,

1161
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,920
we are entering the expo hall of all expo halls,

1162
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,560
one of the most impressive floors

1163
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,720
I have ever seen in my 10-plus years of covering events.

1164
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,440
I can't wait to go around and see the floor,

1165
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,360
from the high-tech lights to the Azure Cloud

1166
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,840
booth, the IBM million-dollar booth, Intel's here, Dell's

1167
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,920
here, and there's a puppy area.

1168
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
I don't know about that.

1169
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,560
I'm going to figure out what that is, too.

1170
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,200
There's a lot to catch.

1171
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,100
Now, there was one just undescribable booth,

1172
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,240
but I'll give it my best.

1173
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,120
And Wes, feel free to chime in or cheese

1174
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,880
if there's anything you can add to help describe this.

1175
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,200
But as you're coming down a very high escalator that's

1176
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,040
like a story or two up, really, it's a very tall escalator,

1177
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,480
off to the right are these pods of what look like fan-made

1178
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,080
Star Trek warp cores with pulsing lights,

1179
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,920
their long, tall structures with things that look like plasma

1180
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,480
conduits running into them and cages around them

1181
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,280
to make them look like chambers.

1182
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,840
And then if you look closely, and we have some pictures up

1183
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,960
on our website, which we'll have linked in the show notes,

1184
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,880
if you look closely, you'll see phone handles.

1185
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
And these phone handles, when you pick them up,

1186
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,300
have something very special in them.

1187
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,320
It was a very, very interesting and intimate experience,

1188
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,120
and it was the first thing we had to make a beeline to.

1189
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,220
Innovators on the line, technology saving lives.

1190
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,720
So this has been something that's

1191
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,680
been capturing our attention the entire time.

1192
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,440
Oh, I see.

1193
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,080
So Wes, you go in here and you learn

1194
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,080
about different innovators.

1195
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,200
You go inside the booth, and then I think you put it up.

1196
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,640
So here's a chief data scientist,

1197
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:48,080
vice president of digital transformation at BP.

1198
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,760
It's hard to hear, because it's such a loud floor,

1199
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,200
but you get essentially a phone call

1200
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,100
with a CEO at one of these companies

1201
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,760
or somebody who's designed something who's famous

1202
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,920
that they worked in conjunction with Red Hat

1203
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,800
to go out and collect the audio.

1204
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,880
And I was sitting there just sort of marveled by it,

1205
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,800
and out of the corner of my eye, I

1206
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,920
noticed a lady walking up to me that she

1207
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,880
had a look of pride, because I was saying things like,

1208
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,500
oh, this is great.

1209
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,600
This is really an intimate experience.

1210
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,920
We were clearly super interested in her project.

1211
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,480
She walks up, and I just went right into interview mode.

1212
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,880
So I have a sense that you may know a little bit about this.

1213
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,640
What's your name?

1214
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,200
Emily.

1215
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:23,720
Hi, Emily.

1216
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,440
I'm Chris.

1217
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,840
So what is this called, and what's the idea behind it?

1218
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,520
Yeah, so this is Innovators on the Line.

1219
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,660
We are from an agency in Portland called Second Story.

1220
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,360
We partnered with the Red Hat content team

1221
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,920
and tried to come up with an interesting way

1222
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,760
to highlight the Innovation Award winners

1223
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,280
by having this intimate experience like you suggested.

1224
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,920
The idea is that it does feel a little bit exhibit-like.

1225
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,880
It's really special and kind of elevating all of the speakers

1226
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,880
and what they're saying.

1227
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,260
And then the content was selected

1228
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,040
based on different themes, so the central theme being

1229
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,880
innovation, and then each of the satellite pods,

1230
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,000
like this one is the future that we're standing in.

1231
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,920
It was really impressive, and Emily was great to chat with.

1232
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,320
They even took apart one of the booths for us.

1233
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,520
If you go to linuxunplugged.com or click on the blog,

1234
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,080
Cheezy wrote up a great article.

1235
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,560
Yeah, the guy there, Matt, from Second Story, super nice guy,

1236
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,160
really talented guy.

1237
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,360
And I got to talking.

1238
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,440
Well, actually, it was with Emily.

1239
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,800
And I was like, so what kind of microcontroller

1240
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,600
is inside of there?

1241
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,480
Is that a ESP32 and 8266?

1242
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,640
At that point, she signaled for Matt to come over,

1243
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,000
and he comes over, and he's like, dude.

1244
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,520
What's that?

1245
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,040
What's that?

1246
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,000
He's like, what are you asking him about?

1247
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,360
And I started asking him, he's like, well,

1248
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,800
do you just want to see inside one?

1249
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,160
And I was like, you're going to take this thing apart

1250
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,720
on the floor?

1251
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,160
He's like, sure, man.

1252
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,120
So he just pulled it apart, and it was like, at that moment,

1253
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,760
I realized that we were all just a bunch of nerds in a room.

1254
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,520
Like, wherever we aligned in the Linux community,

1255
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,560
it was like tech toy, and he was showing it off.

1256
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,400
I was glad to check it out.

1257
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,160
It was really a great experience,

1258
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,360
and I appreciate both Matt and Emily from Second Story.

1259
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,320
They did a lot of work.

1260
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,280
They actually collaborated with Red Hat to build that.

1261
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,560
So it got Red Hat's blessing, but it definitely

1262
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,240
looked like the warp core or something from the Enterprise.

1263
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,000
I think it was 16-foot tall, something like that.

1264
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,040
And Carl, you worked on the floor of the Expo Hall.

1265
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,520
What was your impressions of it?

1266
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,720
Massive scale.

1267
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,080
Oh, yeah, Red Hat, they don't half-ass it, man.

1268
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,880
No kidding.

1269
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,040
No, the numbers I was originally kicking around in some

1270
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,840
of our clips are 8,000, but then the number

1271
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,720
I've actually heard after the fact is more like 9,000.

1272
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,120
Yeah, I heard the same.

1273
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,400
Yeah, so what area of the Expo Hall were you working?

1274
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,320
So I wasn't working the Expo Hall.

1275
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,680
I was doing one of the labs.

1276
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,920
A lab, that's right.

1277
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,800
That's right.

1278
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,000
In fact, before we go there, I think

1279
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,580
the story we really should tell, although I

1280
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,200
do want to hear about the, and now I remember,

1281
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,400
because you actually had great attendance.

1282
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Now I think about it.

1283
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,600
The story I want to tell, though, is those wings.

1284
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,320
The most incredible wings, I think,

1285
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,640
maybe the top two in my life.

1286
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,800
I don't know, I'm leaving room for the possibility

1287
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,280
I've had better wings, but I don't know for sure.

1288
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,200
Immediately impressive.

1289
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,080
Best pro tip ever.

1290
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,600
Yeah, so Carl, can you describe the killer feature

1291
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,240
about these wings?

1292
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,120
Because you know what it is.

1293
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,400
There's something a little different about these wings.

1294
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,320
So these are the tin spice wings at City Taphouse,

1295
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,060
a short walk away from the conference.

1296
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,680
I don't really know how to describe them.

1297
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,040
They're dry rub wings.

1298
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,920
They're real juicy, though, but they're not dripping in sauce.

1299
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,800
They're just different.

1300
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,800
The dry rub's the key.

1301
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,080
The dry rub is the key, so they're so good.

1302
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,960
They're so good.

1303
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,120
Like a little cinnamon as you bring them up to your face,

1304
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,440
you get a good smell of it.

1305
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,520
That was a great tip.

1306
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,000
So the experience of running a lab,

1307
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,080
Carl's a community member.

1308
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,360
I'm kind of just curious of your impressions

1309
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,880
of that, just kind of like a short summary of it.

1310
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,800
Oh, it was a blast.

1311
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,880
One of my friends, Adam Miller, that works at Red Hat

1312
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,000
reached out to me.

1313
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,360
He was doing a lab about building RPM packages, which

1314
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,800
is my entire day job.

1315
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,640
And he got permission to have a few extra co-presenters,

1316
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,840
got me a ticket to Summit, and then it worked really well.

1317
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,600
He got to do all the presentation stuff,

1318
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,960
and me and two other people ran around and answered

1319
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,440
everyone's questions and kept the lab on track.

1320
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,320
Well done.

1321
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,800
Well done.

1322
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,120
I know that can be a lot of work and a lot of energy,

1323
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,920
but it looks like it was well received.

1324
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,320
So good job.

1325
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,600
You know, it should be said, too, that there was a Red Hat,

1326
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,000
the old logo there.

1327
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,880
And that was on Rob's arm from Linux Academy.

1328
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,640
Yeah, that's true.

1329
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,440
Yeah, we bumped into Rob and Gabby from Linux Academy

1330
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,800
and hung out with them for a bit.

1331
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,280
Yeah, Rob's got an old school.

1332
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,680
Also, he's got a pine head tattoo.

1333
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,520
So Rob's decked out.

1334
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,080
I think he's the first and only to have the pine head tattoo,

1335
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,200
actually.

1336
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,680
Well, you better step up, cheese.

1337
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,200
I'm on it.

1338
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,040
He did mention that your CEO was talking

1339
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,880
about getting the pine head tattoo,

1340
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,080
and then Rob beat him to it.

1341
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,760
Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

1342
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,400
OK.

1343
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,680
Well, I got more to say about Red Hat Summit.

1344
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,760
Just two more clips, because the second day towards the end,

1345
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,160
as we're walking around this massive scale high production

1346
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,520
expo hall, it just kind of starts hitting us.

1347
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,560
There's several things about this event that are, I mean,

1348
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,600
not to put it over the top, but honestly,

1349
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,080
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

1350
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,000
There's something that keeps crossing our mind

1351
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,760
as we're walking around the expo,

1352
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,440
as we're walking around the whole summit,

1353
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,200
as we attend the keynote.

1354
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,800
What we are witnessing right now is peak Red Hat,

1355
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,520
peak independent Red Hat.

1356
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,600
They brought all these companies here themselves,

1357
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:33,440
not as an arm of IBM, but as a scrappy 1995 Linux company.

1358
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,840
They started up, they brought Lockheed Martin, and VW,

1359
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,200
and BP, and all of the other companies that

1360
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,480
have been up on stage, right?

1361
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,680
And they have created an 8,000 attendee event

1362
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,680
that is one of the best orchestrated, best executed

1363
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,300
events I've ever been to.

1364
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,040
And they brought all this here on their own.

1365
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,320
This is peak Red Hat.

1366
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,240
So in a real way, it's kind of an historic summit.

1367
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,000
There will never be another Red Hat summit like this one.

1368
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,160
Next year, they'll be IBM owned.

1369
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,320
The deal's been approved.

1370
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,160
So it's sort of kind of amazing that we made it here.

1371
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,180
Yeah, I think for them to, like you mentioned earlier,

1372
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,960
to be a scrappy company from 1995,

1373
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,600
I don't think they could ever picture themselves here

1374
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:25,120
in a convention hall this size with nearly 8,000 attendees

1375
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:28,360
and industry from all over the world.

1376
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,440
Huge first class industry.

1377
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,060
They pulled this all together.

1378
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:38,120
Maybe it, I don't want to say it's a good sendoff to Red Hat

1379
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,360
because I don't think it's a sendoff.

1380
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,920
This is not the last of Red Hat, but I

1381
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,440
think this is definitely one of those events

1382
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,280
that is going to be the last of its kind for Red Hat

1383
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,600
as we know it.

1384
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,520
It's not just that it's the last summit

1385
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,040
as an independent company where they brought

1386
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,360
all of these massive organizations

1387
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,600
and they built this massive ecosystem from the ground up.

1388
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,280
But it's also a bit historic in the sense

1389
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,800
that not every summit has a massive RHEL release.

1390
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,680
We're continuing our walk around the Expo Hall.

1391
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,880
We're somewhere right now between the customer success

1392
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,080
zone and the feedback zone.

1393
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,880
And it really hits us going back to that point

1394
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,320
about it being historic.

1395
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,180
This is also going to be one of the few Red Hat summits

1396
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,680
where a new version of RHEL is released.

1397
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,680
RHEL 8 came out yesterday.

1398
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,720
And then today, we saw OpenShift 4.

1399
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,080
They're really pitching both of these as platforms to build on.

1400
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,840
This is the first major RHEL after everyone

1401
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,800
has adopted container technology.

1402
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,960
And you see it in the things they're excited about,

1403
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,560
not only the universal base image,

1404
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,360
but all the container-based tool chains that come just

1405
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,480
as part of standard RHEL.

1406
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,240
Yeah, that's another kind of noteworthy thing there.

1407
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,400
You just tossed in there, the universal base image

1408
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,200
is their base container platform now.

1409
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,360
It's like a base container.

1410
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,800
I mean, everything's got the word platform.

1411
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,880
But it's a standard container file system

1412
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,180
that will work on any kind of container host that is RHEL.

1413
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:09,000
And if you run it on RHEL, on OpenStack, or whatever,

1414
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,200
whatever their combo is, it's fully supported.

1415
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,800
But you could technically run it on Ubuntu too.

1416
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,560
That's key.

1417
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,400
It's freely redistributable.

1418
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,280
So you can take this image, you don't have to get a license,

1419
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,680
you don't have to worry about that.

1420
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,960
You can ship it and run it wherever you want.

1421
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,080
If you run it on whatever operating system you like,

1422
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,280
that's up to you to support.

1423
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,080
But if you run it on a licensed version of OpenShift or Red Hat

1424
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,840
Enterprise Linux, because they've

1425
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,720
tested this universal base image against all the Red Hat

1426
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,360
software, they'll provide you regular support just like RHEL.

1427
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,160
Yeah, and I confirmed it's not sent to us.

1428
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,800
It is genuine RHEL that will be tracking RHEL packages

1429
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,360
like Python and whatnot.

1430
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,840
And going back to OpenShift just really quick,

1431
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,800
the other big thing they're doing with OpenShift

1432
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,680
besides Kubernetes, all the things, is serverless.

1433
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,120
Oh, and a little bit of serverless.

1434
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,840
It does feel like Red Hat Enterprise 8,

1435
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,240
sort of their big catch up, making Linux the base platform

1436
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,520
and then you can build your infrastructure or your cloud

1437
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,840
however you want.

1438
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,240
And you don't get a lot of those.

1439
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,880
Like you can go to Red Hat Summit for a few years

1440
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,720
and there's no big release.

1441
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,640
There's no big release of OpenShift and RHEL.

1442
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,640
Plus you've got the new rebranding rolling out.

1443
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,960
It's the last one before they join IBM.

1444
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,200
The more we talk about it, the more we think about it,

1445
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,280
historic really feels like an accurate description.

1446
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,160
One of the things about the time of the last

1447
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,320
Red Hat Enterprise Linux released,

1448
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,240
I don't think Red Hat would have called themselves

1449
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,800
a hybrid cloud company.

1450
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,120
But that's what they call themselves now.

1451
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,440
So it's a new era in many ways for Red Hat.

1452
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,640
And this is the culmination of a lot of that work.

1453
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,840
Also, don't forget they're a culture leader too.

1454
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,680
Oh yeah, that's right.

1455
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,520
You got to get that in there.

1456
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,400
Cloud and culture.

1457
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,240
That's right.

1458
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,080
Wow.

1459
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,120
I mean, those clips really just kind of sum it up.

1460
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,120
And it really was a remarkable summit to go to.

1461
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,800
And I don't know if I could say necessarily go

1462
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
if you weren't in the industry.

1463
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,880
Cheese, you're probably the most removed from the industry.

1464
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,080
Would you recommend it necessarily

1465
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,920
for a casual listener of the show?

1466
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,040
You know, I don't know that I would.

1467
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,120
If you're just say a casual listener,

1468
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,240
if you're just a hobbyist, it might not be the thing.

1469
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,080
There might not be the conference for you.

1470
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,920
But if you are an IT professional that uses RHEL,

1471
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,920
works with RHEL, I think it's important that you go.

1472
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,520
Yeah.

1473
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,960
You get a lot more context around stuff for one thing.

1474
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,600
Absolutely.

1475
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,880
And I think the workshops like what Carl and Rob and everyone

1476
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,880
was doing there, I think those are of great benefit

1477
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,760
to the attendees.

1478
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,200
So I think that's a great way to get them up

1479
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,840
to speed really quickly with the new technology.

1480
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:42,640
So it's a great place if you're going there for that.

1481
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,520
If not, I would say go somewhere like LinuxFest Northwest

1482
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,560
or come down to Texas LinuxFest, a little smaller, tighter

1483
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,200
community, a smaller group of people.

1484
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,200
You get more opportunity to hang out and chit-chat.

1485
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,200
And the hallway conversation is always

1486
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,600
great at those little conferences.

1487
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:02,320
So that's where I would say go.

1488
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,920
I, for one, am glad you went because you

1489
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,560
got some great, great photos.

1490
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,360
And it was a ton of fun to have you there.

1491
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,560
So you got to check that out.

1492
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,600
Now, I know, Neil, it must have been

1493
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,120
worth your time in every sense of the word to go.

1494
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,240
Well, yeah, I mean, so I've been going to Red Hat Summits

1495
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,480
for the past five years now.

1496
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,720
So for me, this feels like this event

1497
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,200
was a celebration of the over 25 years

1498
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,600
that Red Hat has been going from just a distro integrator

1499
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:35,240
to a developer to a leader in free and open source software.

1500
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,600
And I think this event this year, I

1501
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,320
think it was a big celebration of that

1502
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,960
with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, Red Hat OpenShift Container

1503
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,120
Platform 4, with the community booths, with all the stuff

1504
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,520
that they were doing.

1505
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:57,400
So my day job really doesn't involve too much Red Hat stuff.

1506
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,320
I go to Red Hat Summit for two main reasons.

1507
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,640
One is I get to geek out with all the people.

1508
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:10,480
And as you mentioned earlier, we're all nerds here

1509
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,160
at the end of it.

1510
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,160
And it's a lot of fun to meet all these people.

1511
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,120
And the other thing is if you really look at it

1512
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,320
and if you really take stock of what Red Hat Summit is about,

1513
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,440
and if you really know about how the event works,

1514
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,920
if you're a community member of any of Red Hat's over 500

1515
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,960
communities that they officially sponsor,

1516
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,720
you can get a ton of value out of it,

1517
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,800
even if you are not a Red Hat customer.

1518
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,000
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

1519
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,600
That's the thing, Neil, is I can tell

1520
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,400
you've got a little bit of the con crud right now.

1521
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,760
You can hear it in your voice.

1522
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,600
So I hope you feel better soon.

1523
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,600
Stick around, because we're going to keep going.

1524
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,120
We could talk more.

1525
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,480
We could talk more Red Hat Summit.

1526
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,520
Just don't go anywhere, Neil.

1527
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,720
We'll keep talking about it.

1528
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:01,040
But I want to get a chance to play this interview with Tony

1529
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,840
Lambert.

1530
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,240
So after the show today, we're doing a study group

1531
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,040
with Tony Lambert.

1532
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,040
It's called Command Line Threat Hunting.

1533
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,720
If you're a part of our meetup, you already know about this.

1534
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,160
And it's a great walkthrough on how

1535
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,600
to just use tools built into Linux

1536
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,920
to determine if your system has been owned

1537
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,000
or if it has something on there that might be malicious.

1538
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,160
And Tony is an interesting guy, and I had a chance

1539
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,280
to chat with him before the study group, which

1540
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,960
is coming up later today, which we should, I would imagine,

1541
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,880
by the time this episode comes out,

1542
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,120
have a link to go watch it after the fact,

1543
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,680
because we are going to post this one after the fact.

1544
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,640
We have to now.

1545
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,160
Yeah.

1546
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,280
So here's an interview with Tony Lambert.

1547
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,280
He is the host of this study group, him and El Marquez.

1548
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,920
And check the show notes for a link to the entire talk

1549
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,920
where he gives way more information than what

1550
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,440
we touch on in just this chat.

1551
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,200
So Tony Lambert is joining us right now.

1552
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,120
He's a detection engineer at Red Canary.

1553
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,840
Tony, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

1554
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,320
Thanks.

1555
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,400
It's awesome to be here.

1556
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,020
So we were thinking, since we're going

1557
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,400
to focus on security in our study group,

1558
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,200
maybe we could give people a quick top three things

1559
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,280
to check on their Linux box if they

1560
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,360
think their machine has been compromised, maybe

1561
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,040
has something even persistent.

1562
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,200
Absolutely.

1563
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,120
So the thing to keep in mind when adversaries

1564
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,800
are trying to compromise Linux machines is that they don't

1565
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,920
always know what your Linux setup is going to look like.

1566
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,280
Everybody's setup is a little bit different.

1567
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,040
Everybody has a different distribution.

1568
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,320
Maybe your folders are set up differently than somebody else's.

1569
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:33,280
They tend to focus on certain things that are

1570
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,760
consistent across distributions.

1571
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,200
You always have certain temporary folders

1572
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,000
that are consistent across distributions.

1573
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,860
You have cron jobs.

1574
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,840
You have scheduled scripts that are

1575
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,120
consistent across distributions.

1576
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:50,560
And it's also possible across distributions nowadays

1577
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,640
that you're going to have systemd services,

1578
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,160
systemd timers that are existing on systems.

1579
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,600
So the things that I tend to tell people to check most

1580
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:04,200
are files that may have been left in temporary locations,

1581
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,720
cron jobs or scripts that are existing on your system,

1582
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,560
and systemd services, systemd timers

1583
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,080
may have been left by malicious packages.

1584
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,240
All of these things are going to be

1585
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,560
left in various types of attacks.

1586
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,040
Sometimes they're drive-by attacks by adversaries.

1587
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,200
Sometimes they may be orphaned software packages.

1588
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,640
Do you have any tips for, you know, even just looking

1589
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,560
at like a systemctl status?

1590
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,520
There are a lot of services, many of them

1591
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,600
that I did not install but are provided by the distro.

1592
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,320
Do you have any tips for sort of sorting through that mess

1593
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,000
to identify something that might be malicious?

1594
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,120
That is really hard, and the only big advice I can offer

1595
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,920
is to do it like a lot of enterprises do it.

1596
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,520
Create a baseline.

1597
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,160
After you first install your Linux system,

1598
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,920
take a look at the cron jobs that you have.

1599
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,320
Take a look at the systemd services that you have.

1600
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,480
What are your init scripts that may exist

1601
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,880
if you're using an older distribution

1602
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,000
or something that doesn't honor systemd, at the least?

1603
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,800
And, you know, keep a little text file that says,

1604
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,320
here's what known good was, and then kind of, you know,

1605
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
as you go on, if you think something's weird,

1606
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,960
go back, look at what known good was

1607
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,840
and see if anything's changed.

1608
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,560
Yeah, coming from the server side and the sysadmin side,

1609
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,600
I know that there are a lot of baselines that we get used to.

1610
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,600
You know, a web server acts this way.

1611
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,840
You know, my SQL server acts this way.

1612
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,480
If you're a desktop user, what are some of the red flags

1613
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,440
that you should be looking for to think,

1614
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,000
hey, maybe I have been compromised?

1615
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,360
So for a desktop user, some of the red flags

1616
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,440
I would tend to look for are more of,

1617
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,680
you have certain services turned on that shouldn't be.

1618
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,400
You know, if you're a desktop user,

1619
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:44,240
you're probably not using SSH to get back into your machine

1620
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,840
as much as, you know, you're getting into a server.

1621
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,720
If it's something that you interactively log on with,

1622
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,800
you may not need that.

1623
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,960
If you have, you know, VNC, remote desktop type services

1624
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,200
or, you know, SSH, something like a lot of SSH,

1625
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,760
failed logons in a log,

1626
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,280
those are the things I would typically look for

1627
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,600
on the desktop side.

1628
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,800
The cool thing about doing security with Linux

1629
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,680
is that you do have some proprietary products

1630
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,280
and some of these proprietary products are expensive,

1631
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,200
but the grand fundamentals of doing security in Linux,

1632
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,960
you can base those around shell utilities

1633
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,600
and things that are automatically built into your packages

1634
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,560
that you have installed

1635
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,960
when you first set up your distribution.

1636
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,520
So if you want to determine

1637
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,360
if you have malicious cron jobs

1638
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,040
or malicious scripts executing on your system,

1639
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,400
you can do that using CAD, LS, GREP,

1640
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,040
all the tools that are built into your Linux distribution.

1641
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,320
If you want to determine whether or not, you know,

1642
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,200
you're participating in a malicious botnet

1643
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,240
that is bringing down other sites,

1644
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,880
you can do this using tools

1645
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,400
that are actually built into your system already.

1646
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,000
Companies know about this now.

1647
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,240
There are several companies

1648
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,440
that actually base their threat hunting services

1649
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,720
around using built-in shell utilities in Linux

1650
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,480
and combining those with SSH to do hunting

1651
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,880
at scale across an enterprise.

1652
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,280
Tony, you're being humble now,

1653
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,920
but I understand that Red Canary

1654
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:12,040
actually contributes a bit in this area in open source.

1655
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,560
So where we contribute a lot in open source

1656
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:18,280
is security control and validation,

1657
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,520
security control, validation, and testing,

1658
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,040
because we run into customers in the community

1659
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,680
that don't really know how to test their own services.

1660
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,760
They don't know how to test

1661
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,360
whether or not their controls are working.

1662
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,280
They decide to go to VirusTotal and download a virus

1663
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,640
and see whether or not it actually serves up a detection

1664
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,280
from something that's a behavioral control.

1665
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,200
Not all antiviruses are equal.

1666
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,600
Not all behavioral controls are equal.

1667
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,320
So we put together a project called Atomic Red Team,

1668
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,840
which lets you kind of browse around and see what commands,

1669
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:58,120
what scripts that adversaries use in the real world.

1670
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,240
And you can see, how does it work?

1671
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,600
What does an adversary need

1672
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,160
to actually execute this in my environment?

1673
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,320
And you can replicate that before an adversary does

1674
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,280
so that you can find out

1675
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,520
whether or not you have coverage for it.

1676
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,480
If you don't have coverage to detect it,

1677
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,280
if you don't know how to look for it,

1678
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,480
you can learn how to look for it

1679
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,040
before a bad guy comes to you.

1680
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,360
Thank you to Tony.

1681
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,680
And if you're on the live stream today,

1682
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,320
stick around because he will be joining us

1683
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,600
in just a little bit via the magic of the internet

1684
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,400
and going through all of that live

1685
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,080
with much, much more detail and examples and all of that.

1686
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,640
And then we should have it posted pretty soon.

1687
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,000
Mr. Payne, I think that's everything we had

1688
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,840
for the main show.

1689
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,920
You know what we should do is take those pics

1690
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,240
we had for this week and let's save them for next week.

1691
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,480
We'll just do extra pics next week.

1692
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,440
Good idea.

1693
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,280
I think, yeah.

1694
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,280
Get it out of here.

1695
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,120
Double pics.

1696
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,240
Yeah, hype for the pics.

1697
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,920
So make sure to tune in to the next Linux Unplugged.

1698
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,240
Get them brats to the front of the line.

1699
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,120
Brats to the front of the line.

1700
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,920
That's right, that's right, I love that one.

1701
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,320
I just love that one.

1702
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,120
All right, well, links for everything at linuxunplugged.com

1703
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,440
are probably in your podcast player, I would imagine.

1704
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,920
Go check out the new Friday stream.

1705
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,200
It'll be live 2 p.m. Pacific in your local time

1706
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,440
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1707
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,880
And then we post it Monday for download.

1708
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,520
Fridaystream.com.

1709
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,640
Friday on a Monday if you want to get the download

1710
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,640
where we've cleaned it up a little bit.

1711
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,480
Not much, though.

1712
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,920
Let's be honest, it's a sloppy show.

1713
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,920
Just the way we like it.

1714
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,800
Boy, I'm getting really good at these teases, aren't I?

1715
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,320
All right, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

1716
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,720
of the Unplugged program.

1717
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,880
I would love to see you here live next week.

1718
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,160
I'd love any of your feedback at linuxunplugged.com slash

1719
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,000
contact.

1720
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,800
I am at Chris Elias and I work at Jupiter Signal.

1721
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,800
See you next Tuesday.

1722
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,800
Have a great week.

1723
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:13,480
Elle, are you still on the line?

1724
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,840
Because I know you just got back from DockerCon.

1725
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,880
Apparently DockerCon cut crowd free, though.

1726
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,520
So congratulations to you.

1727
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,440
How did it go?

1728
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,400
It was a lot of fun.

1729
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,720
It was good to see a lot of my friends

1730
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,360
who I only get to see every six months, I guess.

1731
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,640
Now every year that's going to be a little sad.

1732
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,160
But I love how hands on the conference was this time

1733
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,880
as opposed to just kind of sitting and watching

1734
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,760
presentations.

1735
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,680
They actually had just kind of like little robots

1736
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,960
that were running Docker, running around the conference,

1737
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,640
bringing swag to you.

1738
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,440
Did you say like swag delivery?

1739
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,160
Yeah, and could you explain that a little bit?

1740
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,840
So they have these little bots that

1741
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,760
are used in San Francisco to make food deliveries

1742
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,560
or groceries deliveries within a small area.

1743
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:01,280
But they would fill them up with swag.

1744
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,880
And it would just kind of run around.

1745
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,560
And if it noticed you in front of you,

1746
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,200
it would stop, make little eyes that look like a heart,

1747
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,800
open up, and there was swag inside that you could take.

1748
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,120
I want one.

1749
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,880
What's really funny, though, is I couldn't figure out

1750
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,920
how to make it stop.

1751
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,060
So I kind of just walked in front of it.

1752
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,960
And it did veer around me.

1753
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,360
But then my friend walked in front of it.

1754
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,480
And it just ran right into him.

1755
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,280
And it gives two X eyes.

1756
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,720
And it looked like it was looking meanly at him.

1757
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:31,880
Target identified.

1758
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,240
Must destroy.

1759
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,280
Swag theft.

1760
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,560
Swag theft.

1761
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,840
So that was a lot of fun.

1762
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,720
I did tell you that I got to play rock, paper, scissors

1763
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,080
with Rosie the robot.

1764
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,560
Who won?

1765
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:43,120
I don't know.

1766
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,160
Yeah, from the Jetsons.

1767
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,480
So Rosie won.

1768
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,680
And she trash talked the entire time.

1769
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,920
No.

1770
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,400
She was telling me that her ratio was so much higher.

1771
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,160
And then I thought that I had won.

1772
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,080
But she cheated because she was like, you have scissors.

1773
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,280
And I was like, I have paper.

1774
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,440
What are you talking about?

1775
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,400
So it's like a series of cameras they've

1776
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,360
stuck in this thing to watch you so you can't trick it.

1777
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:11,480
There's one main camera in its belly that it's watching.

1778
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,200
And then it's analyzing all of your movement.

1779
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,960
It's running over 40 Docker containers

1780
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,760
to run its brain, basically.

1781
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,720
Whoa.

1782
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:25,240
So they've done 40 containers on Rosie the robot?

1783
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,760
I did think that it was very interesting that we

1784
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,000
could have our own Rosie the robot if we wanted.

1785
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,160
Because all of the blueprints for how to print this robot

1786
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,120
are available open sourced online

1787
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,760
and can be done with an at-home 3D printer.

1788
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,920
All right, audience.

1789
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,840
There you go.

1790
01:09:39,840 --> 01:10:07,880
The challenge has been thrown down.
