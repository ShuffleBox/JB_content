1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
have you guys I think we talked about this like a really long time ago the the

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,280
sole laptop the solar-powered laptop well now we're getting we're getting

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,920
prices 495 Canadian I don't know what that is in real actual money but in

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,120
Canadian money it's something now remember this is the one where the box

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,280
yeah where the back folds down and the and the panels come out and then it

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,640
charges it runs Ubuntu and I haven't looked at the specs yet I was saving for

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,400
the show so let me find it right here see if I can oh yeah specs here we go

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,640
all right so it's it comes with Ubuntu 1404 or you can get with Windows 7 it

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,760
has an Intel Atom 1.8 gigahertz dual core processor 2 gigs of RAM 320 gigabyte

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,240
SATA hard drive yeah it's got an Atom so I don't know but it's solar-powered

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,720
that's kind of cool right would you buy one Eric if you had the if you had the

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,360
cash dude if I had the cash I'd be all over that just because it's a

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,280
recognized laptop I wouldn't have to worry about my kid you know and then I

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,200
could take it places like into the back woods you know take pictures I'm sorry

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,840
what oh I got you I was I was losing you there for a minute hey Colonel Linux

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,720
could this be the ultimate travelers laptop never have to look for a charging

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,640
board at the airport again he says no no because you have to sorry yeah yeah no I

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,360
well here's the thing right so as far as a traveling laptop I think it would be

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,240
hard to charge it it would have to be able to actually get to Sun to get it to

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,560
charge right man get a window seat

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,120
so it's not like you're stuck with just solar power boring all right what about

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:54,320
okay okay where are the specifications when we so slow it's painful it's got a

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,040
that's well I mean I don't know 1.8 gigahertz isn't that bad dual core that's

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,800
not I'm not talking about the technical specifications of the computer rather

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:13,000
than the power intake and solar size and generate well frankly I've seen some

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,760
really significantly large solar panels through what I do with work and they

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,480
generate tiny little sips of amperes that barely power an electric biro so

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,720
I'd be amazed if this thing can actually charge and power a laptop for any

29
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,840
significant time whatsoever yeah okay that's a good point I mean

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,880
that could be a major issue is how long it takes to charge I noticed they're not

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,120
actually throwing that out on the pages I'm looking no I can't find that is the

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,400
most important specification item for a laptop of this kind and I don't see it

33
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,200
readily available hmm hmm boy look at you just dumping cold water on this like

34
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,120
sorry sorry well the thing is is that I've got customers that would really

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,440
like to use an equipment like this because they operate aircraft for in

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,240
sort of pseudo military environment so for the United Nations and stuff like

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,480
that and they upload their flight data over satellite phones so they would love

38
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,040
a computer like this that they can open in the middle of Africa or Afghanistan

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,320
where Sun is available almost all the time mm-hmm and yeah that bit of

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,800
information isn't on here boy that is an interesting catch and of course one that

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,480
once you think about it is sort of the critical piece of information I thought

42
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:47,000
when we first heard about this it was gonna be an arm machine to the second

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,160
issue I have with it with your live as far north as I do half the edits

44
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,560
completely useless oh I don't know I'm an optimist Eric I like to believe it's

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,600
funny I guess I don't know I like to think it's nicer in the Pacific

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,360
Northwest than everybody thinks it is like I don't know I I find all these

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,920
things to be supplemental what I really want is I'm waiting for the day when

48
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,400
they can integrate a solar panel behind the LCD screen of my smartphone and then

49
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,680
when I just have my smartphone down on the table or on my dash it's secretly

50
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,760
like you know trickle charging it's absorbing the yellow Sun like Superman

51
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,560
that's that's what I look forward to okay yeah okay sorry and I've heard some

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,880
some stuff on science shows recently that they've got a completely clear

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,560
glass that they are planning on putting in two new phones and new tablets I'm

54
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,800
ready charger I'm ready for that whether it completely charges it or just keeps

55
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,520
it from charging so fast did you find the charging info and I found the

56
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,240
information so I'll read it back it says this really depends it says how long

57
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,420
does it need to be in the Sun to be fully charged and it says this really

58
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,960
depends on the exposure you're getting right in a fully sunny day it should

59
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,360
take a couple of hours to get fully charged duration will change with

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,560
conditions such as and this is they oh by the way this is our get out of

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,160
clauses to why it's never going to work position of the Sun clouds location on

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,760
the earth and even air pressure and temperature yeah that's basically it

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,980
doesn't work it's never gonna charge the laptop that is everything you can

64
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,320
imagine because where are you on the planet exactly I'm sorry you're not

65
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,840
exactly on the equator on this specific aren't you gonna bake the components

66
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,560
like aren't you gonna cook the laptop now you're really digging into this so

67
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,560
now I'm gonna find temperature temperature operation the temperature

68
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:07,760
conditions I guess I know I guess I like the idea of this being a feature on

69
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,740
almost anything where there's some integrated self-charging you know like

70
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,480
okay I'm not saying everything it comes down to Star Trek but it turns out seems

71
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,400
like everything comes down to Star Trek and something the Enterprise D got

72
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,080
really good if you look at the back area of the Enterprise D between the warp

73
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,280
missiles that's all solar panels and it's not their primary source of power

74
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,440
but it's like a solid trickle charge for their power cells and they could just

75
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,440
you know they don't depend on it but it's just sort of supplements it's like a

76
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,520
multiple different ways getting that power up and I look at the battery

77
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,960
technology and I think these batteries are not getting better fast enough you

78
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,520
know like they're they're just like I want to I want a phone that lasts two

79
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,520
three days that's that would really be perfect for me or at least a solid two

80
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,920
days but the battery technology doesn't seem to keep up but if they could have

81
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,240
trickle charging like through solar and stuff like that to sort of supplement

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,240
the battery shortcomings Chris I can solve that problem for you the thing you

83
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,200
need is a Nokia 9660 there you go that will last you five days in a single

84
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,240
charge network really the night Nokia that's the old in other words get away

85
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,040
from your stupid smartphone that's what you're saying yeah that's well yeah go

86
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,080
back to my old that was advertised as a smartphone but yeah back in the day I'm

87
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,000
looking right now oh boy yeah yeah exactly that was too fast what I'm

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:37,280
sorry what sorry Noah I meant to say okay thank you welcome to Linux unplugged

89
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,440
your weekly Linux talk show that's already preparing its defenses against

90
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,520
the con crud my name is Chris and my name is Matt hey man I'm taking like

91
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,880
vitamins I'm trying to drink water I'm trying not to get sick when I go on this

92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,000
trip but I'm already paranoid because I've been sleeping very well and that's

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,600
that lowers the defenses right there Matt oh boy I'm starting on a

94
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,520
disadvantage so if if I get sick what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna implement a

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,400
bubble quarantine it's gonna make Monday's Linux action show a little

96
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,280
awkward so I'm gonna be in a bubble but we'll communicate over the microphones

97
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,240
and headphones so you'll still be able to hear me however I am gonna need you

98
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,480
to slip the bacon through a slot okay okay you know when it comes to slipping

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,920
bacon I can do that okay good good all right well we got a good episode today

100
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,680
episode 63 of the unplugged show we're gonna talk to the Linux grandma I went

101
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,440
to a meetup recently of kabuntu users you know me Matt I'm a kabuntu guy oh

102
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,680
yeah so I went to a kabuntu users meetup and met Valerie she's gonna join us today

103
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,440
and chat about kabuntu KDE specifically the KDE project something neat I learned

104
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,160
that the KDE group is doing it coming up right now and a few other things that

105
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,320
come up and plus just a little bit about her blog as well plus we've got a ton

106
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,720
of feedback and then Microsoft apparently quote-unquote hearts Linux

107
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,200
we're gonna talk about that as well as a bunch of other things coming up later in

108
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,040
the show so big show today accidentally did a big show I don't even know your

109
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,760
show a huge show so let's start with some feedback from Sunday's Linux action

110
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,840
show Dave wrote in and he wanted to kind of take us to the mat Matt get it oh

111
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,160
boy I see how that works he's calling us out though he's like hey guys great show

112
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,040
I've been a listener for a long time you ready for this Matt I use a Windows

113
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,320
sysadmin oh I know a few of those that's okay they exist and that's why he likes

114
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,860
listening to last because he likes to get info about all the OS's but he

115
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,160
wasn't so hot on the negativity towards Docker on Windows he says I get a

116
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,280
feeling from your and Matt's comments in last 335 you're irritated that Docker

117
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,760
would dare roll out their products to Windows hey Windows Server guys want

118
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,320
containers too why do you Linux guys got a hog all the good stuff I would love to

119
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,040
be able to use containers instead of virtualization to keep applications

120
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,120
isolated also you made it sound as if you could run Linux Docker containers on

121
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,240
Windows that's not the case the container share the kernel so Windows

122
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,760
Dockers only run a Windows containers I think we actually didn't make that point

123
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,080
pretty clear so you know you know what it was Matt is we get these terms in the

124
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,760
industry that just drive me crazy and I think Docker is turning into a buzz term

125
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,800
almost because when you start taking out the Linux component of Docker doesn't

126
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,280
seem like Docker anymore now it just seems like you're taking the concept of

127
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,640
container ization and you're just calling it Docker all right pretty much

128
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,200
I mean it becomes a branding thing it's yes that's what I was rolling my eyes at

129
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,480
right I in a way it also shows like what a player Linux is right now in the

130
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,420
market because not the first OS to do this right I think those BSD guys would

131
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,240
have you check out something called jails and I think they're pretty proud

132
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,320
of it in fact I think they think it's still a lot better so Docker comes along

133
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,320
and it kind of does stuff that other things can already do except for it has

134
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,880
this great Docker hub where you can pull down images and it goes from that to now

135
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,040
it's this it's like the concept of container ization is just it's like when

136
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,640
we started calling DVRs Tivo's and it's like no it's not a Tivo that is your

137
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,600
cable company's DVR or that is a play TV you know it just that's what I was

138
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,000
rolling my eyes at well and going from my perspective what kind of irritated me

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,840
about the whole thing is that I have no problem with Microsoft getting on board

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,320
with this what I have a problem with is the fact that as per usual they waited

141
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,120
to the very last minute to where they didn't have to innovate anything then

142
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,640
they kind of slopped they kind of belly flopped onto the platform out of the

143
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,600
pool limped along a little bit and said oh hey look at this grand jewelry thing

144
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
that we're coming up with it's so awesome and we're so innovative they

145
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,560
just the entire experience that they're presenting had a very it just felt like

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,080
that they were doing something unique and different it's like but that's not

147
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,200
the case you're a me too product I'm sorry yeah and like like Linus Tech

148
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,920
points out in the chat room I mean they're depending on LXC docker is built

149
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,400
on that and we wanted to remind us of a little history right well yeah I mean

150
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,200
open vz has been around for a long long time now and that was sort of the

151
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,180
original Linux container platform and I've been using that successfully at

152
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,040
work and I was a late adopter for about five years now so yeah docker is great

153
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,360
I've had a go with it and I can see the advantages and how it extends on what

154
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:11,440
open vz offers but then containers jail CH roots it's not new yeah I agree I

155
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,400
mean I've got Proxmox here in the studio right and I've been using LXC on

156
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,580
that but I think what my I think what my point is is a lot of times we as the

157
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:27,200
technical crowd we see that the groundwork was already there and we

158
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,720
failed to recognize the innovation in making it all work really simple in a

159
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,760
way that a lot larger of an audience can grok and what what is different about

160
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,400
docker is it broke into that gray area that's called DevOps where you've got

161
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,400
developers who maybe didn't fully understand containers and namespaces and

162
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,880
virtualization and kids and Zen and KVM and LXC but they get github right and

163
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,920
they get that docker has this github like functionality and I can pull down

164
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,760
this container and now it's just working and it from end to end it is presented

165
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,040
in a product like fashion that you can completely wrap your brain around you

166
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,600
understand what it is from a concept and so it's easy to talk about it's easy to

167
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
understand and then you understand that has this github like functionality for

168
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,240
images it clicks and I think we as as more technical users sometimes fail to

169
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,680
fully appreciate sometimes just bringing it a little bit more polished bringing

170
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,320
to that edge can really make the difference obviously look at that's what

171
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,560
Apple really makes their money on right what's your number one comment you

172
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,920
always see after a new iPhone or iPad is launched XYZ Android device had it first

173
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,080
Apple pay is a great example of that right there's my Nexus 5 device is

174
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,040
ancient now in the smartphone land sorta it's had wireless payments this entire

175
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,600
time I've never used at once right that the difference is that final 10% gap

176
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,520
closing that seems to be where you can make the difference and that's what

177
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,800
docker did because there's other operating systems that have it as well

178
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,160
so good for Windows I don't think Windows is a fantastic platform for

179
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,200
service to begin with but that's probably too much of a surprise to

180
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,480
anybody and so yeah I mean that's pretty much that's kind of where I'm at with

181
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,400
it's like hey they want to go have a go with it that's great but you know lose

182
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,560
the oh my gosh we're so are they're trying to be like Apple in this regard

183
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,080
it feels like they're just it's like they it almost feels like they're

184
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,360
saying they innovated this whole thing and it's like but you didn't really have

185
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,160
any no you didn't I mean not really all right I wanted to open the floor to

186
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,080
feedback on the Ubuntu 1410 review that we had in Sunday's Linux action show we

187
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,800
got several different emails and comments about it but there wasn't any

188
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,080
one particular theme that jumped out so just as a as an open door to the mumble

189
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,920
room did anybody have any feedback follow-up corrections or arguments they

190
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,320
want to make from our review of Ubuntu 1410 on Sunday show now is your chance

191
00:14:52,320 --> 00:15:01,280
for hold your or forever hold your going once going twice sold this style of it

192
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,280
they they're looking at the different flavors you think that worked out with

193
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,400
because that was kind of something new we were trying you think that worked out

194
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,880
okay yeah at least for me it it feels like a deeper look into the different

195
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,240
yeah the different flavors because I never liked the first Ubuntu I tried

196
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,400
but I really love both Kubuntu and Ubuntu but there was little little less

197
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,880
information from reviews and all that on those flavors right so maybe now

198
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,840
somebody looking for more about Ubuntu will see that and learn about those

199
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,560
other flavors and obviously Mate played a big role in our review so wimpy I used

200
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,120
you want to give a chance to follow up on some of that well first of all thank

201
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,200
you ever so much for covering Ubuntu Mate in your roundup not least because

202
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,440
Ubuntu Mate is not an official flavor yet but also because it's really good to

203
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,960
get good feedback so there was a few things that you mentioned in your review

204
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,140
which if you dig into the Ubuntu Mate website little bit this is one of the

205
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,800
links that isn't and top in the top there on the roadmap I've got a few

206
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:17,960
things outlined that you touched upon so would you like me to okay so there was

207
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,520
there was a few things obviously you'd gone all compies addict mode there and

208
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:36,640
you'd you turned on wobbly windows never way way way back for one there was

209
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,760
actually an Ubuntu Marte dash comp is meta package which was put together

210
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,200
based on the feedback of one of the guys from the Ubuntu Marte compete community

211
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,800
quickly worked out that this was going to require a bit more work than I had

212
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,360
time to put in so I put that on the back burner but what we're going to do is

213
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,280
comp is is never going to be a default option for Ubuntu Marte but it will be a

214
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:06,240
meta package so a compass is still hugely popular in Marte community so I'm

215
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,040
going to make a meta package available so that you can install compete via a

216
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,840
single package you get a same set of default and you get that traditional

217
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,440
compass experience for those people that love it now you know next thing you're

218
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,960
gonna have people are going to ask for barrel support so that way they can get

219
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:32,800
their crazy window decorations I love I love wobbly windows I draw the line at

220
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,920
3d cubes but there is actually a practical application to all of this and

221
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,320
that's with them talking to Jonathan NATO from the accessible computing

222
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:49,960
foundation in his opinion the best desktop zoom application for individuals

223
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,560
with low vision is the enhanced zoom plug-in from compass for all that for

224
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,760
all the fun and games there is actually a practical application for for making

225
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,240
comp is easily available you know I used to use I totally forgot about that I

226
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,000
used to use that during shows to demonstrate something's on a specific

227
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,800
area of the screen I would just zoom into it yeah yeah yeah so for all for

228
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,840
all the wobbly windows fun there is actually practical application and a

229
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,600
couple of other things you touched on was launches and docks if I actually

230
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,040
sent you a screenshot of how I run Ubuntu Marte I think it'd make a lot of

231
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,120
Ubuntu Marte or Marte users shriek because it's unconventional I have a

232
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,760
dock at the bottom so I have a single panel at the top with your applications

233
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,880
places and system yeah and a few few applets to tell me when the discs are

234
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,720
rattling and all of that sort of stuff and then your system tray a dock at the

235
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,760
bottom and I use plank for that yeah and then I have an oversized auto hiding

236
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,280
panel on the left of the screen with a huge workspace switcher on it which is

237
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,040
remarkably like what you find on the right hand side of the screen in GNOME

238
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,320
3 with their workspace switcher so that's how I how I drive my system so

239
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,720
I'm obviously looking at a way to integrate docks what what's so funny

240
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:32,040
those Katie users don't listen to them I know I thought I was being all right

241
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll move on I'll move on very quickly then so again docks won't be a well they

242
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,000
may be a default setting I'll ask you been to Marte community if they want as

243
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,660
a default setting but one of the things I'm planning on working on is that the

244
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:54,880
working title is shapeshifter so you can choose a workspace setup so not just the

245
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,440
panel arrangements but also things like docks launches and and the general

246
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,240
appearance so you know what are the other things we've been seeing a lot is

247
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,240
people want to see that like the whisker menu or something like that that they

248
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,440
can use yeah and that's and that's something else I'm looking at is some of

249
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,240
the launches so I use synapse for example which gives me all of that stuff

250
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,080
that you were looking for so you can yeah you can hotkey type TRM and hit

251
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:28,440
return and there's your terminal yeah guys I mean I we've talked about synapse

252
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,880
multiple times on the show obviously I know about and also gnome do although

253
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,800
when I installed gnome do it locked my limit a session up but first can't shut

254
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,840
me up about yeah we know about the thing is is I just wanted to find a project

255
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,640
that was still active and I just haven't found yeah yeah so so synapse has got a

256
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,800
PPA it's recently been restarted so that's under active development oh yeah

257
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,320
yeah docky and plank of merged so if you look at the latest docking plank

258
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,200
they're effectively identical awesome and in addition to synapse there's

259
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,160
slingscold which is another launcher which looks very interesting and another

260
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,760
one I think it's called the duck launcher and there's one other that I

261
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,680
found so what we'll be doing is is looking at these having conversation

262
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,240
with the community finding out which ones they like the most building some

263
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,840
meta packages and some default configuration and then providing

264
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,680
utility when you install them into my tape for the first time you can have a

265
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,000
this is a visual representation of the different ways the desktop can be

266
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,560
arranged and the tools that are on offer and you can say snap and go and in some

267
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,180
little way that's available now so if you deeply deeply want a Windows XP

268
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,800
classic look there's a Redmond panel layout and if you go to the Ubuntu mate

269
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,960
website you'll find in the release notes the instructions on how to enable the

270
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,840
Redmond layout and that's the first baby steps towards the shape-shifting

271
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,320
create your desktop with a single click the way you want it to be oh I cannot

272
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,480
wait to see that well I'm still running it here in fact I was just thinking

273
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,560
today as I set up I really appreciated how snappy it was and I feel like even I

274
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,080
don't know I feel like even my web browser start faster and I don't know

275
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,360
why the desktop would make the difference I obviously granted it

276
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,480
probably uses less resources but it's not like I'm starved for resources so

277
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,040
yeah it's and it's not about saving resources it's about preserving

278
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,720
resources for the things that matter so by having less resources allocated to

279
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,880
your desktop you've got more resources available to your Steam client or your

280
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,640
web browser for example good point good point less fluff less fluff well great

281
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,720
work on the Mate edition and thank you and it was it was good for the Mate

282
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,400
desktop team to see as well because this is an opportunity for that for them to

283
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,600
see their work showcased as well sure well I look forward to keep checking out

284
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,960
boy something sounds like some of those improvements are gonna be really really

285
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,400
incredible alright so I think Valerie's been waiting long enough before we get

286
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,600
to that I'll thank our first sponsor this week and that's Linux Academy here's

287
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,720
where you need to go right now stop what you're doing oh my gosh what are you

288
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,600
doing you got to go there right now Linux Academy comm slash Linux or slash

289
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,960
unplugged I think both of those work but I like Linux boom why not right Linux

290
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,040
Academy comm slash unplug to get you the discount I know that lock that in go to

291
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,920
Linux Academy comm slash unplug to make sure you get the awesome discount you

292
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,000
can get up to a 33% off and the great thing about that subscription is you

293
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,080
just constantly get all of the new content you get access to everything

294
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,640
pick and choose what you want to start with so have you heard about Linux

295
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,320
Academy you should go check them out right now Linux Academy comm slash

296
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,400
unplugged you can get step-by-step video courses they'll walk you through all

297
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,200
kinds of things thing one of the things I like about Linux Academy too is I've

298
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,760
used it to just sort of test the waters and see what topics interest me but you

299
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,520
could absolutely surely use it to just sort of increase your skill level and

300
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,960
whatever your industry is in or maybe get yourself up to that next level if

301
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
you've been just thrust into a project and you've got to move from like a red

302
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,720
hat box to a Debian box and things like that's one of the great things about

303
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,560
Linux Academy is whatever course where you're taking you're gonna be able to

304
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,320
choose from seven plus Linux distributions and then they structure

305
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,800
all the courseware off the distribution you pick that's a great opportunity if

306
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,640
you're moving between distributions or you need to refresh or you want to

307
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,080
figure out maybe the way the other side does things and I'm showing you some of

308
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,920
the courses you can take now if you take some of their Linux training it's

309
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,720
awesome all kinds of things you can take all kinds of courses over there and one

310
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,960
of the best parts is is they have these learning plans now they will

311
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,440
automatically customize the amount of training time you have just based on the

312
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,160
availability you select and it can send you reminders about courses and it gives

313
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,760
you an idea in a snapshot okay it's gonna take you this long to get through

314
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,040
this course when you log in and by the way you can download these study guides

315
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,320
some of them are an audio and video and listen to them on the go Seth

316
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,360
Scooby Sprite sometimes joins us during Linux unplugged or tech talk listens in

317
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,200
the shower most people listen in the car but Seth listens in the shower and you

318
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,280
know I realized I do some of my best thinking in the shower so maybe I would

319
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,800
do some of my best learning in the shower like that could actually be total

320
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,880
genius I don't know how cool how cool would it be to have like some sort of a

321
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,960
shower proof whiteboard that if you're coming up with these ideas well quickly

322
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,320
jot it down it's funny you say that he actually mailed me I'm not even kidding

323
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,200
a waterproof notebook all of the pages in the notebook are waterproof and he

324
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,400
hangs it I'm not even kidding this is not made up he hangs these in a shower

325
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,320
and with the right pens and he takes notes in there and he sent me a set like

326
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,400
this is what he does this is his system and it works for him this is what's

327
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
awesome about Linux Academy is you can literally customize it to whatever your

328
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,920
scenario is you know if I've gotten emails from people recently said you

329
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,000
know Chris I'm gonna be a dad soon I'm a little worried about keeping my skill

330
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,880
level up Linux Academy can customize to your availability or you know you're

331
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,440
like Seth you're only free times when you're in the shower he still makes it

332
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,600
work and finds value out of it they're constantly adding new things and they

333
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,160
have scenario based training so you actually implement something so say you

334
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,760
take an AWS course you'll implement the s3 back-end storage the ec2 front-end

335
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,200
boxes the load balancing the DNS management you'll do all of that and as

336
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,720
each part in that lab in that scenario based training not only will you be

337
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,600
implementing and at the actual stuff the actual application so you'll have

338
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,480
hands-on experience but they will spin up the service for you as you need them

339
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,880
on-demand just part of their service it's really cool Linux Academy comm slash

340
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,680
unplugged time to go do some more training it's always time to learn a

341
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,240
little bit more and it's never been a better time Linux Academy comm slash

342
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:29,160
unplugged all right well I would like to welcome Valerie to the show she is

343
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,560
hanging out with Eric they might sound like they're at the bottom of a pool but

344
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,040
they promised me they're not swimming right now but you never know with those

345
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:45,760
two but you're just lounging sure how would we know it's an audio only show

346
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,920
how would we know well Valerie welcome to Linux unplugged and I feel bad like I

347
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,360
shouldn't call you the Linux grandma but that's what you go by isn't it I don't

348
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,800
know I don't know but that's what you go by I go by you embrace and I think I

349
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:06,600
love that you you break a lot of stereotypes that when we got we we met

350
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,940
Valerie at a Kubuntu users meetup and when we got there Valerie showed up with

351
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,960
the thumb drives preloaded with plasma 5.1 so that way we could all get

352
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,080
installing if we didn't have you that's how that's how cool Valerie is and so I

353
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,560
wanted to kind of start with your involvement in the KDE project and I

354
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,200
don't know if you wanted to jump right into it but you told me about something

355
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,520
that I didn't know KD he does it's kind of reminded me of the Google Summer of

356
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Code so you can start wherever you want what you do with the KD project probably

357
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,000
a great place but I'd like to get there so tell us what you do for KD well

358
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,920
Google Summer of Code I'm one of the administrators you're actually largest

359
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,560
or one of the largest research and contributors I guess you would say

360
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,560
because I don't know if your listeners know about Google Summer of Code oh

361
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:05,200
sure yeah okay so Google puts up the money and then the free projects

362
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,440
actually do the mentoring for the students and so the students work for

363
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:22,000
summer and get paid for it and we possibly get new members of the

364
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,960
community right like KD connect was started as a Google Summer of Code

365
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,520
project right exactly yeah and all kinds of cool stuff and there are two other

366
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,840
actually two other mentoring projects that we do one is called season of KD

367
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,320
which has no money and we're just actually we're kicking it off late this

368
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,680
year it's just kicking off now it'll go through the end of January participants

369
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,800
get a t-shirt and a certificate and it's open to students it's really open to

370
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,560
anybody who finds a mentor and wants to do it and then Google code in is

371
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,280
relatively new I think Google's only been running it for four or five years

372
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,960
that is for junior high and high school students it is awesome and our mentors

373
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:20,080
come up with small tasks that students can do in a day and the top prize which

374
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:28,120
I think about ten kids win is a trip to Mountain View for two or three days

375
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,560
oh what a treat parents oh yeah and you can see that that's really awesome for

376
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,280
Google because they get a first look at all of these uber smart uber driven kids

377
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:45,800
of course it's wonderful for the projects when I got involved I had just

378
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:55,720
started writing user documentation for Amarok and I set up a page for every

379
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:06,880
little sub subject and then the students did wrote wrote the page did the media

380
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,200
wiki coding and did the screenshots and all I had to do was point clean up after

381
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,680
them it was wonderful and then years later up at Linux fest Northwest I met

382
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:28,200
my prize student who was working for own cloud by then Wow yeah so it's just a

383
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,360
win in every way that you can think of although the mentors work really hard

384
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,160
and it's right during it's in the winter so are you are you serving as the as the

385
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,760
interface like the go-between between the Google reps and the KD project like

386
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,480
are you helping coordinate some of that people they're getting by me I'm one of

387
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,040
the I'm one of the administrators yes so we get all the infrastructure set up we

388
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:57,480
make sure that mentors are around to talk to their students how critical just

389
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,600
whatever how critical to the KD project would you say the Google summer of code

390
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:09,800
involvement has been I think that especially in India it has helped us a

391
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,480
lot because it has spread the word because it's Google spreading the word

392
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,200
and not just us spreading word and we have had we've had two KDE conferences

393
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,080
in India that the students themselves started with like hundreds of students

394
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,640
each and set the EV paid for you know KD people to fly over there and do the

395
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,080
talks and stuff it was really cool but we've got we have some American students

396
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:45,360
not as many as I would like but also lots of European students so that's

397
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,920
pretty cool one place we're lacking is Africa I

398
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,800
think the word is just not spreading and I also think that there's not good

399
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:59,440
enough connectivity for African students to get involved well so let's talk a

400
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,120
little bit about organizing a community and getting involved so we did this

401
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,560
meetup it was fun it was what like eight or nine of us eight of us or something

402
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,160
like that not very big you know I'm about to get on a plane and fly to Ohio

403
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,320
Linux fest which I suspect are probably one of the larger Linux events of the

404
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,880
year and it's such a huge like one-to-one difference it couldn't be two

405
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,320
two more opposite sides of the spectrum however I kind of think there's probably

406
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,280
we should be doing more of these small group meetups I feel like this is it's

407
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,360
it was interesting because we we had we had a gentleman there from the visual

408
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,000
design group at KDE we had the developer of KDE connect there we had yourself

409
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,560
there and we had folks that are involved with you know deploying KDE on recycled

410
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,920
machines and all a whole range of different areas and it was just a nice

411
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,200
one-to-one conversation everybody had a chance to chat we didn't even we were

412
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
we were we were having so much fun talking with each other we didn't eat

413
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,920
the cake we forgot to eat the cake like we forgot to eat cake so that when does

414
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:10,920
that ever happen can't waste it so what would you impart on pond is it is it

415
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,800
just do you think part of the issue is is that we as geeks are just too

416
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,160
antisocial so we won't just take the next step and organize the meetups what

417
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,640
is holding us back with tools like meetup and on all these ways to organize

418
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,720
why aren't we seeing more of these local events do you think well I think in this

419
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,120
case Andrew I didn't even know him I had never met him before I'd never talked to

420
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,560
him before I talked I was talking to KD connect guy and he's like I just moved

421
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,440
to Seattle let's get together and I said okay well let's have a release party so

422
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,720
he's like oh there's this meetup thing like what that you know a couple days

423
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,760
before somebody had set that up so I think that it's just people taking the

424
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,680
initiative yeah I years ago my first computer was an Coleco Adam and I didn't

425
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,360
know how to use it so I started I started an atom users group and we met

426
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,280
for about five years we became such good friends I mean we were meeting when none

427
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,360
of us were even using the Coleco added anymore because you know 80k doesn't

428
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:34,280
know you know I don't know how many people started a user group because they

429
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,160
didn't know what they were doing but that's what I did I was like how else am

430
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:45,040
I gonna find out let's find some experts here I know that there are some the

431
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,120
internet came along we got hangouts we got mumble and we all just kind of stop

432
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,680
going and meeting up in plate in in person you know you used to have to go

433
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,320
to the computer store to get even your to get a box copy of your distro I try

434
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,280
to figure out what it is because I'm just as guilty of it but I want to try

435
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,080
to get out and see people more because it's neat to actually meet and discuss

436
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,960
stuff and is true because remember the computer user newspaper yeah oh wait for

437
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,720
that every month yeah and that's how we got users actually was advertising in

438
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,640
there right yeah free advertising of course yeah um yeah I think part of it

439
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,000
is time everybody seems so busy also a lot of people who started as teenagers

440
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,960
are now getting married and having children right and that sort of puts a

441
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:34,400
cramp in your style so you know here I am now I'm I'm retired and I have time

442
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,840
that's really why I got involved in open source I had been using Linux for over

443
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,760
ten years and I thought I have time now I should give back that was my next

444
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,280
question for you because you know we just got through a couple of weeks of

445
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:51,880
pretty tumultuous community drama and you know sometimes some of the KD

446
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,400
community members are involved in some of the drama I don't think they were

447
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,080
this last round but that can happen from time to time and I wondered like so when

448
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,400
you get to the point where you're ready to retire and kind of just indulge a

449
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,320
passion you got you go pretty far into the community you're in all the IRC

450
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,720
rooms IRC rooms how do you deal with the drama does it bother you what's your

451
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:18,200
approach to that in KDE I'm on the community working group and that that is

452
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,520
a group that the EV got together to actually deal with conflict in the

453
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,240
community and I am not scared of conflict I think that when people are

454
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,560
fighting about things that means they're passionate there's energy there so

455
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,040
what's usually happening though is that people are talking past each other

456
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,680
rather than thinking together and if there's a lot of energy around a subject

457
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,800
there's obviously a problem therefore we need to think together so rather than

458
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,640
clashing we should be listening to one another and thinking together and trying

459
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,760
to work our way through whatever the problem is yeah and I think sometimes

460
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,320
what would help is if we stopped talking to each other through our blogs and talk

461
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:09,440
to each other maybe chat or mumble or the phone yeah face-to-face to me there

462
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,640
is at back to what you were saying the small groups there is absolutely nothing

463
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,680
better than sitting and talking to somebody right you know it's funny too

464
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,400
like for example in a face-to-face meeting you can have a bunch of Linux

465
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,760
users and if one of those Linux users pulls out an iPhone nobody would say

466
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,920
anything but on the internet if one of one of if you're having a group chat and

467
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,000
somebody somehow figured out you had an iPhone they pulled out all of the Linux

468
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,920
users would jump on that person say oh you have an eye you have an iPhone what

469
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,800
are you doing like over the internet we're just we're just a little bit more

470
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,800
sometimes of jerks to each other like we just don't quite care as much but in

471
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,920
person you know we're nicer we're more understanding we listen a little bit

472
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:57,280
better and part of the reason that I'm in KDE I mean KDE runs on Windows and it

473
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,160
runs on Mac so we actually have as part of our community people who work oh sure

474
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,280
on making sure everything works on Windows and works on Mac and it's true

475
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,800
every once in a while they get disparaged no I shouldn't leave that I

476
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,400
shouldn't leave up these BSD either but I was just making kind of a like a

477
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,760
dramatic comparison because really yeah we're more critical over the internet

478
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,520
than we are in person is really what happens and it's just I think that's why

479
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,240
even these small meetups are really good because it can happen in small little

480
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,680
doses too it doesn't have to be these huge events I think it's it's happening

481
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,040
in our culture at large if you look at our politics and it's starting to

482
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,960
happen not just in the US but around the world that we're getting these polarized

483
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,240
groups and so we need to figure out how to you know and some people say that

484
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,240
that's because people used to have more time and used to pull together mm-hmm

485
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,760
and maybe maybe there's something to that I don't know well it all say what

486
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,160
you're taught what you're saying is something that I am actually trained in

487
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,980
is I have had a degree in leadership and everything that you're touching on is

488
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:07,320
exactly what I was trained on in in terms of Chris you're mentioning these

489
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,240
small groups but also you're mentioning getting together face-to-face you know

490
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,800
talking on the phone over as opposed to over each other's blogs that speaks to

491
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,120
everything that I was trained you voice communication and personal

492
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:27,560
communication is so much more important than say oh just fighting over blogs

493
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,280
that's just ridiculous yeah well fighting over fighting is generally not

494
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,120
very constructive anyway but it does show you that there's there's a point

495
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,560
around which there is a problem and there's energy that means it can be

496
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,360
solved mm-hmm and seriously I have a lot of hope both in the political sphere and

497
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:53,920
and you know look at all the energy that there is in free software we can we can

498
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,760
get past these things and we can solve the problems mm-hmm I really do I like

499
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,200
that it's optimistic too I like that all right well I'm gonna move you and

500
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,120
Eric up into the into the main group here and we'll just move on with the

501
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,200
show and Valerie and Eric stick around and we'll we'll chew through a few more

502
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,720
topics and I'll open up the mumble room to any questions for Valerie as well we

503
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,920
have a couple of emails that I want to help some folks with some some switching

504
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,360
to Linux problem so everybody stick around don't go anywhere we got a lot

505
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,600
more show but first I want to thank our next sponsor and that's ting ting is

506
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,960
mobile that makes sense my mobile service writer man I tell you it's never

507
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,080
been a better time to be a ting customer the Nexus 6 is gonna be coming soon to

508
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,120
the ting network and you can switch right now and start saving start saving

509
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,080
right now by switching your team because you'll only pay for what your users no

510
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,520
contract it's a flat six dollars for the line and then just your usage on top of

511
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,640
that ting just takes your messages your minutes your megabytes whatever your

512
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,400
usage is that's what you pay so I've got three lines right now it's six dollars a

513
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,840
line I was just last night looking around at another cellular carry to see

514
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,480
what they charge when you add another phone and it is forty freaking dollars a

515
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,600
month just for another line unbelievable and then they make you sign a two-year

516
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,360
contract on top of that no none of that anymore stop it you know that's not the

517
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,680
way it should be that's not where you're gonna get value from your mobile

518
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,720
provider go with ting go to linux.ting.com linux.ting.com not only is that

519
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,840
like a little quick way of saying yo thanks for supporting Linux unplugged

520
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,320
but it'll also get you a $25 credit towards your first ting device take $25

521
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,440
off your first ting device then you've got a ting service you're only paying

522
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,440
for your usage there's no contract no early termination fee and you've got a

523
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,240
real person who will answer the phone if you call them try it right now 1855 ting

524
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,460
FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. business hours then they got a real

525
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:51,600

526
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,080

528
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,440
to call somebody you want somebody that's really into the phones that they're

529
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,080
talking about that's what so I like their approach about that and their

530
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,280
dashboard they just gave it a brand new upgrade and it's better than ever they

531
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,280
have such a great ting dashboard that gives you a full oversight of where

532
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,760
you're at so go to linux.ting.com and I was doing some digging around using big

533
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,520
data you know man how I you know how man I'm a big data analyst did you know

534
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,720
did it oh absolutely like your side gig yeah big data Matt big data so I was

535
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,800
looking at the big data over what turns out Linux unplugged audience is sneaky

536
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,640
they've been picking up the Moto G I don't know where I'm they probably find

537
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,880
themselves a CDMA sprint compatible Moto G and they've been bringing over to the

538
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,880
ting network and any on their own map they went to linux.ting.com they got a

539
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,120
$25 service credit they found the ting user forum where there's Moto G users in

540
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,240
there talking about how to get it to work I'm not exaggerating when I say the

541
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,520
Moto G is one of the most popular phones among Linux unplugged audience members

542
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,760
and it's not even a phone ting sells directly this is a super cool about ting

543
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,920
is they have a support network in their forums where you'll find people that are

544
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,080
trying out things like Firefox OS Sailfish OS on different phones and ting

545
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,320
doesn't go in there and go shut up stop talking they don't stamp it down in fact

546
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,000
sometimes you see some of the employees and they're giving a few tips it's

547
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,960
awesome and it just gives you a little insight into ting's culture so go to

548
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,200
linux.ting.com to get started no more contract my friends no more get out of

549
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,840
that contract they also got an early termination relief program if you is in

550
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,720
a contract they'll pay up to $75 per line you gots to get cancelled go to

551
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,800
linux.ting.com and a big big thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged

552
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,120
okay so let's see if we can help and then we'll get into one of our topics so

553
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:46,480
I want everybody get your heads together Jose writes in he says hola Chris and

554
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,400
everyone in the JBU community I'm writing to see if there's a way you guys

555
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,240
can help me out before I go on sorry if I get any of the technical terms wrong

556
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,080
I'm a forensic psychologist and I've started to learn more about computers

557
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,280
and tech stuff so naturally because he's gone down the right path he's wound up

558
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,400
at Linux so here's this problem I want to switch to a Linux distro full-time

559
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,160
currently I'm a Mac and Windows 7 user this guy I love him already Mac and

560
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,560
Windows 7 user this is our bread and butter right here however I've been

561
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,160
playing around with Mint Debian Arch and Ubuntu on VirtualBox so far I love it

562
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:25,520
there's just one huge issue that's keeping me from doing the change I think

563
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,960
it's my HP laptops hardware every time that I try to boot from an ISO the

564
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,080
kernel starts up I see it's do its thing and after the screen goes black it never

565
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,980
comes back I've tried Arch, Mint, Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora, you name it the only two

566
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:46,560
that I've managed to boot up and install is Mint using combat compatibility mode

567
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,560
and Manjaro with hot with the hardware detection tool the problem is after

568
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,360
installing it happens again starts to boot up I see some kernel stuff and then

569
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:02,200
black I got an HP Pavilion with an AMD Radeon HD he doesn't say

570
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,760
specifically which eight gigs of RAM he's got a SATA 640 gig blah blah blah

571
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,960
what can I do is this a stupid mistake can you help me he just wants to switch

572
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,920
and I know I don't have an HP anybody in the Mumble Room have an HP Pavilion laptop

573
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,620
that has experienced any problems with booting up getting their display

574
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,720
showing I know it's not super uncommon but it's not a problem I've had for a

575
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,720
while I haven't had that exact problem in an in an HP book but I've had that

576
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,760
problem numerous times on other laptops and the way I've always fixed it is

577
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:38,040
booting with the no-mode set yeah I were kind of discussing here that almost

578
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,840
sounds like he's having a UEFI secure boot problem you just need side of

579
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,520
disabled secure boot or something well we said it's Windows 7 right well Windows

580
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,280
7 well he's a Windows 7 user but the system may not have come with Windows 7

581
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,080
probably no so the thing is I mean I've tried no I have a HP laptop it's a

582
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,440
pavilion that has that issue every once in a while and I've actually had a

583
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:07,120
couple computers that have a problem where HP has this weird flaw in some

584
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,600
laptops where it's the display is actually working perfectly fine but the

585
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,240
brightness level is completely off yeah so you have to add you have to

586
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,040
manually add the brightness higher but you can actually do a script that will

587
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,240
also automate it so a dog Z and the IRC says he has an HP pavilion laptop no

588
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:31,840
mode does work no mode set to get his gentoo yeah that's so you add so here's

589
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,680
what here's the problem is is I think Jose kind of got that when he did like

590
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,000
compatibility mode it probably like the you know the option and grub probably

591
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,800
just appends no mode set but the issue that he's been running into well maybe

592
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,960
not but like he got that far but the problem is is he maybe could append it

593
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,240
to the to the live CD but then he has to remember to also once the systems

594
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,640
installed he's gonna have to hit II at the grub menu there and append it to his

595
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:59,300
installed boot menu to until he gets his graphic situation worked out and then

596
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,840
maybe if he gets a new graphical environment stalls the proprietary

597
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,360
driver I don't know at least Bantu and Fedora if you when you boot when you're

598
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,360
going through the installer if you if you append no mode set or if in a bunch

599
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,440
I think you can actually at f6 and there's a there's a thing for options

600
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,960
and you can choose it it will automatically add it to your grub

601
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,080
config so it's persistent can you do that in a bunch too yeah you can I

602
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:24,400
believe so yeah yeah yeah I think it's f6 and it whatever it says modes at the

603
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,240
bottom and then you can just check no so you're saying if you hit f6 and you add

604
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,760
that and then you boot up the installer the installer will then append that to

605
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:37,000
the final installed version of grub yes but don't quote me on the f6 quote me on

606
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,480
whatever it at the bottom look from yeah like it when it boots up you see English

607
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,760
hit English and then it will give you an option install or boot to live

608
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,200
environment at the very bottom there's F keys and whatever one says mode you

609
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,840
click on that I think it's f6 it should be f6 the last time I installed it was f6

610
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,080
the other thing you can do is just add it to the kernel perimeters in etsy default grub

611
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,640
right yeah if he's already got it installed could do that boot to elastin

612
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:05,080
but okay so what though once he's up and going what do we think a proprietary

613
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,080
graphics driver would solve the problem long term so once once X starts you'd

614
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,600
at least get a desktop again because it's never coming back and if he puts it

615
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,160
in no mode set won't that be like low resolution once X starts up no with an

616
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,720
AMD card I would go I would go proprietary just because you're already

617
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,160
dealing with a problem set up as far as I'm concerned I AMD cards especially in

618
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,560
laptops are just a nightmare okay I would go proprietary based on the

619
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,200
experience I've had with AMD cards on laptops and I banged my head on this for

620
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:39,680
so many years I would if it was me yeah that is that is the thing right if it's

621
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,760
an older Radeon yeah and Rekai has a great suggestion the chat room as well

622
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,920
it might be an issue of function f3 to manually up the brightness oh yeah maybe

623
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,120
yeah but I might like Tripoli my S is Tripoli I actually have to go in and

624
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,880
code in there's an actual a grub information you have to add in to

625
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,960
actually get it to any of your function keys to work at all I mean including

626
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,600
your brightness I have an HP Pavilion can't remember it's like a 17 inch

627
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,160
laptop with a Radeon 5800 something in there I can't remember if I have this

628
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,880
problem so I if I might power it up tonight and so it would be no mode set

629
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,040
I'll add that to the boot options and now here's a foolproof way to know for

630
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,860
sure if it's an if it's a brightness issue or if you're truly getting a no

631
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,120
display server you take a flashlight I'm dead serious about this go into a

632
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,080
dark room and with it booted up shine on there you'll see whether or not if it's

633
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,320
on or not yeah yeah a couple people yeah it's a brand because the pixels are

634
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:40,100
there the backlight just doesn't shine bright and I actually actually the

635
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,440
backlight inverts so like when it boots up it sets the backlight to a hundred

636
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:57,960
you guys deal with this crap seriously Jose what you do is just stick stick

637
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,480
with Windows until you can afford to buy a computer just a run no I'm kidding I

638
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,800
don't know though I mean like killing about these issues it feels like we're

639
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,720
back in the 90s all of a sudden and I guess but it does develop good skills I

640
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,680
guess the other thing I was gonna suggest is I wonder if he couldn't just

641
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,480
hook up I mean maybe just a troubleshoot and maybe look at logs and stuff like

642
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,440
that an external monitor I'm sure probably especially depends whether or

643
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,740
not if he's going like you know s-video HDMI or VGA a lot of depending on the

644
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:30,040
age of the laptop it could be VGA or s-video I mean just really depends but

645
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:34,040
if it's a VGA or HDMI it'll probably work if it's s-video shoot yourself in

646
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,160
the foot right now yeah all right we got we got two two bigger thicker topics I

647
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:45,280
want to get to but first I just I wanted to just talk about Steam OS for a second

648
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,020
because you know we have no idea what's gonna happen there but I like to

649
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,160
speculate and Zach the Penguin wrote in he says hey guys long time since I wrote

650
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,000
I was messing around with Steam's whole steam from a Windows computer thing

651
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,840
which is pretty awesome and the thought popped into my head what if the

652
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,120
long-term goal here is for valve to stream games to steam boxes like on

653
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,560
live did it would completely eliminate the Windows only problem and adds value

654
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:12,480
to steam to serve it as a service I know right now it's only a local network

655
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,760
deal but it might be possible for steam to do this from their own servers in the

656
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,720
future so here's what he's suggesting is that perhaps the LAN steam streaming we

657
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,440
see today is the early groundwork for something that valve would then deliver

658
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,800
over the internet down the road so you buy a steam box you don't have to have a

659
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:35,240
local Windows PC they go all on live on you and they stream the game let's say

660
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,240
let's say this is valve and if they do it they're gonna do it right so let's

661
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,320
just let's assume it's gonna work right let's just take that as a grant as a

662
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:48,320
granted we'll see all the piping challenges gone right do you think a

663
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,200
this is something valve would consider Matt and B would this sort of solve a

664
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,840
huge problem for steam machines as then you get all of these great native Linux

665
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,680
games and if you want a legacy Windows game from the quote-unquote PC era or

666
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,320
whatever they would call it we'll stream it to you from the valve online service

667
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,840
do you think that you would you see him doing only two ways I see this working

668
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,120
realistically speaking if I'm valve the only way I would reliably do this

669
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,000
especially with games that might require a little bit more back-and-forth data

670
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,040
would be to team up with Google and the reason why is because then you know for

671
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,800
a fact that you've got a partner who has a vested interest in connectivity that

672
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,960
you guys can kind of sync up what's needed to get that data back and forth

673
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:37,240
boy that's dirty though but yeah Joe blows ISP emporium you know they may not

674
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,600
care they may be like oh yeah you want us to help you know saturate our network

675
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,200
yet but you can go buy this we're not gonna help you yeah so that would be the

676
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,600
downside otherwise lower end games maybe you know I don't know right vault

677
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:54,720
vault you say Nvidia tried it and it didn't work yes they if I remember

678
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:01,120
correctly they tried making a it was displayed during e3 or something I

679
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:08,840
believe it was sort of like a cloud hosting for your games where it was

680
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,680
speculated like oh you can put it at your ISP and ISP can actually deliver it

681
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:21,480
to you hmm yeah and it they store it for you and then stream it to you yes sort

682
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:27,600
of like that like the these people can or companies can be oh we want to buy a

683
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:34,360
rack or something of these dedicated processing and then rent it off to our

684
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,680
customers yeah I don't see if steam ever wanting to get into that kind of

685
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,880
infrastructure investment to want to render all these games and stream it to

686
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,640
people and all the ISP agreements it just sounds like so much bureaucratic

687
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,960
telco BS I just don't see anybody at valve having the will to suffer through

688
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,040
it and it will never ever be comparable to local gameplay and I think valve at

689
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,440
the end of the day cares a lot about the local gameplay pay play experience and

690
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,680
they know that people are willing to pay to have slightly more powerful systems

691
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,520
if they want to play those kinds of games I think it is lit I think the steam

692
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,040
streaming is what it is what it is it is a transitionary tool to migrate from

693
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,080
your old crappy piece of junk Windows PC that has all kinds of problems into this

694
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:19,360
nice new steam box now I think it was a little bit envisioned during the time

695
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:22,040
when everybody thought the tablets were gonna rule the world and PCs were going

696
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:28,520
away but I think it still has some potential that's tough yeah that's a

697
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,240
tough one all right so we we do have some big topics including Microsoft

698
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,680
announcing that they just full-on love Linux now

699
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,200
Satya Nadella I'm not dude I don't know did you see the picture did you know he

700
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,960
was up on stage doing a live stream in Satya Nadella behind him on the

701
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,520
projector has Microsoft Hearts Linux I got I got a picture for those of you

702
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,480
watching the video version right there is there a knife sticking out of Tux's

703
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,480
back or oh I see it now okay yeah isn't that something Microsoft Hearts Linux so

704
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,200
we're gonna talk about what that means and where Microsoft is going with that

705
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,760
and then also you might have heard about the initiative to fork the Debian

706
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:11,800
project or at least some veterans are considering it and then forking Fedora

707
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,520
came up but that conversation ended fairly quickly we'll talk about that in

708
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,040
just a moment but first I want to tell you about Digital Ocean head over to

709

like what is Digital Ocean Chris because I live under a rock and do not know

713
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,520
about super awesome services that are blowing up like crazy well I'm glad you

714
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,160
asked me Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering

00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,840
the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server some of you can get

00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:53,680
started in about 55 seconds some of you can get started in about 32 seconds 22

717
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,080
seconds it's nuts send them to me take a screenshot email I'm Chris at Jupiter

718
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,680
broadcasting.com you guys is crazy and by guys I mean guys and gals just a

719
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,080
little disclaimer here's what you get for five dollars per month 512 megabytes

720
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:13,640
of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD yeah they're all SSD one CPU and a terabyte of blazing

721
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,600
fast transfer why because Digital Ocean has tier one bandwidth providers at

722
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,280
their data centers in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and London

723
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,120
I blows my mind you guys I log in there and I like updating my system just

724
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,160
because I like seeing download numbers that high I'm not even joking at all

725
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,200
it's that awesome and one of the great things about Digital Ocean is that

726
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,640
dashboard it is super simple and intuitive but yet extremely powerful

727
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,520
you can take snapshots backup migrations move transfer droplets to different

728
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,680
users DNS management one-click installs of the entire LAMP stack GitLab WordPress

729
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,360
all sitting on top of KVM it's really slick and I think the best part is that

730
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:59,760
API and you can use that API to take advantage of some of those services on a

731
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,120
much larger scale and Digital Ocean right now for a little while I don't

732
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,320
know how long because it's crazy to me I think this is nuts but I understand why

733
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,960
they're doing it because they're crazy about getting the quality of their

734
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,480
tutorials up crazy Digital Ocean I tell you what they're willing to pay you up

735
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,160
to $200 if you write a tutorial for them and they have editors that will work

736
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,880
with you so you don't have to be like a wordsmith you don't got to be a

737
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,080
wordsmith they'll work with you if you've got a great tutorial they'll pay

738
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,200
you for it and that's Digital Ocean's commitment to getting the tutorials up

739
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,880
on their site the highest quality possible because their dashboard is all

740
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,960
about getting you going the way you even fund your account is about making it as

741
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,560
simple and out of the way as possible the API all of it everything is about

742
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,520
making sure you can get your infrastructure up and running as fast as

743
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,120
possible to get on to your work and that's why they're trying to have the

744
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,480
best documentation as well digitalocean.com use the promo code unplugged

745
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:54,240
October to get a $10 credit you can try out that $5 rig for two months for

746
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,720
absolutely free and a big thank you to Digital Ocean for sponsoring Linux

747
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,360
unplugged okay Matt put your crazy hat on because you're not even gonna believe

748
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:08,120
some of the ridiculous shenanigans going down right now so our buddy friend of

749
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,680
the show Satya Nadella was up on stage today talking about how great Azure is

750
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,320
and how wonderful Linux is with Azure he says did you guys know it's like peanut

751
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,480
butter and chocolate that's not actually what he said but isn't it more like

752
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,560
peanut butter and motor oil I mean he did talk a little bit about how great

753
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:30,400
Azure has become and I just wanted to touch on this because this is the new

754
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,320
Microsoft this is the Microsoft that is now competing with Linux not on the

755
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:39,720
desktop but in these service like infrastructure type ways so a Microsoft

756
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,840
has rolled out 300 major new features and services in the last 12 months to

757
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:49,560
Azure bullet point number one there are 10,000 new Azure customers per week there

758
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:55,640
are currently 350 million active active directory users on Azure so they have

759
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:00,120
active directory up on Azure over 2 million developers are using Visual

760
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:06,760
Studio Online to connect directly to Azure and customers are using once we're

761
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,640
only using basic Azure services 60% are now using higher level services and

762
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:18,800
number one core OS is now supported in Azure the container optimized Linux

763
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,200
distribution with a minimal memory footprint is available starting today in

764
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:30,760
the Azure marketplace so they are all about Linux guys is this okay so I'm an

765
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,520
old fart when it comes to Microsoft I grew up in Microsoft I grew up in

766
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,720
Microsoft's backyard I've been in and out of there checking judge you know

767
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,280
chatting with friends for years I've watched them for a long time and the one

768
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,560
thing that I'll tell you that really stood out is they are some competitive

769
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:49,480
SOBs over there at Microsoft and can I really trust that they're all in with

770
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,960
Linux or is this embrace and extend again Matt I go to you first personally

771
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,680
I feel like that yes in the sense that they've tried like butting heads with

772
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,480
you know the Linux direction the Linux ideas the Linux all the all anything to

773
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,160
do with Linux they tried that it didn't work that's kind of the bomber air I

774
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:12,000
think in this case they realized that if they're gonna remain relevant 10 15

775
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,800
years forward they're going to have to start playing nicer with their

776
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,680
neighbors so I think it's legit I think it's legit for selfish reasons they're

777
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,720
not there to be your buddy they would soon as you know they're not they're not

778
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,840
there for nice reasons they're there out of preservation I think and you keep in

779
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:31,120
mind I know people that are Microsoft admins that work for Microsoft events

780
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,520
that put on you know that like some behind-the-scenes stuff yeah it is but

781
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,840
because they're being put there and they're not thrilled about having to

782
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,080
learn this stuff they're literally in lockdown mode learning stuff in a hurry

783
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:46,080
because they're suddenly this has become a thing long term you know they're

784
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,560
they're hoping that they're basically just trying to remain relevant I think

785
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,800
that's the big the big piece of it will it matter 10 15 years down the road I

786
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,560
don't know yeah I think it's legitimate but it's not legitimate for the reasons

787
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,120
why people might think oh they've changed their mind and they're being

788
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,880
nice now it's not it at all it's survival honestly it's it's being able

789
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,200
to remain competitive with things that are frankly it's a it's a pragmatic you

790
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,240
know it's a pragmatic Microsoft it pretty much wimpy why is it that you and

791
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,920
I kind of feel a little dirty when we talk about this what is it why are we

792
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,720
why do we have this bias what's going on well it just it feels uncomfortable this

793
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:30,000
is not this is not Microsoft's area I used to work as an enterprise architect

794
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,320
for Windows platforms and before that I was a Unix admin and since then I've

795
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:41,080
worked exclusively in Linux and these are not the same market spaces and I

796
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:46,520
would be really interested to know how sort of the Windows admins feel about

797
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,960
this statement from Microsoft that they love Linux they must be shitting their

798
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,280
pants right now that is a good point I didn't think about it from that

799
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,200
perspective let's ask Valerie since she has some perspective on the matter

800
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,080
Valerie do you do you buy the new Microsoft or are you skeptical oh she's

801
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,720
not in the room right oh what do you think you take it

802
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:14,240
with the whole Microsoft thing um Adela really wants to go towards for if the

803
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,480
cloud infrastructure sure he knows that Linux does better in cloud than Windows

804
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:25,580
server does so I just think he's come to the realization and the company is

805
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:31,240
coming to the point where they can't serve survive with just Windows Server

806
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,480
alone they have to start branching out and using something like Linux and yeah

807
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,280
I think I think he's trying to take the company in the right direction in terms

808
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,160
of the service market yeah I think it's interesting to watch and it's more

809
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,920
options for more deployments of Linux that seems like a good thing okay anybody

810
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,120
else want to comment on that before we go to the next kind of crazy thing that

811
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:56,120
I was like what this week that just made me kind of flat-footed alright next one

812
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:01,920
did you guys see the roll up your sleeves we may need to fork Debian site

813
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,760
did you guys catch this and I'll just read the first paragraph here we are

814
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,040
veteran which is bolded by the way veteran Unix admins and we are concerned

815
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:16,360
about what's happening to canoe slash Linux Debian edition and they're

816
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:22,440
considering forking the project I want to stop right here okay I think that's a

817
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:28,360
great idea I think fork it like instead of instead of delaying the progress of

818
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,760
the distribution or the direction yeah fork it and go your own way that seems

819
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,240
like that actually seems like the right approach to take especially if you're

820
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,440
never going to be satisfied with the system D version of Debian you know that

821
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,760
seems like a pretty reasonable response and I I hope they do I think the

822
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,160
competition would be good the thing that I can't get past it seems like a lot of

823
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:52,200
other people have picked up on it is is the language used there veteran Unix

824
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,680
admins and bolded that what that does is sort of projects old farts and I'm not

825
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,720
trying to be derogatory I'm just saying like from a messaging standpoint people

826
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,480
are saying that makes you sound like a bunch of old farts and it people sort of

827
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,600
write it off wow what do they care a bunch of stick in the muds and it's sort

828
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:13,400
of like it immediately makes people not take it very seriously well you know

829
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,000
looking at from my perspective I think it's a combination of quote-unquote old

830
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,520
farts as well as people that are of the mind that if it isn't broke why fix it

831
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,280
at least from their perspective and so you might have an inner mixture of

832
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:31,080
individuals in that space wimpy do you think they're just crazy well they're

833
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,800
exercising their right to free speech and all power to their elbow and

834
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,320
everything and if they want to have a go at forking Debbie and then I think

835
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,200
everyone should just stand back and let them get on with it and let themselves

836
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:48,840
burn yeah just just let's just try to take those two words together fork

837
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:57,160
Debian okay forking is hard I have first-hand experience of forking really

838
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:04,880
small projects in the comparison with Debian so they want to fork Debian just

839
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,440
think about all of the infrastructure that's involved there and all of the

840
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:16,680
platforms and ever it's just crazy nonsense and Ian Jackson's obviously got

841
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,560
an opinion about this and he posted his thing to the mailing list to suggest

842
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:27,840
that this was you know evaluated one last time very expressly stating he

843
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,600
didn't want to turn this into a system D versus whatever in its system debate

844
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:38,000
and then the internet explodes with system D inferno again this is so

845
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,800
disappointing it's just it's just laughable and and if they want to fork

846
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:51,600
Debbie and yeah do that thing I'm all for it I'm gonna watch that gleefully

847
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:57,280
from afar yeah I would be pretty skeptical myself and vault you think no

848
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,400
no don't fork don't don't do that we need more resources as it is not less

849
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:07,320
people working on the same stuff well that's obviously the but my actual

850
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,920
practical point is no don't fork it find a way to accommodate you know multiple

851
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:18,600
in its systems in Debbie and if you want to for Debbie and yeah go on to me if

852
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,240
they're never gonna be interested in being involved with the project in that

853
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,480
state then they should just fork it you're not really losing resources

854
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,080
because if they weren't gonna cooperate anyways you're not losing them they

855
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,760
already they're already lost so let them go off and do their own thing well no

856
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,840
the thing is is that no well yeah okay if they want to fork Debbie and fork

857
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:39,880
Debian but there's their system BSD there's useless day yeah there are

858
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:46,120
shims around system D if they were really serious about coming up with an

859
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,400
alternative they would be looking at those projects in terms of developing

860
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,880
them and supporting them within the Debbie and community rather than saying

861
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:58,520
we're gonna fork Debbie and which is frankly insane oh yeah you're talking

862
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:06,280
the biggest distribution there is the mother of most of our distributions yeah

863
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:11,400
that's a huge undertaking if you think would you do a would you do a complete

864
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,960
fork or would it be more like sort of a clone of straight-up Debbie and where

865
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,800
you're just constantly swapping out the system D parts for something else well

866
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,760
one thing that comes to mind that I want to point out here is that now last time

867
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,280
I checked most computers with blogging platforms attached don't have

868
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:33,520
breathalyzers ready so it's entirely possible they were fit-shaped and they

869
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:41,040
got on a year maybe no I'll tell you I'll tell you who's a little s-faced how

870
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:49,000
about this one how about this one fork fedora org shall we fork fedora not

871
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,040
really it's doing great maybe we're not veteran enough that's great that's

872
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:01,000
really that is fantastic they sound like they're really housed you know what yeah

873
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:09,120
yeah they're really housed right yeah no Matt did prove that that he did

874
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,400
actually later up on G plus I think like ten people on the whole internet but

875
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,960
still we exist yeah that actually is getting housed as a term I don't it's

876
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:19,360
like got a ridiculous origin though or something I don't remember it's

877
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:30,760
abbreviated from you know okay but this fork business like shall we fork

878
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:36,040
fedora time to fork Debian I've never well actually we have the only time I

879
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:40,200
think we've ever seen the Linux community this riled up and just unable

880
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:45,760
to just move forward for a long time was like the Microsoft Novell deal where you

881
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,400
had boycott Novell prop up and you had all this stuff and there was such

882
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:55,240
decisive lines and it went on for like two years but really not I mean you know

883
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,480
it was it was not as bad two years but it really went on for a while and this

884
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,080
is like we haven't had a good old classic drama like this since then it's

885
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:07,240
like the good old days again who are all right I remember the old Novell thing

886
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,640
and I'm sitting there going thinking that's great I'm gonna go watch TV now

887
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,280
because I'm just like this is gonna be a week-long thing and people are gonna

888
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:19,120
blow it over yeah that still cracks me up just all right wimpy go ahead ask the

889
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:27,320
question that's on everybody's mind well I'm putting myself out there again is

890
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:32,760
the bloke that says you know system D is really quite good but I I often wonder

891
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:37,760
reading what some of the people say about system D and also listening to

892
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:42,880
other podcasts and what they have to say about system D and I'm left with the

893
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:48,600
impression of you've never actually used it not only have you never actually used

894
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:53,280
it you've never actually sat down and written a unit file you're not a package

895
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,440
maintainer you haven't had to deal with init scripts and you haven't seen the

896
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:03,920
benefits of migrating package from an init script to system D and and the

897
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,640
many other benefits of system D now I can appreciate that people are very very

898
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,160
firm in their opinion that they like the way things are and and there's a place

899
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:20,800
for that but I think a lot of the speculation and commentary about system

900
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,120
D is being had by people who simply do not know what they're talking about now

901
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:30,000
I'm not suggesting necessarily that fork Debian falls into this camp they would

902
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,120
claim to be seasoned Linux administrators and every and veterans

903
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:40,480
quite so maybe they do know what they're talking about and they have legitimate

904
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,080
reasons as to why they feel system D is not going to to suit them but there are

905
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:49,200
some podcasts where I've heard them debating the the various init systems

906
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:54,280
and talking about the pros and cons and then admitting partway through there you

907
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:59,200
know slacking off of system D they've never used it yes think well how are you

908
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:05,320
qualified to have an opinion my my so my stance on the system D discussion I

909
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:09,240
think if you look over the history of this show has an arc where I'm pretty

910
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:13,160
neutral don't give a crap and then I become pretty pro system D and then I

911
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,520
get to a point where I was a little belligerent to people who didn't who

912
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,880
didn't seem to think going forward with system is a good idea because the reason

913
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,000
I've I don't know belligerence right word but I'll just label it that the

914
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:30,320
reason why I felt that way is because as as a sys admin of like 14 15 years there

915
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,480
are literally things that I see in system D that I think if I had that when

916
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:41,360
I was managing servers I would have hated my job so much less like it's not

917
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,320
just small stuff that I see in system D some of the things that system D brings

918
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,920
as a whole I see as fundamentally necessary for Linux to remain

919
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:56,080
competitive at scale like without those things and with and without those things

920
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,440
free BSD could easily eat our lunch really because essentially we're we're

921
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,400
just as capable and but system D offers so many things and the problem is you

922
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,800
really don't know how important they are until you've deployed Linux at scale or

923
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,040
you have a you know a very network demanding thing or you have something

924
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,320
that has to be as absolutely minimal as possible and support socket activation

925
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,640
or you need something that's integrated with namespaces all these things that

926
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:27,480
are edge cases but together matters so much and may and are so important to

927
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:32,080
keeping Linux competitive not just on the server but also in mobile that when

928
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,600
you when you come when you argue against system D what you have to realize is you

929
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,680
have to really come with something that's extremely compelling because what

930
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:45,560
you are arguing for is essentially removing what I in my personal opinion I

931
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,360
and I'm not saying it's right but in my personal opinion are fundamentally

932
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,880
critical features to keep Linux competitive so if you're gonna say no

933
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:56,080
system do you've got to have an answer for those problems and and yeah I don't

934
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,640
think you and I can have a debate about this because I think we're clearly on

935
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:03,800
the same side of the fence and we've got we've got our personal opinions it

936
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:08,600
sounds like a largely similar reasons so really what we need is somebody to step

937
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,840
up and tell us why we're wrong and I I think part of it is some of the more

938
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,200
vocal people debating this are not the same people who are as impacted by it

939
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,600
like I think there's a group of people that care a lot but they're just not as

940
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,960
vocal about debating it I think I'm trying to because I get emails that seem

941
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,960
really well reasoned but I even then I've still not been convinced the

942
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,180
biggest things that convinced me that it might be a problem are always the what

943
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:40,080
if scenarios and I think yeah if that happens we could have a problem but

944
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,920
that's not a today problem that's a what-if problem anyway so how do we get

945
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,200
talking about oh yeah the forks yeah so there you go the system D conversation

946
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,680
once again has been stirred back up by these project forks and you know what's

947
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,760
interesting is you check the Linux forms like r slash Linux and just general

948
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,720
discussion forums and people are constantly still asking about it it is

949
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,720
genuinely a topic that even though it seems like we've talked about it at

950
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:08,840
nauseam people still seem to care about I guess that's sort of the fun of being

951
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,000
a Linux user is you get to care about such nitty-gritty things like your

952
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,560
display compositor and system D and all that stuff so I guess that's why we're

953
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,480
that's why we do it all right well so you probably already know this but Linux

954
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:27,640
action show won't be live on Sunday it's gonna be on Monday and I think I don't

955
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,160
know if Ange told you Matt but I think we're gonna try start at two o'clock so

956
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,680
you probably want to get to the studio around 1 30 because then we're gonna try

957
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,200
to fit in a foe too and then we'll be able to show all the highlights from

958
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:43,760
Ohio Linux fest so if you're gonna be in Ohio this weekend come say hi to some

959
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,520
of us there some of the crew will be there and we'll be going out and getting

960
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,800
our party on in the evening so join us for that as well and then join us for

961
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,800
Linux action show Monday afternoons we'll have the time in your local times

962
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,760
and over at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and Eric is reminding me

963
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:02,640
dutifully so that you can also say hi to him at seagull is there anything you

964
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:10,520
want to plug about that Eric say hi to Eric and Valerie at the sea it's seagull

965
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:16,160
right that's how you say it yes se a GL and you can find it at just google for

966
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,040
seagull but I think it's like seagull org and it's a it's a Seattle Linux

967
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,440
users group meetup right or who's put on it's a Seattle GNU Linux conference

968
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,000
thank you thank you I don't know why I can't remember that but anyways there's

969
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,600
a ton of stuff going on so come out and say hi to us Valerie thanks a bunch for

970
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,960
coming on and I can't wait for our next meetup maybe in December or something

971
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:41,360
like that yeah is there anything you want to mention before we wrap up we

972
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,920
have a like a couple of minutes you know what you know why is because we we we

973
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,920
talked about it quite a bit on Sunday show so we just kind of got our we just

974
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,120
kind of got our come into one but if there's anything you wanted to mention

975
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:59,560
or specifically with the 14.10 release have that we have the we have the

976
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:07,000
release it's going to be pretty stable now it's coming after a long-term work

977
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,520
but so we usually are wild and crazy this time we are doing an alternate ISO

978
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,480
for the plasma 5 stuff oh awesome people should not except expect that to be

979
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:25,360
completely stable but we sure would love to have some testing and we don't know

980
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:30,960
if it will be ready six months from now for a release and without testing it

981
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,640
won't be so it's actually that plasma 5 ISO is what I used for Sunday's review

982
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,340
when I did that so that's so it's reasonably stable some people have had

983
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:45,280
some problems getting things to work getting it set up but once they get it

984
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:53,280
set up it's pretty cool awesome oh my god I need it and bug reports so and if

985
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,920
people wanted to connect with you online what's the best place for them to find

986
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:07,480
you in IRC or Valerie at kde.org b a l o r i e dot k error at kde.org awesome

987
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,800
all right well I look forward to our next meetup and I'll remember to

988
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:15,360
schedule time for beers next time I will not make that mistake again Valerie I

989
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,080
will not make that mistake again all right well that'll wrap us up for

990
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,080
today's episode of Linux unplugged will be we our regular Linux unplugged time

991
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,080
next week I don't think the Ohio Linux fest will affect our our regular

992
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:32,320
scheduled Linux unplugged so should be on Tuesday which is at 2 p.m. Pacific you

993
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,360
go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get that converted to your

994
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:41,000
local time well Matt so it's gonna be a little extra longer as you're gonna have

995
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,560
to go an extra day before you get to see the hair again are you gonna be all

996
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:48,600

997
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,840
TV show you got Saturday and Sunday to just really pound through something and

just show up Monday ready to do a show all right everyone well thanks so much

999
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,960
for tuning this week's episode of Linux unplugged don't forget we really want

1000
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:03,360
your feedback go to Jupiter broadcasting comm click the contact link choose

1001
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,480
unplug from the drop-down Linux action show dot reddit comms another great

1002
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,640
place to go all right everyone thank you so much for

1003
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:38,480
tuning this week's episode see you right back here next Tuesday

1004
01:18:38,640 --> 01:19:01,360
oh yeah oh oh yeah there we go all right so value will record the post show

1005
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,200
too if there's any other couple into a bits you want to get in there while

1006
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,120
everybody go to JB titles calm right now and vote JB titles calm everybody vote

1007
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:37,960
all right so yeah there you go there you go once again we got in another system

1008
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:44,280
D conversation where wimpy and I painfully agreed with each other we need

1009
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:52,000
to encourage some people to have a rational argument for not system day

1010
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,320
because I think both you and I have different similar but different reasons

1011
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:01,760
as to why it suits what we're doing and we really need somebody yeah well it's

1012
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:07,000
quite a little bit isn't it oh I know there are alternatives and I'm familiar

1013
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,520
with some of them and I've obviously used a lot of them but I need somebody to

1014
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:20,840
remind me why is there better because I've forgotten do we really think oh one

1015
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,760
second I want to spawn I'm good no no no the fork fedora thing was a joke it's

1016
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,440
not it's just a joke but no we're not yeah I still want all right sorry I

1017
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:32,320
didn't mean to interrupt go ahead I think I was just gonna say one of the

1018
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,040
districts I tried recently was um Phoenix it's a live CD distributor that

1019
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:45,480
uses run it that's right and it's very functional Microsoft Hearts Linux fork

1020
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:57,240
you Debbie in fork it all I like that too yeah so I've used running in the

1021
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:02,040
past for some for some for demonizing some processes because it has some

1022
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:06,800
features that traditional in it's didn't have so yeah that's very good

1023
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,800
Valerie you should twist Eric's arm to leave the mumble info behind so you

1024
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,560
could join us in the future whenever you feel like it yeah I actually did paste

1025
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,160
that into the Katie could go into off topic chat room did I not oh good good

1026
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,200
yeah so whenever there's anything kaboom to related that you want to get the word

1027
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:28,000
out about or or Katie or anything you can you could always just pop in the

1028
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:35,480
mumble room and we'll give you the floor for a couple of minutes okay so let's go

1029
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:41,800
to JB titles and so are we liking for forks sake we like that not Katie or not

1030
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:52,280
to fork Debbie in I like the wimpy is like think about that fork yeah quite

1031
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:56,720
the task so tonight and you and I are gonna mail out hopefully a whole bunch

1032
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:01,360
of boxes of swag and stuff we're gonna bring to Ohio Linux fest so that should

1033
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,560
be cool Colonel Linux are you in here I am oh you haven't said anything for so

1034
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:10,680
long I thought maybe you left I missed you no I'm still here that's the base so

1035
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:17,280
yeah so I didn't want to come off too strong in the recording but I'm like 100

1036
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:22,120
percent sure that no modes that will fix that guy's laptop okay cool yeah and I

1037
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:27,160
see I thought I see the reason why I for some reason I thought no meds no mode set

1038
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:32,640
just sort of put X in the light crappy mode mmm it's funny I actually couldn't

1039
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:45,000
tell you what it does it stops kernel mode switching happening it doesn't do

1040
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,280
the resolution detection and auto resolution adjustment it just goes with

1041
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:56,000
the basic BIOS so but why is it not being resolved when X starts if it's

1042
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,880
that if it's the console resolution then how come when X is starting it's not

1043
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:08,000
fixing the problem because wouldn't that whoa so that was the only thing I

1044
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,280
wasn't sure about is it it seemed like to me that if no mode set would fix it

1045
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,560
then it then it shouldn't be happening next that the only thing I thought the

1046
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,440
only thing but I don't know I don't use no I don't really ever have to I

1047
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,560
seriously have bought system 76 laptops for so long now that I haven't had to

1048
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,840
fight with someone I tell you what here's here's how sure I am here's how

1049
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,920
sure I am you put a filter on that guy's name if you send you another email

1050
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:34,320
saying no mode set fixes it you pick out a beer you want I'll send you a 12-pack

1051
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,320
no I'm looking right now there's other people talking about and talking about

1052
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,120
no mode set on askabuntu.com too well here's here's the other thing like for

1053
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:50,600
this is for my machine it will not run a kernel older than 3.12 efficiently 3.11

1054
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:55,600
I have to use no mode set otherwise it doesn't render graphics at all several

1055
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,640
people like Recon Chomper saying could be a brightness issue too so let's see

1056
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,560
all right so for fork's sake is currently at the top here so we can just

1057
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,560
go with that I suppose all right Noah Noah can I ask you a question about

1058
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:14,400
your Ubuntu unity review yeah you you mentioned about crypt setup can you just

1059
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:20,920
talk me through what you saw exactly because I've got some background in this

1060
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:28,040
and I just want to hear what you saw precisely what I saw well okay so excuse

1061
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:32,160
me if this is a little too dumbed down I apologize but so I opened my laptop I

1062
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:38,040
clicked on my encrypted drive and it said unable to decrypt kernel Linux or

1063
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:44,240
well slash media slash kernel Linux no crypt setup found and then I had to get

1064
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:48,280
on to Wi-Fi pseudo apt-get install crypt setup and then I was able to then

1065
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:54,720
decrypt my hard drive so so this wasn't at boot time when Plymouth should give

1066
01:24:54,720 --> 01:25:00,360
you the password from put your passphrase in correct however the fact

1067
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,960
that that option exists that I can encrypt my hard drive at boot time means

1068
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:08,560
that the package which was I found out was all of like 4 megabytes is clearly

1069
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:13,760
included in the install media so why not just install that what what possible

1070
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,200
reason would I not want the ability to decrypt my decrypt encrypted drives like

1071
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:27,000
what advantage does that serve it sounds to me like that's something he ain't a

1072
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:36,360
few people to fix like ha ha if Popey was here as if so I've been chasing

1073
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:40,560
people around at canonical for two months about this issue now and I've

1074
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,720
been pestering Popey until he's probably bored of hearing from me because

1075
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,960
anything I mentioned now is by the way you can't decrypt full disk encryption

1076
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,040
with the new version of Plymouth and it's one of the things that I attempted

1077
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:58,560
to fix in the current release candidate of Ubuntu Marte I have effectively fixed

1078
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,480
it it's actually a Plymouth bug and I think canonical have just released a

1079
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:08,400
fix for it this evening so Crip setup does get installed the issue is is that

1080
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,160
Plymouth doesn't pass the passphrase through properly or wasn't passing it

1081
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:15,600
through properly well in this the absolutely ridiculous thing is I

1082
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,160
understand like so open SSH server doesn't doesn't come with default but

1083
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:22,520
that I get right because there's a security implication I cannot think of a

1084
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:27,360
one single reason of how having that package there other than the fact that

1085
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:32,120
it occupies four megabytes of disk space which even even in today's world of

1086
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:37,080
solid-state drives that are ridiculously small still is is negligible so it just

1087
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,080
infuriated me I had four hours I couldn't get to any of my files and I'm

1088
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:47,640
like 12 before 1210 1304 and 1310 all had Crip setup installed by default I

1089
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:51,920
guess I didn't check it 1404 does but really like what the hell guys yeah Crip

1090
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,280
setup is installed by default that's not the issue it's the fact that Plymouth

1091
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:01,760
doesn't invoke it correctly to decrypt your drive when you chosen to do full

1092
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:07,080
disk encryption and like I say there's been three of us in the Ubuntu Marte

1093
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:13,000
team aware of this for months and we've been adding logs and messages to I don't

1094
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,480
know about eight or nine bugs in launchpad about this for months now and

1095
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:23,040
it's just got fixed today well at the same time Plymouth has quite a bit of

1096
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:29,120
breakage I mean even in arch like 0 9 0 the version that's on the AOR it's

1097
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:33,160
broken in broken in fedora it's broken upstream it's frankly not fit for

1098
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:42,600
purpose so I've back ported 0.8.8 and giving it a version of 0.9.0 plus really

1099
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:57,000
0.8.8 yeah I switched to mate the Ubuntu mate edition I'm at a mate mate

1100
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,880
hi dang it dang it all right maybe we should wrap but I wanted to leave with

1101
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,440
this if anybody in the Ohio area who's listening to this knows of some great

1102
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:11,640
places right around where the Linux fest is gonna be at that we could go to some

1103
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,840
holes in the wall or something like that tweet him at me at Chris Elias you got

1104
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,720
it you're my intelligence network I need I need people on the ground is what I'm

1105
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:23,280
saying I need like people there boots on the ground taking care of the situation

1106
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,500
they're they're they're not combat boots though they're just there as advisors to

1107
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:39,480
advise me about Ohio Columbus any boobs on the ground would be great too if it's

1108
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,920
not if it's not right around the hotel that also should be okay because we have

1109
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:50,880
vehicular transportation yeah all right so I so Chris yes before you dashed you

1110
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,160
want do you want one little bit of inside information always but I'm

1111
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,960
recording wait do I have to stop recording okay no no you can record you

1112
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,120
don't put it out necessarily and it's me I'm not gonna give away any names because

1113
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:07,080
I don't know them all yet all right but you remember the whole gun was buck

1114
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:12,320
deployment on open Sousa and Marte and that good stuff yeah small town of 50,000

1115
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,720
people and you asked me what I knew about that and I said I don't know very

1116
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,480
much what I know about the next one the next one is going to be in Germany the

1117
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,980
next one is going to be a remote terminal services deployment based on

1118
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:28,400
extra go and I happen to know that the desktop operating system they're going

1119
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:34,200
to be using is up into Martin you know I should I should do an extra go segment

1120
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:37,880
I still have Marte installed I mean not that I wouldn't uninstall it but I'm

1121
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:41,440
probably gonna go back you can use it on a number of distros but I mean I'm get

1122
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,720
this I've got an expenses paid trip to Germany at the end of the month and I am

1123
01:29:45,720 --> 01:30:05,920
getting to stay in get this the Linux hotel
