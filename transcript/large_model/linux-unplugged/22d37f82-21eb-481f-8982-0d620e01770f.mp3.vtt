WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:04.300
So, how's mr. Hartley doing not bad not bad yourself

00:04.340 --> 00:08.100
Yeah, I feel like we I feel like we circle each other all the time, but we never actually I mean

00:08.100 --> 00:10.100
We directly interact on Facebook every once in a while

00:11.060 --> 00:14.180
Yeah, it does seem like that doesn't like that. I'll be popping in for a bit tomorrow

00:14.180 --> 00:18.900
So I heard I see you then I heard for this for for for secret project 109

00:20.620 --> 00:22.620
Alpha dog

00:23.100 --> 00:25.420
That'd be kind of cool if everyone had call signs

00:25.940 --> 00:28.020
Right that would just make life a lot simpler. I think

00:28.020 --> 00:32.740
I don't know then you could really would yeah, I guess we kind of do though. That's what screen names are for right

00:32.740 --> 00:35.660
I guess so I mean it kind of starts with whole you know

00:36.140 --> 00:40.940
You know you got your CV handles, and they're kind of a ball. I'll see you from there, and we call Colonel Linux

00:41.540 --> 00:46.140
Yeah, there you go. What am I getting am I getting made fun of I feel like I'm getting made fun of

00:47.860 --> 00:51.180
I'm basically I am just a little bit

00:51.940 --> 00:56.420
Like military this is a this is a poor week for you guys to make fun of me because right now

00:56.420 --> 00:59.900
I'm sitting in front of mumble, and I have a feeling this account is rather empowered

00:59.900 --> 01:02.220
I feel like you walk around in a constant state of

01:02.540 --> 01:08.980
Evaluating other operating systems as they compare to a bun to and all of their phone mobile operating systems as they compare to a bun

01:08.980 --> 01:10.580
to touch

01:10.580 --> 01:12.580
Not all the time in your spare time

01:13.300 --> 01:15.300
Well when I'm awake yeah

01:15.300 --> 01:22.820
No one's on the nook no one's on the nook no on the nook actually and a yoga as well. Yeah, okay?

01:22.820 --> 01:28.340
So hold on a second. I'm on a think center. I'm in a Lenovo think center. I'm on a nook. I'm on a yoga

01:28.340 --> 01:32.420
It's just wow man. Yeah, it's crazy. Well. I got so many computers up in here

01:33.100 --> 01:36.380
You you're in studio at the moment. I am

01:37.060 --> 01:41.300
Both of you, so you've not headed off to the big jamboree yet not yet

01:41.300 --> 01:47.940
No, that is on Friday. Yeah, oh, oh wow now you you're putting in some hours there then no it came in early

01:47.940 --> 01:53.460
Last or late last week, so that way he could be here for the for the big switch Angela to Linux effort

01:54.020 --> 01:56.020
which was

01:56.020 --> 01:58.980
Is ongoing Chris you know it's ongoing

01:59.740 --> 02:04.020
You know I will say for the she's reinstalled the rest in order. Yeah, I'll say no no no

02:04.020 --> 02:06.620
Don't don't give it away. Don't go away. I didn't

02:06.620 --> 02:12.220
Is this a show topic? Yeah, this is gonna be a show topic. We got it all right. I'll say we gotta save it for the show

02:12.220 --> 02:15.380
But I'll just say so Noah flew in if he got here Friday

02:16.380 --> 02:17.740
and

02:17.740 --> 02:23.140
He so he basically he eventually did get to sleep Sunday after last

02:23.540 --> 02:27.980
Yeah, oh there you go hours for like basically yeah, we're not no neither

02:27.980 --> 02:32.020
Nor I slept much from Friday until Sunday after the Linux action show yeah

02:32.020 --> 02:36.780
I think towards the end of last you could start to tell both of us. We're getting a little cranky. Yeah, hey a little

02:36.780 --> 02:38.780
Night owls you well

02:40.580 --> 02:43.380
If we didn't stay up all night there wasn't gonna be a show in the morning

02:43.380 --> 02:48.580
So we stood about we just and it wasn't just us either. No yeah, Rekai like he every guy

02:48.580 --> 02:51.660
Yeah, every guy pulling double time like no, and I went off

02:51.660 --> 02:55.860
I got like a solid two three hours of sleep Noah got a solid two three hours of sleep mm-hmm

02:56.140 --> 02:58.140
Rekai got zero yeah

02:58.140 --> 03:03.460
We didn't get sleep you just slept during last week I slept during last while we were doing last

03:03.460 --> 03:05.940
And then he woke up after last to continue working

03:05.940 --> 03:11.420
We're gonna give him a burger eyes because you know Rekai if you're not aware can be bought in five guys burgers

03:11.420 --> 03:15.860
Yeah, people have no people like I become a podcaster. How easy must that be? Yeah?

03:17.780 --> 03:23.340
For a day yeah, I'm up for a day. I'm seriously this job's making me old and that's and then here

03:23.340 --> 03:24.860
We're wearing ourselves out right now

03:24.860 --> 03:31.540
Yeah, yeah, she can't here's the thing though Chris. You have to understand something use you feel the stress right from the outside

03:31.540 --> 03:33.540
This is amazing

03:34.020 --> 03:36.580
Nobody wants to see us roll in there and everything work on the first

03:37.980 --> 03:39.980
Yeah

03:39.980 --> 03:58.300
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that has an anchor around its net. Oh wait a minute. No, that's a Macbook

03:58.300 --> 04:02.580
My name is Chris and my name is Matt. Hey there Matt guess what in studio?

04:02.580 --> 04:04.780
We've got a special guest and that is Noah

04:04.780 --> 04:09.700
Thanks for having me. Hey Noah. I didn't have your mic muted. I had your mic muted cuz it's like who's never he's never in studio

04:09.700 --> 04:11.700
Yeah, why would he talk?

04:11.700 --> 04:17.900
Hey, buddy. Well, I'm glad you're in studio. Yeah, Noah's hanging out because Linux fest Northwest is coming up in just a few days

04:17.900 --> 04:20.380
And we have been slaving away for hours

04:21.100 --> 04:25.180
Before the show and after the show converting my wife Angela to Linux. We have learned a lot

04:25.980 --> 04:27.980
and in the process

04:28.300 --> 04:30.300
We've also bought some new hardware

04:30.300 --> 04:37.300
We will be giving you a review of the ThinkPad yoga 2 in this week's episode of Linux Unplugged

04:37.300 --> 04:42.700
Oh yoga 3. Sorry yoga 3. We went all out. Oh shoot shoot and we'll also tell you about that

04:42.700 --> 04:49.540
But um after that there's a very interesting thing going on with John Deere tractors. Yeah, I said John Deere tractors

04:49.540 --> 04:54.060
But it really show. Yeah, it actually very much relates to Linux free software and free hardware

04:54.060 --> 04:56.060
And it's pretty cool. It's pretty cool

04:56.060 --> 05:01.860
Yeah, it actually very much relates to Linux free software and free hardware and it's picked up a lot of traction in our subreddit this

05:01.860 --> 05:04.260
Week, so we're gonna talk about that as well as some

05:04.740 --> 05:11.260
Great great follow-up since Linux action show and today like I cannot believe how much good news has come out

05:11.260 --> 05:13.220
It's a huge show this week

05:13.220 --> 05:20.780
So before we go any further we cannot we cannot take another moment without bringing in our mumble room time appropriate greetings mumble room

05:20.780 --> 05:22.780
Oh

05:24.180 --> 05:27.620
Handsome handsome group hello there everybody man a house

05:27.660 --> 05:32.780
It is it's lovely having you here, and I'll have to tell you what I'm glad you are because we have got a great show

05:32.780 --> 05:33.980
And we're gonna break it down

05:33.980 --> 05:37.420
Let's start though with a little follow-up a little just stories

05:37.420 --> 05:41.820
We have talked about before on your unplugged program that need a little a little attention

05:41.820 --> 05:42.660
Oh, hey there

05:42.660 --> 05:46.480
How you doing and that is your friends are good buddies everybody loves system D

05:46.480 --> 05:53.820
What no not everybody and a group is doing something about it one of the most tantalizing components of system

05:53.820 --> 05:54.980
D is login D

05:54.980 --> 05:59.140
and it's something that you got to have if you're gonna use like say gnome 3 on Wayland and

05:59.540 --> 06:03.620
It's caused some consternation in the BSD's out there and all them folks well

06:03.620 --> 06:07.260
I would like to introduce to you e login D

06:07.980 --> 06:11.500
What essentially this is is login D ripped out from system D?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.140
And it's gonna become its own project to be a standalone version of login D

06:15.140 --> 06:20.300
So those distributions that don't want to use system D can put this in have it be API compatible

06:20.300 --> 06:22.060
It'll lay out on the file system

06:22.060 --> 06:26.500
It'll integrate in with PAM so that way it'll use PAM and policy kit or a login kit or whatever

06:26.500 --> 06:27.700
It is a Paul kit Paul kit

06:27.700 --> 06:31.260
It'll use Paul kit so that way it works with the underlying authentication infrastructure

06:31.260 --> 06:35.040
So you can get all the advantages of having login D without system D

06:35.260 --> 06:40.860
So is this have we reached a point now where we can stop saying things like red hat has taken over

06:40.860 --> 06:45.580
System D, and that's a that's a totally red hat thing and nobody will else be able to play at the party because

06:46.620 --> 06:50.620
Red Hat controls the party. I mean is this not a first step of

06:51.580 --> 06:54.420
Allowing other people to do things different different ways well

06:54.780 --> 07:02.020
Breaking compartmentalize things out Matt do you in your opinion is this is this sort of proving all of the system D?

07:02.340 --> 07:08.180
Proponents point they was saying look if system D gets big there's an API you can clone the functionality well

07:08.180 --> 07:13.420
Guess what system D got big and they clone the functionality isn't that exactly what we're seeing play out here isn't

07:13.740 --> 07:16.980
Isn't all the naysay and all the doom and gloom maybe turning out to be

07:17.780 --> 07:22.420
Not quite accurate because look look what we're doing right here. Mm-hmm is this proof of in the pudding Matt

07:22.420 --> 07:25.220
I think that the whole thing was just blown out of proportion

07:25.220 --> 07:31.720
It's obviously people with entirely too much time on their hands that sit in their parents basements whining and complaining about whatever the point of it

07:31.720 --> 07:33.440
Is is that the whole thing stupid?

07:33.440 --> 07:38.000
It's this takes care of itself, and it's beginning to I mean that you know solutions are already making themselves evident

07:38.000 --> 07:41.980
So yes an answer to the whole thing being blown out of proportion absolutely hmm

07:42.220 --> 07:46.180
And I wonder if anybody anybody in the mumble room that wants to take the counter-argument you're more than welcome to

07:46.580 --> 07:52.060
All right, I would like to do that. Yeah, so when it comes to to the complaining well

07:52.060 --> 07:54.060
That's pretty much what we do

07:57.980 --> 08:03.240
The complaint is what improves the quality that's my argument on that one and in service we do

08:03.240 --> 08:06.220
I

08:06.220 --> 08:07.720
Guess it does

08:07.720 --> 08:13.540
prove the case because it shows that apparently there is enough people interested enough to

08:13.920 --> 08:19.060
To the point that they will do the effort of you know cloning and just having an API compatible

08:19.400 --> 08:21.160
It's good that it has the API

08:21.160 --> 08:26.920
But it's still work being done because it's getting to be right and that API is unstable it changes

08:27.420 --> 08:32.380
So exactly so it means that now there is quote-unquote duplication of efforts, right?

08:32.380 --> 08:34.380
Something that we're always bitching about

08:35.380 --> 08:38.820
Yeah, that's what I feel. That's what I feel well, but it does prove that

08:40.620 --> 08:46.400
Okay, so and I thought nothing that and it is early days not not a lot other than this to it, but I

08:46.900 --> 08:51.780
We the system D drama does continue on its own way all right

08:51.780 --> 08:55.260
I thought this next story was particularly interesting we talked about the whole Debian

08:55.340 --> 09:01.260
elections and all the stuff going around there and the different sort of platforms that the different candidates ran on and I don't know if

09:01.260 --> 09:06.220
Anybody else caught this, but I thought it was particularly interesting that Neil McGovern. I think is his name

09:06.220 --> 09:10.460
he's the one that ended up being elected as the new project lead for Debian and

09:11.140 --> 09:13.140
part of his election platform and

09:13.940 --> 09:19.600
You know maybe it won't be exactly this but part of his election platform was introducing PPAs from Ubuntu

09:20.140 --> 09:25.480
Into Debian to give users of Debian an easier way to install PPAs

09:25.480 --> 09:31.840
Now that there could be a lot of ways to skin that cat it might not be an exact implementation although that seems like that

09:31.840 --> 09:33.840
Would be the best

09:33.880 --> 09:35.640
user adoption

09:35.640 --> 09:37.920
Seems like it on the surface. Yeah, yeah

09:39.080 --> 09:41.080
What do you think wimpy? I?

09:41.080 --> 09:44.880
Think this is a great idea and and probably a bit overdue

09:45.640 --> 09:51.240
Because with Debian sort of two-year cadence more or less. You know when it's ready

09:51.240 --> 09:57.560
And really you've only got the back ports repositories, and then you know if you're on a server platform

09:57.560 --> 10:01.880
It's a little easier because some of the big projects maintain their own repositories for things like

10:02.360 --> 10:04.200
nginx and varnish and

10:04.200 --> 10:06.120
Postgres and things of that nature

10:06.120 --> 10:11.320
but if you're a desktop user you're kind of resorting to either sticking with what you were given or

10:11.840 --> 10:15.560
Compiling stuff from source or making your own packages, so I think having

10:16.280 --> 10:17.440
PPAs

10:17.440 --> 10:23.280
Brings us closer to that stable base and then rolling applications on top which is terrific

10:23.280 --> 10:29.560
And you you don't have any concerns you think the current PPA system is good enough that Debian you think they just take it as is

10:30.080 --> 10:33.880
I've no idea if they're just going to take what Ubuntu have already created

10:33.880 --> 10:38.360
Doesn't it seem like that would be the most advantageous, but maybe they couldn't because there'd be too many differences between

10:39.000 --> 10:40.520
Debian and poppy

10:40.520 --> 10:44.600
Isn't all the launchpad stuff open now, so they could they could potentially take all that

10:44.600 --> 10:49.120
They could but it comes along with I think a significant amount of baggage

10:49.120 --> 10:52.640
And it's all very well integrated into launchpad. I think they want to do something

10:53.480 --> 10:57.340
akin to PPAs, but not yeah like you

10:57.880 --> 11:02.080
You know going and getting launchpad and putting it on a server somewhere and saying there you go

11:02.080 --> 11:03.320
There's PPAs for Debian

11:03.320 --> 11:08.980
I think they just want I mean there be an archive admins know how to maintain an archive and a

11:09.200 --> 11:11.880
PPA is effectively a very small archive

11:11.880 --> 11:15.560
That's all it is right and it has behind it has builders

11:16.160 --> 11:22.800
And so they they would probably need to put restrictions on the PPA building infrastructure in the same way that we do so that

11:23.320 --> 11:28.160
PPAs only build like x86 and i386 or i686

11:28.720 --> 11:33.360
And optionally arm HF and optionally power PC and so on and so on

11:33.360 --> 11:37.760
Otherwise their builders are just gonna be flooded with people in the same way that ours are sometimes

11:37.760 --> 11:43.560
People uploading their own random like Firefox or cute or open-office whatever packages

11:44.040 --> 11:46.040
Which take a very long time to build

11:47.120 --> 11:52.720
You know they need to put restrictions in place and I think they're quite capable of doing that without using launchpad

11:52.720 --> 11:57.800
So I dare Devon are we putting the carpet for the horse? You say that's not the first step. What is the first step?

11:58.060 --> 11:58.560
Okay

11:58.560 --> 12:04.680
So apparently what they've just set out to be doing more often and more quickly is to okay

12:04.680 --> 12:10.280
So like the core few set of packages to be core handle those and things that are out of that spectrum

12:10.480 --> 12:13.860
Let's not keep them around and trying to fix them as they have been doing

12:13.860 --> 12:16.160
Let's drop them and let them come in again

12:16.160 --> 12:24.200
And I think that is because they're getting they're realizing the limited resources and they have more and more traction and I'd say vol

12:24.680 --> 12:29.720
And others as well coming more and more to Debian are opening

12:29.720 --> 12:37.280
That Avenue, right? So PPS will be a next step type scenario where okay if there's too many things being dropped

12:37.280 --> 12:41.000
So constantly then we need to figure out a way of you know

12:41.280 --> 12:44.440
Allowing those to exist and that's where PPS fill in

12:44.720 --> 12:50.520
But I think they're first streamlining the process that they already have try to have that to be a quicker process

12:50.760 --> 12:54.880
For people to enter into the Debian project. Yeah, then something with you

12:54.880 --> 13:00.240
Yeah, you got to build that community to create the software and package all that stuff. You got to cultivate all that

13:00.920 --> 13:03.240
Okay. Can I say something here? Yeah, I

13:03.920 --> 13:11.860
I personally like the idea because I think it would make a Debian a lot easier to use for us regular

13:12.520 --> 13:16.800
Users who are not so really that much first in the Linux world

13:18.960 --> 13:23.080
Yeah, I think it would I feel it feels like it would make whatever it is a PPA ripoff or not

13:23.080 --> 13:26.760
I think it would encourage people to switch over to Debian from Ubuntu

13:26.760 --> 13:31.280
I think if that kind of availability was I think it'd be one of the one of the things that keeps people on Ubuntu

13:31.280 --> 13:37.320
Is that that math software available available? They might as well call PPAs Ubuntu crack really?

13:42.960 --> 13:49.240
Like it seems to me like right now Devin is aiming for a completely different kind of user that I agree to it

13:49.240 --> 13:57.280
I agree. Well, I I do I can see that however, Debian stable is appealing to a certain class of machine

13:57.280 --> 13:58.380
I mean, there's a you know

13:58.380 --> 14:02.560
there's a workstation class or a server class where Debian stable has a real place to it and

14:03.120 --> 14:04.880
There's also political reasons as well

14:04.880 --> 14:11.400
I suppose if you insult Debian stable and then put a whole lot of packages from PPAs

14:12.040 --> 14:14.360
By some random people. It's not really

14:14.360 --> 14:20.920
Debian stable and the reality is I think they they target drastically different. Is this going to change?

14:20.920 --> 14:25.040
Well what we think of Debian is this going to change Debian a little bit? I don't know

14:25.040 --> 14:31.400
Do you think you're still you know right now? No, I can tell you right now. No, yes, there's already a way to install

14:32.380 --> 14:35.440
packages or build sure packages for Debian

14:35.440 --> 14:40.240
Well, there's third-party files from well, you can use the build

14:40.240 --> 14:45.880
Files from launchpad from PPAs to build the packages on Debian, right?

14:45.880 --> 14:50.000
Yeah, so there's kind of a this workaround way to use PPAs on Debian. I like

14:50.800 --> 14:58.280
I like the process q5sys producer q5sys says Debian's user repository would be called the der not a great

14:59.280 --> 15:02.920
The reality is that I would put my mother on Ubuntu

15:02.920 --> 15:08.200
But even if I had access to all the software and PPA I still wouldn't be I still don't think I'd feel comfortable sticking around

15:08.200 --> 15:12.440
A Debian box. I mean unless I'm going to be there constantly to do stuff for yeah

15:12.960 --> 15:14.440
Yeah, man

15:14.440 --> 15:19.740
I've been using Ubuntu for going on three years and I just recently tried a deep

15:20.000 --> 15:26.660
Debian based distro AV Linux and let me tell you it was a quite a bit difficult for me to use

15:26.720 --> 15:31.560
So yeah, I like Ubuntu and Ubuntu based derivatives a lot better

15:32.160 --> 15:34.160
but I suppose I

15:34.160 --> 15:39.960
Yeah, I'm reaching to really come for a good answer to that question. So I'll grant you that Derek Devlin

15:39.960 --> 15:43.400
All right, your closing thought on the zero install

15:43.960 --> 15:51.680
So zero install is this type of package manager really that this allows you to quickly install something that is listed on a website

15:51.680 --> 15:56.560
And it pretty much is able to pick up from tarballs or search your package manager

15:56.600 --> 16:01.660
See what's already installed use that but installs like a different environment for that package

16:01.660 --> 16:04.860
It follows you pretty much to have these foreign packages

16:04.860 --> 16:11.340
I think that might be a way of having okay. This is an exception to my stable system and

16:11.900 --> 16:15.020
It is kind of better than PPA necessarily

16:15.180 --> 16:22.060
That's my impression and it's already working with Debbie and they are actually making efforts and it works on Windows even though

16:22.060 --> 16:28.220
I don't know. How is that going but it is interesting project. Hmm interesting a zero install

16:28.220 --> 16:32.860
I I find all of this stuff so much potential and yet still so far away

16:33.060 --> 16:37.300
But I'll tell you what's here today what you can capture today in your very hands listeners

16:37.300 --> 16:43.620
And that is our first sponsor digital ocean go over to digital ocean comm right now and check them out and use our promo code

16:43.620 --> 16:49.980
Of absolute knowledge and power do unplugged lowercase one word Noah's got like a jillion droplets

16:49.980 --> 16:52.300
I'm sure he used the promo code do you unplugged on his account?

16:52.420 --> 16:57.560
Absolutely that way you got a ten dollar credits. You could try out digital ocean two months for absolute what wait what you don't know

16:57.560 --> 17:01.200
It what you don't know what digital ocean is well digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider

17:01.220 --> 17:06.100
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server that you're gonna have root

17:06.100 --> 17:08.900
Dizzle access to up in the cloud sizzle and that's right

17:08.900 --> 17:13.060
They're gonna use the HTML 5 nizzles so you don't even have to have Java when you want that console

17:13.060 --> 17:18.620
You can watch it from a post all the way up to your login screen and you get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing

17:18.620 --> 17:23.220
Plan started only five dollars for one outrageous month five dollars for a month

17:23.220 --> 17:30.100
I mean, I'm just trying to think you and I went out today to the walk. Yeah, and we spent $30 on lunch

17:30.100 --> 17:35.900
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, you can barely get ice cream anymore. You go to Cold Stone. You'll spend $7 on ice cream

17:35.900 --> 17:40.180
That's insane that lasts like 15 seconds nuts and so so for five dollars a month

17:40.180 --> 17:45.420
You can get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a frickin terabyte of transfer

17:45.420 --> 17:50.220
Yeah, a frickin terabyte of transfer. Yeah a frickin terabyte of transfer for five dollars a month

17:50.220 --> 17:54.540
It's just it's nuts and they got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

17:55.220 --> 17:58.820
London and a brand brand new one in Germany. I'm gonna tell you about that because it's hot

17:58.820 --> 18:04.860
It's hot and their interface speaking of hot their interface is amazing. You think gnome 3 looks good. I

18:05.580 --> 18:11.100
Think so. Yeah, no three ain't got nothing on digital oceans interface digital oceans interface is out

18:11.100 --> 18:15.140
I would if I could legally get married to digital oceans interface in the state of Washington

18:15.140 --> 18:20.940
Yeah, I think I would consider that I mean give it five years. I first of all, I would like to have multiple marriages

18:20.940 --> 18:25.540
I don't feel like I should leave my existing wife over that but I also feel like I have room for another wife

18:25.540 --> 18:27.660
Yeah, if that wife is digital oceans dashboard

18:27.660 --> 18:27.780
Yeah

18:27.780 --> 18:34.940
Especially looking that good and at that pricing structure and and digital ocean really just like come on the perfect spouse the perfect spouse has an API

18:34.940 --> 18:40.260
Let's admit it. We all wish our significant others had an API digital ocean. You're my significant other you've got an API

18:40.260 --> 18:40.900
It's very straightforward

18:40.900 --> 18:46.540
They just released the brand new version so you can replicate the functionality of their dashboard on a very very straightforward basis

18:46.540 --> 18:48.080
Plus there's tons of great community apps

18:48.080 --> 18:53.860
We take advantage of the API and the apps around that and if you didn't ever need to use that their dashboards gonna take care

18:53.860 --> 18:57.620
Of all your problems. You got full DNS management. You can take snapshots of your servers

18:57.620 --> 19:00.040
You can build servers from previous snapshots to save ton of time

19:00.040 --> 19:02.400
Of course, they go tons of one-click installation

19:02.400 --> 19:05.980
So you can deploy the latest and greatest software on top of your latest and greatest Linux installation

19:05.980 --> 19:12.820
Riding on top of KVM that sits on top of Linux top of those great SSDs connected to tier one bandwidth with data centers all

19:12.820 --> 19:16.220
Over the world remember how I mentioned they had a brand new data center. That's right

19:16.220 --> 19:21.140
They got a brand new one in Germany. And what I love about this data center is it is hooked up

19:21.140 --> 19:23.820
They got 40 gigabit e networking to each hypervisor

19:23.820 --> 19:30.200
They got their fastest yet SSDs on those hypervisors and the data center sits on top of the German German commercial Internet exchange

19:30.200 --> 19:36.880
The largest Internet exchange point worldwide by peak traffic serves Germans neighboring countries with unparalleled connectivity and speeds

19:37.900 --> 19:43.960
$5 a month do one plug do one plug one word do one plug lowercase $10 credit

19:43.960 --> 19:47.560
Try out your own Linux rig. They got free BSD to I don't know why you'd want that

19:48.540 --> 19:51.380
They got that though. They also have core OS now

19:51.380 --> 19:57.180
I know why you'd want that containerization with a rolling base and they have direct channel upstream to from core was that's super badass

19:57.180 --> 20:01.820
That's a long-term infrastructure. That's totally worth investing some skill set and time and learning and you can get started two months

20:01.820 --> 20:05.420
Absolutely free up on a production droplet where you can point people at that

20:05.420 --> 20:10.240
You can point services at that core OS is something you should check out do it for free do one plug two months

20:10.240 --> 20:14.780
Absolutely free digital ocean calm. No, have you played with core OS yet? I have not really played with

20:15.140 --> 20:18.940
I have I have however played with digital ocean using

20:20.060 --> 20:24.700
X2 go. Oh, yeah, man. Oh, yeah, you got next to go up there, huh? That is nice

20:24.700 --> 20:31.340
All right, so digital ocean calm do you unplug? Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring some plug program. All right

20:31.340 --> 20:33.860
So wimpy is it customary now?

20:33.860 --> 20:35.380
I know this is just in your opinion

20:35.380 --> 20:41.460
but is it customary for canonical to make up crazy random numbers in their press releases or if if

20:42.020 --> 20:47.860
If canonical writes today we count over 25 million users and that number keeps going rapidly

20:47.860 --> 20:52.300
Is that is that trustable? Is that 25 million number legit? Because that seems you know

20:52.300 --> 20:54.740
Cray, I I have no idea

20:56.020 --> 20:59.380
No idea where those numbers come from Popey, Popey

21:03.380 --> 21:05.380
I'd say what do you think Bobby?

21:05.380 --> 21:11.220
It's not it's not infeasible. If you look at just the digital ocean being the most popular one you think about

21:11.220 --> 21:14.300
Okay, if it's most popular at least 30% of that

21:14.860 --> 21:19.580
Okay, you can contact a good numbers of that. All right, and it's on the tone easy to a lot, right?

21:19.580 --> 21:21.580
It's on a lot of cloud installation

21:21.580 --> 21:25.940
Yeah, it's very I mean it doesn't sound too off honestly

21:26.340 --> 21:32.140
Why do you say that that number that number 20 million was quoted from mark years ago, like

21:32.900 --> 21:34.900
five years ago something like that and

21:36.660 --> 21:41.620
Within the first week or so of me starting at canonical someone mentioned numbers

21:41.620 --> 21:44.160
And so I asked on an internal mailing list

21:44.620 --> 21:48.040
Look this 20 million number has been banded about a lot

21:48.040 --> 21:52.580
Is is there an up-to-date number and now bear in mind I started at canonical three and a half years ago

21:52.580 --> 21:55.460
And I asked that question and I had a conversation

21:56.900 --> 21:59.180
Unfortunately internal private conversation with someone

21:59.740 --> 22:02.620
Who explained where that number came from and that it?

22:02.980 --> 22:07.380
Yeah, it it was as accurate as we could make it given that you know

22:07.380 --> 22:10.340
It's possible for someone to install them into and be behind a firewall

22:10.340 --> 22:16.140
And so we have no idea and pass the CD around and we have no idea of that install, right?

22:16.140 --> 22:20.700
So we you know, we can't be a hundred percent accurate but based on you know, various things

22:21.780 --> 22:28.420
You know people upgrading hits on launchpad archive hits NTP update hits or you know all kinds of stuff

22:28.580 --> 22:32.580
We can make an educated guess right and that was some years ago

22:33.500 --> 22:37.780
the not the trajectory the graph was going in a particular direction and

22:38.820 --> 22:44.780
We could extrapolate forward and continue to monitor those numbers. And yeah, they're not inaccurate

22:44.780 --> 22:51.680
But that number 20 million was some years ago and people keep asking us for an updated number and I I personally think

22:52.700 --> 22:58.700
That the company regrets ever giving that number out because people keep on asking for an updated number

22:58.700 --> 23:04.260
I think that might be so you think 25 million is a is a trended estimate is what you're saying

23:04.860 --> 23:10.960
No, I personally 25 million is massively under. Ah, really? I personally think it's way higher than that

23:10.960 --> 23:15.560
So I have no evidence. I can't I can't possibly corroborate that or I have enough

23:15.560 --> 23:20.920
No data to to provide to back that assertion up. So you could say that with a grain of salt because I work for canonical

23:20.920 --> 23:21.320
Yeah

23:21.320 --> 23:23.320
but when you factor in like it's

23:23.480 --> 23:28.420
One of the major use cases for for Ubuntu is the cloud deployments and in number one

23:28.720 --> 23:30.800
Thing about a cloud deployment is probably behind a firewall

23:30.800 --> 23:33.040
I mean like a lot of those like the number one use case for

23:33.200 --> 23:37.960
Ubuntu server is generally behind a firewall is gonna be harder to count if they're all coming from one IP to check in updates

23:37.960 --> 23:41.240
And whatnot, right and if a company spins up 20 30

23:41.720 --> 23:46.920
100 300 we just wouldn't and then and then to make that even harder than you have like when you have when you have companies

23:46.920 --> 23:50.080
That have a lot of Ubuntu machines a lot of times they do internal repos, right?

23:50.080 --> 23:53.000
And that's what I that's kind of where I was thinking of at first

23:53.000 --> 23:54.640
I was like wow that seems high and then I thought about it

23:54.640 --> 23:58.760
I'm like man in Grand Forks alone and we're only a town of 50,000 people we have Amazon

23:58.760 --> 24:02.440
They have 4,000 workstations and I know for a fact every one of them is running a bunch of desktop

24:02.480 --> 24:06.240
Hmm, so you look at that and now you extrapolate that and say well if they're doing that

24:06.240 --> 24:08.080
They're probably doing that at every Amazon call center

24:08.080 --> 24:12.400
How many computers is that in addition to all the computers that we have at home in addition to all the computers that we have?

24:12.400 --> 24:17.360
In the cloud in addition to all the computers that places like Google and you think about how cheap a VM is these days

24:17.440 --> 24:19.160
Yeah, we'll just have thousands of them

24:19.160 --> 24:19.400
Yeah

24:19.400 --> 24:24.240
But I mean like even Google has their their workstations that they do work out some modified version of Ubuntu

24:24.240 --> 24:27.920
But there's a bunch of when I say people have thousands of people like data centers. I don't mean people like us

24:28.760 --> 24:33.200
There's data centers where there's could be a thousand VMs in some in one data center and maybe they're only doing a few things

24:33.200 --> 24:37.280
So then that number starts to see you highly realistic if not low. What are you gonna say poppy? I

24:38.360 --> 24:42.020
Think people get really hung up on the numbers and and really

24:43.320 --> 24:44.800
what I

24:44.800 --> 24:49.580
Part of the problem is, you know, a lot of the time developers want to see numbers to be able to yeah

24:50.160 --> 24:55.800
Know that there there is a target audience. Is it worth my investment of time exactly and and I I

24:56.460 --> 25:01.680
Can see why people want more accurate more accurate details, but really in the large scale of things

25:01.680 --> 25:07.440
I'm not I'm not sure that you know having super accurate numbers about exactly how many deployments there are

25:07.440 --> 25:07.760
I mean

25:07.760 --> 25:13.040
It's good for the Apple to go on to it's great for app for Tim Cook to go on stage and say we've sold

25:13.360 --> 25:21.320
X-million, you know iPhones or iPads or MacBook pros because there's a share price there that that you know the the market

25:22.480 --> 25:28.760
They're interested in keeping the market happy. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was a privately held. Yeah company. Yeah, we don't have any shares

25:28.760 --> 25:34.340
Right, you're publicly traded shares. So that's not important to us to make those announcements. So it's a different kettle of fish

25:34.340 --> 25:37.520
Really? Can I I wanted to ask you something that I think I'm reading the wrong way

25:37.520 --> 25:42.360
and I know you're not an expert in these areas and so I'm not asking for an official canonical opinion, but I

25:43.440 --> 25:50.080
always think of you know friends of the shows like system 76 when I when I'm seeing kind of hardware related announcements from canonical and

25:50.280 --> 25:55.200
I want to talk about certified hardware images. And so it reads as this the Ubuntu image preload

25:55.200 --> 26:00.000
This isn't this is on the same announcement. So the Ubuntu image preload will come with all the drivers

26:00.080 --> 26:02.920
Integrated and maintained throughout the life cycle of the Ubuntu version

26:02.920 --> 26:07.920
This is a certified image from canonical the end clients were to use a standard image from Ubuntu comm

26:07.920 --> 26:12.640
It's likely that not all components will work. So here's what I'm here's what I'm taking away from this

26:12.640 --> 26:14.000
This is how will Ubuntu

26:14.000 --> 26:21.080
Certified images differ from the Ubuntu comm images and Ubuntu certified image offers end-users radically different experiences

26:21.080 --> 26:27.280
Because all components within the hardware will simply work out of the box and continue to offer great performance throughout the life of the Ubuntu

26:27.280 --> 26:31.360
Version canonical will ensure that any modifications that may be necessary due to security

26:31.680 --> 26:37.560
Updates and patches are fully tested and integrated into the master image before the updates are pushed out to market

26:37.560 --> 26:41.960
So this would be like an OEM image provided to Dell or somebody like that, but

26:42.600 --> 26:46.240
the way I also sort of could secondarily read this is if

26:46.240 --> 26:51.760
If you're buying hardware from vendors like system 76, that's that's sort of like a doc

26:51.760 --> 26:53.960
That's the image they downloaded off of the website

26:53.960 --> 26:58.760
We can't guarantee that but if you want to buy a certified laptop with a canonical certified image

26:59.360 --> 27:01.480
That is going to be maintained by canonical

27:01.480 --> 27:07.360
So essentially canonical is kind of going to kind of do the job system 76 has been doing where system 76 has you know?

27:07.360 --> 27:10.520
Made any drivers or changes or patches needed to make Linux work

27:10.520 --> 27:15.120
Well now canonical is kind of taking that role on but offering it to almost any hardware OEM

27:15.120 --> 27:17.120
Am I following this?

27:17.520 --> 27:19.280
we've had

27:19.280 --> 27:24.920
An engineering services group for years that have done this right is not new. So this we've is this

27:26.120 --> 27:28.120
Why is this in this and not really?

27:28.240 --> 27:31.960
Well, I think it's more that people just didn't know we did it. Okay, that's what I was trying to understand

27:31.960 --> 27:34.180
It's what's been changed. I think part of this came from a

27:35.000 --> 27:38.520
Conversation that was had internally about the new Dell Sputnik, right?

27:38.520 --> 27:41.280
so there was a there was a conversation on Intel my list where

27:41.280 --> 27:47.560
An engineer says yeah, what laptop should I buy and and someone says well you should buy the Dell one because you know

27:47.560 --> 27:53.840
It works really well and there were I know you and others have reported problems with the Windows version of the Dell laptop

27:53.840 --> 27:55.840
That's all pretty much done Windows version

27:56.040 --> 28:02.820
Right, but the the Linux version is now available. Yeah, and the we helped Dell make that work, right?

28:02.820 --> 28:06.160
So it wasn't Dell that did that. It was a collaboration right canonical and right

28:06.160 --> 28:08.440
So someone's gonna do that and someone's gonna pay for that work

28:08.440 --> 28:12.360
it kind of though, but it kind of sounds like it does kind of sound like it creates a

28:13.280 --> 28:19.120
A difference between the vendors that have certified images and the vendors that don't that maybe right?

28:19.120 --> 28:23.640
Well, someone's got to do that work. Somebody should be so there's got to be commercial relationship going on between

28:24.000 --> 28:32.280
Dell and canonical in order to make an excellent experience for people who yeah, I don't want people to go to Dell com

28:32.280 --> 28:38.880
Type of them to get a laptop and it arrived and so this doesn't work what I'm trying to ask though is like if I were

28:38.880 --> 28:42.220
to buy a certified canonical certified Ubuntu

28:43.360 --> 28:44.760
machine

28:44.760 --> 28:50.680
The updates for that machine would actually be be developed by canonical not the OEM. I bought them from

28:51.720 --> 28:58.520
Am I falling? It's it's our average. Okay, this is the canonical and they'll work together. So it depends on what the arrangement is

28:58.520 --> 29:05.080
Right, but it's it's at the whole point of this is getting a machine out the door that that is satisfactory for

29:05.680 --> 29:11.280
Dell's customers or whoever that OEM is and what we're saying is we'll work with you to make sure it works

29:11.280 --> 29:12.720
You know, it's it's a positive thing

29:12.720 --> 29:16.880
It's not you know, there's an ISO image chuck that on your machine and off you go and good luck

29:16.880 --> 29:22.360
Yeah, we want we want you to have a good experience. We want your customers to have a good experience

29:22.360 --> 29:24.640
We want the touchpad to work. We want the touchscreen to it

29:24.640 --> 29:30.440
We want the the Wi-Fi to work and we'll help you to do that. That's that's part of the value add that we're trying to offer

29:30.440 --> 29:31.600
is

29:31.600 --> 29:35.600
That that's what that that press release is really all about is like, you know

29:35.600 --> 29:41.480
Look at the services that we offer that actually can make the experience for your customers better. I love you poppy

29:41.640 --> 29:47.640
So while we're talking about hardware, I wanted to mention the yoga 3 that we ended up picking up

29:47.640 --> 29:51.560
Which we'll tell you more about here in a little bit why we just picked this up and I'm gonna hold it up

29:51.560 --> 29:53.560
To the camera

29:53.660 --> 29:56.900
So Noah right now is installing on the yoga 3 and

29:57.440 --> 30:01.100
What's been your first impression Noah out-of-the-box compatibility with ThinkPad?

30:01.100 --> 30:03.500
Yeah, I mean so why but why are we doing a USB thing?

30:03.500 --> 30:09.020
Well, so okay that so that's just the wireless needs to get the updated drivers before it will work

30:09.260 --> 30:11.940
Which I need the internet that that wireless card is really finicky

30:12.740 --> 30:19.400
It it it the laptop is incredibly well built as you would expect from Lenovo and in true Lenovo fashion

30:19.400 --> 30:21.400
To get it to boot

30:21.920 --> 30:28.080
Instead of having to do some stupid goofy shutting UEFI off and all that other crap. There's a little button. You push a little button and

30:29.180 --> 30:31.080
Now you're booting USB

30:31.080 --> 30:33.080
And it disables security

30:33.600 --> 30:37.160
Disables the UEFI you can do regular BIOS boot the whole nine yards

30:38.720 --> 30:41.800
Yeah, but yeah, the only thing is the before I

30:42.560 --> 30:47.960
Understand from from the from the Google that once the operating system is installed

30:47.960 --> 30:49.960
All the updates are done. We'll have

30:51.080 --> 30:55.280
Drivers support for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth right now that doesn't seem to be the case

30:55.280 --> 30:57.440
So what we have is we have a wired Ethernet adapter

30:57.440 --> 31:01.360
The problem is the wired Ethernet adapter keeps coming unplugged and then my down my down

31:02.360 --> 31:07.420
No, you know, so thanks, but it's it's really finicky and or the cables finicky. I don't know but so

31:08.080 --> 31:10.080
1080p screen version. Yeah, and

31:10.700 --> 31:15.440
Having seen this compared to your 4k XPS. It's still really good way

31:15.440 --> 31:18.640
Yeah, yeah, and then you don't have to worry about all the weird high DPI stuff. Frankly. I'd prefer this

31:18.640 --> 31:23.000
Yeah, I mean I'm being honest. I well I after I saw this like gosh. I kind of want to give Angie the XPS

31:24.440 --> 31:28.940
But so we're gonna tell you why we're doing the yoga over the MacBook later on in the show

31:29.120 --> 31:31.720
But so right now if somebody was just coming to you and say no

31:31.720 --> 31:35.920
I'm at Best Buy and I want to pick up a machine that can run Linux and I know they sell the yoga 3 at

31:35.920 --> 31:39.120
Best Buy would you say go ahead and pick this? Yeah. Yeah, you know the Wi-Fi is not working. Yeah

31:39.120 --> 31:41.120
Yeah, I would like to

31:41.120 --> 31:46.240
I was gonna say I'd like you to ask me that question again in 20 minutes, but okay, but you work on it during the

31:46.240 --> 31:48.240
Show I will and then it will

31:48.520 --> 31:53.600
We'll see if you get the Wi-Fi going now if that is so that's assuming we don't knock off the the adapter now

31:53.600 --> 32:01.360
Also now if all goes well, you'll see Angela rocking her new yoga 3 at Linux fest Northwest April 25th and 26th

32:01.360 --> 32:03.540
That's this weekend. If you can't be there in person

32:03.540 --> 32:08.680
We'll be streaming it live Saturday on Sunday JB live TV and we'd love to have you tune in to hang out in the chat room

32:08.680 --> 32:12.920
We'll be taking questions when we have guests from the chat room and it should be a pretty good pretty fun experience

32:12.920 --> 32:17.440
It's been fun the last couple of years at least. Are you excited? I am I'm super excited. Yeah, Matt. Are you excited?

32:17.440 --> 32:20.440
Oh, definitely. I've been looking forward to it all year now Matt

32:20.440 --> 32:23.440
I if there were say going to be cake at the booth

32:24.040 --> 32:26.720
Would you I mean would you have like even a bite? I?

32:27.360 --> 32:33.720
Can't I'm literally alright. I actually have cake here. Yeah, I'm not saying there's gonna be cake. Don't assume there's gonna be

32:33.720 --> 32:40.760
No guys, but Matt what we'll do is we'll arrange it so if there was gonna be cake

32:40.760 --> 32:42.280
You're as far away from as possible

32:42.280 --> 32:45.080
So you're not tempted because all as I'm saying that there was gonna be cake

32:45.080 --> 32:47.760
It's gonna be delicious cake if there was gonna be cake

32:49.480 --> 32:54.260
We'll make sure that we'll put you as far away from this delicious cake as possible

32:54.260 --> 32:56.960
And if you know what we'll do is maybe people just show up at the booth

32:56.960 --> 33:01.000
They can eat all the cake for you if there was gonna be cake work, but the cakes probably a lot Linux fest

33:01.000 --> 33:02.040
Northwest is gonna be awesome

33:02.040 --> 33:05.320
We'll be doing a party on Saturday evening you can go to meetup.com slash Jupiter

33:05.440 --> 33:10.800
Broadcasting and we'll have final details in the Linux fest Northwest event as that approaches, and I'm really excited

33:10.800 --> 33:15.200
I'm it's all in now. Who are you picking up tonight? You're where are you going after this?

33:15.200 --> 33:19.040
I don't know I have to I'll have to look up. It's I think Ellen is is tonight

33:19.760 --> 33:23.240
There's people coming in all all hours of the day all different days of the week

33:23.240 --> 33:28.960
So it's gonna be an ongoing process, but that's just another service. We provide you're a trooper Noah. You're a real trooper

33:28.960 --> 33:33.400
I think you're a you're a what do they call it? What is it? What's like the guy that does like the?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.920
I think they call you a

33:35.920 --> 33:37.920
Gopher no

33:42.840 --> 33:44.840
Come on come on come on

33:45.440 --> 33:50.880
Alright, so let me tell you about our buddies over at Linux Academy cuz they just had a freaking great great week since we got

33:50.880 --> 33:56.720
Together last year on the Linux unplugged show our Linux Academy had their big live special on the 16th

33:56.720 --> 34:01.600
And man you guys it's like a serious serious thing and so I've got a little summary for you

34:01.600 --> 34:06.480
But I encourage you to go over to Linux Academy comm right now in fact go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug that we get

34:06.480 --> 34:08.480
our 33% unplugged discount and

34:08.720 --> 34:11.520
You're gonna be impressed by this so if you don't know about Linux Academy

34:11.520 --> 34:12.960
They've been a sponsor for a little while

34:12.960 --> 34:18.160
They are a resource for you to go learn really some of the best technology in Linux and open source

34:18.160 --> 34:23.240
It's built by people that are truly enthusiastic about this stuff, so they really close that 10% gap

34:23.240 --> 34:29.320
It's not a site that does like Photoshop tutorials camera tutorials after effects tutorials broken sync tutorials

34:29.320 --> 34:36.120
And an Apache server tutorial they only focus on the Linux in the open source stuff because that's what they eat and breathe

34:36.120 --> 34:40.920
They got together with their buddies that are educators and developers, and they created the Linux Academy platform

34:40.920 --> 34:42.480
There's seven plus Linux distributions

34:42.480 --> 34:48.300
They get to choose from that automatically adjust the courseware to match that distribution and also make sure that the virtual machines match the courseware

34:48.300 --> 34:53.200
So if you choose an Ubuntu box for the courseware then the virtual machine is a buntu box once you spin up that virtual

34:53.200 --> 34:56.840
Box you get a public IP address to you get to SSH up to that bad boys you get to work from your desk

34:56.840 --> 35:00.480
Maybe load up mosh or something like that so that way it's real responsive. That's how I prefer to work

35:00.920 --> 35:07.200
My lesson in my guake terminal. It's outrageous. They have scenario based labs that way you really get hands-on with the technology

35:07.200 --> 35:13.080
So you really know what you're doing they have everything from Linux essentials up to open stack Docker virtualization

35:13.080 --> 35:16.480
But after the 16th it just they just blew it off the door

35:16.480 --> 35:19.640
It's just like the door came in and smacked me in the face is like oh my gosh

35:19.640 --> 35:20.880
I had to print it out look at this right here

35:20.880 --> 35:27.680
I got yeah two pages and how small is that type yeah? Yeah, that's wow that's ridiculous. Yeah, I know right. That's crazy

35:27.680 --> 35:28.480
That's how much stuff

35:28.480 --> 35:32.040
They did so I'm just gonna read through a couple these things cuz like I'm just gonna be reading off this for a little while

35:32.040 --> 35:38.400
It's it's it's amazing so a couple of things. It's what are you guys gonna? Love the most they have new types of in-depth courses

35:38.400 --> 35:40.080
They're totally nuts

35:40.080 --> 35:44.560
You'll really seriously get in depth with that technology, so you're really gonna understand it

35:44.560 --> 35:48.200
But they are also like hey, you know what sometimes. There's just like small nuggets of stuff. You need to learn

35:48.200 --> 35:51.400
It's not really attached to any specific courseware, so they have nuggets now

35:51.400 --> 35:55.040
So when you have downtime you just want to jump in and learn something new. It's a really cool

35:55.040 --> 35:58.920
It's a single how-to that allows you to walk through specific tasks. They're not really course related

35:58.920 --> 36:04.440
I like about two to sixty minutes long depending on which one it is. It's brand new something. They just introduced also

36:04.440 --> 36:06.280
I love love love this

36:06.280 --> 36:07.760
I'll tell you about all the other things they've done

36:07.760 --> 36:14.320
But I think you guys are gonna think this is pretty enough pretty neat they're announcing the Linux Academy Foundation open source grant program

36:14.320 --> 36:20.360
They're gonna give a $5,000 grant to an open source program, which is pretty amazing pretty awesome

36:20.360 --> 36:25.640
So they are they are truly their community members. They haven't back any open source license project can apply for this grant

36:25.960 --> 36:29.600
They have an external page up shortly, so we'll tell you more about it when I learn more about it

36:29.680 --> 36:31.100
They Linux Academy

36:31.100 --> 36:36.200
This is this is the guy who this is an email I sent me so they believe in supporting open source and ensuring great projects have

36:36.200 --> 36:40.480
A lasting future in the community in order to celebrate and support open source. This is the email

36:40.480 --> 36:41.640
He sent to me. This is not even an ad bitch

36:41.640 --> 36:47.760
This is what I wrote me in order to support open source the Linux Academy Foundation will be opening the applications for open source projects

36:47.760 --> 36:52.660
To receive either part or all of the $5,000 grant we believe in bettering the community

36:52.660 --> 36:55.260
And we are excited to have the help of the founders Club members

36:55.260 --> 36:59.360
I'll tell you more about the founders Club members soon and vote on which projects will receive the grant

36:59.360 --> 37:04.240
So you can become a member of the founders Club at Linux Academy and you can get a say in which projects will receive the grant

37:04.240 --> 37:08.720
I think that's awesome Linux Academy comm slash unplugged to get our 33% discount and

37:08.720 --> 37:14.560
Go up try it out. You get it applied it to all of the courseware there, and there's a ton of good stuff now Chris

37:14.560 --> 37:19.520
That's only the stuff that they told you about right because here's the thing I was at dinner the other night

37:19.520 --> 37:25.120
And we sat down and what did producer q5 sis ask he goes hey, I heard you talking about xyz Ruby

37:25.120 --> 37:29.800
Yeah, Ruby. I I don't see that on their side. They got really they got Ruby courseware Python courseware

37:29.800 --> 37:31.800
I know after Linux fest. I'm gonna have to dig into one of them

37:31.800 --> 37:36.620
I just don't know which one of those things where you have they they offer so many different services and so many different courses

37:36.620 --> 37:39.920
They can't even you won't be able to include all those in a sales pitch

37:39.920 --> 37:42.240
You'd almost have to sign up for an account and try it for a month

37:42.240 --> 37:43.120
Yeah, you know it's funny

37:43.120 --> 37:43.640
That's funny

37:43.640 --> 37:47.720
You say that because a lot of times like I kind of get like in a I get like in a zone of what I've been

37:47.720 --> 37:51.800
Interested in and then I and I get out of my course when I realize oh wow yeah, that's right

37:51.800 --> 37:53.680
They have like a ton of other stuff

37:53.680 --> 37:57.400
I should mention from time to time because it's just it's one of those things where you until you go see it yourself

37:57.400 --> 38:01.860
You don't really have an idea of the depth of courseware, and that's why I really like their model a lot

38:02.560 --> 38:04.520
alright, so

38:04.520 --> 38:07.000
Let's talk about Angela's switch to Linux and

38:08.440 --> 38:14.960
Wow what a monstrous event this has been so we ended up deciding that Angela has a Macbook and

38:15.560 --> 38:20.400
She really likes the Macbook, but she's willing to try Linux, so let's get Linux on her Macbook

38:20.440 --> 38:24.560
But because her pictures and her data are so precious plus. We don't want to interrupt her workflow

38:25.140 --> 38:30.340
We just set it up on a secondary Macbook which is actually a pretty good rig

38:30.340 --> 38:36.720
It was a 2011 model pretty high-end 16 gigabytes of RAM 512 gigabyte Apple SSD

38:37.320 --> 38:41.040
Dedicated ATI graphics with the extra memory added a high-resolution

38:42.240 --> 38:48.540
Non-reflective screen core i7 processor, so this is a high-end Macbook Pro that had died. Yeah, it was dead

38:49.120 --> 38:55.120
Yeah, it was dead and then Apple just recently said hey so those of you who have this GPU issue a couple of years

38:55.120 --> 39:00.840
ago will replace it for free and so we took the Macbook into Apple store and we gave him the Macbook and Apple said

39:01.000 --> 39:04.320
Your battery's dead. We can't test it. Well the guy did some magic

39:04.320 --> 39:07.720
He hooked up to a supercharger, and he got the battery working, and he did a test

39:07.720 --> 39:09.960
He said yeah your GPU failed so we went down there

39:09.960 --> 39:12.120
We picked up the Macbook after they fixed it for free and he's like hey

39:12.120 --> 39:13.600
I threw in a free battery for you, too

39:13.600 --> 39:19.140
So they replaced the battery the logic board the GPU so now we essentially have a brand new Macbook that just has

39:19.360 --> 39:23.640
2011 parts, but it's a new motherboard new GPU new battery, so we're like we'll use this as

39:23.640 --> 39:27.080
Angela's laptop that way we don't even hurt her existing laptop

39:27.080 --> 39:32.320
But we will prove the point that to her that she'll be able to use Linux on her Macbook and that was

39:32.720 --> 39:40.160
The original sort of idea that we set off with about Friday night. Yeah, yeah well really we started out with that

39:40.160 --> 39:41.640
Yeah, we started talking about it

39:41.640 --> 39:42.760
You know early Friday

39:42.760 --> 39:47.000
And then started putting these pieces into these pieces of the puzzle into action late Friday

39:47.000 --> 39:49.320
And what we kept finding was there was tiny little robux

39:49.320 --> 39:51.880
And you know how you write those off because as somebody who troubleshoots

39:51.880 --> 39:54.960
I mean it wouldn't be any fun if it worked the first time yeah, so having a good time

39:54.960 --> 39:59.320
It doesn't work, so we try something else. Yeah, I can try something else and we start we're pinging developers

39:59.320 --> 40:02.520
And we're trying different we are literally talking to the developers of the distributions

40:02.520 --> 40:07.860
We're trying and so and so it fast-forward 24 hours later. We have now reloaded the machine no less than three times

40:07.860 --> 40:13.560
We now have three different and we've tried it like with OS 10 with no OS 10 with refine with no refine

40:13.560 --> 40:15.320
But we wound up with three bootloaders

40:15.320 --> 40:21.200
Refined refit and grub all three of which could get you could you could click on the right option you would get into this endless

40:21.200 --> 40:26.080
Boot cycle where one would boot into the other would boot into the other boot into the other and eventually at some point

40:26.080 --> 40:30.680
We decided this just this just isn't gonna work, so we decide we're going to bed. That's it. We quit

40:30.680 --> 40:36.040
Yeah, we go to bed. I go to take a shower. I get back up and Rekai's like no man. We're gonna get this to work

40:36.040 --> 40:40.920
Yeah, I'm like halfway through planning an alternative episode. Yeah, I'm like we're never gonna make it what time in the morning

40:40.920 --> 40:44.840
Is this what this is about 7 a.m.. 7 a.m.. And the Linux action should goes live at 10. Yeah

40:44.840 --> 40:49.040
Yeah, so so we have like three hours mind you it took us two hours the first time to copy all of our data

40:49.040 --> 40:53.200
Yeah, we got pretty good at that because like we're figuring out exactly you know that's way to get that done

40:53.360 --> 40:59.320
Man, I can change permissions from HFS back to to ext4 like you wouldn't believe yeah, right

40:59.320 --> 41:06.420
Yeah, so so so we're getting this that we're in the stuff that and the frustrating thing apart part about it is the computer

41:06.420 --> 41:08.880
That we're working on is actually really decent hardware

41:08.880 --> 41:10.880
Yeah, I I don't think there's anyone

41:11.000 --> 41:14.080
Involved in JB that hates Apple as much as I do and I have to admit

41:14.080 --> 41:16.660
That's a nice machine every time we look at it. Yeah, we look at it. We're like

41:16.660 --> 41:21.500
Yeah, and when we could get things to work they work they actually work pretty well

41:21.500 --> 41:27.340
But it's when you have a new Linux user and I have dealt with this numerous times. It has to work the first time

41:27.340 --> 41:29.340
Yeah, you don't have right

41:29.340 --> 41:36.760
We have all these little nuances from the production standpoint that like other people like maybe we just write off like we have to have

41:36.860 --> 41:41.460
HDMI mirroring because we have to show the audience Angela's computer exactly so if we don't get aged up

41:41.460 --> 41:43.540
So then that sends us down the path of okay

41:43.540 --> 41:49.020
That means we now have to get the ATI dedicated graphics working and then this sends us down to all these different modes

41:49.020 --> 41:54.220
We have to pass the grub menu or we have to put in grub in grub configs that way or type it in at the grub

41:54.220 --> 41:59.620
Menu at boot so that way the ATI car gets activated over the Intel card all these little you can only boot in UEFI

41:59.620 --> 42:02.900
We can't use the BIOS part and it's like if you know what I was thinking to myself this time

42:02.900 --> 42:06.340
It's like man, you know if this was my rig, I would totally be willing to tinker with this stuff

42:06.340 --> 42:12.660
Mm-hmm, but this is like I don't want to blow this. I really really really don't want to opportunity

42:12.660 --> 42:18.260
It seriously is I've said it before but like there a crack has opened in the Apple ecosystem for us to take advantage for her

42:18.260 --> 42:22.860
And her workflow and in my entire relationship with her. I've been with her for 17 years

42:22.860 --> 42:24.820
I have never had an advantage like this and I'm like

42:24.820 --> 42:29.020
This is our moment two advantages because the other thing was when she sat down and saw

42:29.460 --> 42:33.500
Antrigos for the first time that blew her away. She liked it. And then it was a double punch

42:33.500 --> 42:37.140
She got hit with triple punch. She got hit with an awesome hardware awesome software

42:37.140 --> 42:42.580
And then the chat room did a bang-up job of saying hey, hey, that's cool that she's using hardcore Linux

42:42.580 --> 42:46.740
Yeah, and she got into that. Yeah, she's like, hey, they think I'm there. Yeah, they're really proud of me

42:46.740 --> 42:52.020
I'm using real Linux and yeah now now anything else like a bunch of elementary OS is is kind of out of the

42:52.420 --> 42:55.020
Picture we have to do and Tegra so we have to do it, right?

42:55.060 --> 42:59.460
So we were starting to think you know, the problem is is a there are a few things that are finicky

42:59.460 --> 43:01.780
Like we're still having a problems with dual display

43:01.780 --> 43:05.260
Which is a critical part of her workflow for like spreadsheet stuff that she's working on

43:05.260 --> 43:10.060
We're still having issues with the dedicated graphics. We can get Intel graphics working, but we're right now

43:10.060 --> 43:15.380
I'm not sure we're at with the ATI graphics and so no one I've been going back and forth like we really really really don't

43:15.380 --> 43:19.580
Want to mess this up and we don't want her to have any troubles with this and if she ever does have troubles

43:19.580 --> 43:21.060
We want to be able to bounce back immediately

43:21.060 --> 43:23.620
So that way we don't want her to think boy something ever goes wrong

43:23.620 --> 43:26.500
I'm out for a couple of days then she's gonna be petrified the entire time

43:26.500 --> 43:29.380
I know how she works that'll scare the crap out of scare the crap out of me

43:29.620 --> 43:34.680
So we decided to sort of preemptively grab this yoga 3 laptop

43:34.740 --> 43:38.560
Hoping that it might work out as a little bit more of a stable machine

43:38.560 --> 43:43.380
But still meet those sort of build requirements that she has the expectation she has from her MacBook

43:44.060 --> 43:49.240
And and have the keyboard and all that that she expects from her MacBook and though and the weight and portability in fact this thing

43:49.240 --> 43:56.100
Is thinner than the new Mac just a MacBook that they keep touting and it was funny because Lenovo actually sent out a tweet

43:56.100 --> 44:00.240
That said oh, yeah, and then they gave the actual dimensions are like real cool Apple

44:00.240 --> 44:01.420
That was so last year

44:01.420 --> 44:04.660
This is also one of the number one recommended laptops from our audience now

44:04.660 --> 44:09.340
The thing is is right now. We are not in a position to do this especially with Linux fest coming here

44:09.340 --> 44:10.740
We're totally not in a position to do this

44:10.740 --> 44:14.220
Well, we are out of funds before Linux fest started so what we're thinking of doing and it's up

44:14.220 --> 44:16.160
Do you guys are welcome to have a first crack at it?

44:16.160 --> 44:22.220
We're gonna put Angela's Ted the MacBook we've been talking about up on eBay and see if people want it now

44:22.420 --> 44:24.180
Because we have it here in studio

44:24.180 --> 44:27.620
You can have it however you like if you'd like to have it with just OS 10

44:27.780 --> 44:32.080
We can load it that way if you'd like to have it with OS 10 and arch or anti gross

44:32.080 --> 44:35.640
We can do it that way if you'd like arch only we can also do that and

44:35.840 --> 44:38.880
Ship it to you that way right straight from the jb1 studio now

44:38.880 --> 44:43.080
It's gonna get better Chris because we're not we're actually offering it at a lower price

44:43.080 --> 44:46.900
So we had a price point in our head and we started a little bit lower for the mumble

44:46.900 --> 44:50.440
So if you're in the mumble room, then you get kind of first crack at a slightly reduced cost

44:50.440 --> 44:51.920
Yeah before we're gonna crank it back

44:51.920 --> 44:57.960
Yeah, the price of that of the 512 drive when that was new alone was $1,000 in that laptop Wow. Yeah, man

44:58.240 --> 45:00.240
We've come a long way. Yeah

45:00.240 --> 45:07.220
Yeah, I really have and so the in the picture here. You're seeing if you're watching the video version. That's the Macbook. They're running

45:08.120 --> 45:10.120
anti-gross with gnome 3 and

45:10.360 --> 45:13.400
the gnome to shell dock extension there at the bottom and

45:13.740 --> 45:17.360
That's there in the other room and it it it's a good machine

45:17.880 --> 45:23.560
Like if we had the money I would just keep this as another production machine when you keep looking over it and you go man

45:23.560 --> 45:25.320
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a nice-looking machine

45:25.320 --> 45:31.160
It really was like it was a really all-out like our main like workhorse editing machine when the GPU died

45:31.160 --> 45:32.880
And then like once the GPU died

45:32.880 --> 45:36.440
It just sat on the shelf and never got used and then Apple just refurbished it basically for us

45:36.440 --> 45:40.080
I would I could put it to work if I had the funds. Yeah, but I you know

45:40.080 --> 45:44.360
We need to recoup the cost of this. Yeah, we just right now especially there's no money

45:44.360 --> 45:48.920
There's no slush there and if we're gonna really be serious and want her to stick with something for a long time

45:50.080 --> 45:54.040
Angela is a savvy enough user that she wants to feel that it's a quality product

45:54.040 --> 45:58.080
She really needs to feel like this is you know, like she likes the build of the MacBook

45:58.080 --> 46:01.760
I think this is gonna do that. Absolutely. It's in fact, there are a lot of things

46:01.760 --> 46:03.420
I like it actually better about the MacBook one

46:03.420 --> 46:06.600
It's not a MacBook and two doesn't have an Apple logo on it and three

46:06.960 --> 46:09.220
It's a little bit thinner a little bit more portable. I think

46:09.880 --> 46:12.480
Than the MacBook and I've had experience now that said though

46:12.680 --> 46:15.520
Yeah, I mean what we're gonna put this in the show notes and it's in the chat room right now

46:15.520 --> 46:21.960
I I am not an advocate of Linux on a MacBook as your primary unless you're okay with some tinkering

46:21.960 --> 46:26.320
Yeah, what we were what we were kind of coming to is set it up and then DD the machine

46:26.320 --> 46:30.240
Yeah, and that could that could certainly work too. Yep, but if you're a geek

46:30.240 --> 46:32.640
I don't think this is necessarily gonna be a problem for you

46:32.640 --> 46:38.960
If you are if you are if you are somebody that wants to set this up for somebody else and you want them to kind of

46:39.200 --> 46:42.720
Run with it independently. That's where we have some real concerns

46:43.720 --> 46:45.680
It's it's a 2011

46:45.680 --> 46:47.680
and so it sort of sits in that spot where

46:47.680 --> 46:52.960
Like enter gross you get it going pretty easily and then it takes about 15 20 minutes of tweaks and then if you really want

46:52.960 --> 46:56.920
to dial it in it's about a little bit more than that once you get the graphics and all that so it's it's an interesting device and

46:57.440 --> 47:01.040
It's available there and we'll let you know at Linux fest how it all turns out

47:01.440 --> 47:06.360
We did decide to go with anti gross again on the yoga wimpy was asking. What do you think wimpy? Are we crazy?

47:07.480 --> 47:10.640
Yes, I've made a catastrophic error of judgment

47:11.800 --> 47:17.520
Well, I've I've made this mistake with my wife I installed Arch Linux on my wife

47:17.520 --> 47:19.520
computer with gnome 3 and

47:20.000 --> 47:25.600
The only way I could keep her on a Linux based operating system was to make my own damn

47:26.120 --> 47:31.720
Distribution so you've no idea the heartache and effort you're gonna be

47:33.920 --> 47:38.640
Here's what I'm working off of wimpy and tell me tell me where I felt tell me where this logic falls apart

47:38.640 --> 47:44.120
So I would be right there with you if it was up to me and I was picking a Linux distribution for a new user

47:44.120 --> 47:47.720
It would be stock Ubuntu and I would keep it as stock as I possibly could

47:47.720 --> 47:50.600
However, there are three big factors to consider one

47:51.080 --> 47:56.200
Angela really likes gnome and she was not only blown away by gnome, but she was impressed

47:56.200 --> 47:59.360
She's used to using gnome on Chris's laptop add to that

47:59.480 --> 48:04.040
She has tried Ubuntu in the past and it and and that that was turned down

48:04.040 --> 48:08.240
So we're working with that second of all and this is a big thing if it's in my house

48:08.240 --> 48:13.240
I want to be familiar with it because I know who has to ultimately answer for those for those problems

48:13.240 --> 48:17.960
And so if we leave here with Angela running Ubuntu or elementary or any of those other

48:18.160 --> 48:21.560
Distributions when she has problems and then Chris has to come home and she goes hey, honey

48:22.120 --> 48:26.040
In addition to the lot in this and this can you fix this and then he sits down and goes man

48:26.040 --> 48:31.080
I just followed this problem on arch. I have no idea how to do it on XYZ. So there's that aspect to consider

48:31.760 --> 48:32.840
so

48:32.840 --> 48:39.280
Here's the thing. So I I went through I went through a period where I had all of my immediate family

48:39.280 --> 48:45.880
That were running Linux running arch Linux and you know, I am an arch Linux to you

48:45.880 --> 48:50.680
I'm heavily invested in the arch Linux community, right, but it did not go well

48:50.960 --> 48:55.960
This is not an operating system you install on your immediate family's computer

48:55.960 --> 49:03.320
Yeah are not Linux savvy because what do you do about updates? You're responsible for doing those updates now, but is that about you it?

49:04.200 --> 49:07.800
Is that he maintains control over when those updates?

49:07.800 --> 49:14.320
Chris are you busy? I am I am but I see my logic is I have I have like three or four other machines

49:14.320 --> 49:19.360
I would do updates on before I do hers. So she should be the last machine. I have I had I had the exact same logic

49:21.080 --> 49:27.040
This just doesn't work you're just not gonna get around to that machine and what happens is months go by and then you think damn it

49:27.040 --> 49:32.760
I really need to do the updates and then you've got all of those configuration conflicts to deal with and suddenly

49:32.760 --> 49:39.760
what should be a simple task is a mess that you need to un-pickle and you don't have time to deal with it and

49:44.960 --> 49:47.920
There's a slight thing that you haven't paid attention to there is Rekai

49:48.640 --> 49:50.520
Well, okay, that's he has nothing to do

49:50.520 --> 49:57.100
But what I think who is it in the chat room is is is saying the same thing that I'm thinking kz6

49:57.480 --> 49:59.480
Fiddy sent

49:59.480 --> 50:01.480
Um

50:01.480 --> 50:03.040
Ubuntu gnome

50:03.040 --> 50:08.560
Angela is not Chris. Angela doesn't know what the what she's missing by running

50:09.560 --> 50:11.200
Ubuntu gnome

50:11.200 --> 50:13.400
314 versus Ubuntu gnome

50:13.880 --> 50:17.200
360 Chris you might appreciate those differences

50:17.240 --> 50:22.200
But Angela won't and if you went with that with all of the automatic

50:22.200 --> 50:27.280
You know update utilities that that's got built into it. You can just let her

50:27.280 --> 50:33.800
accept the update prompts and hit you know apply now we start my computer I mean

50:37.000 --> 50:42.760
That makes the most sense to me for up to ten machines by far use landscape and you could remotely

50:44.520 --> 50:46.520
My wife I would say

50:49.040 --> 50:53.840
I don't know. I mean, I don't want to I don't want to totally discredit Angela's ability your wife runs arch

50:53.840 --> 50:59.240
She does and she installed it herself and she knows probably less about is that can I say that on air?

50:59.240 --> 51:01.000
Am I gonna get in trouble? Hold on think yeah

51:01.000 --> 51:06.920
She I think she knows less about Linux and technology than Angela does and she was able to follow the wiki and figure it out

51:07.200 --> 51:12.080
I don't a I mean, I don't know. I I'm always for

51:13.280 --> 51:18.720
What man what RIP? No, everyone's saying RIP. No, no, it's it's one of those things where I

51:18.720 --> 51:23.520
I organically I agree that that stock a bunch who is usually gonna be better for users

51:23.520 --> 51:26.480
but in this particular case having seen Angela's immediate reaction and

51:27.200 --> 51:29.040
having seen

51:29.040 --> 51:34.160
How how she how she reacts to when she's using Chris's computer

51:34.160 --> 51:38.440
I think in this particular case since everyone is kind of in that arch mode and you know

51:38.440 --> 51:42.600
You know who does this Linus Torvalds himself does this he uses Fedora

51:42.600 --> 51:46.920
And so he makes sure that all of his other computers in his house are using Fedora and he specifically said that's because he doesn't

51:46.920 --> 51:49.540
Like to run multiple distributions in his house. Yeah

51:50.200 --> 51:51.800
That's even why I put it on my server

51:51.800 --> 51:53.480
I can totally get behind that

51:53.480 --> 51:57.040
See, but I feel like all you guys are saying don't run don't run this for your wife's computer

51:57.040 --> 51:59.040
We're also the same guys that tell me don't run it on my server

51:59.480 --> 52:04.920
Yeah, no, no, that's not me at all. I'm just the guy that says yeah, I mean you are but you're scaring me the most

52:09.200 --> 52:13.220
Nine months in it's easier to maintain a whole distribution than look after one

52:13.220 --> 52:16.300
Of its information on your wife's computer. Yeah

52:16.300 --> 52:19.020
I'd have to agree with you this time wimpy because you know

52:19.020 --> 52:24.060
There is a lot of kernel tweaks that go into the Ubuntu kernel which kind of help a little bit of the hardware

52:24.060 --> 52:26.700
So but here's where I get to if I'm gonna go with an Ubuntu base

52:26.700 --> 52:30.860
Then I start getting pulled towards elementary and I love Matei, but I start thinking well

52:30.860 --> 52:33.580
Then I should give her something that'll really give her a you know

52:33.580 --> 52:39.500
Sort of a sex appeal that sort of she's used to you was you were saying that Angela likes the gnome desktop

52:39.500 --> 52:45.620
So why don't you go with that been to canine? Yeah, we were talking about all the advantages of PPAs earlier on in the show

52:49.100 --> 52:54.740
What could it kind of come down to either elementary OS or Ubuntu Matei 1504 well, let's be clear

52:54.740 --> 52:57.260
It wasn't so much gnome specifically that drew her to it

52:57.260 --> 53:02.300
It was the fact that she was using the same hardcore Linux that you were using when you install a bunch

53:02.300 --> 53:05.260
You know that then that changes. Well, yeah, it's not the same thing

53:05.260 --> 53:09.940
Mm-hmm. So I wonder if the appeal for her is gonna change and that brings us back to elementary. I

53:10.620 --> 53:12.540
Guess if you I'm sorry good

53:12.540 --> 53:17.300
Oh, I was gonna say I guess if you mirror and like if you have if you keep frequent mirrors of everything to where she's done

53:17.300 --> 53:22.060
It's like everything's it goes to crap. You just push a button it all reverts back to what it was five minutes ago

53:22.060 --> 53:25.620
It's fine. Whatever. I mean if you if you have a push button solution for it, it makes sense

53:25.620 --> 53:27.620
But I don't I just don't

53:28.100 --> 53:32.380
Advantage of I just don't get I think you're right. I think what we do is we let Angela pick

53:32.380 --> 53:35.820
Do you want arch or you want to bat a 1504 and here when here's the other thing?

53:35.820 --> 53:39.820
the nice thing about this over over the old silver sliver is

53:40.500 --> 53:45.180
With this when she changes her mind, it's a matter of plugging in a different USB drive and restart

53:45.180 --> 53:48.900
Yeah, you know, it's no longer a weekend project. Yeah. All right

53:49.020 --> 53:52.980
So we'll we'll we'll make her a pitch and we'll let her make the choice

53:53.820 --> 53:55.540
And see what she thinks is best

53:55.540 --> 54:00.520
I wouldn't be surprised if she goes with arch and then we'll load the yoga either way she chooses

54:00.520 --> 54:05.020
Well, and make sure you're using a laser pointer and PowerPoint slides because that really will help get your point across

54:05.860 --> 54:07.860
Yeah

54:08.740 --> 54:16.260
A lot of users don't ever realize or notice the underlying operating system very much. It's always the desktop experience. Mm-hmm. Yep

54:16.540 --> 54:18.540
Always I agree. I agree

54:18.540 --> 54:20.800
I just want to make sure it's one that she'll like

54:21.180 --> 54:26.860
And I think we'll find it and we'll let you guys know and so that the bay auction is up now and don't worry

54:26.860 --> 54:30.580
It's going so fast because I'm not I don't think we've had it. We had zero bids. It's your bids

54:30.580 --> 54:33.260
Yeah, no, that's that's kind of won't stay that way for long

54:33.260 --> 54:39.820
No, you think and as someone at eBay is frequently it watch for the snipers. So you'll see I said the same thing

54:39.820 --> 54:41.060
Well, I'll tell you about another great deal

54:41.060 --> 54:46.740
How about our friends over at ting go to linux.ting.com that'll get $25 off your first device or

54:47.380 --> 54:52.420
$25 of credit if you have a ting compatible device and you probably do plus it supports this show

54:52.540 --> 54:54.740
Things got a GSM and CD main network coverage

54:54.740 --> 54:59.500
So when I say you probably have a device that works you probably do there's a lot of them ting is mobile that makes sense

54:59.500 --> 55:03.560
Ting's my mobile service provider ting's Matt's mobile service provider ting is Noah's mobile service provider

55:03.560 --> 55:05.560
We all use ting and we all love it ting

55:05.740 --> 55:08.860
Not do you have you both phones with you right now just the way I have one it's in the car

55:08.860 --> 55:11.620
Yeah, the other ones in the car. Yeah, you know why cuz it's so small. I forget it everywhere

55:11.620 --> 55:12.460
Well, and it's why not?

55:12.460 --> 55:17.340
I mean, it's yeah, you said Noah got one of those nine dollar GSM car a SIM cards from ting

55:17.340 --> 55:18.500
And then he just pays for what he used

55:18.500 --> 55:22.980
He just takes your minutes and messages megabytes and they add them all up whatever bucket he falls into that's what he pays

55:22.980 --> 55:27.180
It's a flat six dollars for the line so we can have an emergency phone with a nine dollar SIM

55:27.340 --> 55:32.260
Sitting in this car that has two weeks of battery life and he's just paying for what he uses which is not very much

55:32.260 --> 55:36.460
That's why Jupiter broadcasting is able to have three lines because I don't have a lot of money

55:36.460 --> 55:37.460
But I ting well

55:37.460 --> 55:42.140
We just pay for what we use and we make a ton of Wi-Fi calls and they have some great devices on ting

55:42.140 --> 55:45.100
I'd like to recommend the Moto G if you're looking for a value device

55:45.100 --> 55:52.080
Ninety one dollars unlocked modern version of Android you own it six dollars for the line. No contract

55:53.020 --> 55:56.860
That's pretty sweet. Yeah. Now. It does get a little more crazy after that

55:57.940 --> 56:02.180
Ting has just started directly selling the one plus one. I think that's pretty awesome

56:02.180 --> 56:06.100
Yeah, you can now buy the ting want you from ting you can get the one plus

56:06.740 --> 56:12.580
Unlocked get it on ting. It's yours. You own it. What a great device. What a great device for a ting network

56:12.580 --> 56:18.380
What a perfect device for the ting network and then also if you're like me and you've been looking at that Moto X to

56:18.580 --> 56:21.660
Second-gen ting is now selling that directly as well unlocked you own it

56:21.660 --> 56:22.780
That's your rig

56:22.780 --> 56:26.260
Go take it on the ting network or if you have a GSM or CDMA device that works with them

56:26.260 --> 56:30.060
You get $25 a service card that might pay for more than your first month. It did for mine

56:30.060 --> 56:33.900
Yeah a smartphone for under $25 a month. It is actually possible

56:34.460 --> 56:41.360
Linux dot ting comm they got no hold customer service a fantastic dashboard and I really really love the way they do business

56:41.360 --> 56:45.780
Check them out Linux that ting comm and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged

56:46.820 --> 56:51.900
I said did you see this story about the John Deere tractors or stuff and the software and I got it

56:51.900 --> 56:54.940
I'll just recap this for all of you who may be not following the story

56:54.940 --> 56:57.380
It's it sort of lit up in our subreddit today

56:57.800 --> 57:03.140
But the headline from wired reads we can't let John Deere destroy the very idea of ownership

57:04.140 --> 57:06.140
That's pretty bold. Yeah

57:06.140 --> 57:13.900
In a particular spectacular display of corporate delusion John Deere the world's largest architectural machinery maker told the copyright office

57:13.900 --> 57:18.220
That farmers don't own their tractors because the computer code

57:18.540 --> 57:24.680
Snakes through the DNA of modern tractors farmers receive what they are farmers receive an implied

57:24.900 --> 57:30.300
License for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle. In other words, it's John Deere's tractor

57:30.300 --> 57:37.660
You're just driving it several manufacturers recently submitted similar comments to the Copyright Office under an inquiry into the digital Millennium

57:37.940 --> 57:39.180
Copyright Act

57:39.180 --> 57:41.820
Carrie Adams a farmer hasn't been able to fix an expensive

57:42.220 --> 57:47.020
Transplanter because he doesn't have access to the diagnostic software. He needs he isn't alone

57:47.020 --> 57:50.820
Many farmers are opting for older computer free equipment because of this very problem

57:51.100 --> 57:56.260
Some companies have even leveraged the DMCA to stop owners from modifying programming on those products

57:56.260 --> 57:59.460
So you might be wondering what does copyright have to do with modifying a tractor

58:00.300 --> 58:03.180
Well owners can tinker, you know, and you have homebrew hackers

58:03.180 --> 58:08.740
They have to copy programming in order to modify it in the first place product makers don't like people messing with their stuff

58:08.740 --> 58:13.500
So some manufacturers place DRM when you break the DRM and make a copy

58:13.860 --> 58:19.580
You are essentially violating copyright law and that's how manufacturers can turn tinkerers into pirates

58:19.580 --> 58:22.980
And even if said pirates aren't circulating illegal copies of anything

58:22.980 --> 58:28.220
John Deere the company argues that allowing people to alter the software even for purposes of repair

58:28.580 --> 58:35.540
Would make it possible for pirates and third-party developers and less innovative competitors to free ride off the creativity

58:35.540 --> 58:39.660
and unique expression and ingenuity of the vehicle software and

58:40.180 --> 58:44.660
the piece of resistance as they say piece of the resistance or sauce sauce

58:45.300 --> 58:47.300
in John Deere's argument

58:47.300 --> 58:53.740
Permitting owners to root around in the tractors programming might lead to pirating music through the vehicle's entertainment system

58:53.740 --> 58:58.020
Oh, they're really reaching here. Okay, so there's a few things wrong with this entire

58:58.580 --> 59:01.780
First of all, if someone's gonna actually decide to you know, break the DRM

59:01.780 --> 59:06.620
They're gonna find a way to do it second of all if they're doing it for themselves because they've purchased the equipment

59:07.100 --> 59:12.900
Congratulations, they're already a customer. Let's not piss them off and third of all pirating music. I mean the whole thing

59:12.900 --> 59:17.260
Pirating music. I mean the whole thing. Mm-hmm. They're just completely reaching for it

59:17.260 --> 59:23.440
I mean I watched a thing or a documentary yesterday showing how you can take most cars made out and trucks made after

59:23.660 --> 59:29.980
1996 flash the software and wait for it run alternative fuels right now. No additional hardware

59:30.020 --> 59:36.140
So, you know, but and but because you can't it's illegal to change that software same same basic thing. This is not a new problem

59:36.140 --> 59:38.140
It's just now coming to light

59:38.140 --> 59:44.740
Yeah value of this is negative. So you're saying Matt that people are not buying $25,000 tractors to pirate music and I

59:46.740 --> 59:49.220
Know I just I look at this at a situation

59:49.220 --> 59:52.820
It's obvious what they're trying to do is just lock things down and use copyright to do it

59:52.980 --> 59:58.660
But it's a pretty scary thing when everything has software in it and it's not just so we're picking on John Deere

59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.660
General Motors told the Copyright Office the proponents of copyright reform

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:08.780
Mistakenly conflate ownership of a vehicle with ownership of the underlying computer software in the vehicle ie the car you own

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.660
General in General Motors opinion you do not own the computer or the computer software in that car

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:16.140
But of course you need to drive the car, right? Yeah

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:19.460
Convenient, right? I got to be honest as a Linux user

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.980
This really kind of pisses me off. Mm-hmm

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:30.340
That should scare you it should scare you that it's culturally acceptable that we can sell a device that you that

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.620
the

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:37.140
Concept even 10 15 years ago of buying a computer that you didn't have administrative access to would be ridiculous

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:44.320
And yet we allow this now consistently with smartphones with smartphones apparently with tractors apparently with cars. We just don't think about it

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.540
It's not good. Yeah

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:55.460
Yeah, yeah, you do to make them if this is the true what how where what's their liability with errors in that software that lead

01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:01.580
To loss of life. I do wonder about that other automate automakers have pointed out the owners who make unsanctioned modifications

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.000
Who I like that one could alter their vehicles in bad ways

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.860
They could tweak them to go faster or change no parameters to run a foul

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.980
You know like APR tuning I could tune my engine to run faster, too

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:13.420
Mm-hmm

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:19.100
Give me a break or I could just apply more pressure to that pedal on the right and I could also go faster without

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:23.080
Altering the software again the arguments idiotic. It's pretty weak, isn't it?

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.600
It's just terrible GM says that locking people out helps innovation this week though. There is some good news

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.620
Senator Ron widened and a janitor Jared polis

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:38.860
I think is the last name will introduce the breaking down barriers innovation act of 2015 which might help improve the DMCA process

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:42.580
We'll see although the fair repair legislation also has some

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.900
Work to do. Well, we'll see where that goes. What are we gonna say right now?

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.780
I'm sorry didn't there was a Toyota had a problem with their their gas pedal got stuck

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.420
Yeah, and it was a software issue that they had that you had to go to their dealership to get it to fix it

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.540
If it wasn't, you know proprietary you could actually fix it yourself

01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:02.060
Toyota moving you forward whether you want to or not this this kind of stuff is

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:09.180
Particular spooky for those of us who are really hyper aware of how important software is to pretty much everything we get involved with now

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.420
everything we use and

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.420
It does kind of like you think RMS was right in a way. Mm-hmm

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:20.820
I guess it's kind of what he's been saying all along right and just saying yeah

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.140
I think and unfortunately for honor the unfortunate thing for RMS is I think it's wasted effort

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:28.200
Perhaps has been wasted effort because here we are anyways

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.540
so what worries me about this is not just the big devices like

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.900
Tractors that are used by farmers, but also the little devices like light bulbs, you know

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.820
The fact you have to firmware update your light bulbs or firmware update your fridge or something

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:48.020
And they can choose if you've if you've hacked it in some way they can choose not to let that work

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:53.640
And so you're left in darkness or you're left with rotting food in your fridge because they've chosen not to allow you to

01:02:54.260 --> 01:03:00.020
Fiddle with the stuff and yeah, I agree with you. I think RMS was right in some ways with these things

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:08.700
Wow, or even expanding on that imagine if they thought that you adjusted it or they thought that you made an adjustment when in reality

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.740
You didn't actually do anything

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:14.140
But because you've been labeled as such we get the same result that was just pointed out to us. Mm-hmm

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:19.360
That's scary dare Devlin you wanted to make comment on the sad consequences of the logic

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:19.980
Yeah

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:27.460
I think it's even worse because if you lock down and if they successfully keep locking down to in this path

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:34.620
What eventually will come down to only certify developers on blah blah blah, which already happens in certain fields

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:42.380
Yes, but it's going to expand to all of the fields like I know you have these like you have for doctors for software

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:45.340
Because it will be everywhere and you will have blah blah blah

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:49.620
Specification or certification and a lot of the innovation will be just stagnating

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:54.820
I mean ultimately that's what the locking down leads to hmm

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:59.380
If you to have access to the car you have to pass blah blah blah specification, right?

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:05.460
Then I mean just gonna study for that particular. You're right. That is sort of the inevitable conclusion of this logic

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.460
That's a great point. I hadn't thought of

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:11.140
WWI wanted to give you a chance to jump in on how you see this kind of happening with digital media today

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:19.260
It's already happening. I mean the WikiLeaks stuff that just came out from the Sony hack that right everybody

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:23.220
That's in this IRC and in mumble who watches text that

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:28.700
Knows that you know Sony had that big half and now we're seeing the

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:33.080
Consequences of that and what these companies are really doing behind your back

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:39.380
You have the evidence that anybody can go to WikiLeaks and just look it up and you can see the interaction

01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.420
Between these different companies on digital media and they want to control the content

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:48.140
They want to control what you see on any US website now

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:55.460
So where's it gonna end if people should be literally up in arms about this and they're not and that's what I think it's now

01:04:55.460 --> 01:05:00.820
You know what they're doing and I it's of course only benefits me, but I think they're just going somewhere else

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.220
I think they're going to alternative media

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:05.980
I think they're going to podcasts are going to internet media and those of us that become more aware of it

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.980
we seek out independent entertainment and

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:12.340
I think they are going to be the catalyst of their own downfall because people will realize

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.260
Brian Williams is just the tip of the iceberg my friends

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:19.060
Yeah, and you can jump on you know, it's funny too when I get when I pick up a new passion your new hobby

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.780
One of the first things I'll do is I'll jump on YouTube and I'll take a look and see what other people have channels and that

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:27.940
They're talking about it. It's kind of fun, right? Yeah, you don't go on TV anymore for that kind of stuff. No, no

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.980
Yeah, so maybe it's actually all for the good in the long run

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:37.540
we'll see but it is pretty it is pretty it's pretty frustrating to watch this kind of stuff happen and I would love to see

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:41.940
Ron Wyden's successful with the breaking down barriers to innovation act and you of course

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.460
I will have information in the show notes and the link to wired the link

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.500
I have to wired has links where you can contact the Copyright Office and

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.580
The the URL to do that is specific for the DMC. It's dmca.digitalrights

01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:02.620
digitalrightrepair.org dmca.digitalrightrepair.org and they have a way for you to contact people and

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:04.780
Representatives I'll put a link to that in the chat room, too

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:12.340
If you guys want to get involved with that, so maybe that can help maybe we can make a difference. Maybe good old Ron Wyden. Hmm

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.540
Yeah, you know, I'm probably one of those guys

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.620
It's gonna stand there on the top of my hood with both my middle fingers out going I'm doing it bite me

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:26.140
Because that's more how I'll be there with you. I'll bring the hot dogs. Okay, you know

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:34.500
The legal defense on them. Yeah, you bring the hot dogs now Matt'll bring something gluten-free you bring the beer and that'll be our protest

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.340
Actually, that sounds a little bit like Friday night, Matt

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:42.220
I don't know if I don't know if you have any plans Friday, but after we get set up at Ballyham and Linux for Linux Fest

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:46.060
We're gonna take the crew out to dinner. I'd love to have you join us all I'll contact you later in the week

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.060
I'll talk to you tomorrow about that. I'll see you

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:52.060
Tell you all about about our cool plans on the weekend

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.460
And so for those of you out in the audience, we want you to join us JB live TV Saturday and Sunday

01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:00.900
Or come say hi at Linux Fest Northwest. It's gonna be really good to be good to see how you guys there

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.700
Anything else need to cover before we get out of here?

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:06.500
Somebody buy that MacBook. Yeah, I do that

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.100
That'll help us out a lot also Linux actually show that reddit to come to make this show even better Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:22.700
Contact and Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar for updates. See you next week everybody

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:44.100
I

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:53.060
Think wouldn't be talking me to 1504. I will get this. Oh, really. I've maybe I don't know. I'm gonna be so much easier

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:54.780
I'm gonna call it that

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.780
Think it'd be easier really. Oh, yeah

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.820
Live installer thing and then all the guys at ease

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:05.460
But here's a sign of a broadcasting professional when you hear the outro coming up and you're like I will get everything

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.460
I'm about to say up before the music

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.460
So it sounds like it

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.180
Your voice elevates right

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.420
Right there I could do it's like I'm doing an auction. Yeah. All right

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:22.300
I'm using 1504. No free at the moment and it's awesome

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500
It's wonderful

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:31.260
Really really really really fast really reliable. I haven't had one single problem on it

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:35.740
I've got a 4 gig laptop with Intel onboard graphics card

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:41.340
Nothing special and it just runs it perfectly. What's the support? Is it nine months for 1504?

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.020
Yes

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.580
Everything

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:50.460
What do you dislike

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:58.500
Stable nonsense no nonsense LTS Chris really

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.500
Yeah

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:03.500
So so

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:08.540
Chris so boring you guys the Ubuntu gnome team maintain their own

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:14.700
PPAs with the updated version of the desktop in there so you can install the LTS

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:21.860
you can add the PPAs for the desktop and the other applications that are important to you and you can just maintain a

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.380
semi rolling applications on top of a standard base

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:31.700
Try when I said to you are you busy Chris the the the extension of that question is

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.100
When are you?

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:40.140
When do you have free time? I know they Angela's computer when she is not using it. All right

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.060
You don't you use landscape

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:51.300
You on your machine you log into landscape and you press a button that says update all my computers and it just does it and

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.300
You don't worry. Yeah

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:58.980
Definitely what we're talking about here is potentially Chris having one Ubuntu machine on home network

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:02.420
Yeah, not not ten Ubuntu machines on the home. All right. Well, so now I'm wondering

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.620
To my add it to my account and I'll update

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:14.020
So is it really better to go Ubuntu 1404 with gnome 3 PPAs or Matei

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:16.700
1404 what do you think she'd like better?

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:19.300
probably

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:24.180
Okay, yeah, it's what she was why don't you ask her and would you try them both and see if I

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:31.740
That's where everyone with that Mac like interface so you can share with that

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:38.140
That's where everyone kind of falls off because we this has to get done like by the end of today so that she can try it

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.940
So they're gonna get back on. Yeah. Yeah, we're swapping her out like this

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.900
We want to get her back because you realize every day that we every day that we she doesn't have her new computer is one

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:50.540
More day that we have to go collect all the data off of her her existing computer. I'll move it all over

01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:53.300
There is no doing this twice. We need to get it right the first time

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:59.340
Three times ago, right? Well, we're we're stopping to redo it, right?

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:03.560
We just don't want to go this arch kind of screwed up your plans doesn't mean you

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.020
That is arch have anything to do with the plans

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:11.620
In fact, if anything arch has been the easiest distribution out of all of them to get running on there

01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:14.540
We couldn't get a bunch of we couldn't get a bunch of the boot

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:19.460
We couldn't get what else do we try and then no, it's not like it's some arch maniac

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:24.940
No, in fact, I really dislike arch in this particular case. He's right. It's the only one that even booted on the system much less

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:31.860
Let's look at this. Okay, so we've established that arch is working a boon to at some level wasn't really working out

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:34.060
Previous at all at all. So

01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:40.240
Even though I'm not an arch guy anymore necessarily that kind of gravitates us just just sticking what's what's working

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.680
I think well, but now run but now it doesn't matter cuz now we're on the yoga, you know, so now well, okay

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.700
So now we could oh, you know, I see what you're saying. I see you say, okay

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.960
So the based on that stick with gnome a boon to gnome done, you know

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.100
She's already grown to like the desktop environment make keep it simple

01:11:54.220 --> 01:12:00.180
You know, you're rarely I rarely ever recommend you bugged you but here I am doing it

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.180
I feel like I feel like we recommend a boon to because we're all scared

01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:07.540
I feel like we do it because we're scared of we are scared of rolling

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:12.020
Software it's a practical. It is a practical scared thing because it's bitten me enough times

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:19.860
No, I just hate giving in so let's say you have you have arch like it's just a flood of perfectly flawless updates

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:26.460
I'm saying that without laughing and or you have a book because I've broken shit so many times or you have a boon to

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:32.580
Which you know can still have issues obviously, you know, I'm both both options can roll back their packages just fine easy enough

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.740
No big deal. Yeah, but I have less

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.500
Wonderful updates of one than I do the other I guess for her

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.660
I get

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.860
Yeah, all right. All right, JB titles.com. Let's get this thing banged out

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:50.300
Yeah, so I mean it's so from owner. What's that? I

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:53.860
Said five minutes. I got a puppy on there. That's all you guys

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.940
Oh

01:12:55.940 --> 01:13:01.180
Dear RMS was right. It's not bad. That's excellent. Actually Chris. Does she not like unity at all?

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.940
No, she does not know

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:10.700
But once you depart from Ubuntu, I almost say it at the risk you get my head bit of I almost say elementary

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:14.620
You know guys, he doesn't like unity because he has choice

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.860
Elementary has a lot of USB stick. Yeah

01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:23.340
Issues I've had a lot of issues

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:27.700
A lot of issues with their

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:35.700
I agree, but it's not an issue in elementary. I think the US is a little bit too far removed from the parent project

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:41.780
Well to be honest, I mean I would be I would probably be more willing to go with it, but it's in beta fray is

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:43.780
Yeah, that's true. So

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:49.260
I thought fray I thought was a bit like the release. No final version

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:56.060
Well, if you ignore the three thousand seven hundred bucks in launchpad, it's it's final release, okay

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.060
Care about making a desktop really

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.620
All the applications that Angela probably need isn't part of elementary's vision

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:14.620
So they don't care about anything else other than their Pantheon and no blessed application

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.940
Well, no, she needs the web browser. She needs photo and she needs mail and they do all that

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.940
But yeah, yeah. Well, all right

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.500
I think right now

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:38.820
Someone rely on that I think either way I think either way we go it's gonna be okay. So I'm not

01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.820
About it go safe go safe with a bun with a bun too long lean initially

01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:49.940
And then if you want to go to watch or something that once she she's been on it a little bit longer and got used

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:51.940
To it then then go for it then

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:57.980
Here's the end of the thing is like let me paint you a picture. You've got two three week circumstances three weeks from now

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:02.780
You're like, oh crap. I haven't updated that for a while. Which distro do you want to be faced with what doing that?

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.820
So I'll let you guys know which way we go

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:12.340
I will we'll get the installation going here in a few minutes now once we get off air and we'll update you guys soon

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:36.180
Have a great week, and I'll see you tomorrow minute. All right. I'll see you then. All right, buddy
