WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.040
I'm having a rough day, Wes.

00:01.040 --> 00:02.800
I've officially wrecked my uptime

00:02.800 --> 00:04.600
and I'm struggling with that.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.240
Had to reboot, eh?

00:06.240 --> 00:07.320
What happened?

00:07.320 --> 00:09.600
Well, had to shut down.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.440
Had to shut down.

00:10.440 --> 00:12.520
Yesterday, we were in the studio

00:12.520 --> 00:14.680
and it started to heat up

00:14.680 --> 00:15.720
and we're looking at the forecast

00:15.720 --> 00:18.880
and it's saying 104, 105 Fahrenheit.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.640
And I just said, no way.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.400
We don't have air conditioning in the studio.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.560
The little portable unit that I have running right now

00:24.560 --> 00:28.440
basically becomes worthless after about 90, 95 degrees.

00:28.440 --> 00:29.900
So I just, I shut everything down.

00:29.900 --> 00:31.400
I said, we're shutting the studio down.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.880
We bumped Coder from Monday

00:32.880 --> 00:34.880
and we're gonna record it on Wednesday.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.900
And I turned off the mixer, which we never do.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.800
I turned off the recording systems, which we never do.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.040
I didn't turn everything off,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.640
but I turned a lot of stuff off.

00:41.640 --> 00:42.480
And I got out of here.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.080
I evacuated, everybody evacuated.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.480
And I kind of had a, I had like a brilliant moment.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.760
You know, sometimes I impress myself, Wes.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.760
It's really like a Star Trek scene here, you know,

00:51.760 --> 00:53.340
where you've got to turn down all the power

00:53.340 --> 00:54.560
so we can hide in the nebula.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.200
Although, I don't know if we can really hide from the heat.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.040
Ooh.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.120
Got it all shut down.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.920
Yeah, so I decided to go out and play in the snow.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.160
So the wife and I loaded up in the car with Levi

01:06.160 --> 01:07.320
and we headed out to Mount Baker,

01:07.320 --> 01:10.540
which is about 45, 5,000 feet up in the air.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.720
So it was like mid eighties, which is still pretty warm.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.840
And you found honest to goodness snow.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.920
Yeah, we had a snowball fight.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.480
So I'm out there having a snowball fight.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.160
And I checked my phone because it was the first time

01:20.160 --> 01:22.040
we were in reception in about two hours

01:22.040 --> 01:23.400
and they have a tower up there.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.480
And I got a message from Daniel Fore.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.080
This last weekend, Wes and I helped them

01:27.080 --> 01:28.600
with their elementary developer weekend.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.440
We ran the stream.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.720
We were like the wizards behind the curtain.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.960
And I had forgotten to upload day two's file before I left.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.760
So I'm up there on the mountain, playing in the snow.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.040
And I see a message from Dan saying,

01:41.040 --> 01:42.400
hey man, I'm at my desk.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.720
I'm like ready to edit and stuff.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.080
Like, but I don't have the file.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.700
And I feel like such a jerk.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.080
So we had to pack up.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.840
We threw a few more snowballs, but we had to pack up,

01:51.840 --> 01:54.360
get back in the car and drive for two hours

01:54.360 --> 01:55.880
back to the studio.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.760
I pull into the studio.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.600
I open up the garage.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.040
I pull into the garage, which is also the server room.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.120
But at this point, I had the server off.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.220
And Hadeen and I, kind of at the same time,

02:05.220 --> 02:07.000
we open our doors, we step out

02:07.000 --> 02:08.880
and we're just hit with this wall of heat.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.400
Like somebody sitting there with a blow dryer in our face.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.240
It was so hot.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.400
We look at each other and all we can do is say,

02:13.400 --> 02:15.840
oh my God, and run for the door.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.800
We get to the door and you know how they tell you

02:17.800 --> 02:19.840
if the doorknob's hot, there might be a fire

02:19.840 --> 02:20.760
on the other side?

02:21.760 --> 02:23.080
The doorknob was hot, Wes.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.440
The whole door was hot.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.400
The whole room, every object was radiating heat.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.160
It might've been like 120 degrees

02:29.160 --> 02:31.720
because probably since about 2 p.m.,

02:31.720 --> 02:35.920
the sun had been directly on the garage front door

02:35.920 --> 02:39.200
and the heat in there had just built and built and built.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.120
So we bust out of there as fast as possible,

02:41.120 --> 02:44.640
get into the main studio, power up the OBS rig,

02:44.640 --> 02:48.680
get that file uploaded that I promised Dan I'd get to him.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.680
And then I went through the studio

02:50.680 --> 02:52.880
and I did a complete shutdown like I've never done

02:52.880 --> 02:54.160
since we've moved in here.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.960
Every single device off, Wi-Fi access points powered off,

02:57.960 --> 03:01.460
cable modem unplugged, everything totally turned off

03:01.460 --> 03:02.840
because I didn't want anything to die

03:02.840 --> 03:07.000
because the heat was outrageous, 120 maybe in the garage

03:07.000 --> 03:09.580
and 100 degrees in the main studio itself.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.460
It was horrible.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.120
So I just turned everything off

03:13.120 --> 03:16.240
and then I came in early this morning before the show

03:16.240 --> 03:18.600
and it was like the bad old days of my IT gig

03:18.600 --> 03:19.800
where I would have to go around

03:19.800 --> 03:22.440
and get a client back online after a power outage.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.280
So I start with the edge devices,

03:24.280 --> 03:25.680
you get the cable modem going,

03:25.680 --> 03:27.240
get the firewall up and running,

03:27.240 --> 03:28.240
then I get the server booted

03:28.240 --> 03:30.280
so that way all of our network services are available.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.480
Then I go get all the client machines online.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.560
And then last but not least is the studio,

03:35.560 --> 03:38.720
which that has to be booted up in a very particular order.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.680
So I get everything turned on here,

03:40.680 --> 03:43.040
I sit down and now we're doing a show.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.000
So hopefully everything works.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.740
Yeah, I can't believe you actually made it back online

03:47.740 --> 03:48.800
to the live stream.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.220
We'll see, hopefully I have all the buttons

03:50.220 --> 03:51.060
in the right place.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.920
I have a feeling I forgot something.

03:52.920 --> 03:57.920
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.480
My name is Chris.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.520
My name is Wes.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.320
Hello, Wes, good luck keeping cool during this episode,

04:09.320 --> 04:11.800
which is brought to you by the all new A Cloud Guru,

04:11.800 --> 04:13.800
the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

04:13.800 --> 04:15.000
and other modern tech skills.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.760
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

04:17.760 --> 04:18.680
Get certified, get hired,

04:18.680 --> 04:21.280
get learning at acloudguru.com.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.080
Well, coming up in a very warm edition

04:24.080 --> 04:26.480
of the Linux Unplugged program,

04:26.480 --> 04:29.280
we are setting out to try something

04:29.280 --> 04:31.320
that I think has been sort of rattling around

04:31.320 --> 04:34.320
in the back of our minds for a while now.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.380
When Fuchsia gets to a certain point,

04:36.380 --> 04:38.200
is it gonna become a threat to Linux?

04:38.200 --> 04:40.080
We got an email into the show

04:40.080 --> 04:43.120
and they asked some really good questions.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.500
So we're setting out to find out.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.520
Wes is gonna try the absolute state of the art

04:46.520 --> 04:47.820
of Fuchsia on the desktop

04:47.820 --> 04:51.360
and try to determine if long-term it's a threat to Linux.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.640
And at the same time,

04:52.640 --> 04:55.240
I'm setting off to test something else.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.600
I wanna try out the latest state-in-the-art

04:57.600 --> 04:59.840
of desktop Linux for new users.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.880
I think there might be one true distro out there

05:01.880 --> 05:03.080
that we should start considering

05:03.080 --> 05:05.240
we recommend to all new Linux users.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.040
And I'll tell you about that in a little bit.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.120
But before we get there,

05:09.120 --> 05:11.400
we have to say hello to our virtual lug.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.240
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.080
Hello, hello.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.680
Hello. Hello.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.520
Howdy.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.720
Namaskaram.

05:17.720 --> 05:18.840
Well, hello everyone.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.320
It is great to see all 24 of you in there,

05:21.320 --> 05:24.360
including the mayor, AKA Jack from Alma Linux.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.240
Jack, welcome to the Unplugged program.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.760
Hey guys, how are you?

05:27.760 --> 05:28.600
Great.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.840
And we have lots to talk about today.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.120
So if you wanna chime in at any point,

05:32.120 --> 05:34.280
just tag me in the chat room and I'll try to work you in.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.520
The Mumble Room is open to our community

05:36.520 --> 05:37.920
and we invite people to join us.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.060
You can get details at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble,

05:41.060 --> 05:43.240
and then join us live on Tuesdays.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.820
But let's start with the new goodies

05:44.820 --> 05:47.120
that your future Linux desktop will be getting really soon.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.600
Linux 5.13 was released.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.120
And I think the headline feature here, Wes,

05:51.120 --> 05:53.260
is really the M1 bring up support

05:53.260 --> 05:55.520
that is landed now upstream.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.960
Of course, it's still early days there.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.960
There's no accelerated graphics and a lot more to work out,

06:01.960 --> 06:05.100
but it's in and that should provide a pretty nice base

06:05.100 --> 06:07.320
for development going forward.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.460
There are also new Linux 5.13 security features in the mix,

06:11.460 --> 06:14.960
like a new Landlock Linux security module,

06:14.960 --> 06:17.680
Clang control flow integrity support,

06:17.680 --> 06:20.880
and optionally randomizing the kernel stack offset

06:20.880 --> 06:23.480
at every system call.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.600
There's also some AMD fun this cycle though, don't worry,

06:26.600 --> 06:29.400
around FreeSync HDMI support, nice.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.200
Yes, I love to see the FreeSync support landing.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.960
The Landlock LSM stuff is a really interesting story.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.920
And if that type of thing appeals to you out there

06:39.920 --> 06:40.840
in the audience, let us know.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.460
We would happily do a deep dive.

06:43.460 --> 06:45.260
We just don't know if it's too niche or not,

06:45.260 --> 06:48.600
but let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.360
Linus says, this is a fairly big one.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.760
It's not like the biggest we've seen,

06:51.760 --> 06:53.760
but it's one of the bigger five series releases

06:53.760 --> 06:56.000
with over 16,000 commits.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.440
And if you count, I guess, all of the mergers,

06:59.440 --> 07:01.240
it's more like 17,000.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.920
And 2000 different developers participated

07:03.920 --> 07:06.700
in this release of the Linux kernel.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.720
And it's not slowing down.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.860
5.14 has some big things in the works,

07:11.860 --> 07:14.520
including dropping its legacy IDE code.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.840
Sorry, Wes, your IDE disks are gonna have to go.

07:16.840 --> 07:20.200
Oh, no, not my legacy NAS.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.440
I thought you'd be worried about your CD-ROM writers.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.860
But Neil says that's not actually true.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.540
We're not losing IDE support.

07:25.540 --> 07:28.200
This is the completion of, gosh,

07:28.200 --> 07:31.800
I think like 20 years of effort to kill this code.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.760
So a long, long, long time ago,

07:33.760 --> 07:38.760
the code around supporting what we call IDE drives,

07:38.880 --> 07:41.760
which formerly I think are called parallel ATA

07:41.760 --> 07:45.560
or PATA drives, was unified with the code

07:45.560 --> 07:48.020
that manages SATA drives.

07:48.020 --> 07:50.620
And so that's all through the same subsystem.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.860
That's why you tend to,

07:52.860 --> 07:57.580
that's why you see SDA for drives,

07:57.580 --> 07:59.120
even on older systems,

07:59.120 --> 08:04.120
like the legacy IDE subsystem uses the older HDA

08:05.520 --> 08:07.320
or HDB or HDC.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.760
We haven't seen those in forever.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.600
And that's what this code controls.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.880
I believe, I'm not totally certain.

08:13.880 --> 08:17.200
I think the only thing that still uses the legacy IDE code

08:17.200 --> 08:19.920
is the M68K port in Linux.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.200
All the rest of it uses the newer stuff.

08:22.200 --> 08:26.880
So the M68K code was ported to the new stuff.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.980
And so the legacy code can go away.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.440
Let me tell you something.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.320
Linux was the best back when we called it HDA.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.800
It's been crap since then.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.080
No, actually, I'm also really excited to see

08:37.080 --> 08:39.280
ButterFS is getting more performance tuning

08:39.280 --> 08:42.520
and other solid improvements in 5.14.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.580
We talked about this one before,

08:43.580 --> 08:46.420
but the Raspberry Pi 400 is getting mainlined.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.760
Dell's been working on privacy screen support

08:48.760 --> 08:50.440
for a long time.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.440
That's gonna make it into 5.14.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.280
Whoa.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.640
And Intel and AMD CPUs are getting some nice solid features

08:57.640 --> 08:59.080
that are getting added,

08:59.080 --> 09:02.760
including Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4 support.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.520
Plus don't think you have to be a file system hipster

09:05.520 --> 09:07.280
to get some goodies in 5.14.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.520
No, no, XFS improvements for large scale deployments

09:10.520 --> 09:12.040
are coming down the line.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.160
And one thing that really caught my eye,

09:14.160 --> 09:17.040
latency reduction work for USB audio devices.

09:17.040 --> 09:17.880
Hey.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.140
Yeah, that's exciting.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.200
And you combine that with the improvements

09:21.200 --> 09:22.640
we're seeing in PipeWire.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.100
PipeWire is getting really great.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.800
They've done some big improvements

09:26.800 --> 09:28.640
with their jack stability.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.880
And you combine that with a low latency kernel

09:30.880 --> 09:33.880
and the improvements that are going into 5.14.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.960
Early, early tests are seeing latency,

09:37.960 --> 09:39.220
audio latencies in numbers

09:39.220 --> 09:41.820
that we've never achieved before in Linux right now.

09:41.820 --> 09:44.280
Hackaday has been experimenting

09:44.280 --> 09:45.720
and they're seeing two milliseconds

09:45.720 --> 09:47.060
in the entire chain right now,

09:47.060 --> 09:49.880
which would be record breaking for Linux.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.520
And that's not even with the 5.14 improvements yet.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.360
Wow.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.300
Yeah, very excited about that.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.220
Did you see the other kind of,

09:57.220 --> 10:00.060
I don't know if this is really a feature of software

10:00.060 --> 10:02.200
so much, but it's gonna make PipeWire

10:02.200 --> 10:05.000
at least more intelligent with Bluetooth devices.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.560
Oh yeah, this is kind of a big deal

10:07.560 --> 10:11.280
they're talking about at least with the release of 0.3.31,

10:11.280 --> 10:14.560
which is a database of quote unquote,

10:14.560 --> 10:17.200
weird Bluetooth hardware.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.100
That way PipeWire can apply specific tweaks

10:20.100 --> 10:21.360
for each of those devices.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.720
It's basically a bunch of stuff

10:22.720 --> 10:24.840
that Android has figured out over the years

10:24.840 --> 10:26.720
that now PipeWire can take advantage of

10:26.720 --> 10:28.680
to hopefully work a little bit better.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.080
And I think it underscores

10:30.080 --> 10:31.960
the one little nice benefit of PipeWire

10:31.960 --> 10:34.960
that I didn't really appreciate or tune into at first

10:34.960 --> 10:36.520
was all this Bluetooth stuff.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.720
It's turning into a really nice implementation

10:38.720 --> 10:41.120
and a place where all of it can just work

10:41.120 --> 10:42.740
instead of sort of the weird like,

10:42.740 --> 10:44.240
oh, you can't do it in also anymore,

10:44.240 --> 10:45.960
only you have to rely on Pulse.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.120
It was just a mess.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.880
It's such a practical solution,

10:49.880 --> 10:51.800
but yet it's not really been done yet.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.120
And it's, well, we're gonna make a list

10:54.120 --> 10:55.540
and we're gonna make a list of stuff

10:55.540 --> 10:57.720
that just needs tweaks to work right.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.440
And we'll catch probably 80%

11:00.440 --> 11:03.120
of the most popular devices out there.

11:03.120 --> 11:06.200
And what they've done is they've grabbed

11:06.200 --> 11:09.880
the original data set from Android.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.440
So they have a massive data set

11:11.440 --> 11:14.840
of popular headset devices to start with.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.920
So it's just like a ton of well-supported,

11:17.920 --> 11:20.680
well-known headset devices are just gonna work

11:20.680 --> 11:22.640
with these out of the box,

11:22.640 --> 11:24.560
assuming you can get it connected to your system

11:24.560 --> 11:27.780
in PipeWire 3.3.1, in 0.3.3.1.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.560
That is really great to see.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.000
And the project just continues to crank out

11:33.000 --> 11:35.140
really, really solid releases.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.880
So a big congratulations to them.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.680
We love seeing this kind of stuff.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.080
Keep up the great work.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

11:45.400 --> 11:48.960
Go there to get $100 in credit and you support the show.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.720
Linode is how we spin everything up in the cloud these days.

11:51.720 --> 11:52.920
And when it's crazy hot here

11:52.920 --> 11:55.260
and I had to shut down everything,

11:55.260 --> 11:58.040
I was so glad Linode had my infrastructure

11:58.040 --> 12:01.200
for the listeners covered in their data centers.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.440
They got 11 of them around the world

12:02.440 --> 12:04.160
and they've got air conditioning.

12:04.160 --> 12:05.880
I mean, they've been around since 2003.

12:05.880 --> 12:06.880
So they've been able to build

12:06.880 --> 12:09.180
like just these ultimate network pipelines

12:09.180 --> 12:10.160
between their data centers.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.860
They've become their own ISP

12:11.860 --> 12:13.600
and they're able to invest in machinery

12:13.600 --> 12:16.200
that is just killer performance.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.920
So these are sort of like the top level reasons

12:17.920 --> 12:19.520
why I love Linode.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.920
But you know, Linode was so receptive to the idea

12:21.920 --> 12:24.340
of the Linode on the road road trip.

12:24.340 --> 12:25.960
The idea kind of was like a baby seed

12:25.960 --> 12:27.400
of like, hey, let's do a meetup.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.320
And then it kind of widened into a conversation

12:29.320 --> 12:33.040
where Linode was like, you know, we've got a few ideas.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.440
And they have been instrumental

12:35.440 --> 12:37.880
in creating what I think is gonna be

12:37.880 --> 12:40.600
a super important team reunion for the JB crew.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.260
I think it's gonna be just totally critical

12:42.260 --> 12:45.400
because we haven't seen each other really

12:45.400 --> 12:48.320
since the whole transition to going independent

12:48.320 --> 12:50.260
because the pandemic's been going on

12:50.260 --> 12:53.200
and we've all been sort of isolated in our homes

12:53.200 --> 12:56.000
and we haven't had that human to human connection

12:56.000 --> 12:59.600
that makes working together a lot more possible,

12:59.600 --> 13:01.080
but also I think just sort of regenerates

13:01.080 --> 13:02.520
our creative energy.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.560
Linode's gonna make that trip possible.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.800
And I am so grateful for them

13:05.800 --> 13:08.560
because they're supporting our network,

13:08.560 --> 13:09.740
they're making these shows possible,

13:09.740 --> 13:12.960
they're making this reunion and our meetups possible,

13:12.960 --> 13:14.360
but they've also supported things

13:14.360 --> 13:16.840
like Linux Fest Northwest for years,

13:16.840 --> 13:20.220
the Kubuntu project, there's a list on their website.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.000
There's a lot of projects they've been involved with

13:22.000 --> 13:24.480
for over the years and that's really how I met them

13:24.480 --> 13:26.440
the first time was at,

13:26.440 --> 13:27.960
I think it might've been Texas Linux Fest,

13:27.960 --> 13:30.940
it was some event I was at and they had a booth there.

13:30.940 --> 13:34.160
And when some of the other vendors weren't taking the time

13:34.160 --> 13:37.160
to really do all of the things necessary

13:37.160 --> 13:40.380
to have a good booth, Linode was there enjoying it.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.120
They were just enjoying it, you know?

13:42.120 --> 13:44.120
And that was when I was, that was a couple of years ago.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.720
I was like, yeah, I'm gonna try out Linode.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.120
That experience.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.480
And then it transitioned into kind of a passion

13:50.480 --> 13:52.440
and now here they are supporting our independent work

13:52.440 --> 13:54.400
and making our team reunion possible.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.520
And they just have such a great suite of options

13:56.520 --> 13:58.520
from object storage to super fast systems

13:58.520 --> 14:02.740
to $5 a month rigs and they're 30 to 50% cheaper

14:02.740 --> 14:04.680
than the major cloud providers like AWS

14:04.680 --> 14:06.160
and they've been around longer than AWS.

14:06.160 --> 14:07.960
They started years before them

14:07.960 --> 14:09.920
and they do everything with Linux.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.400
They are all in, everything they're doing with Linux

14:12.400 --> 14:14.520
and that means you can take it as deep as you want.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.920
If you wanna build it up from scratch

14:15.920 --> 14:17.320
and build the whole stack, you can,

14:17.320 --> 14:19.880
or if you just wanna do the one app click deployment thing,

14:19.880 --> 14:21.040
you can do that as well.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.080
And they support a lot

14:22.080 --> 14:23.440
of your infrastructure management tools

14:23.440 --> 14:25.800
like Terraform and Kubernetes and Ansible.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.680
So you can pop it into your existing infrastructure

14:27.680 --> 14:28.520
with ease.

14:28.520 --> 14:31.520
So go get that $100 credit and support the show.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.280
It's a really nice way to get going

14:33.280 --> 14:35.220
and help your buddies here make a podcast.

14:35.220 --> 14:37.360
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.420
So Deepin has a release this week

14:42.420 --> 14:45.580
and we actually haven't really discussed Deepin much

14:45.580 --> 14:48.940
but 20.2.2 came out this week

14:48.940 --> 14:51.840
and it introduces a lot of interesting features

14:51.840 --> 14:53.360
that caught my attention.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.380
And I have to be fully transparent with you guys.

14:55.380 --> 14:57.280
One of the reasons I haven't talked about Deepin a lot

14:57.280 --> 15:00.480
on the show is I don't fully understand

15:00.480 --> 15:02.880
the owner model behind Deepin.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.880
I've read their EULA and I've read their privacy policy

15:05.880 --> 15:07.960
and everything seems good there.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.960
I've monitored the network traffic to a degree.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.320
It's only been like 24 hours

15:11.320 --> 15:13.320
and I haven't seen anything sketchy

15:13.320 --> 15:15.800
but I don't really totally fully appreciate

15:15.800 --> 15:18.920
and understand that whole relationship there.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.760
And so I've been hesitant just to cover it on air.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.520
But after today, I couldn't hold my tongue anymore.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.440
I mean, I'm gonna make that disclaimer to you

15:27.440 --> 15:29.240
and it's something I'm going to investigate more

15:29.240 --> 15:32.080
and it's something I recommend you investigate.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.600
However, there is clearly some neat stuff happening here.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.060
So what Wes and I did today is we decided to divide

15:38.060 --> 15:39.640
and conquer the work on the show

15:39.640 --> 15:43.480
because we wanna cover both Deepin and Fuchsia.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.620
So Wes went off into Fuchsia town

15:45.620 --> 15:47.640
and I went off into Deepin town

15:47.640 --> 15:50.200
and I thought I'd come back and tell Wes

15:50.200 --> 15:53.800
that it was cutesy and it had a nice little UI

15:53.800 --> 15:56.980
on top of like Plasma or something, but move on.

15:56.980 --> 15:58.200
I thought that's what I was gonna come here.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.040
I really did.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.200
That was my bias towards this.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.760
That's what I'm expecting.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.440
Is that not what you're doing?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.560
I'm gonna start with what I would normally

16:05.560 --> 16:06.400
end the review with.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.080
And that is, I think this is the distribution

16:09.080 --> 16:11.880
with some disclaimers I'm about to make

16:11.880 --> 16:13.600
that people should look at and consider giving

16:13.600 --> 16:15.340
to new users of Linux who are just looking

16:15.340 --> 16:16.440
for a Windows replacement.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.680
They're not necessarily looking to become

16:17.680 --> 16:19.640
a quote unquote Linux user.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.680
And they want something that is fancier

16:22.680 --> 16:23.740
than say Windows 11.

16:23.740 --> 16:24.580
And I mean it.

16:24.580 --> 16:25.880
And what they've done now in Deepin

16:25.880 --> 16:28.320
is a brand new app store that includes

16:28.320 --> 16:31.120
the ability to install Android apps.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.980
So they're right there with Windows 11

16:32.980 --> 16:34.600
on that feature as well.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.500
Now in my version, does not work at the moment.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.880
And I'm gonna continue to play with that.

16:38.880 --> 16:42.080
But that wasn't really why I downloaded this distro.

16:42.080 --> 16:44.220
Deepin is also the first Chinese distribution

16:44.220 --> 16:45.800
to support Secure Boot.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.560
And they've been working with Microsoft

16:47.560 --> 16:48.480
to get that signed.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.320
Interesting.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.600
That adds a layer to your conversation around

16:51.600 --> 16:52.760
trust in some sense.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.600
Yeah.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.360
It's not just you making some assessments about them.

16:55.360 --> 16:56.920
At some level, Microsoft is too.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.320
Whether you trust Microsoft, that's another question.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.160
But it's a point anyway.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.120
And you know what else, Wes,

17:02.120 --> 17:03.440
is it's something we need to kind of start

17:03.440 --> 17:05.600
paying attention to more as Windows 11

17:05.600 --> 17:06.960
is gonna force this issue.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.600
And so Linux distributions are gonna need

17:08.600 --> 17:11.120
to have Secure Boot support for a lot of Windows 11

17:11.120 --> 17:12.040
compatible hardware.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.960
Especially if you're targeting new users, right?

17:13.960 --> 17:14.800
Right.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.360
So Deepin checks that box.

17:16.360 --> 17:19.120
And then they have a nice calendar application,

17:19.120 --> 17:21.920
which God, that's like giving a glass of water

17:21.920 --> 17:23.920
to a man in the desert when you're on Linux.

17:23.920 --> 17:28.640
They have a really, really clean, clean, consistent UI

17:28.640 --> 17:32.240
across all of their default album, draw, image viewer,

17:32.240 --> 17:33.860
mail applications.

17:33.860 --> 17:36.400
Fact, I took some screenshots of what I thought

17:36.400 --> 17:37.800
were some of its UI highlights,

17:37.800 --> 17:39.940
and I put them in an imager album

17:39.940 --> 17:41.080
that I'll have linked in the show notes

17:41.080 --> 17:44.000
and I've just put in the IRC.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.360
And their desktop, their Deepin desktop,

17:46.360 --> 17:50.840
which is their own thing, is pretty special.

17:50.840 --> 17:51.940
It's pretty unique.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.720
This latest version's pretty great.

17:53.720 --> 17:57.720
And they're really clever and polite

17:57.720 --> 18:00.360
about the way they ask you if you wanna go

18:00.360 --> 18:04.360
into total efficiency mode or would you like eye candy.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.760
And they'll walk you through it in a way

18:05.760 --> 18:08.060
that is totally approachable to either get a system

18:08.060 --> 18:10.740
that has all of the fancy turned up

18:10.740 --> 18:14.680
or is just really kind of lean, mean on the GPU.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.520
And I liked that a lot.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.440
The Deepin menu is clean.

18:19.440 --> 18:20.920
It's very simple.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.920
The most recently installed applications

18:22.920 --> 18:25.020
are highlighted with a blue dot.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.120
Your most frequently run applications are in a list,

18:28.120 --> 18:30.160
most frequent at the top.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.680
And then of course, things are also sorted by category.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.880
The task bar is the cleanest little system bar

18:36.880 --> 18:41.440
I have ever seen in an operating system, not in Linux,

18:41.440 --> 18:43.160
in a desktop operating system.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.020
They just nail it so hard.

18:45.020 --> 18:46.860
Everybody needs to steal what they're doing.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.320
It's clean, it's simple,

18:48.320 --> 18:50.920
it's easy to see the icons in the system tray.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.720
They've taken the best of what macOS

18:52.720 --> 18:54.400
and what GNOME 40 is attempting to do

18:54.400 --> 18:57.960
with virtual desktop management and multitasking overview,

18:57.960 --> 18:59.000
and they've nailed it.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.200
It's easy and simple to move windows

19:01.200 --> 19:02.460
between virtual desktops.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.880
They use a vertical layout,

19:03.880 --> 19:05.280
but the way the vertical layout works,

19:05.280 --> 19:07.760
you can see all of the applications

19:07.760 --> 19:09.380
and you can move them easily.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.680
The terminal is clean,

19:10.680 --> 19:12.380
it's consistent with the rest of the UI,

19:12.380 --> 19:15.300
and it gives me more functionality and tweaking

19:15.300 --> 19:17.220
than GNOME Shell does,

19:17.220 --> 19:19.760
but not like a crazy amount like console does.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.040
It like just hits that sweet spot.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.280
Happy medium, huh?

19:22.280 --> 19:23.900
And then the system monitor

19:23.900 --> 19:26.080
is one of the best dang looking system monitors

19:26.080 --> 19:27.040
out there, Wes.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.840
Yeah, I'm looking at this right now and sexy.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.680
Yes, I mean, it's really well done.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.920
The whole thing really comes together.

19:34.920 --> 19:35.760
Their appearance,

19:35.760 --> 19:38.680
configuration and personalization is fantastic.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.160
You can choose between light mode, auto,

19:41.160 --> 19:43.000
if you wanted to switch, dark mode.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.240
They support accent colors,

19:44.240 --> 19:46.120
like is coming in elementary six.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.280
They let you dial up and down the transparency

19:48.280 --> 19:50.780
and the window effects with simple controls.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.420
You can even turn off the rounded corners

19:53.420 --> 19:54.940
or make them just slightly less rounded,

19:54.940 --> 19:57.960
but it's all done in a way that's so clean.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.800
It makes the other configurator screens

19:59.800 --> 20:02.480
on other distributions look complicated

20:02.480 --> 20:04.760
while giving you more options.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.480
I mean, I'm telling you, this is so slick

20:07.480 --> 20:09.840
and it's got built in backup options

20:09.840 --> 20:12.540
into the system settings that are crazy easy to use.

20:12.540 --> 20:15.640
The file manager starts really big and clear,

20:15.640 --> 20:17.220
but then can be kind of refined

20:17.220 --> 20:19.700
into a more typical power users file manager.

20:19.700 --> 20:21.100
Again, striking a great balance

20:21.100 --> 20:24.640
between configuration options and not overdoing it

20:24.640 --> 20:26.900
and also making those configuration options easy

20:26.900 --> 20:27.740
and approachable.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.520
And honestly, somehow they lay out in a way

20:29.520 --> 20:32.040
that makes it easier visually to go through the list

20:32.040 --> 20:34.280
and decipher what options are available.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.160
It makes it more approachable that way.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.960
And it's all running on top of Debian

20:37.960 --> 20:40.160
and something else they do that's kind of fun

20:40.160 --> 20:41.400
is they ship it with this,

20:41.400 --> 20:43.080
what they call dual kernel mode.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.440
Dual kernel mode, huh?

20:45.440 --> 20:46.460
Yeah, how about this trick?

20:46.460 --> 20:48.840
Two kernels are installed at the same time.

20:48.840 --> 20:52.520
They by default are using like a more conservative LTS kernel

20:52.520 --> 20:54.160
but in the grub advanced menu,

20:54.160 --> 20:55.560
you can choose a newer kernel

20:55.560 --> 20:57.720
with better newer hardware support.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.480
And it'll just boot that and everything works just great.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.960
And you know, the Deepin package manager,

21:01.960 --> 21:05.720
which is apt with their own repos, keeps it all up to date.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.920
Oh, so it's not like you have to do a one time,

21:07.920 --> 21:10.680
point in time pick, like, I mean, they're going LTS

21:10.680 --> 21:12.360
or, you know, something a little newer.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.080
No, you can choose as per boot if you want.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.360
Yeah, and I tried swapping between them

21:16.360 --> 21:18.080
and I think you need the later one

21:18.080 --> 21:19.080
for the Android app support.

21:19.080 --> 21:22.200
So I just went with the later one, cause why not?

21:22.200 --> 21:23.860
And then, you know, I don't know how that's gonna work out

21:23.860 --> 21:24.700
because like I said,

21:24.700 --> 21:26.600
the software center never quite worked right for me.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.520
That's not why I'm using this distro though.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.520
And there was still parts of the software center

21:31.520 --> 21:33.280
of the UI that are in Chinese.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.680
When you launch the browser, which is based on Chrome,

21:35.680 --> 21:38.000
the latest version of Chrome, when you launch that,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.640
you get the Baidu search engine,

21:39.640 --> 21:40.880
which gives you results in Chinese.

21:40.880 --> 21:44.320
So you definitely would need to, and this is my disclaimer,

21:44.320 --> 21:47.400
besides just research the back of the company,

21:47.400 --> 21:49.720
but all of that, but you also would need to tweak

21:49.720 --> 21:51.080
some of this stuff for a new and new user.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.720
Cause some of it comes up in Chinese

21:52.720 --> 21:54.280
and you have to maybe switch the search engine

21:54.280 --> 21:57.440
to your preferred search engine, which is obviously Bing,

21:57.440 --> 22:00.440
and then tweak those kinds of things.

22:00.440 --> 22:03.040
But I imagine as every release goes on with Deepin,

22:03.040 --> 22:04.900
these problems become less and less

22:04.900 --> 22:06.920
because I have followed the distro for a while.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.400
I just haven't talked about it a lot.

22:08.400 --> 22:11.480
And these items have slowly been getting corrected

22:11.480 --> 22:13.260
and it's been making it more and more approachable

22:13.260 --> 22:15.120
to a Western audience for a while now.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.060
And it's been trending in that direction.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.440
So you'd have to tweak some of those things

22:19.440 --> 22:21.920
and before a new user could sit down

22:21.920 --> 22:24.360
and really fully use it and have a great experience,

22:24.360 --> 22:28.300
but it truly feels like something different and fresh.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.280
It feels very well thought out.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.880
It is a new experience to the face of Linux

22:32.880 --> 22:35.000
and it installs very fast.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.360
It's probably the fastest Linux distro I've ever installed.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.240
And it's probably the fastest setup time

22:40.240 --> 22:43.360
because I was just on board to experience Deepin

22:43.360 --> 22:44.760
as they have it by default.

22:44.760 --> 22:45.720
I didn't want to tweak it much.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.120
I just turned on dark mode

22:47.120 --> 22:48.960
and then pretty much was happy there.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.400
And then when I'd open up each individual application,

22:51.400 --> 22:53.920
I'd maybe have to make some kind of tweaks,

22:53.920 --> 22:56.800
maybe to the file manager or to the terminal,

22:56.800 --> 22:59.160
but it'd take me about 15 seconds and then I'm done.

22:59.160 --> 23:02.440
And I was up and going in this thing in probably an hour.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.160
Yeah, okay, that's not bad.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.320
It's a fresh take.

23:05.320 --> 23:08.200
And you can absolutely use the Deepin desktop

23:08.200 --> 23:09.520
on other distributions.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.640
I'm not saying you only have to use Deepin Linux

23:11.640 --> 23:13.560
to try out the Deepin desktop.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.600
What are the advantages there?

23:15.600 --> 23:17.480
I'm curious how that experience might differ

23:17.480 --> 23:19.360
to just getting the benefits, the surface level,

23:19.360 --> 23:21.520
sort of DE experience versus something

23:21.520 --> 23:22.720
like that dual kernel stuff,

23:22.720 --> 23:24.680
which I imagine you need the whole system to have.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.200
Yeah, I mean, to me, it's like akin

23:26.200 --> 23:28.240
to running Pantheon on Fedora or Arch.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.000
It's like you get some of the experience,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.120
but it's not quite the full representation

23:33.120 --> 23:35.320
and it's not definitely what they intended.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.720
So I wanted to try their take on it.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.800
I'm kind of, I think, in part of this, Wes,

23:39.800 --> 23:42.400
when I do these tests, I think part of me is hoping

23:42.400 --> 23:44.640
to just fall in love with a Debian based Linux

23:44.640 --> 23:47.080
that I could just use for a long time.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.360
A base you're comfortable with,

23:48.360 --> 23:50.720
but something that keeps you happy on the surface.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.760
Yeah, but still none of them have quite scratched the itch

23:53.760 --> 23:55.960
like Fedora is recently.

23:55.960 --> 24:00.200
That really seems to be with DNF and toolbox.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.040
And then the concept of just really close to rolling,

24:04.040 --> 24:04.880
but not quite there.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.040
I like their term of leading edge.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.360
That's where for me, as my personal desktop,

24:10.360 --> 24:11.520
I'm gonna, I think stick there

24:11.520 --> 24:13.760
because I like being pretty current.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.160
I think it's overall, it's better

24:15.160 --> 24:17.080
if in the free software ecosystem,

24:17.080 --> 24:19.800
if you're fairly current and you're not lagging behind.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.760
And sometimes Debian does tend to lag behind

24:21.760 --> 24:22.600
in certain areas.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.920
And while Deepin makes up for that in some places,

24:25.920 --> 24:30.680
ultimately it's not quite the workstation recipe I want,

24:30.680 --> 24:33.760
but I wasn't just being obnoxious when I said earlier,

24:33.760 --> 24:37.360
I think this could be the distro for new Linux users.

24:37.360 --> 24:40.920
Right now, if you're recommending Linux Mint to people,

24:40.920 --> 24:43.800
then you're who I'm directly addressing at this moment.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.760
I want you to try Deepin out and take a look at it

24:46.760 --> 24:49.440
and see if maybe you could start recommending this to people.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.720
Now I'm not saying you have to change

24:50.720 --> 24:52.600
and Mint could be working great,

24:52.600 --> 24:54.000
but there's something really special here

24:54.000 --> 24:56.560
because it's a real fresh take on the desktop

24:56.560 --> 24:58.240
that feels more modern

24:58.240 --> 25:01.040
than what Apple or Microsoft are putting out right now.

25:01.040 --> 25:06.040
Even with their Mozarati coming out and the Windows 11,

25:06.240 --> 25:07.960
I think it feels like it's still ahead

25:07.960 --> 25:09.160
of where they're going.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.400
And the team is really putting a lot of thought into it.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.760
And whenever you see a Linux distribution

25:13.760 --> 25:15.920
that's getting that much love and care and thought

25:15.920 --> 25:16.760
put into it,

25:16.760 --> 25:18.840
and they're doing something new and fresh like that,

25:18.840 --> 25:20.520
it's worth anybody's time to check out.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.160
But if you're in right now,

25:22.160 --> 25:24.440
and you're in that area where you're a Mint recommender,

25:24.440 --> 25:26.320
think Deepin has to be on your try list.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.240
Yeah, sounds like maybe there's some ideas over there

25:28.240 --> 25:31.480
that need to be more widely enjoyed and shared

25:31.480 --> 25:32.360
and thought about,

25:32.360 --> 25:35.400
and that injection of some of those fresh ideas

25:35.400 --> 25:38.960
into perhaps an otherwise stale Linux ecosystem.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.840
I'm gonna stick with it for another week,

25:40.840 --> 25:43.840
even though I think ultimately I'll be back on Fedora.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.320
I have it on my ThinkPad,

25:45.320 --> 25:47.280
and I think I'll probably reload that.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.720
I had Windows 11 on there,

25:48.720 --> 25:50.920
so I'm kind of in this weird area right now.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.840
I was trying out Windows 11 for Coder Radio,

25:53.840 --> 25:56.440
which I'm gonna talk about tomorrow in Coder Radio.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.560
And then I thought,

25:57.560 --> 25:59.080
well, now that I'm done with Windows 11,

25:59.080 --> 26:00.360
I'll try Deepin out.

26:00.360 --> 26:01.240
And that's been really great.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.000
And I think I'm gonna stick with it for another week,

26:03.000 --> 26:05.920
but then I've got to make that decision after that.

26:05.920 --> 26:08.200
Think I'll probably go back to a Fedora distro,

26:08.200 --> 26:11.320
but I don't know if it's gonna be a Plasma Spin

26:11.320 --> 26:12.320
or the GNOME one.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.080
I just, I'm in this weird phase right now.

26:14.080 --> 26:16.240
So while I let that thought simmer,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.480
I'm gonna enjoy Deepin for just a bit longer.

26:18.480 --> 26:22.600
Now, Wes, we got some cleaning up to do around here.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.440
This is ridiculous.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.880
Ooh, yeah, messy.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.720
Yeah, I stormed out of here and just made a mess.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.960
Like right here, look at this.

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
It's just laying on the floor.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.800
This says right here,

26:31.800 --> 26:34.760
hey, meetups, two of them coming up.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.440
One in Denver and one in Salt Lake City.

26:36.440 --> 26:39.880
Details are at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

26:39.880 --> 26:40.720
Let's go see.

26:40.720 --> 26:42.480
Are people signing up?

26:42.480 --> 26:43.640
Let's find out.

26:43.640 --> 26:46.000
I hope so, because, you know,

26:46.000 --> 26:49.240
otherwise, why are we going to Salt Lake City, right?

26:49.240 --> 26:52.120
Look, so far we have 20 that are going to Denver.

26:52.120 --> 26:52.960
Nice.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.320
And nine that are in Salt Lake City.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.800
I think that means those things are happening.

26:55.800 --> 26:56.800
That's awesome.

26:56.800 --> 26:57.920
Right there.

26:57.920 --> 26:58.760
Very nice.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.880
If you'd like to join us, get accounted.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.640
You know, be accounted for.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.680
Get counted.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.880
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.480
Our Telegram group's going right now, you know.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.520
That's where the conversation continues.

27:11.520 --> 27:12.680
The show wraps up.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.280
You can always send us an email.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.880
But every now and then, it's just a quick thing.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.720
You might want to grab,

27:16.720 --> 27:18.360
maybe one of us are hanging out in there at that moment.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.320
You want to grab us, something like that.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.240
We got a Telegram group.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.320
You go in there and do that.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.080
Jupiter Broadcasting.com slash Telegram.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.080
That's over there.

27:25.080 --> 27:28.440
Matrix Info Two is at our website, LinuxUnplugged.com.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.520
And then, of course, those emails

27:29.520 --> 27:32.160
at LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.400
And then the last little bit of housekeeping wisdom

27:35.400 --> 27:36.880
that I will depart with.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.240
Don't steal our wisdom.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.920
Yeah, wouldn't that be great, though?

27:39.920 --> 27:40.760
That'd be my power.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.320
That'd be a great superpower.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.920
So if I had a superpower,

27:43.920 --> 27:45.320
it would be that I would take wisdom

27:45.320 --> 27:46.160
and transmit it to you

27:46.160 --> 27:48.240
that Luplug is going on every Sunday.

27:48.240 --> 27:50.440
And that it is wise to attend the Luplug.

27:50.440 --> 27:52.760
Because hanging out with like-minded Linux users

27:52.760 --> 27:54.320
rejuvenates the soul in a way

27:54.320 --> 27:56.840
that even antisocial, inverted,

27:56.840 --> 27:58.800
like totally don't want to talk to people,

27:58.800 --> 27:59.960
people benefit from.

27:59.960 --> 28:00.800
How do I know that?

28:00.800 --> 28:02.240
Because I've done it and I've benefited from it.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.040
I don't want to get on a thing

28:04.040 --> 28:05.640
and talk to people I don't know on a Sunday.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.480
But you know what?

28:06.480 --> 28:07.320
Every single time I've done it,

28:07.320 --> 28:09.880
I've absolutely enjoyed the experience.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.040
It feeds you.

28:11.040 --> 28:12.920
And it happens every Sunday.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.840
LinuxUplug.com slash mumble, join our virtual log

28:15.840 --> 28:16.680
and hang out.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.440
And then, then you've got that mumble software all set up

28:19.440 --> 28:22.920
and you can join us here in the pod on a Tuesday.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.160
I'm sorry I called it pod.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.000
It's weird housekeeping.

28:25.000 --> 28:25.840
What can I say?

28:27.360 --> 28:29.480
All right, so we've got some fuchsia fears

28:29.480 --> 28:33.800
that I think reflect the thoughts of some of our listeners.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.560
Do you want to take this email from Mr. Light fixture?

28:36.560 --> 28:39.560
Mr. Light fixture wrote in.

28:39.560 --> 28:40.960
Hey, just wanted to write in

28:40.960 --> 28:44.040
because I know you people like to keep up with fuchsia.

28:44.040 --> 28:48.040
Did you know there's already a desktop OS based on fuchsia?

28:48.040 --> 28:51.760
It's called Dahlia OS and they have two additions.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.000
One based on the Zircon kernel

28:54.000 --> 28:57.040
and the other based on Linux.

28:57.040 --> 29:01.480
It's open source, has an eye candy desktop called Pangolin.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.320
And the devs seem to focus on flutter based apps

29:04.320 --> 29:07.880
as the main kind of programs on the system.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.040
If you did check it out,

29:09.040 --> 29:10.640
I'm curious to know your thoughts.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.080
Does it have potential?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.400
What does fuchsia on the desktop mean

29:14.400 --> 29:18.000
for Linux distros as we know them today?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.360
Could fuchsia supplant desktop Linux

29:20.360 --> 29:23.360
or even Chrome OS in the future?

29:23.360 --> 29:24.760
Big questions there, Chris.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.960
That's a good question.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
You and I have been kicking that around a little bit

29:27.960 --> 29:29.800
because we follow the development of fuchsia

29:29.800 --> 29:31.600
pretty closely for Linux action news.

29:31.600 --> 29:35.200
And there's more movement there than in the past.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.080
Google has recently rolled out fuchsia

29:37.080 --> 29:40.080
to the first generation Google Nest hubs.

29:40.080 --> 29:45.080
And they're positioning it very much as a modular OS

29:46.640 --> 29:48.040
that could work for IOT

29:48.040 --> 29:49.560
but eventually make its way up to phones

29:49.560 --> 29:52.680
and yeah, Chromebook style devices.

29:52.680 --> 29:56.920
And one wonders, what would that mean for Linux?

29:56.920 --> 29:58.960
You know, what is truly the concern there?

29:58.960 --> 30:02.440
Would it be necessarily useful in server workloads?

30:02.440 --> 30:04.680
You know, I don't know,

30:04.680 --> 30:07.240
but desktop workloads potentially,

30:07.240 --> 30:10.640
mobile workloads potentially.

30:10.640 --> 30:14.800
And if that's true, the ramifications of that

30:14.800 --> 30:19.000
could be a significant drop-off in kernel developers.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.600
Because when you look at a lot of the source code

30:22.600 --> 30:25.960
and development time coming into the Linux kernel right now

30:25.960 --> 30:28.240
and the things that are driving features

30:28.240 --> 30:30.840
like even having an LTS kernel,

30:30.840 --> 30:33.040
a lot of that comes from mobile right now.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.680
A good portion of that developer time

30:35.680 --> 30:38.680
comes from companies that are bringing up mobile support

30:38.680 --> 30:41.760
or fixing something so it's more efficient on mobile,

30:41.760 --> 30:44.520
which often has great, great effects too on desktop.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.440
You know, we get better power efficiency

30:46.440 --> 30:48.240
or we get something that comes along

30:48.240 --> 30:49.800
as a knock-on effect of that.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.520
And I think if you were successful,

30:51.520 --> 30:54.320
say in the Android marketplace,

30:54.320 --> 30:57.880
devices say five years from now have a fuchsia base

30:57.880 --> 31:01.040
and Chromebooks five years from now have a fuchsia base.

31:01.040 --> 31:04.040
I think the impact would not be directly felt

31:04.040 --> 31:05.320
by Linux users from that,

31:05.320 --> 31:08.200
but it would be a reduction in kernel development

31:08.200 --> 31:09.720
and contributors to the kernel.

31:09.720 --> 31:12.280
A lot of what happens at these huge scale companies

31:12.280 --> 31:14.200
is that kind of like custom development.

31:14.200 --> 31:17.120
We need X, we need a system that meets our needs here.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.880
And in the current times,

31:19.880 --> 31:21.680
that Linux is the easiest way to get that done.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.520
It makes the most sense.

31:22.520 --> 31:25.200
You can kind of leverage what other folks are doing,

31:25.200 --> 31:27.680
but there are also some impediments, right?

31:27.680 --> 31:29.320
Like Linux is an old kernel.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.000
It's got the design decisions it's made

31:31.000 --> 31:33.240
from a long time in computing.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.400
And sometimes you might have to, you know,

31:35.400 --> 31:36.480
go back and forth a little bit,

31:36.480 --> 31:38.280
look at some of the stuff like features

31:38.280 --> 31:40.840
in the Android kernels that have been hotly debated,

31:40.840 --> 31:43.080
whether they should or could be merged up to mainline,

31:43.080 --> 31:45.960
eventually did, some still haven't been.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.240
So there's also some friction there.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.640
And I think maybe some of the worry is that

31:49.640 --> 31:53.200
if fuchsia or something like it gets far enough along,

31:53.200 --> 31:54.760
the value proposition might change

31:54.760 --> 31:55.960
where Google or Facebook

31:55.960 --> 31:58.160
or some of these other big companies decide that,

31:58.160 --> 32:00.400
oh, hey, this OS over here,

32:00.400 --> 32:02.360
it's just easier for us to get what we need here

32:02.360 --> 32:04.080
because we don't need it to support

32:04.080 --> 32:05.120
all the hardware in the world

32:05.120 --> 32:06.760
or every possible type of computing, right?

32:06.760 --> 32:08.360
We have six different product lines.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.400
We need it to support that.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.200
And otherwise we don't care.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.640
Yeah, I think that is very reasonable.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.520
And it's not just maybe as simple as that.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.440
And we're gonna talk about more about this in a moment,

32:19.440 --> 32:22.600
but fuchsia being the modular OS that it is,

32:22.600 --> 32:25.520
it may be very simple to bring up fuchsia support

32:25.520 --> 32:28.280
on older hardware as well for compatibility purposes.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.760
That may be a very straightforward process

32:30.760 --> 32:33.120
with the way that fuchsia is designed.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.600
Maybe this is the context in which we talk about Dahlia OS,

32:36.600 --> 32:38.520
which is trying to kind of bring together

32:38.520 --> 32:42.440
the best of Linux and fuchsia into a desktop experience.

32:42.440 --> 32:44.600
And so we thought let's have Wes try this out

32:44.600 --> 32:46.960
and see how practical and realistic this is,

32:46.960 --> 32:49.200
is maybe a one day Chrome OS replacement

32:49.200 --> 32:50.360
or something like that.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.880
All right, well, right out of the gate,

32:52.880 --> 32:55.240
it's still super early days for fuchsia

32:55.240 --> 32:56.800
and the whole Zircon kernel.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.680
And because of that and because of their goals,

32:59.680 --> 33:03.160
Dahlia OS is looking to provide a fast and stable experience

33:03.160 --> 33:05.720
on nearly every computer, at least so they say,

33:05.720 --> 33:07.640
and including from their little notes here,

33:07.640 --> 33:10.000
including the 2004 desktop tower,

33:10.000 --> 33:13.240
all the way up to the latest generation of mobile notebooks.

33:13.240 --> 33:16.160
So right now they've got a dual kernel approach

33:16.160 --> 33:18.680
so that users with the newer hardware in theory

33:18.680 --> 33:21.240
at some point would be on Zircon,

33:21.240 --> 33:23.600
but to get all that legacy software support,

33:23.600 --> 33:27.840
all those older devices, they plan to use good old Linux.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.040
So it's interesting, maybe it represents

33:30.040 --> 33:32.040
an approach of the future, a bridge,

33:32.040 --> 33:34.960
but right now the only thing that I could actually get

33:34.960 --> 33:36.880
to boot was the Linux version.

33:36.880 --> 33:41.000
Okay, and like we were kind of alluding to earlier,

33:41.000 --> 33:42.600
it doesn't seem like that's a weird

33:42.600 --> 33:44.120
kind of stretch for fuchsia.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.480
It seems like you kind of can plug and unplug

33:47.480 --> 33:49.240
these different parts of the fuchsia stack

33:49.240 --> 33:51.840
and plug in a Linux kernel to get access

33:51.840 --> 33:53.520
to device drivers and whatnot.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.080
How does that work exactly?

33:55.080 --> 33:55.920
Well, I mean, I think it depends

33:55.920 --> 33:58.720
on what we're talking about in the fuchsia stack.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.880
So one thing here about Dahlia is, yeah,

34:00.880 --> 34:02.480
a lot of it is targeting Flutter

34:02.480 --> 34:04.760
and Flutter and Dart, of course,

34:04.760 --> 34:06.560
work just fine on Linux, right?

34:06.560 --> 34:09.200
It's got its own render, it's got its own setup.

34:09.200 --> 34:12.120
So that makes that part of the stack flexible.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.920
And then on the Zircon side, it's just so new, right?

34:15.920 --> 34:17.680
Like from the developer perspective,

34:17.680 --> 34:18.920
it's just exciting to see something

34:18.920 --> 34:20.000
where you can make changes,

34:20.000 --> 34:22.280
you can learn from your past mistakes.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.840
And because it has this history of being quite minimal

34:24.840 --> 34:28.960
and leaving a lot of things out of the kernel,

34:28.960 --> 34:30.040
especially with some of its more

34:30.040 --> 34:32.360
asynchronous non-blocking nature,

34:32.360 --> 34:35.680
it seems like if needed, there's a lot of areas

34:35.680 --> 34:38.080
where Zircon could be extended to support stuff

34:38.080 --> 34:41.040
that Linux previously did if it actually needed to.

34:41.040 --> 34:41.880
Yeah.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.240
One aspect here is because of like

34:43.240 --> 34:45.360
the asynchronous non-blocking stuff,

34:45.360 --> 34:47.280
it might make it really easy for system calls

34:47.280 --> 34:50.040
to be serviced on a different core

34:50.040 --> 34:51.720
than say the one making the call.

34:51.720 --> 34:54.200
Just some other sort of like nitty gritty details like that

34:54.200 --> 34:57.640
that make me wonder if Zircon might end up

34:57.640 --> 35:00.320
being a better fit for some of these new architectures

35:00.320 --> 35:02.520
we're seeing with more custom different cores

35:02.520 --> 35:06.120
than say Linux and being targeted at general computing.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.880
I think that is part of the concern

35:08.880 --> 35:11.480
that's gnawing at some of us long timers just a little bit.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.840
Like we know in the back of our mind,

35:12.840 --> 35:15.360
it's a low threat likely on the desktop

35:15.360 --> 35:18.240
and in its current state for sure, sounds like.

35:18.240 --> 35:23.240
However, the thing about Fuchsia is the whole entire thing,

35:23.240 --> 35:26.360
the entire OS stack is being built

35:26.360 --> 35:31.360
with Google's lessons learned with Android and Linux

35:31.360 --> 35:32.920
and all of that.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.340
Like they're taking, oh, this didn't work.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.800
So let's build it this way.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.040
And they're really clever people there at Google.

35:39.040 --> 35:42.440
And so I think we all kind of implicitly know

35:42.440 --> 35:43.960
they've solved some problems

35:43.960 --> 35:45.720
that are gonna be appealing to developers

35:45.720 --> 35:48.560
and Google has the might and the scale

35:48.560 --> 35:50.840
to really push something if they want.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.480
And those things are concerning

35:52.480 --> 35:55.600
because if it's gonna save developers time and money

35:55.600 --> 35:57.840
and if the simplicity means it's quicker

35:57.840 --> 35:59.880
and perhaps a little more secure,

35:59.880 --> 36:01.000
that's gonna be very attractive.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.040
Like for example, the Zircon kernel only supports ARM

36:04.040 --> 36:06.240
and x86 and 64 bit versions of that.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.120
Like they don't have to mess

36:07.120 --> 36:11.360
with all the old legacy architectures that Linux supports.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.520
Like they don't have to play.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.440
That's not in their wheelhouse of targeted devices.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.080
They just, they don't have to do that.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.000
There's a lot of stuff like that in the security world too,

36:19.000 --> 36:20.760
right, where there's just some more flexibility

36:20.760 --> 36:23.080
or compromises that were chosen a different way

36:23.080 --> 36:24.960
in the Linux world that they can choose

36:24.960 --> 36:27.080
a different path on in Zircon.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.680
So when you're using it, Wes, do you get a sense

36:28.680 --> 36:31.280
that they're building it to work as a workstation

36:31.280 --> 36:33.560
because in the screenshots that you have linked

36:33.560 --> 36:37.000
in the show notes, I see that they have like a VM manager

36:37.000 --> 36:38.720
and stuff for virtual machines.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.040
Yes, so again, we should be clear

36:40.040 --> 36:41.840
at what different things we're talking about here.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.600
This is going back to Dahlia OS,

36:43.600 --> 36:46.680
which I think in some sense is a hedge.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.040
So, you know, we're worried about future.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.000
We're worried about Zircon and some of these things.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.520
Part of that worry to my mind is,

36:53.520 --> 36:55.200
I mean, we're not worried that it's not open

36:55.200 --> 36:57.160
because of course it is, you know,

36:57.160 --> 36:58.280
at least it's open source.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.200
But one thing that's been so amazing about Linux

37:01.200 --> 37:03.920
is that it's community driven, right?

37:03.920 --> 37:07.360
Like it's not just, yes, as we mentioned a second ago,

37:07.360 --> 37:08.520
there are some huge companies

37:08.520 --> 37:10.080
that have major influences on it.

37:10.080 --> 37:10.960
But at the end of the day,

37:10.960 --> 37:12.880
it's the kernel maintainers and it's Linus

37:12.880 --> 37:15.360
and it's the community of people actively developing it

37:15.360 --> 37:17.040
that are making those calls.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.080
Google and Facebook don't get to do whatever they want.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.080
But Fuchsia has been this weird little skunk work project

37:23.080 --> 37:24.080
in the background.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.280
And of course we've got some kind of bad taste

37:26.280 --> 37:28.000
left in our mouth from, you know,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.960
the AOSP sort of just code dumps over the wall.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.600
I wonder if Dahlia, I mean,

37:33.600 --> 37:37.000
with their kind of clever different kernel approach

37:37.000 --> 37:39.320
and building this technology on Flutter

37:39.320 --> 37:41.600
and in theory to support a future

37:41.600 --> 37:44.280
more developed Zircon kernel,

37:44.280 --> 37:46.320
I wonder if this is a hedge against that success,

37:46.320 --> 37:48.320
you know, because instead of just Google

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
and some of these more companies building,

37:50.320 --> 37:52.040
I don't know, you know, smart devices

37:52.040 --> 37:54.920
or running it on some like container security system

37:54.920 --> 37:57.040
in the cloud, this might be an area

37:57.040 --> 37:59.360
where it could be generating a real community

37:59.360 --> 38:01.280
that we might actually recognize.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.640
That is a wild thought.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.200
So this is a hedge.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.200
If the Fuchsia on the desktop thing ever does take off,

38:08.200 --> 38:10.800
at least we've got some community driven,

38:10.800 --> 38:13.320
community built workstation OS.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.960
And it doesn't look too bad.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.480
So they've got their custom,

38:16.480 --> 38:19.680
some desktop environment called Pangolin.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.080
And it's kind of pretty.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.160
I mean, it looks like a Flutter app.

38:23.160 --> 38:27.640
It's got a strong sort of Google design inspired aesthetic.

38:27.640 --> 38:30.000
And a lot of it is still super early days.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.440
They've grayed out all of the apps

38:31.440 --> 38:32.480
that just don't work at all.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.200
But even in the ones you can open,

38:35.200 --> 38:38.280
well, not all of them work as nicely as you might think,

38:38.280 --> 38:40.000
but there's a lot in here to like,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.800
including a sort of Android style settings menu

38:42.800 --> 38:45.200
that's very accessible, easy to use.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.720
And a clever custom process and container monitoring app

38:48.720 --> 38:51.320
that looks like once it's working a little bit nicer,

38:51.320 --> 38:52.480
could be pretty great.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.680
And these are Flutter applications essentially?

38:54.680 --> 38:56.160
These are, yeah.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.280
Okay, I mean, it looks very touch friendly,

38:58.280 --> 38:59.720
but you could still use it with a mouse.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.920
Yep, and I was using it to virtualize with a mouse,

39:02.920 --> 39:04.000
no problem, but you're right.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.440
I think a lot of the elements here,

39:05.440 --> 39:06.960
they could be touch friendly.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.120
It's definitely not anything radical,

39:09.120 --> 39:11.000
if you're familiar with sort of a Chrome OS

39:11.000 --> 39:13.680
or a material or an Android design,

39:13.680 --> 39:15.920
yeah, you're gonna know what this looks like.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.760
Yeah, I'm getting strong Chrome OS material vibes

39:18.760 --> 39:21.880
from this, which is I guess what you would expect.

39:21.880 --> 39:25.840
Though having Deepin on the same episode as Dahlia,

39:25.840 --> 39:29.280
it so is at opposite ends of the spectrum.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.120
Deepin is this complete, polished,

39:32.120 --> 39:34.800
fully feature rich desktop environment

39:34.800 --> 39:37.320
with desktop applications in an app store

39:37.320 --> 39:39.080
and a Chrome web browser

39:39.080 --> 39:41.720
and a full Linux Debian based subsystem, right?

39:41.720 --> 39:46.360
And then Dahlia is this weird fusion of Linux and Fuchsia

39:46.360 --> 39:48.720
with the Pangolin desktop on top of it all.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.360
And I have a hard time even keeping it straight, Wes.

39:51.360 --> 39:54.200
It seems like a whole new hybrid monster to me.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.760
Yeah, that's what's kind of fascinating too,

39:55.760 --> 39:58.080
is seeing it all work out in these different ways.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.400
Like I guess we could have a whole, you know,

40:01.400 --> 40:04.400
Flutter based desktop running on top of Linux.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.960
Sure, some folks might wanna run it on Zircon and Fuchsia,

40:06.960 --> 40:10.440
but maybe it's just fine for us to run it on Linux too.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.360
I don't know, I'm not saying I'm in love with Flutter

40:12.360 --> 40:13.520
or the look of this,

40:13.520 --> 40:15.560
but I do find it really interesting

40:15.560 --> 40:17.840
to see these ideas sort of built out

40:17.840 --> 40:20.360
and see more community involvement with it.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.280
Maybe Flutter could be a really great technology

40:22.280 --> 40:25.920
for us to build toolkits, you know, and desktop apps,

40:25.920 --> 40:27.880
just like we use GTK and Qt today.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.080
And I agree with ByteBitten in the IRC,

40:30.080 --> 40:32.200
like this could be a compelling environment

40:32.200 --> 40:33.960
for the Pinebook Pro kind of device.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.720
Oh yeah, very true.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.520
You know, a nice ARM64 machine

40:37.520 --> 40:39.840
with a good desktop environment on it

40:39.840 --> 40:42.560
that really could have some decent features.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.560
I just am still adjusting to the entire concept.

40:44.560 --> 40:45.560
And I think I'm part of this

40:45.560 --> 40:47.120
where I'm kind of having to reassess

40:47.120 --> 40:49.240
is where I've come down on Flutter to a degree

40:49.240 --> 40:52.480
because, you know, when Canonical kind of went all in

40:52.480 --> 40:54.560
and announced their installer was gonna be in Flutter

40:54.560 --> 40:56.880
and kind of suggested that other developers

40:56.880 --> 40:58.000
follow them in that direction,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.760
I thought, ah, I don't think that's it chief.

41:00.760 --> 41:01.640
I don't think that's quite it.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.360
I don't think they are, but you know what?

41:04.360 --> 41:07.800
When I see this and when I play with Flutter

41:07.800 --> 41:09.200
and I've gotten emails in from people

41:09.200 --> 41:10.280
who are building Flutter apps,

41:10.280 --> 41:13.120
I think to myself, maybe I misread Canonical's read.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.480
Maybe they got it right.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.520
And then you go through this album

41:16.520 --> 41:17.840
that you've linked in the show notes

41:17.840 --> 41:22.080
and a lot of these apps are like 80% there already.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.560
And it's not like they've been around for years.

41:24.560 --> 41:26.000
They've been able to catch up

41:26.000 --> 41:30.400
to what we would consider modern standard features

41:30.400 --> 41:32.760
in a remarkably short time.

41:32.760 --> 41:36.720
And that's noteworthy because we really, really could use

41:36.720 --> 41:39.680
a healthy third-party developer ecosystem.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.800
And I'm not saying Flutter is necessarily it,

41:41.800 --> 41:43.600
but I think going through this

41:43.600 --> 41:44.920
and having you explain this to me, Wes,

41:44.920 --> 41:46.640
I think it's made me reevaluate

41:46.640 --> 41:48.440
that I need to be more open-minded to it

41:48.440 --> 41:51.320
and that if we wanna see an influx of apps

41:51.320 --> 41:52.720
that are not Electron,

41:52.720 --> 41:54.240
I think I've gotta consider this

41:54.240 --> 41:56.120
a little bit more freely than I had before.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.640
I have to be a little more open to the idea

41:57.640 --> 41:59.360
of Flutter apps on the Linux desktop.

41:59.360 --> 42:02.120
I think it's hard to maybe separate its origin

42:02.120 --> 42:04.520
and who's pushing it and all of that from,

42:04.520 --> 42:06.480
at the end, the technical merits

42:06.480 --> 42:09.520
and what sort of interesting stuff do people make with it.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.600
Unpluggedcore.com, thank you to our core contributors.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.440
This episode, the last few have been brought to you

42:17.440 --> 42:19.240
right by, in this spot right here in the show,

42:19.240 --> 42:21.480
they've been brought to you by our members.

42:21.480 --> 42:24.440
Just members, people out there making this show possible.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.640
Thank you everybody who's become

42:25.640 --> 42:27.600
an Unpluggedcore contributor.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.720
You, you're my sunshine.

42:29.720 --> 42:30.720
I don't know, what else can I say?

42:30.720 --> 42:33.040
I mean, you make the show possible.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.200
We've been in a tight spot this month

42:34.200 --> 42:35.600
and a lot of you stepped up.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.040
And I'm really, just really very grateful.

42:39.040 --> 42:41.480
The summertime sale is going on for a little bit longer,

42:41.480 --> 42:44.560
a $1 off membership for the lifetime

42:44.560 --> 42:46.640
when you go to unpluggedcore.com

42:46.640 --> 42:48.680
and you use the promo code SUMMER.

42:48.680 --> 42:50.680
I could go on such a soapbox

42:50.680 --> 42:53.480
about how I think member-driven media

42:53.480 --> 42:55.160
is so critical right now

42:55.160 --> 42:58.080
and how I just am so grateful for everybody who stepped up

42:58.080 --> 43:00.080
and provided some support,

43:00.080 --> 43:02.000
but there are still, still spots.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.320
We could still use more.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.520
We're definitely not at the spot

43:04.520 --> 43:06.600
anywhere close to where it would replace a sponsor yet,

43:06.600 --> 43:09.920
but maybe one day we'll get there, unpluggedcore.com

43:09.920 --> 43:12.840
and use the promo code SUMMER for just a little bit longer

43:12.840 --> 43:16.120
and you can get a dollar off the lifetime of your membership.

43:16.120 --> 43:21.120
John writes in regarding the AUR on Ubuntu.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.560
This was last episode where we kind of dove into

43:25.560 --> 43:27.480
just about any approach we thought might work

43:27.480 --> 43:30.320
to get our favorite AUR hot apps

43:30.320 --> 43:34.600
on our boring old Ubuntu or Debian desktops.

43:34.600 --> 43:39.600
John runs LTS Ubuntu 2004 with LXD and LXC and says,

43:40.400 --> 43:42.880
I can run just about any secondary Linux OS

43:42.880 --> 43:46.520
in a container, Arch, Fedora, Alma, whatever,

43:46.520 --> 43:51.040
with pretty much a full system, sans kernel, of course,

43:51.040 --> 43:55.600
and they run blazingly fast and almost like the real thing.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.880
I can even run them in a VM if I so choose,

43:58.880 --> 44:02.320
although that's still a pretty early feature of LXD.

44:02.320 --> 44:03.720
I know Docker is the future,

44:03.720 --> 44:07.840
but I find myself using LXD more than I do Docker, frankly.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.360
Here's how he does it, though.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.560
By loading an X11 profile

44:11.560 --> 44:14.200
that automatically displays to my host system

44:14.200 --> 44:16.040
when I spin up a new instance,

44:16.040 --> 44:18.760
I can run, e.g. Arch,

44:18.760 --> 44:21.440
and install anything I want from the AUR,

44:21.440 --> 44:23.960
displays to my host as if it's native

44:23.960 --> 44:26.000
and if it's truly running in Arch,

44:26.000 --> 44:27.440
which seems much simpler to me

44:27.440 --> 44:29.760
and more stable than some kind of hackery

44:29.760 --> 44:32.760
running the AUR compiled directly.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.720
Now, I don't have a full desktop, of course,

44:34.720 --> 44:38.080
but that isn't what you said you wanted anyway.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.960
At any rate, with this setup, I've been pretty happy.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.520
I can run any application I want from almost any distro,

44:44.520 --> 44:47.200
and it runs as if it's native.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.960
Takes seconds to spin one up, and it's great.

44:49.960 --> 44:54.160
Clever setup, that is not bad, John.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.520
I think that's a perfect use case in that scenario.

44:56.520 --> 44:58.240
I love using Toolbox right now.

44:58.240 --> 45:00.560
It sort of solves what I needed from it,

45:00.560 --> 45:03.880
but I could see you using a setup similar to this, Wes.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.600
I mean, yeah, you had me at containers,

45:05.600 --> 45:07.960
and I'm a big LXD fan.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.600
And I'm sure you could set up something similar

45:09.600 --> 45:11.280
with Wayland, too, if you had some need

45:11.280 --> 45:14.040
or just desire for Wayland-specific apps.

45:14.040 --> 45:17.080
I kind of feel like I'm not feeling Docker is the future

45:17.080 --> 45:18.480
as much as it once was.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.600
I think it's going to have a very, very healthy

45:20.600 --> 45:22.000
long-term future.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.160
But Podman is getting more and more love,

45:25.160 --> 45:28.960
and it's getting used just sort of as a back-end tooling

45:28.960 --> 45:31.920
more and more by orchestration tools.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.600
And there's LXD.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.200
I mean, hell, there's still FreeBSD Jails.

45:36.200 --> 45:39.920
I think what we're going to have is the concept of containers

45:39.920 --> 45:43.640
and an OCI standard, and we're going to just sort of mix

45:43.640 --> 45:46.960
and match the runtime depending on the application and use.

45:46.960 --> 45:50.240
And it's going to be part of our jobs.

45:50.240 --> 45:51.400
I use that term very loosely.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.900
But it's going to be part of people

45:52.900 --> 45:55.960
that are in the industry's jobs to figure out

45:55.960 --> 45:58.360
which runtime and tools are correct

45:58.360 --> 45:59.440
for the right application.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.120
And I think it's less of a default

46:02.120 --> 46:03.920
that it's Docker more than ever these days.

46:03.920 --> 46:04.400
Yeah, really.

46:04.400 --> 46:05.900
I mean, especially if you're getting

46:05.900 --> 46:08.360
into some kinds of weirder use cases,

46:08.360 --> 46:11.640
more system-specific or admin-type use cases.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.400
I think Docker, especially with all the changes

46:14.400 --> 46:17.600
that happened to that company and their now focus on desktop

46:17.600 --> 46:19.760
and developer tooling, it seems like they're

46:19.760 --> 46:23.400
focused very much on that container runs one thing.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.840
It's meant there to be like running microservices,

46:25.840 --> 46:28.880
isolating stuff out and deploying it into the cloud

46:28.880 --> 46:30.920
or onto your container cluster.

46:30.920 --> 46:32.060
And that's all great.

46:32.060 --> 46:33.680
And of course, you can do those things

46:33.680 --> 46:35.000
with Podman and everything else.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.520
But between systemdnspawn, LXD, or even just the container

46:39.520 --> 46:42.440
primitives that are being leveraged by stuff like Flatpak,

46:42.440 --> 46:44.080
I think you're totally right.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.560
You just need a file system image.

46:45.560 --> 46:46.800
Maybe you want to build one yourself

46:46.800 --> 46:48.440
or pull it out of a virtual machine.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.000
And then at the end of the day, you're

46:50.000 --> 46:52.120
kind of just assembling a collection of cgroups

46:52.120 --> 46:54.960
and some namespaces and running a process.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.400
And I think for a long time for me personally,

46:57.400 --> 47:01.440
it'll be either Docker or Podman using Docker Compose

47:01.440 --> 47:03.400
compatibility, because I do really like that.

47:03.400 --> 47:06.080
But I'm a multi-container gentleman.

47:06.080 --> 47:06.700
What can I say?

47:06.700 --> 47:09.320
It's a lifestyle.

47:09.320 --> 47:13.160
We have another pick, one of our famous picks for you here,

47:13.160 --> 47:15.360
a classic, a real spinner.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.080
It's called Mix, M-I-X-X-X.

47:18.080 --> 47:19.160
And we've talked.

47:19.160 --> 47:21.360
No, it's not dirty.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.440
It's like DJ software.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.640
We've talked about it before on the show.

47:23.640 --> 47:24.720
You remember, don't you?

47:24.720 --> 47:28.480
And it lets you be a smooth operator.

47:28.480 --> 47:31.080
It mixes music together like a pro.

47:31.080 --> 47:34.240
And it has new looks, new tagging capabilities.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.560
And it also has new hardware support.

47:36.560 --> 47:40.320
And very happy to say it now has support for recording

47:40.320 --> 47:44.480
and streaming in Opus and high quality AAC codecs.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.440
It can stream from the software itself out to your endpoint.

47:47.440 --> 47:48.160
Wow.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.120
Yeah.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.440
We love Mix.

47:50.440 --> 47:53.200
I've used Mix a lot on our live streams over the years.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.820
So that's why I've mentioned it before on the show.

47:55.820 --> 47:56.960
It's so neat, though.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.580
If you just want to throw something on your machine

47:59.580 --> 48:01.940
and just have it mix together music for you,

48:01.940 --> 48:04.840
if you've got a couple albums or something,

48:04.840 --> 48:07.640
and if you do that local music thing, it is so cool.

48:07.640 --> 48:08.980
And the way it displays the music

48:08.980 --> 48:10.440
and lets you crossfade everything,

48:10.440 --> 48:11.640
it just is the neatest.

48:11.640 --> 48:14.440
And it's just a fantastic open source app.

48:14.440 --> 48:17.720
Or maybe you're just a nerd who's forced to socialize.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.300
You're having folks over to your party.

48:19.300 --> 48:20.920
You don't really want to talk to them.

48:20.920 --> 48:23.080
But you can be there playing with Mix in the background,

48:23.080 --> 48:24.120
playing great tunes.

48:24.120 --> 48:25.720
Are we both just introverts?

48:25.720 --> 48:28.160
Because both of us, it'd have to be a forced thing

48:28.160 --> 48:30.680
to have people over.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.920
It's not just something we do.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.280
But some people do, Wes.

48:33.280 --> 48:35.200
Some people, some people.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.800
You could probably also pipe it into your Zoom calls

48:37.800 --> 48:38.520
using PipeWire.

48:38.520 --> 48:40.000
Now, there you go.

48:40.000 --> 48:40.600
Right.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.400
Thanks to our sponsor, Cloud Guru Sponsor.

48:42.400 --> 48:44.640
You can find them on social media.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.160
Pretty much anywhere that's a social media website,

48:47.160 --> 48:49.080
they're just slash a Cloud Guru.

48:49.080 --> 48:49.920
It's really easy.

48:49.920 --> 48:53.120
So they're just about everywhere, slash a Cloud Guru.

48:53.120 --> 48:55.200
We've got that thing, too, that social media thing.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.760
The show's at Linux Unplugged.

48:56.760 --> 48:59.200
And the network is at Jupiter Signal.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.100
And then if you just want a website,

49:01.100 --> 49:02.360
if you're old school and you just

49:02.360 --> 49:05.580
want a website in your Mosaic compatible web browser,

49:05.580 --> 49:08.400
you can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

49:08.400 --> 49:11.760
And if you are not catching Linux Action News,

49:11.760 --> 49:14.280
you're missing all the news, the stuff that's

49:14.280 --> 49:17.320
going on in the industry all the time in open source and Linux.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.600
We're covering it there.

49:18.600 --> 49:20.520
There will be a episode next week.

49:20.520 --> 49:22.000
It'll just be a little bit later,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.740
because Wes is going to be traveling,

49:24.740 --> 49:27.240
like the gentleman man about town that he is.

49:27.240 --> 49:31.520
And like a pro, even after traveling,

49:31.520 --> 49:32.920
we're going to sit down and we're

49:32.920 --> 49:35.160
going to record an episode of Linux Action News.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.440
I mean, the news doesn't stop.

49:36.440 --> 49:36.960
That's right.

49:36.960 --> 49:37.760
I can't either.

49:37.760 --> 49:39.080
No, just can't stop.

49:39.080 --> 49:39.800
Won't stop.

49:39.800 --> 49:42.600
So go get that at linuxactionnews.com.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.260
But for us here, we do it live.

49:44.260 --> 49:47.920
We do it every single Tuesday at noon Pacific.

49:47.920 --> 49:49.240
See you next week.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.840
Same bad time, same bad station.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.400
We'd love to have you join us.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.340
Participate in our open Mumble Room

49:55.340 --> 49:58.640
and conversate with us in the real times in the IRC.

49:58.640 --> 50:02.120
irc.geekshed.net pound Jupiter Broadcasting.

50:02.120 --> 50:03.480
Yeah, we're still on Geek Shed.

50:03.480 --> 50:05.560
I've had people asking.

50:05.560 --> 50:10.120
And I feel like we want to support an open IRC ecosystem.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.280
So come hang out.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.040
I'm plugging it right now.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.120
It's been a while.

50:14.120 --> 50:15.160
It's been years.

50:15.160 --> 50:16.160
It's been years.

50:16.160 --> 50:19.280
irc.geekshed.net pound Jupiter Broadcasting.

50:19.280 --> 50:23.280
I'm hardly in there, but come say hi.

50:23.280 --> 50:23.880
All right.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.960
Links at linuxunplug.com slash 412.

50:25.960 --> 50:28.040
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

50:28.040 --> 50:29.680
of the Unplugged program.

50:29.680 --> 50:35.760
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday.

50:59.680 --> 51:15.040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

51:15.040 --> 51:19.000
Everybody head over to elementary's YouTube channel.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I'll put a link in the show notes, actually.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.640
Their EDW went pretty great.

51:23.640 --> 51:26.000
Wes and I had a great time hanging out with those guys.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.040
And they had people talk about accessibility and usability.

51:29.040 --> 51:31.760
They talked about creating great looking icons on Linux

51:31.760 --> 51:32.720
and all kinds of topics.

51:32.720 --> 51:36.280
Dan did a State of the Platform video too.

51:36.280 --> 51:38.720
It's all on the elementary YouTube channel.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.680
So I will put a link in the show notes,

51:40.680 --> 52:10.640
but you can go find it over on YouTube's.
