00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Well, Chris, I almost lost my wallet this weekend.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,680
Oh no, like out and about in town, downtown Seattle?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,680
No, thankfully not.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,400
Actually, this was out in the woods of Issaquah.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,960
Are you kidding me?

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
I've been out in the woods this weekend.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
So we're both out in the woods.

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,000
What happened?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,640
Yeah, right.

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,200
It's a lovely Pacific Northwest day,

11
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,960
although actually it was kind of soggy,

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,920
but misty in the woods in the rain.

13
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
And all right, the dogs had suckered me

14
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,880
into taking them out for an adventure in the woods.

15
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,320
Here I am having a great time, getting very damp,

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,480
taking some pictures too.

17
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,360
And that's where things went awry.

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,600
I get back to the car.

19
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
I was going to go to the store, pick up a few things,

20
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,000
do some errands on the way back home after the walk.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,380
And I notice I don't have my wallet.

22
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,720
So of course, I checked the car.

23
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,600
Maybe I left it in there, although I tried

24
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,080
to take it with me on hikes.

25
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,520
And I think to myself, well, I wasn't planning to do this.

26
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,840
Really, I looked at the small dog,

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,920
and she gilded me with those cute eyes.

28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,360
And I thought, all right, all right, I better

29
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,720
take him to the woods today.

30
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,160
So it was plausible that maybe I just left the wallet at home.

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,280
I'd never brought it at all.

32
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
Right, so you realize before you make it home

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,240
that you've lost the wallet, but you've

34
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,480
left the woods at this point.

35
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:02,840
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,600
No, I mean, totally.

37
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
I'm like, well, what do I do?

38
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,520
I don't have my wallet.

39
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,760
I don't know that I lost it.

40
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
So I drive home.

41
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,400
I search the car again.

42
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,880
Then I search the apartment.

43
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,680
Not there.

44
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,200
Oh, no.

45
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,760
By this time, it's like Sunday, getting to be evening.

46
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,120
We're at quite the latitude up here.

47
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,640
So it's getting dark early.

48
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
I basically have just enough time, I think to myself,

49
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,880
is this really worth it?

50
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Is this what I'm going to do?

51
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,920
But I get back in the car.

52
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,800
I drive back to the trailhead.

53
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
And then I jog the entire route that I

54
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,360
went on with the dogs looking for this wallet.

55
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,400
And I find it.

56
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,920
So actually, I go right past it.

57
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,100
I go right past it.

58
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm getting kind of depressed.

59
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,480
I'm like, what am I going to do when I get back to the car?

60
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,600
Like, I need to buy stuff.

61
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,360
I don't have that much gas left in my car

62
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,080
since I just drove back to the trail.

63
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,320
Oh, man.

64
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,080
And I remember that I took a picture at this spot.

65
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,760
And I think to myself, I had my wallet and my cell phone

66
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,360
in the same pocket.

67
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,320
And I back up to where I think I snapped the picture,

68
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,000
look to the right.

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,320
And just there, under some ferns and some leaves,

70
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,000
is my slightly soggier wallet.

71
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,760
Wow.

72
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,800
And it must have been just as it was getting,

73
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,680
I mean, you must have been close to running out of daylight.

74
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, yeah.

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
I mean, this was probably like 10 minutes to sunset.

76
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
My story is not as awesome.

77
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,060
But I got this new mobile router, this new fancy schmancy

78
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,120
mobile router.

79
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
And I brought it down to the studio.

80
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,920
And I got it set up.

81
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,200
And I got it all updated.

82
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,120
And I packed it all up.

83
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,840
And I took it back to the RV, which

84
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,520
I had strategically stashed out in the woods

85
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,760
on the edge of signal.

86
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,360
And I'm so proud of myself because I've

87
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,180
got this whole thing.

88
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,300
And I'm going to plug it in.

89
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,720
And I'm going to have a totally usable cell signal out

90
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,200
in the woods.

91
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,800
And look at me.

92
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,120
I'm such a fancy boy.

93
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,520
And I get it out.

94
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,840
I run the ethernet cable to it.

95
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,140
I get ready to shut down my Raspberry Pi that had been

96
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,680
doing the job of this thing.

97
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,360
And I realized I had left the power cord at the studio.

98
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,720
Oh.

99
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,640
And so I seriously, and it's more than an hour drive away.

100
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,400
And I seriously sat there for a solid 45 minutes

101
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,280
debating if I was going to drive my butt back to the studio

102
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,640
just for that power cord.

103
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,800
But ultimately, I decided just to call it a night

104
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
and have a chill night in the woods.

105
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,080
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

106
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,980
My name is Chris.

107
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,120
My name is Wes.

108
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,520
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, the leader

109
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,720
in hands-on learning.

110
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,100
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

111
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,080
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs for Cloud Linux

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,240
servers and much more.

113
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,000
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,960
Welcome into 3.77.

115
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,880
We have a great show.

116
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,160
Fedora 33 is out this week.

117
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,440
And Wes and I have been really putting it through its paces.

118
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,080
So we'll tell you our thoughts on that.

119
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,680
But we also have some really good community news.

120
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,600
Just some stuff.

121
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
Well, maybe not all of it's so good.

122
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
But stuff we're definitely going to chew on.

123
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
So there's a whole batch of stuff.

124
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,160
I apologize if it smells like pine trees and skunk.

125
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,640
Wes and I have been out in the woods.

126
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,680
Also, Wes, I apologize I set up the Soda Stream in your spot.

127
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,400
But it was on sale for Prime Day.

128
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,560
I had to get a Soda Stream.

129
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,440
And I just can't compete with that carbonation.

130
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,040
No.

131
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,200
No, I like seven squirts, Wes.

132
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,680
I like it really bubbly.

133
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
So that's why it's right there.

134
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,440
So if I have any burps, I apologize.

135
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
But before we get into that community news and those burps,

136
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,520
I want to say time-appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

137
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,720
Hello, Virtual Lug.

138
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,320
Hello.

139
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,520
Hello.

140
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,400
Hello, everybody.

141
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,360
It's really great to have you in there.

142
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,440
Rockin' 22.

143
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,760
We've been averaging a little higher some weeks,

144
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,440
around 22 some weeks.

145
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,960
And it ebbs and flows.

146
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,640
People have stuff going on in their life.

147
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,800
It's been getting cold out in the woods, way below freezing.

148
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,240
So yeah, let me tell you, it's nice to be down here

149
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
in the studio where it's warm and cozy.

150
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,320
And let's start by talking about Linux 5.10.

151
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,520
No, it's not out yet, but it's shaping up

152
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,360
to be a pretty impressive release.

153
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,560
There's a couple of things that are worth noting.

154
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,120
And why we're talking about it today

155
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
is it's been confirmed by Greg Kh

156
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
that this will be the next LTS kernel, which speculation had

157
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,000
been that it would be Linux 5.9.

158
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,400
But no, my friends, it is going to be 5.10,

159
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
which may be a nice thing.

160
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,160
Yeah, right?

161
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,840
Greg Kh announced this at the Linux Foundation's Open Source

162
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,680
Summit Europe.

163
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,120
And I guess, really, we're talking about it because,

164
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
once it's released stably, perhaps around mid-December,

165
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,480
it's going to be a kernel that hangs around for a long time

166
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,600
with that LTS support.

167
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,160
So you, I, all of us will probably

168
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,440
be running it for years to come.

169
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,900
Yeah, and Android devices in particular.

170
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,120
And sometimes, when it is a kernel adopted by Android,

171
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,920
it wouldn't be uncommon to see that support extended out

172
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,200
further than just a few years.

173
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,240
I think the other notable thing about 5.10

174
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,400
has to be the Bluetooth bug that we've recently heard about.

175
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,880
It sounds like the complete fix for that vulnerability

176
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,080
is going to be when you have both a BlueZ update

177
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,840
and a kernel update that corresponds with that.

178
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,880
And that particular fix is in 5.10.

179
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,000
So it's going to have that.

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,160
But there's also just a plethora of new hardware features

181
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,080
and improvement support that's in 5.10 as well.

182
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,800
The current LTS release, just if you're curious, is Linux 5.4.

183
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,360
And that is expected to be maintained

184
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,280
through the end of 2025.

185
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,080
So when you have 5.10 out there, you're

186
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,120
probably going to at least see it maintained until the end of 2026.

187
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,920
So go build your servers, your LTS distros,

188
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,340
and your enterprise distros, and your Android phones.

189
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,680
Hey, that means we can look forward

190
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
to 5.10 on our little Garage Arch server sometime soon.

191
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,360
Yeah, that's right.

192
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,080
Hopefully that takes a little while.

193
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,480
That'll be a dicey upgrade.

194
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
Stay tuned, audience.

195
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,520
Also in 5.10, just a side note, XFS is making the long play.

196
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,680
In 5.10, XFS has been updated with what

197
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,480
they call big timestamps, which means it will now support

198
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,520
timestamps out until 2486.

199
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,360
So they're going to be around for a long time.

200
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,640
Oh, yeah.

201
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,400
OK, so previously we were counting things

202
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,560
in seconds since 1970, as maybe you well know.

203
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,200
That runs out in 2038.

204
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,520
Seems like a long time, but 18 years, maybe not really.

205
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,200
But now we've got huge 64-bit nanosecond counters.

206
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,760
Oh, yeah.

207
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,960
Finally, finally.

208
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,520
So there's your long-term storage, or ZFS, or ButterFest.

209
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,360
Just not NTFS.

210
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,640
Do me a favor.

211
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,240
System76 in the news this week also with Pop!

212
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,080
OS 2010.

213
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,120
It came out at the end of last week.

214
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
There seems to be a lot of improvements

215
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,920
that take advantage of, like the GNOME Shell 3.38

216
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,960
and the underlying updates in Ubuntu 2010.

217
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,840
But there's also something landing in Pop! Shell

218
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,320
that caught my eye, and it's called stacking.

219
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,120
Similar to tabs in a web browser,

220
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,240
you can stack tiled windows on top of one another.

221
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,400
So you can imagine maybe a multi-tiled window.

222
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,240
And maybe you have a long vertical pane

223
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
on the left-hand side.

224
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,520
You could have your web browser there, your notes.

225
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,020
You could have multiple applications there.

226
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,520
And then you can toggle through them

227
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,640
with VIM shortcuts or whatnot.

228
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,880
It sure just keeps getting better and better.

229
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,640
Another one that caught my eye are floating window exceptions,

230
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,280
because sometimes you just have those little weird dialog boxes

231
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,160
that are just too small to really tile efficiently.

232
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,320
And now you can just add that to the exceptions list,

233
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,160
and they're totally exempt from tiling.

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,960
You don't have to fuss with turning it off and on.

235
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,080
My use case for that, so it'll be interesting to see

236
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,440
if I can do this, is bookmarklets for tagging

237
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,600
things for various shows.

238
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,240
Those windows always get tiled, and it scrunches everything up

239
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
for just this tiny little pop-up where I tag something

240
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,000
and give it a title and hit Enter.

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,960
I wonder if there's a bit, but it's spawned by the web browser.

242
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,680
So I wonder if I'll be able to do that.

243
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,280
I wonder if I'll be able to accept that.

244
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,320
We'll see.

245
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Oh, if I didn't mention to the chat room,

246
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,760
as we're going along, do bang, suggest, and title our show,

247
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,380
because that's how we're going to title this thing if you

248
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,880
don't do it.

249
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,840
We can't be trusted.

250
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,480
No.

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,160
No, so please do help us title it.

252
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,780
But I want to talk about a story that is really unfortunate.

253
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,120
And we covered it in LAN, a lot of the details about this.

254
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,400
And it is the DMCA takedown of YouTube

255
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,360
DL, which has been removed from GitHub after a DMCA notice.

256
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,320
There's been some developments since Linux Action News,

257
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,360
including some alternative repos and an interview

258
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,840
with one of the original creators.

259
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,760
So I wanted to stop for a moment.

260
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
If you're not familiar with the story,

261
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,200
the Recording Association of America, Recording Industry

262
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,120
Association of America, the RIAA,

263
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,560
issued a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown

264
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
on YouTube DL under the grounds that it could

265
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,140
be used to pirate music videos off of YouTube.

266
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,440
And it's a bit of a spacious argument,

267
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,160
but I'll tell you where they're coming from on their point,

268
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,200
because we want to give you the both sides of it here.

269
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,800
So in most cases, the DMCA notices

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,260
are regarding an unauthorized distribution

271
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,520
of a piece of media.

272
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,480
That's typically how a DMCA takedown is done.

273
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,920
You're distributing copyrighted music or copyrighted video.

274
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,880
And then they will use the DMCA takedown requests

275
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
that these platforms support.

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,760
It's like a tool often that YouTube or Build or GitHub

277
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,480
builds.

278
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
They'll use that mechanism to use the DMCA as the grounds

279
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
to take down that copyright.

280
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,880
But this notice for YouTube DL is different,

281
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,640
because it's targeting a tool that can be used to reproduce

282
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,080
copyrighted media.

283
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,760
YouTube DL is licensed under the unlicensed license, which

284
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,040
is an anti-copyright license that

285
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,920
promises ownership of the software to the public domain.

286
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,320
And it is usually considered lawful to freely distribute

287
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,600
the software itself because of that license.

288
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Their notice claimed that YouTube DL software

289
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,840
was being used to copy a couple of songs that they cited,

290
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,320
particularly songs that were like a Taylor Swift song

291
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,440
and whatnot that were in the documentation.

292
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,680
Yeah, some of the examples are Taylor Swift, Icona Pop,

293
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,240
and of course Justin Timberlake.

294
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,760
Maybe those aren't the best examples to have.

295
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,680
But at the same time, you're right.

296
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,880
Are we now policing if you violate some other services,

297
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,560
terms of service?

298
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,760
If you violate the JB website terms of service,

299
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,720
not that we have those, I don't think

300
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,800
we could get GitHub to take your code down.

301
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,640
Right, take the entire project down.

302
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
And of course, it's still widely available.

303
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
It's still widely used.

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Last year, the RIAA was able to get five YouTube Ripper sites,

305
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,360
you could put the little URL in there,

306
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,760
got them removed from the Google search engine.

307
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
So one of the new developments with this story

308
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,600
since Linux Action News came out is Perchant News interviewed

309
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,480
Philip, I'm going to say, Hajemeister, Hajester.

310
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,160
He's the previous maintainer, Philip is.

311
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
And this is an interesting bit in the interview

312
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
that I want to call our attention to is I

313
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,720
think there's a broader action that's happening here.

314
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,000
And the RIAA takedown may only be

315
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
a function of that broader action.

316
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,120
Because Philip says he received a seize and desist letter

317
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,080
from German lawyers just a couple of weeks ago,

318
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,360
but notes that there's a ton of technical inaccuracies

319
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,480
in the letter.

320
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,600
They don't seem to understand that, for one,

321
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,720
he's no longer the maintainer.

322
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,480
But he can't say a lot about it because it's an ongoing issue.

323
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,080
Perchant News also asked, despite not being the maintainer

324
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,080
anymore, would he change those examples?

325
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,960
I would remove the test cases, he writes.

326
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,560
These videos were never fully downloaded anyways.

327
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,040
They're just automated test cases

328
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,880
where the test downloaded the first 10 kilobytes, which

329
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,040
amounts to a couple of seconds at most.

330
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
And this is certainly fair use, but the project

331
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,280
is fully functional without those test cases.

332
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,920
How about that?

333
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
It was only downloading the first 10 kilobytes.

334
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,960
I think that's a bit that's been overlooked.

335
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,080
And these are just test case examples.

336
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,440
They're not advocating it, but it

337
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,200
would have been so much better to point to some Creative

338
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,160
Commons content on YouTube instead of a music video.

339
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,960
That just, in retrospect, seems ridiculous.

340
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,960
But I want to say this because I think this issue has been

341
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,360
a little misunderstood, particularly in some

342
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,000
of the Linux journalism slash media space.

343
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,480
But YouTube DL is a tool that maybe is not properly named.

344
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,840
YouTube is one of many sites that this tool supports

345
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,200
downloading from, hundreds of hundreds of sites.

346
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,120
And it is a tool that this podcast

347
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,760
uses to give voice to open source developers

348
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,960
to tens of thousands of listeners.

349
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,880
All these events that get posted online that we clip up,

350
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,680
that process starts with YouTube DL.

351
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,080
And that is absolutely 100% fair use under the DMCA.

352
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,680
I use YouTube DL to back up news clips for fair use

353
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,960
in my unfiltered podcast every single day, every day.

354
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,680
And I pay YouTube a monthly subscription for premium

355
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,520
to just have the privilege of not seeing ads.

356
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,400
So ads aren't really a factor for me.

357
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,560
But I don't think this conversation should be about

358
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,520
the tool's ability to copy a Taylor Swift song

359
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,720
or the tool's ability to download YouTube videos

360
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,040
without seeing ads.

361
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,840
Because that conversation about ad blockers

362
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,040
is a much larger discussion.

363
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
And YouTube DL is really not alone in this space.

364
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,960
And that's a broader conversation.

365
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,440
And the ability to download videos from YouTube,

366
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,840
functionality-wise, I think it's an important tool

367
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,760
to back up a very relevant medium right now that

368
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,480
is culturally more relevant than I think we've seen

369
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,840
any cable platform or television platform

370
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,240
because it is a publishing platform for the people.

371
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,360
And the ability to back that up, especially in an era

372
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,560
when more and more is being controlled

373
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
in what you're allowed to watch and not allowed to watch

374
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,400
or the fact that things can be taken down

375
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
by the creators themselves after the fact,

376
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,560
having a tool that allows you to archive that

377
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,600
is pretty important.

378
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,920
And we have to remember this is free software.

379
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,000
So you can't just squash this one group of people

380
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,960
and claim victory because a dozen more will fork and sprout.

381
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,320
So we have to think about it in a broader way, too.

382
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,920
You know, it also makes me think it's

383
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,080
an important sort of statement about browser lock-in.

384
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,360
If you're acknowledging that you can go to YouTube

385
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,680
and watch this video freely, well,

386
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,880
why can't I use the very same sort of API calls

387
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,960
to interact in the same way, right?

388
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't want to get to this future

389
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,800
where YouTube is totally locked in DRM

390
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
and you can only access it on your iPhone app.

391
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,760
This is a tricky thing here.

392
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,360
Because I don't know if this is a fair analogy to make,

393
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,600
but I can see a future where there

394
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,100
is US federally mandated encryption backdoors that

395
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,840
are built into products that are capable of encryption.

396
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,800
And I could see a similar process where application Y,

397
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,960
messenger application Y, doesn't support backdoor.

398
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,680
And so therefore, it's a security risk.

399
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,400
And there's some process where they issue a takedown on GitHub

400
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,800
because it doesn't comply with US law.

401
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
It becomes a real gray area real quick.

402
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,840
Because what we have here is a recording industry association

403
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,000
that is using music copyright law

404
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to take down open source code on a platform owned by Microsoft.

405
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,840
That's the real big picture here.

406
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,640
And I think this is a horrible precedent that we're seeing.

407
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,680
The takedown functionality, it seems like it's useful.

408
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,280
We looked into it, and there's legitimate known open source

409
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,560
projects on GitHub that issue takedowns under DMCA

410
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,360
against projects that are maybe copying brand or something

411
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,880
like that.

412
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,000
So the takedown process itself seems

413
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,520
like it has some legitimacy.

414
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,960
But how the RIAA is using it here

415
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,400
really reminds me of how they've abused YouTube as well.

416
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,240
But now it's source code, and it matters a hell of a lot more

417
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,300
than cat videos.

418
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,800
Well, yeah.

419
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,080
I need to download and archive those cat videos, Chris.

420
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah.

421
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,160
You know?

422
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,120
See, as someone who's just out in the woods, man,

423
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,920
everything I watched recently was offline.

424
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,460
And for me, it's kind of a nice thing

425
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,520
because I can kind of download and curate

426
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,600
several videos from the creators that I really enjoy.

427
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,400
And I kind of set them aside.

428
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,720
And we make dinner.

429
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,480
And I have them all loaded locally.

430
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,720
And it's a thing.

431
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,840
And it deeply connects me to those content creators.

432
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,320
And the fact that I could use YouTube

433
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,280
to be able to facilitate that is critical in my relationship

434
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,280
and my continued consumption of that content creator's media.

435
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Or maybe you're using a low power device that just

436
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,520
doesn't play well, this full screen video in your browser,

437
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,960
and you want to just play it on the command line

438
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,920
with something that has hardware acceleration.

439
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm curious if the Mumble Room has any thoughts

440
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,840
on this particular takedown.

441
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,280
I think probably nobody would disagree that they should

442
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,640
probably consider a name change.

443
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,280
It just seems, and you can see it

444
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,040
in the project's social media communications.

445
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,500
They initially assumed it was Google

446
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
that knocked them offline because they just live

447
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,200
in fear of Google constantly.

448
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,000
And then they realized after they read it

449
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,040
that it was the RIAA.

450
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
You wouldn't expect it.

451
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,720
Co-what?

452
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,880
You guys are still around?

453
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,080
Yeah, right?

454
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,240
What is this, Napster you're enforcing here?

455
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,480
And Microsoft, I think, should try to own this.

456
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,240
They can distance themselves by saying this is GitHub.

457
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,800
But the reality is that when you bought GitHub,

458
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,200
you get both ends of that relationship.

459
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,920
Yes, right.

460
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,760
And that's kind of the funny part here, too,

461
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,320
is there's been a lot of jokes or mocking or sarcasm

462
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,120
around the, well, it's on GitHub, but it's also Git.

463
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,840
So in one sense, you can't kill it because, well, it's Git.

464
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,840
It's distributed inherently.

465
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,560
But the other side is that there's still

466
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,920
this problem of the defaults.

467
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,600
And right now, GitHub is king.

468
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,400
That's the place where development takes place.

469
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,800
That's the place where issues, discussions, documentation,

470
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
the place people go.

471
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,560
And it's a little tricky when it's a giant, layered-up

472
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,640
industry association versus a little, humble, open-source

473
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,360
project.

474
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,880
Really?

475
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,680
ByteBitton, you have thoughts about this.

476
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,760
So I had to laugh about DMCA, about someone made a pull

477
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,120
request towards it, an empty one.

478
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,360
And he did it in such a way where

479
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,040
he made it an empty one that, via that pull request,

480
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,440
you can eventually still pull the entire YouTube downloader

481
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,040
project because it's available through Git.

482
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
That's great.

483
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,880
Yeah, I mean, they have their own local copies, too.

484
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,600
The developers are saying, we have recent local copies.

485
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,800
We can obviously host it in other places.

486
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,720
And I can't tell if there is a similar thing we're

487
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,920
seeing happening here where you have,

488
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,480
I feel like we have this issue where it's almost

489
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,680
going to become a matter of survival

490
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,720
that you're on your own self-hosted infrastructure

491
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,520
if you're a project that is skirting the legalities here.

492
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,840
If you're in the gray area, and maybe you're not

493
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,400
going to enforce an encryption backdoor,

494
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,080
or if you are a project like YouTube DL,

495
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,720
you have to maybe consider that you're better off from day one

496
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,520
on your own infrastructure and just training your user base.

497
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,840
That's where you go to find us.

498
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,120
And I know you suffer a little bit from the social network

499
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,600
effect of GitHub.

500
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,360
And you also have to be comfortable enough with Git,

501
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,800
the admin side of things, have the time and the resources

502
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,360
to be able to stand that infrastructure up

503
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,200
and maintain it.

504
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah, and maybe that's an area, as a community,

505
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,360
we can keep improving.

506
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,640
I mean, it is getting easier and easier than ever

507
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,800
to stand up infrastructure.

508
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,840
So there is that aspect of it.

509
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,640
It's so much simpler today than it was a long time ago

510
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,360
that maybe that's changing.

511
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,920
But I wonder, I've never really taken Mastodon seriously

512
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,600
until recently.

513
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,120
And I kind of go, OK, I kind of get it.

514
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,320
Long term, maybe it is better to invest

515
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,120
in owning the infrastructure like that.

516
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,680
And for an open source project, something like GitHub

517
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
is just an absolute vital part of the infrastructure

518
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,940
for the project.

519
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,240
And when you think of it holistically,

520
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,120
you think maybe we should really be in charge of that,

521
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,440
even if that means asking for some funding or something

522
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
to make it possible.

523
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,120
And I know there's people out in the community.

524
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,480
I know it, that there's people out

525
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,080
in the community that would volunteer to help them build

526
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,040
that infrastructure.

527
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,840
I know that's true.

528
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,520
Because anytime we have an ask about infrastructure,

529
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,200
the community steps up immediately.

530
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,540
And I know YouTube deals probably

531
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,240
got a lot of very passionate fans out there

532
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,860
that would be willing to help it.

533
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,440
So we'll see.

534
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,320
I think this is something, I feel

535
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,080
like there's a bigger trend happening here.

536
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,880
I'm curious, Bitmux, on what your thoughts

537
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,340
are on the network effect versus self-hosting

538
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,920
and having the freedom of being in control

539
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,120
of your own platform.

540
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,480
That's exactly that.

541
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,240
You have to make a choice.

542
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,240
If you're going to take advantage of the network

543
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,120
effect, which is probably one of the strongest

544
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,640
forces in today's world in development and creation

545
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,600
of anything, you're going to gravitate

546
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,320
towards one of the major corporate supported platforms.

547
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,960
And right now, it's interesting.

548
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,560
You have a lot of binary systems.

549
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,240
You have Microsoft or Apple.

550
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,320
You have Amazon or Google.

551
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,960
When it comes to GitHub, you have GitHub or what?

552
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,300
You end up choosing.

553
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,440
Do you want the freedom of self-hosting it

554
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,240
and all of the responsibility that comes along with that?

555
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,400
Or do you want the advantages and the network effect

556
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,200
and not having the responsibility of self-hosting

557
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,400
of just throw it on GitHub and invite all your developer

558
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,160
friends to have a go at it?

559
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,540
Yeah, and you maybe even get more contributors potentially,

560
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,460
which also has a lot of net benefits for the project.

561
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,880
So that has to be a calculus, too.

562
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,220
Neil, you and I have done an extra on GitHub alternatives.

563
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,960
I'm sure you must have thoughts on this.

564
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,680
There are avenues around this.

565
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,200
And I think some of the things going on with the Fediverse

566
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,360
with Forge Fed, which is a protocol in development

567
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,920
to support cross-server interactions and subscriptions

568
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,000
and things like that to essentially build

569
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,320
a decentralized, federated network across Git servers.

570
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,440
That sort of thing, I think, will help.

571
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,120
And Pagar, as I talked about with you in an extra show

572
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,000
several months ago, there's a contributor

573
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,960
who's got funded effort to build an extension for Pagar

574
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,160
specifically to support that model.

575
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,000
And Pagar itself has features built in to support things

576
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,600
like people are forking the project

577
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,200
or maintaining their own clones in their own Git servers.

578
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,320
They can still make branches and send pull requests

579
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,360
to the master repo on another Pagar server.

580
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,480
And Pagar itself doesn't even require the other server

581
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,800
to be using Pagar.

582
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,160
It could just be a plain Git repo on HTTPS or CGit

583
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
or whatever.

584
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,120
And as long as the Git URL works and you can clone with it

585
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,640
and the branch is accessible, it can pull it.

586
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,440
And then you can make a remote pull request with that.

587
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,080
And so what I think we need to move towards for projects

588
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,120
is to consider that we shouldn't repeat the mistake that we,

589
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,480
well, we did repeat the mistake we made with SourceForge

590
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,520
with GitHub.

591
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,520
We should try to learn from that and start diversifying.

592
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,080
I kind of feel like it's not just source code hosting.

593
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,800
It's communications with the options of Matrix and Discord

594
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,680
and Slack and Mattermost, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

595
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,960
It's social media platforms with Mastodon versus Twitter.

596
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,000
It's PeerTube versus YouTube.

597
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,680
And I don't, maybe versus isn't the right way to put it,

598
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,560
but there is a common theme here amongst all of it.

599
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,560
And it is, and I find myself as time goes on,

600
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,480
again and again, like with, as I have perspective on things,

601
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
I look back and go, yeah, it's clear,

602
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,560
that platform was, it was like a limited ride.

603
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,600
And eventually you knew that ride was gonna come to an end.

604
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
And I see YouTube is very much that

605
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,160
and social media is very much that.

606
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,880
And long-term to be serious about it,

607
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,720
you should probably own that infrastructure yourself.

608
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,360
And that was really what inspired me

609
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,600
to go hard into Matrix.

610
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,120
But the onboarding has been an issue

611
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,320
where the commercial apps like Discord

612
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,640
have really nailed that.

613
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,480
And it's just a challenge.

614
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,080
It's again, the network effect.

615
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
But I also think about this.

616
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,400
The reason why the onboarding is so poor

617
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,920
is because there isn't the drive and interest,

618
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,720
the network effect to push people into improving this.

619
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
Like the only reason that these solutions

620
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
tend to have weaker user experiences

621
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,480
is that they have weaker levels of investment.

622
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,800
And that's because there's a weaker network effect

623
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,840
because there are people preferring solutions

624
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,640
that already are there and things like that.

625
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,520
And again, it's not necessarily always a bad thing

626
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,360
to do that.

627
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,160
Like I am on Twitter and Mastodon.

628
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,800
I prefer Twitter for the discoverability.

629
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,360
But on the flip side, if it's something

630
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,320
that I essentially care for and have to really depend on,

631
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,760
I really strongly consider the self-hosting avenue

632
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,520
simply so that I have confidence

633
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,920
that I don't lose my data.

634
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,840
I lost all of the stuff I did for Google Plus years ago.

635
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,360
And I recently spun up a personal Pagar

636
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,680
instance for my own usage.

637
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,280
I locked it down so nobody else can log in or do anything.

638
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,000
But it's useful for me for doing issue tracking, workflow

639
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,040
management, and storing mirrors of repos and things like that.

640
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,160
And so I'm doing that for my own personal usage.

641
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:37,240
And things like Pagar or even like Getty or whatever,

642
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,440
they're easy to set up.

643
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,280
They have easy documentation.

644
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,840
The requirements are low.

645
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,320
I'm running my Pagar instance on one vCPU

646
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,600
and with one gigabyte of RAM and OpenSUSE Elite 15.2

647
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,600
on Linode for basically nothing.

648
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,320
And it's fine.

649
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,960
It performs very well.

650
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,880
And that's the sort of thing that you should consider.

651
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,360
Because I think people think that the administrative efforts

652
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,560
are not worth it or oversized compared

653
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,560
to what they actually might be relative to all the other work

654
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,680
that they have to do.

655
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,920
And it's true that there's the security stuff.

656
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,000
But at some point, you've got to pull the trigger

657
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,280
and start really thinking about your project in a manner

658
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,880
where it's long-term accessible.

659
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,320
Yeah, I agree.

660
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,960
So we'll be keeping an eye on what happens with YouTube DL.

661
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
And I'll be thinking, I think we all

662
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,160
will think about this more.

663
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,280
And if the audience has additional thoughts

664
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,880
on this overall trend that we seem

665
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,120
to be seeing across a lot of different mediums,

666
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,280
I'd love to hear it, linuxunplugged.com

667
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,360
slash contact.

668
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,880
This seems like a great moment to thank Linode

669
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,560
for sponsoring the program, linode.com slash unplugged.

Receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

671
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,120
I've been using them for just over two years.

672
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,400
And I was really impressed with how straightforward

673
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
it is to spin up infrastructure.

674
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,280
And we were talking about how projects have

675
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,560
easier and easier access to this.

676
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,840
Linode is a great example of this.

677
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,560
I started using it for myself personally.

678
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,760
But then when it was time for Jupiter broadcasting

679
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,520
to go independent, we just built out our infrastructure

680
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,360
on Linode.

681
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,040
But they started in 2003.

682
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,600
They were one of the first companies

683
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,520
in cloud computing, three years before AWS.

684
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,760
And they're independently owned, so you know I love that.

685
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,440
And they're founded on a love for Linux.

686
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,360
And it shows.

687
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,600
And I've got a great example for you.

688
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,080
They already have Fedora 33 up and ready to go.

689
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,320
It released just like a day ago.

690
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,340
It's already up on Linode.

691
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,840
How great is that?

692
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,760
And it really shows.

693
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,960
They embrace a lot of great open source technologies

694
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,320
to make their really awesome cloud dashboard possible.

695
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,840
They also support Linux and open source initiatives.

696
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,640
They're supporters of the Kubuntu project.

697
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,440
They've backed Linux Fest Northwest,

698
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,640
which I am super grateful for.

699
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,040
And now they're backing this show as we go independent.

700
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,320
I mean, you get it, right?

701
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,120
They're really into the community.

702
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,840
You combine that with the fact that Linode's really

703
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,340
just going to make it possible for anything

704
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,000
you want to run on Linux to just run really great in the cloud.

705
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,200
And if you need something for your personal website,

706
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
so you can host a portfolio, or maybe you

707
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,240
want a static website that's crazy fast

708
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,880
and you just take advantage of Linode's object storage,

709
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,960
they're going to make that really approachable for you.

710
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,440
I mean, really, if you don't have

711
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
a site for your name and a portfolio,

712
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,800
so when people search you, it's probably worth it.

713
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,200
Because otherwise, something else will take that space.

714
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,160
So that's something to consider.

715
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,080
If you're looking for a job, I think

716
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,040
that's probably something you should definitely do.

717
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,840
They start at like $5 a month.

718
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,880
And you can build something on there

719
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,880
that's just crazy fast.

720
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,000
And people are looking at you for a technical job.

721
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,640
That reflects really well on you.

722
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,560
I have absolutely 100% checked out

723
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,880
how candidates have built their website before when

724
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,120
I'm checking them out.

725
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,000
So that's something to consider as well.

726
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,400
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

727
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,360
Sign up with a $100 60-day credit towards a new account.

728
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,820
That's a really great deal.

729
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,240
If it's meant to run on Linux, you can run it on Linode.

730
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,160
And you can run it really good.

731
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,860
And every single plan comes with their amazing human-powered

732
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,200
customer support.

733
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,440
It's really legit.

734
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,320
So check them out.

735
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

736
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,600
Thank you to everybody who goes there just

737
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,920
to support the show, to let them know you heard about it here

738
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,360
or takes advantage of that offer, a $100 60-day credit

739
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,160
on a new account.

740
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,840
Linode.com slash unplugged.

741
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,660
A couple of more items for us to address.

742
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,240
I thought this was really fascinating

743
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,280
that one password is now out in beta for Linux.

744
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,520
And there's a lot of options in this space

745
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800
already for Linux users.

746
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,440
Bitwarden's a popular one, of course.

747
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
We've covered it plenty on the show.

748
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,280
LastPass is a longtime contender on the Linux desktop.

749
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,460
And one password kind of comes along

750
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,100
at a time where there's already a lot of options.

751
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,240
But they seem to be really going in with full steam.

752
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
They've built an app that's written

753
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,080
with a back end in Rust, which we love.

754
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,880
They're proud to use also the, as they say,

755
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,120
incredible ring crypto library to power

756
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,080
end-to-end encryption to keep your data safe.

757
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,520
It looks pretty legit.

758
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,640
Now, before you get too excited, it's

759
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,640
important to remember that this is still a beta.

760
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
So expect some sharp turns and sudden drops

761
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,880
as you test this out.

762
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,320
Really, this should be used for testing and validation.

763
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
And if you want a, quote unquote,

764
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,040
stable experience on Linux, for now,

765
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,800
you should use the browser version, which I'll tell you,

766
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,520
Chris, that's what I've been doing.

767
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,440
My new day job, well, turns out they're using 1Password.

768
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,900
I'd only experienced the web stuff.

769
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,660
I had no idea this was being planned.

770
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,960
So I'm pretty happy about this.

771
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,020
And I've already got the beta installed this morning.

772
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,600
I think 1Password should be a sponsor on this podcast.

773
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,980
I'm going to say it right up front,

774
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,680
because I really like 1Password.

775
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,800
I think they have the best UI.

776
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,880
And this is what the company makes, right?

777
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,960
They're not part of a larger conglomerate.

778
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
This is what they do.

779
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,300
And they have a bunch of corporate users,

780
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,360
because over the last year or two,

781
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,320
they've done a ton of deals with businesses

782
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,920
where businesses just roll out 1Password for all their users.

783
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,480
I've been there, I've done that.

784
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
And the other thing they're doing

785
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
is kind of an introduction, which

786
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,920
I think shows maybe some insight into the community.

787
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,880
They say, if you work on an open source team that

788
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,560
needs a password manager, open a pull request in our 1Password

789
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,000
open source project repo, and we'll give you

790
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,320
and everyone on your team a free account.

791
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,200
I think they get it.

792
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,080
Well, maybe another sign of that is they're

793
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,040
maintaining signed apt and RPM package repositories

794
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,920
for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise

795
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,200
Linux, as well as the Snap Store.

796
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,240
Plus, if that's not enough for you, there's an app image.

797
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,440
Although, so far, nothing on the Flat Hub.

798
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,800
Now for yourself at home, listener at home,

799
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,780
I think you could really consider

800
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,440
looking at something like Bitwarden, especially

801
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,200
the Bitwarden Rust server that you can run yourself.

802
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,360
I think that's something you should definitely consider.

803
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,020
There's key paths as well that people

804
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,840
like for local password management.

805
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,300
But the reason why I think this is

806
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,960
noteworthy and why we elected to include it in the show

807
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,560
is this kind of is reminiscent of Active Directory getting

808
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,400
added to Ubuntu and having it in Fedora.

809
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,840
It's a way for Linux to plug in with Enterprise.

810
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,440
Or the teams coming to Linux, right?

811
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,400
Kind of the same thing.

812
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,560
You don't get to pick these tools.

813
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,480
They're chosen for you.

814
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,320
And that's kind of what decides if you can use your favorite

815
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,280
desktop or not.

816
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,920
Yeah, oh, and don't worry, Wes.

817
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,840
Yes, it is in the AUR.

818
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,120
I was worried.

819
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,680
Yeah, I know you were concerned about that.

820
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,440
I haven't given it a go myself.

821
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
But I guess so.

822
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,680
You've tried it, Wes?

823
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,220
Yeah.

824
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,600
Is it like an Electron app sitting

825
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,960
on top of a Rust back end?

826
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,400
Or is it actually a true native desktop Linux app?

827
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,640
Oh, you know, I didn't get that far.

828
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,480
I just actually tried it out for its features

829
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,780
and was trying to sync up with my existing vaults.

830
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,240
That's a good question.

831
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,080
It's hard to tell from the screenshot.

832
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,640
I can't really.

833
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,280
And I suppose it's fine, as long as it's not

834
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,600
too resource intensive.

835
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,880
You didn't seem to have any performance concerns,

836
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,720
it sounds like.

837
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,800
No, it started up real fast, and away we went.

838
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,720
They say it's this new look they're working on.

839
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,320
It has automatic dark mode selection

840
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,360
based on your GTK theme.

841
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,520
It also supports opening network locations,

842
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,200
like SSH and SMB and FTP locations.

843
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
And it will unlock your Linux user account,

844
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,360
including biometrics.

845
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,760
No way.

846
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,800
That's amazing.

847
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,560
What?

848
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,680
No, I got to look into that.

849
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,480
All right, I got to try this.

850
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,640
I got to try this.

851
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,400
That is one thing I think that's exciting,

852
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,440
is just looking at various password managers

853
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,400
over the years, it seems like people really

854
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,240
like one password just for their sort of response.

855
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,920
Very actively developed features, bug fixes,

856
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,840
all go out in a timely manner.

857
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,040
And here, yeah, it seems like they're not

858
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,560
trying to half-ass this Linux support.

859
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,040
It's not just throwing us a bone.

860
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,600
It seems like they really want to make it a platform

861
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,520
that they're willing to support.

862
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,880
X11 clipboard integration and clearing,

863
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,560
also a feature in there for auto-filling passwords.

864
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I got to try this.

865
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,180
If you try this and you like it and you buy something,

866
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,480
you tell them Linux Unplugged sent you

867
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,400
and that they should sponsor this show.

868
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,640
I think this is great.

869
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,960
I really do like seeing big, well, not big,

870
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,520
but independent commercial apps like this

871
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,080
that have really found a niche and gone after it.

872
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,840
I really do like that about them.

873
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,120
So there you go.

874
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,560
I guess I was on the fence, but reading that they claim

875
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,700
you can unlock with your Linux user account,

876
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,440
including biometrics, I got to see that integration.

877
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,920
And then the X11 clipboard integration,

878
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,360
I'm on Wayland presently, but I got to try that too.

879
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,920
That sounds like some sort of Mac fancy magic right there.

880
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,120
I'm just not believing it until I see it.

881
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,360
Does look like there's some Electron happening here.

882
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,440
So surely some of this is written in Rust

883
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,220
and then they're leveraging all the handy UI elements

884
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,860
that Electron provides, but easy install.

885
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,060
I just added the app repo to give that a shot,

886
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,680
but I like that they have an app image.

887
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,160
That seems nice, especially for a machine

888
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,080
that maybe I'm just using for work.

889
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,280
Wonder what the memory usage is on that there app.

890
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,200
You got any data on how much that sucker's taken down?

891
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,660
I mean, I kind of like that the important bits

892
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,100
are written in Rust and then the UI bits

893
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,160
are written in Electron.

894
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,440
I can understand why they're doing that

895
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,840
with multi-platform support, but yeah, not too surprising.

896
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,480
No, nothing much.

897
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,240
Not really showing up on my radar here.

898
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,080
All right, very good.

899
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,720
Well then, Wes, we have a few items.

900
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,840
I know people have been skipping the housekeeping

901
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,120
because I just saw someone in the chat room

902
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,720
who didn't know Unfilter was back.

903
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,360
So don't be skipping the housekeeping.

904
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,320
You know, it's politicals here in the States.

905
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,760
It's politicals right now.

906
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,540
And I'm going to be live streaming the election,

907
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,800
which is like coming at us like a freight train

908
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,800
off the rails like next week at unfilter.show slash live

909
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,920
if you want to watch that train wreck.

910
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,240
I mean, you'll just be streaming nonstop, right?

911
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,520
That's what I assumed.

912
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,460
Yeah, probably for weeks.

913
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,880
No, I'm just going to be there for the night.

914
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
I'll make a few predictions on the stream.

915
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,760
You know, we'll do that kind of stuff.

916
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,320
We'll do live commentary.

917
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,860
It's really about having a social outlet

918
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,560
to commiserate this together.

919
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
I'll be there with you.

920
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,720
But you know, maybe you'd rather do the Linux thing.

921
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,940
I want to remind you that we do have the Luplug

922
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,800
every Sunday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

923
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,120
You can see it on our calendar.

924
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,320
Just get the mumble client installed.

925
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,040
We have info for that on our website.

926
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,720
And then you connect to the lobby.

927
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,640
And I think we have kind of a special plan again,

928
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,040
another theme for the Luplug.

929
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,960
Indeed we do.

930
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,280
So you might remember that we had two weeks ago,

931
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,780
we had a talk about browsers

932
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,860
and that was pretty interesting discussion.

933
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,400
So the idea is now to continue with some kind of topic

934
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,000
every two or three weeks.

935
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,880
And next Sunday will be a topic about keyboard shortcuts,

936
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,720
mouse gestures, mouse button configuration

937
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,280
and stuff like that.

938
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,640
I will prepare a little talk

939
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,240
about how I configure my input devices.

940
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,640
And maybe some of you want to tell us

941
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,400
how they configured their keyboard and mouse.

942
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,520
So if you are interested into that topic,

943
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,760
we would love to see you in the lobby in mumble

944
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,480
for our Luplug next Sunday.

945
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,520
And there is something really special.

946
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,840
We might try to record that session too.

947
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,640
Ah, look at you guys getting fancy.

948
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,920
Very good.

949
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,360
Also a reminder, if you want to be a pro JB listener,

950
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,160
we do have the all shows feed.

951
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,360
You can upgrade to the all Jupiter broadcasting shows feed

952
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,960
by searching in your pod catcher of choice

953
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,600
or there's a link at Jupiterbroadcasting.com

954
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,360
and be sure to stay to the post show

955
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,940
because we will get a weather update with Brent

956
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,780
in the post show.

957
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,880
So you want to stick around for that,

958
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,880
but moving right along, extremely excited to say

959
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,840
that Fedora 33 is officially here.

960
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,480
It's Linux distro release week.

961
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,560
Like last week we had Ubuntu 2010.

962
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,760
This week we got Fedora 33.

963
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,880
It's like release week parties, like all around.

964
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,480
It's the release season.

965
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,520
I'm almost distro hung over at this point,

966
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,840
but there's enough in 33 here

967
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,240
that it kind of makes me excited to talk about it.

968
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,040
Wes and I went clean slate after last week's episode.

969
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,040
We went hard into 33 and I kind of just went all deep.

970
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,240
I think we'll start with what's new

971
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,640
because there's some major standout things in this release

972
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
that we've been looking forward to

973
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,260
and talking about for weeks.

974
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,000
Obviously, number one headline here is

975
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,600
this is the Fedora that ships to ButterFS as default.

976
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,160
When you install it, the default file system now is ButterFS.

977
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,760
And perhaps a reason to consider reinstalling this time

978
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,460
if you're so interested.

979
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,120
But seeing ButterFS finally ship

980
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,960
in a major Linux distribution,

981
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,680
I think is extremely exciting.

982
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,840
I think it's gotten to the point

983
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,040
where it's a really solid workstation

984
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,240
and VPS and laptop file system.

985
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,880
And that's exactly what they've done here

986
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,880
in the workstation versions of Fedora, it's ButterFS.

987
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,880
Yeah, I mean, we've kind of had

988
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,460
our own little ButterFS journey of late.

989
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,700
And okay, maybe things get more complicated

990
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,180
if you're building out your giant next NAS solution.

991
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,740
But I think you hit it right on the head there.

992
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,220
Do you want a modern file system that's maintained,

993
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,180
that works well and has a lot of nice features?

994
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,940
Well, ButterFS is it.

995
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,780
And having it used by Fedora, used by the folks,

996
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,540
the great people using Fedora,

997
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,940
all of the folks that that means,

998
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,300
that's just more people testing it

999
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,780
in all kinds of configurations and settings and environments.

1000
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,580
It's just going to make everything better.

1001
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,620
Yeah, and the reality is more and more people are on SSDs.

1002
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,060
Well, ButterFS is the file system

1003
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,100
that has optimizations for that.

1004
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,220
Data compression with modern disk and modern CPUs

1005
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,980
can provide lots of not just storage benefits,

1006
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,580
but performance benefits, data integrity,

1007
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,820
copy on write, snapshots,

1008
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,180
being able to send a file system over the network.

1009
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,540
It really is a competitive file system.

1010
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,380
And I think it's great to see it land in Fedora

1011
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,220
as the default.

1012
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,940
I think it's a very bold move.

1013
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,460
I think it's equally as bold in many ways

1014
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,660
as Canonical deciding to ship ZFS.

1015
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,740
But while that is fantastic,

1016
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,420
what is really exciting about this

1017
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,980
is not only is it the default on your root,

1018
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,980
but this is a free file system.

1019
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,340
I mean, this is clear and free,

1020
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,300
totally integrated into the Linux kernel.

1021
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,500
So it is truly just a baked in file system

1022
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,460
that feels like it's part of Linux.

1023
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,300
Yes, right.

1024
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,180
No weirdness with module loading

1025
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,300
or strange situations you have to debug

1026
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,300
because it just doesn't feel like it's part of the system.

1027
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,460
No DKMS concerns, right?

1028
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,700
It's just in there and you get all those features.

1029
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,220
And I've just really, really found it

1030
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,620
to be a great file system for my home file servers.

1031
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,700
But I'll tell you a little quick story.

1032
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,420
I recently went over to Angela's house

1033
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,260
to help her with her file server,

1034
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,420
which is a Synology, I think.

1035
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,620
Synology disk station, if I'm getting my, I'm not sure.

1036
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,660
But it's the one that uses ButterFS on the file system.

1037
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,980
And she's having some problems connecting to it.

1038
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,380
And I figured, well, this thing is six, seven years old.

1039
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,020
It's a really old NAS that's ran out in a garage, right?

1040
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,700
It's not kept inside in like a perfectly

1041
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,020
air conditioned room either.

1042
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,660
It's kept out in a garage.

1043
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,100
And it's been out in that garage for seven years

1044
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,780
with spinning disks.

1045
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,580
And I thought, oh boy, I thought I was coming over

1046
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,900
to deliver her the bad news

1047
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,380
that this thing is finally eating itself

1048
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,380
because it's a version of ButterFS

1049
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,980
that is from maybe, it's before the five series kernels.

1050
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,180
I mean, it's from a very long time ago.

1051
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,740
It's really old.

1052
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,420
I've done like one or two updates to the OS

1053
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,260
in its lifetime.

1054
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,620
So it's got a couple of updates on there,

1055
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,740
but it's a pretty old version of ButterFS.

1056
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,900
A couple of updates.

1057
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,740
Yeah.

1058
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,100
And so I thought I was gonna have to prepare her

1059
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,340
for the bad news that she had lost her data.

1060
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,580
And she's not really big on cloud storage.

1061
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,980
She likes it all local.

1062
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,740
And I was prepared to like, I was bracing

1063
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,340
and nothing of the sort.

1064
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,420
It was just simply an interface issue.

1065
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,380
There was a rogue DHCP server on the network

1066
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,660
and the NAS for some reason had grabbed an IP from that

1067
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,100
and didn't get its reserved address

1068
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,900
from the proper DHCP server.

1069
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
And it was a really, it was,

1070
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,020
when I got back on that NAS and I logged into it,

1071
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,500
I looked at the file system and every disk was online

1072
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,060
and everything read as healthy.

1073
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,580
I had a little bit more appreciation

1074
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,700
for ButterFS right there,

1075
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,940
because that's seven years of kind of neglect,

1076
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,420
but just reliable use and keeping that data safe.

1077
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,780
And you combine that with GNOME 3.38.

1078
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,580
And I think what we have here is a magic version of Fedora.

1079
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,820
33, that's a magic number.

1080
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,060
It's pretty impressive with just these two things alone.

1081
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,140
Nothing else really combined in the mix.

1082
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,660
It is a close to upstream version

1083
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,340
with a couple of small Fedora takes on it.

1084
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,140
Maybe my favorite is they've done a clever thing

1085
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,940
with the background where I'll kind of transition

1086
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,940
several times during the day to a different lightning

1087
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,780
and color.

1088
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,980
I actually don't particularly like any

1089
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,860
of the default Fedora experience,

1090
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,020
the theming, the background, any of that.

1091
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,420
So I can't really sit here and tell you that it is,

1092
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,380
it's gonna be the slickest best GNOME Shell implementation

1093
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,940
you're gonna find, but it is one of the purest,

1094
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,860
which you can very quickly build on top of.

1095
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:41,620
And if you are the type of Linux user

1096
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,980
who is okay doing a little bit of that work,

1097
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,220
a little legwork, not a lot,

1098
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,740
probably two hours of legwork,

1099
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,500
if you're familiar with the processes, maybe not even,

1100
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,620
you can really hone it in.

1101
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,620
Because I kind of like starting with a close to blank slate

1102
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,300
and just tweaking the things in GNOME Shell that I want.

1103
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,340
Minimal extension experience, you know?

1104
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,620
Well, it gives you a nice sort of idea

1105
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,980
of what it is like fresh.

1106
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,180
You know, if you install a distro

1107
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,460
that has a lot of customization, that might be great,

1108
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,900
but you're never getting to try

1109
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,140
what that stock experience might be.

1110
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,300
I mean, you're just lower down the tree.

1111
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,460
There's less branching off places

1112
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,260
to try radically different things.

1113
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,100
Well, and when you are installing extensions,

1114
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,020
it's not a bad idea to kind of do them one at a time

1115
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,700
and kind of get a sense for it.

1116
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:29,340
Here's what Fedora does that I think is tops.

1117
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,420
So I go to the GNOME extension site,

1118
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,120
and of course I'm getting this crap

1119
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,660
about needing the OS connector installed

1120
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,500
for the extensions to work.

1121
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,300
And I started thinking to myself, well, for God's sakes,

1122
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,460
Fedora doesn't have that installed,

1123
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,140
so I go to DNF, install it, and it says it's already installed.

1124
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,980
And I sit here and I scratch my chin for a second,

1125
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,580
and I go, hang on.

1126
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,900
I seem to recall that they put these in the repo,

1127
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,580
in some sense, whatever that is.

1128
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,500
And many of the GNOME Shell extensions that I use

1129
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,260
are in the repo.

1130
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
So I don't actually have to go to the extension site,

1131
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,940
and they get updated via DNF with my other packages,

1132
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,420
which is brilliant.

1133
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,700
And it's totally the way to manage GNOME Shell extensions

1134
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,120
in a way that I think works really well and reliably.

1135
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,740
And again, makes GNOME Shell

1136
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,420
a little bit more workstation grade,

1137
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,900
because the two are generally getting updated together,

1138
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,900
if you're lucky.

1139
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,500
And I think that's way better than going to a website

1140
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,700
and having to remember to go update your extensions

1141
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,580
from time to time.

1142
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,980
Because it turns out I never do that.

1143
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,820
No.

1144
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,100
So I'm curious to know what your kind of early impressions

1145
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,300
were of Fedora 33 and where you ended up with it.

1146
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,380
Oh, I've actually been having a lot of fun.

1147
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,900
I'd been enjoying GNOME 3.38 already,

1148
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,660
just having played with it the past couple of weeks

1149
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,500
since it's been out.

1150
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,740
But you're right, there's something really fresh

1151
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,580
about Fedora.

1152
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,700
It was nice to spend a little time

1153
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,340
before I really got the system invested

1154
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,180
with all of my default applications,

1155
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,300
and just sort of using Firefox, using default GNOME,

1156
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,260
exploring the system.

1157
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,080
I'm still enjoying, I installed it rather a few times,

1158
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,660
which I'll get into later.

1159
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,820
But it was really nice to just go through

1160
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,740
the GNOME welcome experience.

1161
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,620
And I'm just kind of impressed with how,

1162
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,660
for a distribution that tests and integrates

1163
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,820
all this great upstream open source software,

1164
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,180
I'm getting to be really impressed

1165
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,140
with how integrated and its own Fedora feels.

1166
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,820
It doesn't feel like just a grab bag

1167
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,380
of good open source projects.

1168
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,580
It feels like a thoughtful, crafted distribution.

1169
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,260
Yeah, I really agree with that.

1170
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,320
It really does.

1171
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,020
From the way the software updates are handled

1172
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,500
and the firmware updates, to installing the extensions,

1173
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,640
to all of that.

1174
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,820
But additionally, it's not so buttoned down

1175
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,300
that you can't make it your own pretty quickly

1176
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,480
if that's your thing.

1177
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,020
I admittedly just went and got the POP theme.

1178
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,460
I got the POP icons, I got the POP GTK theme,

1179
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,860
I got the auto-tiling extension.

1180
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,700
Oh, did you?

1181
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,220
I was thinking about that.

1182
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,380
What was the experience like?

1183
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,020
Because I didn't get down that road all the way.

1184
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,840
I mean, it's great.

1185
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,780
System76 just puts it all up on GitHub.

1186
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,620
So, and now, and now Carl has made it even easier

1187
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,340
to install in Fedora 33.

1188
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,180
Yes, sir.

1189
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,500
I packaged up the POP Shell extension.

1190
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,360
It's available as GNOME Shell extension POP Shell

1191
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,380
with hyphens in between.

1192
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,520
And you can just DNF install it and start using it.

1193
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,100
Yeah, so I pulled it off GitHub and built it

1194
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,260
because they put the instructions

1195
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,420
and it's really easy to do that.

1196
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,140
But there was some TypeScript updates that had to be done.

1197
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,240
I mean, there was some shenanigans.

1198
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,340
So Carl just packaged it all up, makes it even easier.

1199
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,060
And I'm a big fan of the look.

1200
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,840
I think it makes a really great theme on Fedora 33.

1201
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,700
Not to mention with that extension,

1202
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,620
there's quite a few of their shortcuts

1203
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,420
that conflict with default GNOME shortcuts.

1204
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,820
And I had that all handled with G Schema overrides

1205
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,940
in the package that you'd have to figure out

1206
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,700
those conflicts yourself if you were manually installing it.

1207
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,860
That's great.

1208
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:38,700
That's so great.

1209
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,020
So I did, you know, I had to do it the hard way,

1210
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,340
but now you could do it the easy way.

1211
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,980
And that sort of started to complete my experience.

1212
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,900
I was impressed too that the flat packs I installed,

1213
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,420
they seem to launch fast and adopt the theme that I'm using,

1214
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,920
which I'm really grateful for.

1215
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,940
So all that just worked really well.

1216
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,460
And I was on a Pure Wayland session

1217
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,100
because I'm doing this all on Intel hardware

1218
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,980
and I found performance to be exceptional.

1219
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,620
And it's noticeable now that I can do things

1220
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,940
that I couldn't do in Wayland.

1221
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,460
My monitor management is sticking,

1222
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,340
which is a huge win for me.

1223
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,300
If you guys have listened to this show for a while,

1224
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,740
you know I've really struggled with my two verticals

1225
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,060
and a center monitor setup.

1226
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,340
It hasn't been a non-issue using a Thunderbolt dock

1227
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,320
hooked up to a laptop running Fedora 33 on Wayland.

1228
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,540
It has worked, hallelujah.

1229
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,300
And additionally, I have found that performance

1230
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,860
has been even better than I got on X.

1231
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,060
Videos don't tear, games are playing just fine,

1232
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,460
even though they're X Wayland.

1233
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,380
It's really good, even with multi-monitors,

1234
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,920
which I was concerned about.

1235
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,160
I was concerned about a performance hit

1236
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,260
with Wayland and multiple monitors,

1237
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,620
but it is not so far bared out.

1238
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,400
And I'll say lastly, I can tell the functionality's

1239
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,240
really gotten there.

1240
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,620
I can take screenshots of various applications

1241
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,660
and then I can copy and paste them into other applications

1242
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,400
and all of that is working.

1243
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,400
There's a couple like Shudder,

1244
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,800
there's a couple apps that I used to use

1245
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,740
that don't work with Wayland,

1246
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,580
but for the most part, if you use the built-in tools,

1247
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,820
it's brilliant now, Wes, and they all look really good.

1248
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,220
It's almost to the point, I mean, okay, yes,

1249
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,860
there's all kinds of weird little niche cases

1250
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,700
if you're pushing things,

1251
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,580
but it feels like it's to the point where I kind of forgot

1252
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,440
that I was using Wayland and not X,

1253
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,860
at least for my, especially for like my use case

1254
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,020
of just using it for work as an actual workstation,

1255
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,300
not as a streaming or a test machine.

1256
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,500
Yeah, I'll add this into the mix too.

1257
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,860
Fedora 33 is the first distro to pioneer Nano

1258
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,180
as one of the default text editors as far as I'm aware,

1259
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,940
and I think that's a groundbreaking feature, right?

1260
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,060
Oh, you would.

1261
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,460
And so Nano, by doing so,

1262
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,300
makes Fedora accessible to humans,

1263
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,100
and now clearly is an easy distribution

1264
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,260
to recommend to beginners because Nano.

1265
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,100
Also, those of you on the plasma side of Fedora

1266
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,420
will be getting early out of memory manager

1267
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,800
that was shipped last version,

1268
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,620
but was on the GNOME side of the thing,

1269
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,700
of the distro, I guess,

1270
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,340
and now it's on the plasma side of the distro

1271
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,700
if you get the plasma spin.

1272
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,540
So that's kind of nice,

1273
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,400
and you also get swap on ZRAM by default now,

1274
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,940
which should help with performance as well.

1275
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,780
Yeah, I noticed that.

1276
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,600
Isn't that fancy?

1277
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,440
Yeah.

1278
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,060
There's one notable other addition

1279
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,680
to the Fedora family now in 33, right?

1280
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,340
And that's Fedora IoT is now an official edition.

1281
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,580
So that's kind of fun if you're out there

1282
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,780
potentially building something

1283
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,240
that could be in this ecosystem.

1284
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,460
It's now a actual official edition,

1285
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,060
which I think is just fantastic.

1286
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,620
But here's my final sell on Fedora 33.

1287
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,920
And this is where I think it is really nailing it right now.

1288
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,300
If you are using Arch, by the way,

1289
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,860
if you're an Arch user,

1290
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,980
and maybe it hasn't been just quite perfect,

1291
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,500
if you're a happy Arch user and you're loving it

1292
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,020
and you have no concerns at all,

1293
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,260
I'm not talking to you.

1294
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,300
But if you're an Arch user

1295
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,000
and maybe you got bit once or twice,

1296
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,860
or you're concerned about it,

1297
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,100
a little more rocky than rolling.

1298
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,100
Yeah, perhaps you should give Fedora a serious thought

1299
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,920
because it sits in this real nice nexus

1300
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,100
of close to upstream like Arch is,

1301
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,260
really fresh packages,

1302
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,100
like you're gonna get new kernel versions

1303
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,560
during the lifespan of Fedora.

1304
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,220
It's really easy to jump over

1305
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,620
to even the raw hide version if you like,

1306
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,260
but just with the current version,

1307
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,120
you're gonna stay pretty fresh.

1308
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,060
But major user land changes,

1309
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:20,540
like changing your version of Plasma or GNOME Shell,

1310
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,620
those are done at official versions, like 33.

1311
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:26,100
And you can plan for that.

1312
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,300
And you can essentially rely,

1313
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,020
in a world where your extensions come from your repo,

1314
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,660
and a lot of your applications

1315
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,140
are coming from Flat Hub and Flatpaks,

1316
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,740
you would be surprised at the success rate you'll have

1317
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,700
at doing upgrades, even relatively soon around release.

1318
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,340
It really is rock solid.

1319
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,660
And so what you have here is a distribution maintained

1320
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,580
by a major player in the space.

1321
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,620
You have a fairly frequently updated base

1322
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,300
with a stable user land that gets updated

1323
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,100
to the latest and greatest at every major release

1324
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,780
with a package management system

1325
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,980
that makes it really practical to actually do all of this.

1326
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,260
It's not hard to maintain.

1327
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,340
You don't have to be on this rocky rollercoaster of a ride,

1328
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,620
but you still get that really sweet nexus

1329
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,460
of fresh software, well-supported upstream,

1330
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:16,740
and a wide variety of packages to choose from,

1331
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,820
industry support, and also a growing community.

1332
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,700
I mean, there's a lot of positives here.

1333
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,820
I'm not trying to convince anybody

1334
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,500
to switch off of their beloved distro,

1335
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,700
but if this sounds like this appeals to you,

1336
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,940
I think Fedora 33 could be a serious contender for you.

1337
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,780
I can still have my Colonel Hipster dreams.

1338
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,980
Fedora 33 gets the stamp of approval from Linux Unplugged.

1339
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,660
I'm really loving it.

1340
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,420
I had to make it my own to get it there,

1341
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,100
but I have no problem doing that.

1342
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,380
But it's worth that little bit of investment, I think.

1343
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,900
Yeah, okay, maybe it comes a little raw,

1344
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,900
unconfigured, perhaps, but it's just built

1345
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,340
on such a solid foundation.

1346
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,220
And you're right, you're no longer waiting

1347
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,940
for software to become available.

1348
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,100
Pretty much everything just works.

1349
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,140
You can go grab whatever you need.

1350
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:03,140
Feels like you can get, finally,

1351
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,540
and this has been true for the past few releases, really,

1352
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,420
but it's this happy marriage of, okay,

1353
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,380
well, there's probably an RPM that works if you need that,

1354
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,860
and of course, a million other ways to get your software.

1355
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,660
And you get all the great systems and architecture work

1356
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,420
that the Fedora team brings in

1357
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,940
and makes the new future of Linux.

1358
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,460
I think one of the things that's really changed for Fedora,

1359
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,660
from Chris' reviews of the past

1360
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,020
where I really struggled with Fedora,

1361
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,940
like in the teens, in their early 20s of Fedora releases,

1362
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,740
is you didn't have mechanisms like Copper and FlatHub.

1363
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,020
And so when you add in the rather expansive now repositories

1364
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,380
of Fedora to begin with,

1365
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,180
then you add in FlatHub and you add in Copper,

1366
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,940
you can pretty much get anything you want.

1367
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,300
And AppImage, of course, and Snap's available as well.

1368
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,980
You could just install Snap on Fedora.

1369
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,340
There's nothing stopping you.

1370
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,100
So there's really the software availability

1371
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,980
has kind of gone by the wayside.

1372
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,220
And the kernel maturity and the desktop environment maturity

1373
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,700
is just always a default win for Fedora.

1374
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,780
So, you know, while we get here,

1375
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,940
when Ubuntu comes out first,

1376
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,420
we'll often go through the list of features in 5.8,

1377
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,500
and we'll go through the list of features in Gnome Shell.

1378
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,220
Of course, Fedora has all those as well.

1379
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,860
So it's a very compelling release.

1380
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,660
And I think it's, for now, an easy recommend.

1381
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,900
And you also get a chance to play with ButterFS,

1382
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,980
which, Wes, you put in the doc, and I missed it earlier.

1383
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,100
You have a crazy way to run ButterFS from RAM.

1384
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,460
Yeah, well, so this is nice.

1385
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,380
You know, I like to test out distros sometimes,

1386
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,060
run them straight from RAM, and Kexec in there,

1387
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,580
just as I get to play with, you know,

1388
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,300
it's like the benefits of a virtual machine

1389
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,340
where it has a whole disk.

1390
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,340
I can try out the default automatic partitioning

1391
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,860
and see what happens there.

1392
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,980
But I can also just blow it away and try again

1393
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,420
if I want to do things differently.

1394
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,140
What's nice about having ButterFS installed there

1395
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,740
is I can kind of make it work a little nicer

1396
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,740
in a hybrid approach,

1397
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,260
because I've got everything on ButterFS,

1398
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,740
and I actually just sort of changed my setup

1399
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,900
to put boot on ButterFS too,

1400
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,260
because I'm a madman like that.

1401
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,580
But what that meant is, here's my OS running in RAM.

1402
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,900
ButterFS has these awesome copy-on-write snapshots, though.

1403
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,140
So I take a snapshot,

1404
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,140
send that snapshot back to disk as a backup, right?

1405
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,100
So in case my computer breaks,

1406
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,700
or, you know, of course, these things that I run on RAM,

1407
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,260
they're on a UPS, all those normal things.

1408
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,180
But in the event of a power failure

1409
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,660
or a kernel panic or whatever, think that off.

1410
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:17,540
And then anytime I do updates or system changes

1411
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,380
on the system partition,

1412
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,540
all I have to do is take advantage of that snapshot diff

1413
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,780
and only send the diff,

1414
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,140
and I can keep a nice on-disk backup

1415
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,700
that I don't ever actually run.

1416
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,460
But if I need to, I can take that,

1417
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,700
restore it back into memory,

1418
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,100
and have a full, fast RAM disk on my computer

1419
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,460
system ready to go.

1420
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,740
You know, you are just a few short tricks away

1421
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,700
from like a bulletproof segment here of,

1422
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,900
I'm already seeing it now,

1423
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,660
Wes Payne's run your whole system from RAM safely segment.

1424
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,220
And then for just extra fun,

1425
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:49,180
we'll say do it as root the entire time as well.

1426
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,020
Because why not?

1427
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,100
Coming up on a future episode of Linux Unplugged,

1428
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,540
Wes loses all his files.

1429
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,380
I want to say thank you

1430
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:01,060
to our Unplugged Core contributors, unpluggedcore.com.

1431
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,060
You're helping keep Linux Unplugged independent.

1432
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,860
And that is appreciated,

1433
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,620
not just by your humble hosts here,

1434
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,020
but by the listeners of this podcast.

1435
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,660
It's a crew of you out there that make that possible.

1436
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,700
And you also help reduce the ad load needed.

1437
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,700
And we can be a little pickier

1438
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,620
about who we choose to make the show profitable.

1439
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,020
You also get some perks.

1440
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,420
When you become a core contributor,

1441
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,300
you get access to two feeds, your choice.

1442
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,980
Well, I shouldn't say that

1443
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,580
because you could actually do both if you're a maniac,

1444
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,700
but feed one is a limited ad version of the show.

1445
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,980
Same full production, Joe's touches on there,

1446
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,580
just limited ads.

1447
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,260
The ones that we contractually obligated are in there,

1448
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,580
but going forward with sponsors,

1449
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,260
we set them up and we kind of divvy it all up

1450
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,220
so that way the shows can be limited in ads for that feed.

1451
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,500
And that means if you're not a big fan of the ads,

1452
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,100
you get the same great production quality

1453
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,500
just without those.

1454
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,140
But they're his feed two.

1455
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,980
Oh boy.

1456
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,500
Now this is nothing like feed one.

1457
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,700
Feed two is a mess.

1458
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,540
It's horrible.

1459
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,580
You wouldn't listen to it.

1460
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:05,260
I encourage you never download feed two.

1461
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,860
I kid, but it's the full live stream,

1462
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,980
which means anytime we have a screw up

1463
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:13,180
or a pause in the show or anything that's a blemish,

1464
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,060
it's still in there.

1465
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,500
If we caught something that we would technically have pulled

1466
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,460
because maybe we said something that's inaccurate,

1467
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,340
we would cut it.

1468
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,540
But that, it's all in there.

1469
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,140
All the screw ups, full transparency,

1470
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,140
but you also get with that a lot more show.

1471
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,220
You get all the stuff that maybe gets cut

1472
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,500
because we didn't have time,

1473
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,860
but you get the pre-show,

1474
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,260
which is generally quite a bit of show.

1475
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,060
And you get the post-show that is a lot more

1476
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,260
than whatever gets released in the public version.

1477
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,020
So it's, there's some perks to feed two.

1478
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,460
And if you got a long commute, it's pretty great for you.

1479
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,940
And it's just a way of saying thank you

1480
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,980
for supporting the show.

1481
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,260
Unpluggedcore.com.

1482
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,940
You can become a core contributor of this here podcast.

1483
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,660
Keep us going, keep us independent,

1484
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,860
and you get a few perks.

1485
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:56,900
Emails coming into the show.

1486
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,740
Francis writes,

1487
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,140
hi, in the last episode of Linux Unplugged 376,

1488
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,940
you had someone on from System76

1489
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:05,660
to talk about the Thaleo Mega.

1490
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,620
As much as I'm a fan of both System76 and Linux Unplugged,

1491
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,580
I have issues with not disclosing the fact

1492
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:14,740
that System76 sponsors one of your other shows,

1493
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,020
which is Linux Action News.

1494
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,620
He says, I know that you have interviewed people

1495
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,380
from System76 previously,

1496
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,220
and I don't think those interviews were appropriate,

1497
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,420
but I feel that there's at least

1498
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,020
a perceived conflict of interest.

1499
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,380
It just made me uncomfortable listening to the interview

1500
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,700
with you not first putting a disclaimer

1501
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,380
about your business relationship with System76.

1502
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,220
Thanks for your understanding.

1503
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,060
Love the shows.

1504
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,260
Francis.

1505
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,260
Yeah, I knew when I talked about Pop2 is like,

1506
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,060
it's awkward because they do sponsor LAN.

1507
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,580
They don't sponsor this show,

1508
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,020
and I haven't offered this show to System76

1509
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,620
because, well, I am not really concerned

1510
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,540
about it impacting what I would comment on.

1511
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,740
I am concerned about the perception of it.

1512
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,220
And so if we talk about something in this show,

1513
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,820
it's because we wanna talk about it.

1514
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,940
Nobody asks us to talk about it.

1515
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,780
It's our choice and our decision.

1516
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,580
And I have had a, you guys, if you listen to the show,

1517
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,940
I mean, I've had no problem holding back.

1518
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,420
Like I went all in on criticism for Pop when it came out.

1519
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,700
And the thing about System76 and I,

1520
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,220
and really NetJB as a whole,

1521
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:20,220
is our relationship spans like 13 years now, almost.

1522
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,900
I was literally one of their first public customers.

1523
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,900
So it's kind of beyond, it's beyond like one ad deal.

1524
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,220
So one ad deal doesn't really influence

1525
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,140
what I say or don't say.

1526
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,940
It doesn't hold back my criticism.

1527
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:37,140
That's just how I roll.

1528
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,100
That's one of the benefits of me being independent.

1529
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,020
But I totally get the perception

1530
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,460
and the concern of conflict there.

1531
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,780
And so what I always do is if they're an actual sponsor

1532
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,060
in that show, I disclose it.

1533
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,660
If it's something like that would be like,

1534
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,940
say there was some sort of paid promotion,

1535
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,740
a paid thing like that, I would 100% always disclose it.

1536
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,300
If you don't hear me disclose it,

1537
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,900
my general default is just because we chose to do it.

1538
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,460
I asked to have her on, I wanted to know about it.

1539
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,460
I think System76 is extremely interesting

1540
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,100
from a Linux ecosystem perspective

1541
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,620
because they have been around for so long.

1542
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:10,660
They've been through the Unity years,

1543
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,860
the transition to GNOME,

1544
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,740
now they're making their own products more and more.

1545
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,580
And I think it's a really interesting,

1546
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,500
just bellwether in general for the Linux desktop,

1547
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,860
for Linux in business, Linux in education.

1548
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,500
So to me, they're a fascinating subject

1549
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,620
to follow on that level.

1550
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,500
But because they are so relevant,

1551
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,820
I also feel like they do make for a great sponsor

1552
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:33,300
because they fit in that nexus of interest

1553
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,300
with our audience, a company I know well and believe in,

1554
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,660
which means I've vetted them extremely thoroughly.

1555
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,580
And they have a legitimate message to get out

1556
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,900
that I think is, it's a good product.

1557
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,860
So they really, they sit in that kind of sweet spot there.

1558
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:50,260
But we will, as we begin picking on sponsors

1559
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,860
and stuff like that, this is kind of new again for us,

1560
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,100
we will try to be really receptive to this kind of feedback

1561
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,340
because it's, I want to get it right for you guys

1562
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,540
and I've got no reason not to be fully upfront with you.

1563
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,980
So this is something we will try to learn from

1564
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,780
and try to make sure we get right.

1565
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:07,700
And if somebody has some sort of like business relationship

1566
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,500
with us that could be perceived as influence,

1567
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,780
we'll try to disclose it.

1568
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,180
I kind of started playing with that

1569
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,260
when we talked about POP,

1570
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,340
because I knew there was like,

1571
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,940
there's something there about it,

1572
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,820
but I don't really have like the words for it yet.

1573
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,900
It's like, yeah, they sponsor Linux Action News,

1574
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,980
but my thoughts about POP are still my own,

1575
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,180
but I don't know how to cover it,

1576
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,420
but it's something we're thinking about.

1577
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,820
And Francis, I appreciate that kind of feedback.

1578
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,620
Wes, do you have like thoughts on, I don't know,

1579
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,340
lessons learned, what we could do differently?

1580
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,260
No, I mean, I think you're right.

1581
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,100
It is a little bit of a strange bundle

1582
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,900
in that they are a little closer

1583
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,180
than maybe some other sponsors or relationships

1584
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,020
and that you've been a customer,

1585
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,140
we've gone to events with them, we see them a lot

1586
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,940
and know a lot of the folks personally,

1587
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,780
but you are right that I think we try

1588
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:52,940
to keep things separate.

1589
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,900
And Francis has a great point that

1590
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,900
even if we feel these ways internally,

1591
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,260
it can only help to make that more transparent

1592
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,740
or as transparent as we can be that yes,

1593
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,100
we know these folks,

1594
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,300
kind of goes with a lot of the projects

1595
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,940
where especially over the years,

1596
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,660
you reporting on them, following them,

1597
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,140
sending emails asking for,

1598
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,660
hey, can you clarify these things?

1599
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,100
You just develop these relationships

1600
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,460
and it's important to make sure the audience knows that

1601
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,700
yes, you have those, but you're still gonna say

1602
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,540
whatever you want.

1603
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:20,220
Yeah, and I think I really,

1604
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,180
I gained more respect for them too

1605
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,300
when I really shit on Pop OS.

1606
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,220
And they, you know, they didn't like,

1607
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:29,340
I'm sure they didn't like it.

1608
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,020
Constructive criticism?

1609
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,500
Yeah, like, yeah.

1610
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,700
And I admit that I was wrong.

1611
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:34,820
I think it's actually pretty great.

1612
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,740
And here I am running the pop theme now on Fedora.

1613
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,380
Kat writes in, hi, Chris and Wes.

1614
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,780
Why don't we as a community acknowledge

1615
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,180
the freaking amazing level of technical support we get

1616
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,820
with our software for free?

1617
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,020
This week I had a great displeasure

1618
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,780
to contact a certain commercial vendor

1619
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,900
about a technical issue in their product,

1620
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,420
which we paid a lot of money to use.

1621
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,980
I couldn't get in touch with any qualified personnel

1622
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,660
who could actually understand the problem we were having,

1623
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,700
let alone fix it, and had to give up

1624
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,420
and debug the issue myself.

1625
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,820
Oh, I guess we're not spending enough millions

1626
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:10,460
to be able to have direct lifeline

1627
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,060
to whoever is actually writing the product.

1628
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,820
This got me thinking about the level of support

1629
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,300
we've seen on the Linux kernel mailing list

1630
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,700
and so many other places so many times.

1631
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,980
It's very easy to get in touch directly with the developers

1632
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,700
and who are generally relatively eager to help.

1633
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,300
And he has an example, he says,

1634
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,780
some guy posted about a hard drive which crapped itself

1635
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,180
and totally broke and broke his ButterFest file system.

1636
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,020
Okay.

1637
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,620
And he says that the ButterFest developer

1638
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,180
and a SUSE employee actually responded in a few hours

1639
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,860
by writing a custom recovery tool

1640
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:48,260
specifically for this individual's problem.

1641
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,300
Isn't that just great, he says.

1642
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,860
If this were a commercial project,

1643
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,780
you'd have to shell out millions each year

1644
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:55,220
to be able to have that kind of support.

1645
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:59,060
And it's more of the norm than it is the exception.

1646
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,660
He says, by the way, you have listeners

1647
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,340
even in remote places like Central Asia,

1648
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,820
love the show, keep it up.

1649
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:05,620
That is such a great point

1650
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,620
and one that I think can also contribute

1651
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,860
to developer burnout,

1652
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:12,580
but it is such a level of transparency.

1653
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,300
It's one of the reasons I think Wes and I

1654
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,940
like covering this space

1655
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,940
is because you can actually go to the mailing list.

1656
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,060
And a lot of times for a lot of the things we talk about,

1657
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,380
especially with Linux Action News, we just email them.

1658
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:24,660
Yeah, right, there's no secrets.

1659
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,060
The development's happening out in the open.

1660
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,180
The discussion is often out in the open.

1661
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,460
And yeah, once you're pushing these commits out there,

1662
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:33,300
it's not that big of a leap

1663
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,220
to actually just start conversing with folks.

1664
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,420
Oh man, Marty writes in with some feedback

1665
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:39,180
that I was just thinking about on the drive in

1666
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:41,500
from the woods today about how I wanna set up

1667
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:44,420
a local AD Active Directory server

1668
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,820
and I wanna try getting an Ubuntu box

1669
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,820
and a Fedora 33 box to both plug into it.

1670
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,980
I think that'd be pretty cool.

1671
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,220
So Marty writes, I was listening to episode 376

1672
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:55,180
and you mentioned Active Directory support

1673
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,180
in Ubuntu 2010 and the forthcoming Fedora 33.

1674
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,620
I'm a small time Fedora developer,

1675
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:01,180
but I run several different Linux distros,

1676
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:04,700
have for a long time and I run free IPA in my home lab.

1677
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,820
And it's remarkably easy to set up.

1678
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,500
The best thing about it is that it's available

1679
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,100
for my clients and there's clients

1680
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,620
in all the major Linux distros as well.

1681
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,540
Single sign on reality is here.

1682
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,900
Free IPA uses the underlying bits of 389 for LDAP,

1683
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:23,020
MITKRB5 for Kerberos and dog tag for certs.

1684
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,180
It's ridiculously simple to get up and running

1685
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,460
and get clients joined to it.

1686
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,900
It's very convenient.

1687
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,060
It also bundles in an LDAP enabled bind,

1688
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:32,260
which allows clients and servers

1689
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:35,140
to both get their own Kerberos secured DNS updates

1690
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:38,140
and do dynamic addressing.

1691
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:38,980
That's pretty great.

1692
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:40,980
He says, I even do domain replication

1693
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,740
pretty easily in free IPA.

1694
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:45,260
I run a multi-master on my home lab.

1695
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,780
I think it'd be really worthwhile for you to check it out.

1696
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,620
Well, hot dang Marty.

1697
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,860
I think that seals the deal.

1698
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,980
I think that puts it on the project list right there.

1699
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:54,780
Thank you everybody for writing in.

1700
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,460
Love the feedback, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1701
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,460
Anything we've talked about

1702
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,460
or anything you think we should talk about.

1703
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:01,940
You wanna get something in front of us,

1704
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:02,980
that's where you go.

1705
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,980
And last but not least this week,

1706
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:10,220
we have a pic for you that's rather topical.

1707
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,860
And it's called Annie,

1708
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:15,540
the fast and simple and clean video downloader.

1709
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,340
And you gave it a go this morning, Wes.

1710
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,180
I sure did.

1711
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:19,500
You know, it's written in go.

1712
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,140
Pluses and minuses, depending on what you think there.

1713
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,700
But it did mean that there was a simple little static binary

1714
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,060
I could go download and run.

1715
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,100
Hey, that's pretty convenient

1716
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,780
if you don't wanna go install things somehow else.

1717
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,500
Although there are downsides.

1718
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,980
But it was super easy to get started.

1719
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,100
And honestly, it had some really nice output.

1720
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,180
You know, it used the terminal display really well.

1721
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,980
Great integrated progress bars.

1722
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,700
And as much as I love me some YouTube DL,

1723
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:42,820
there's kind of a lot going on

1724
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,100
when it's printing all this information.

1725
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,980
And Annie felt a little bit cleaner.

1726
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:47,820
Yep.

1727
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,580
I think the flip side here is Annie's definitely younger

1728
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,380
and not nearly as full featured as YouTube DL.

1729
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,420
I mean, if you've ever looked at the YouTube DL man page

1730
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,940
or just the long help options,

1731
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,980
can do just about everything.

1732
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,300
Annie, it's a little more bare bones.

1733
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,100
Yeah, I agree with you though.

1734
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,420
I gave it a spin.

1735
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,900
I do like the output.

1736
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,620
It's gonna require you have FFmpeg installed,

1737
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,380
but I'm guessing you already have that.

1738
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,220
And it's quick.

1739
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,860
I think it launches and downloads faster.

1740
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,820
Yeah, you know, also it integrates with the tool

1741
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:20,380
I tend to use sometimes for downloading things, ARIA 2.

1742
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,220
Now, if you go that route,

1743
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:24,380
you do have to merge the resulting multi-part files yourself.

1744
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,500
But hey, FFmpeg's there anyway.

1745
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,620
That's right.

1746
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,460
Yep, it's a thing of beauty.

1747
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,380
So if you're jonesing for a YouTube DL alternative

1748
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,820
and YouTube is the primary use case,

1749
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,300
which actually isn't for me, check out Annie.

1750
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,540
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1751
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,620
It's hosted up on GitHub for now.

1752
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:44,460
Geez.

1753
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,860
Also, I encourage you to join us live next week.

1754
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,420
Join our mumble room, join our chat room,

1755
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:52,260
or just stream along over at jblive.tv.

1756
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:56,460
We do this noon, Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1757
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,300
See you next week.

1758
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,020
Same bad time, same bad station.

1759
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,700
And of course, there is that virtual lug

1760
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:02,540
happening on Sunday.

1761
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:03,860
You get your mumble client set up for that

1762
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:05,340
and then you might as well come by Tuesday.

1763
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,180
Don't miss it.

1764
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,300
And now go try out Fedora 33.

1765
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:10,020
Let us know how it went.

1766
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:11,900
Don't forget, you can also join our Telegram group

1767
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,420
if you want to join the conversation after the show.

1768
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:17,300
That's at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

1769
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,500
People are chatting in there 24 seven

1770
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,260
and it gets pretty geeky.

1771
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,300
So go get that.

1772
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,620
The show is at Linux Unplugged,

1773
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,460
at Linux Unplugged on Twitter, the network's at JupiterSignal.

1774
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,220
I'm at Chris LAS.

1775
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,700
And check out Wes Payne now on Linux Action News.

1776
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,980
Woo, woo, yeah, woo.

1777
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,300
Coming up in your feeds.

1778
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,140
See you back here next Tuesday.

1779
01:07:39,140 --> 01:08:06,140
I'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1780
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:27,740
All right, Brent is here with the report.

1781
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,740
Brent, is it snowing in Canada?

1782
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,900
Yes, today in the weather it might be cold

1783
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,740
for some of us outside, but it's always warm here

1784
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:37,220
in the Jupiter Broadcasting Mumble Room.

1785
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,260
There you go.

1786
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,060
There you go.

1787
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,500
If you do get cold, you can snuggle up close to Brent.

1788
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,180
Works great.

1789
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,380
Thank you for the update.

1790
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:44,340
You're welcome.

1791
01:08:44,340 --> 01:09:09,580
I'll be back to you.
