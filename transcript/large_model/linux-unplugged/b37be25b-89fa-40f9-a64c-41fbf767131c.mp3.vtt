WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Now that we're through the holidays, it's the season of events.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.900
And there's one that I was just looking through our list that we don't have in here.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.700
And maybe it's because it's like outside the US.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.800
But we got to include everybody, right?

00:12.900 --> 00:15.100
Of course we do. That just wouldn't be fair.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.100
No, exactly.

00:16.900 --> 00:20.200
Oddcamp 2019. That didn't make our list for this week's episode.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.400
It's going to be in Manchester October 19th.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.200
Jeez, that's like forever from now. That's like forever from now.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.000
It is. So you have plenty of time to plan your trip.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.800
Oddcamp is an unconference celebrating free culture,

00:31.900 --> 00:34.600
free and open source software, hardware hacking, digital rights,

00:34.700 --> 00:37.600
and all manner of collaborative cultural activities.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.400
It'd be pretty fun to go, Wes.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.500
I mean, I'm just saying.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.400
I know.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.900
Chris and Wes, mess up Manchester.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
I can hear it now.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.300
Yeah, you said it first.

00:47.300 --> 01:03.300
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 285, for January 22nd, 2019.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.200
Oh, hey there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged,

01:06.300 --> 01:10.300
your weekly Linux talk show that's all over the world recording live

01:10.400 --> 01:12.300
and mostly has its crap together.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.300
My name is Chris.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.700
My name is Wes. And speak for yourself, Chris.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.200
Hello, Mr. Payne.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.900
You know, I should, I should.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.200
It's just, when I look at today's episode,

01:22.300 --> 01:24.700
I think we must be going at an unbelievable,

01:24.800 --> 01:26.700
unstoppable pace, if you will.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.700
We have a bunch of really interesting community news,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.700
some that's getting a lot of attention.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.200
I don't know why it's getting so much attention,

01:33.300 --> 01:35.400
but we'll have Wes break it all down for us.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.200
Then we have a bunch of great updates,

01:37.300 --> 01:41.200
so many things to announce and to cover today.

01:41.300 --> 01:43.400
A lot of stuff going on in the community.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.100
Then we'll chat with someone, an individual,

01:46.200 --> 01:48.600
one crazy person out there,

01:48.700 --> 01:51.100
who hopes to make the next design tool for Linux

01:51.200 --> 01:53.300
to build applications, not just for Linux,

01:53.400 --> 01:55.800
but for other operating systems as well.

01:55.900 --> 01:59.900
And it's one of those tools that when you talk to developers,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.400
Linux desperately needs.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.300
And the plan to fund this thing is rather unique

02:05.400 --> 02:07.300
and seems like they could actually pull it off.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.300
So we'll bring on Alex, the main developer and originator

02:10.400 --> 02:11.800
behind this project,

02:11.800 --> 02:13.700
and see what he has planned.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.700
Then, in the second half of the show,

02:16.800 --> 02:19.700
it's undeniable that open source is facing a new,

02:19.800 --> 02:21.700
quote-unquote, headwind.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.700
Yeah, there's your business speak for you.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.700
And it's obvious when you look at things like

02:25.800 --> 02:27.700
the recent MongoDB relicensing,

02:27.800 --> 02:30.700
AWS's announcement of DocumentDB,

02:30.800 --> 02:32.700
which is a MongoDB rip-off,

02:32.800 --> 02:35.700
and so many other things that open source projects

02:35.800 --> 02:37.700
that are server-side projects

02:37.800 --> 02:39.700
that we're hoping for some significant funding

02:39.700 --> 02:41.600
once they grew to a certain size

02:41.700 --> 02:44.600
are being replaced by commercial products

02:44.700 --> 02:46.600
that offer all of the wonderful benefits

02:46.700 --> 02:48.600
of these commercial products

02:48.700 --> 02:49.600
and none of the openness.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.600
And it's a massive problem

02:51.700 --> 02:53.600
that's actually impacting the way

02:53.700 --> 02:55.600
these open source projects get funded.

02:55.700 --> 02:56.600
So we'll talk about that,

02:56.700 --> 02:58.600
and I'll give you my first impressions

02:58.700 --> 03:01.600
of Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo,

03:01.700 --> 03:04.600
which I've been running here for a few days.

03:04.600 --> 03:10.500
And it's fast.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.500
I'll tell you a little bit about that.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.500
But before we go any stinking further into the show,

03:15.600 --> 03:17.500
we must bring in that virtual lug.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.500
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.500
Good morning, everyone.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.500
Greetings.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.500
Hello.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.500
Hello, Bruce and Cubicle Nate

03:24.600 --> 03:26.500
and Mini Mac and Sean and Brent.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.500
It's good to see you back as well.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.500
How has your travels gone?

03:29.600 --> 03:30.500
I'm still traveling.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.500
It's kind of a crazy, crazy time.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.500
Wow, of course you are.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.400
I know.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.400
I know it's nuts.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.400
But good to be a little bit closer

03:37.500 --> 03:38.400
to you guys in the world.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.400
Where are you?

03:39.500 --> 03:40.400
That's a great question.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.400
I'm currently in...

03:42.500 --> 03:44.400
That doesn't sound like you know, Brent, honestly.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.400
I'm starting to piece it together.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.400
I'm currently in B.C.,

03:49.500 --> 03:51.400
sort of like southeastern B.C.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.400
Next week I'm in Quebec City,

03:53.500 --> 03:54.400
and we'll see after that.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.400
Okay, I'm in Texas,

03:55.500 --> 03:56.400
and Wes is in Seattle,

03:56.500 --> 03:57.400
so it's a good spread.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.400
We've got a good spread going here today.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.400
So let's start with the story

04:01.400 --> 04:04.300
that you may see shared the most right now.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.300
If you're listening around the time

04:05.400 --> 04:06.300
this episode is released,

04:06.400 --> 04:09.300
which is around the last

04:09.400 --> 04:11.300
or second week of January-ish,

04:11.400 --> 04:12.300
depending on when you're listening to this,

04:12.400 --> 04:14.300
there is a lot of discussion right now

04:14.400 --> 04:16.300
about vulnerabilities in apt,

04:16.400 --> 04:18.300
including remote code execution,

04:18.400 --> 04:21.300
which is also leading to other discussions

04:21.400 --> 04:23.300
about using HTTP versus HTTPS.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.300
So Wes, I was hoping maybe you could break down

04:25.400 --> 04:28.300
like what is the big hoopla about right now

04:28.400 --> 04:30.300
in regards to remote code execution

04:30.300 --> 04:32.200
and the man-in-the-middle attacks with apt.

04:32.300 --> 04:35.200
Oh yeah, it's been making the rounds today.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.200
And a security researcher by the name of Max

04:37.300 --> 04:39.200
found a remote code execution vulnerability

04:39.300 --> 04:41.200
in apt and apt-get.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.200
And really the first thing you should acknowledge,

04:43.300 --> 04:44.200
and we've talked about this before,

04:44.300 --> 04:46.200
is when you install packages,

04:46.300 --> 04:48.200
well, at least in the apt system,

04:48.300 --> 04:50.200
they have root access to your file system

04:50.300 --> 04:52.200
so bad things can happen.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.200
It's important to trust where your packages come from

04:54.300 --> 04:56.200
and go through the hoops to verify

04:56.300 --> 04:59.200
that that package actually came from the source you expect.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.100
Now combine that with the fact that,

05:01.200 --> 05:03.100
by default, at least in Ubuntu and Debian,

05:03.200 --> 05:05.100
your system is generally not set up

05:05.200 --> 05:07.100
to use an HTTPS mirror.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.100
So just plain text over HTTP.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.100
Now, most of the time that's just fine, right?

05:12.200 --> 05:14.100
As we said, there's usually at least checksums

05:14.200 --> 05:16.100
and almost always a GPG signature involved.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.100
So you can go check and verify

05:18.200 --> 05:20.100
that the package is valid.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.100
Yeah, so the actual packages,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.100
even if it's coming down over HTTP,

05:24.200 --> 05:27.100
the actual packages have signatures.

05:27.100 --> 05:30.000
Yes, okay, so here's where it gets a little bit trickier.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.000
Now, internally, when apt runs,

05:32.100 --> 05:34.000
it has an internal helper for HTTP.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.000
So the main process sort of spawns it off

05:36.100 --> 05:38.000
and says, here's all the packages I'm working on.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.000
Go do all the HTTP stuff.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.000
And then that process responds back over a socket

05:42.100 --> 05:44.000
to the main process with, like,

05:44.100 --> 05:46.000
oh, here's the URL or, you know,

05:46.100 --> 05:48.000
there was a redirect or 404,

05:48.100 --> 05:50.000
whatever the particulars of the transaction might be.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.000
What you didn't expect, though,

05:52.100 --> 05:54.000
is that, of course, it's an older utility

05:54.100 --> 05:56.000
and it's not a nice protocol

05:56.000 --> 05:59.900
and no, no, it's just line delimited plain text.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.900
Yeah, exactly.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.900
And the HTTP helper doesn't really handle the redirects.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.900
It reports the redirect

06:07.000 --> 06:08.900
and then the main process decides what to do,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.900
usually then issues a new request,

06:11.000 --> 06:12.900
you know, for wherever the new resource

06:13.000 --> 06:14.900
can actually be found after the redirect.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.900
There's like a multi-process architecture here

06:17.000 --> 06:18.900
where there's one part of apt

06:19.000 --> 06:20.900
that becomes aware of a redirect.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.900
It captures that and then it delivers it

06:23.000 --> 06:24.900
to another part of apt which then makes the decision.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.800
Yes, and also the helper is responsible

06:27.900 --> 06:29.800
for handling, like, unencoding,

06:29.900 --> 06:32.800
unescaping all the URL parameters,

06:32.900 --> 06:35.800
but it just blindly includes that in its output.

06:35.900 --> 06:36.800
It doesn't sanitize it.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.800
It doesn't make sure that it's carefully delimited.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.800
It just hands that right back to the main process.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.800
And so someone could sneak something in there, basically.

06:45.900 --> 06:46.800
Exactly.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.800
So if you construct a malicious URL in your redirect,

06:49.900 --> 06:51.800
you can basically tell the main process

06:51.900 --> 06:53.800
to go download any arbitrary package you want,

06:53.800 --> 06:56.700
which includes any arbitrary signature

06:56.800 --> 06:58.700
and because as we talked about,

06:58.800 --> 07:00.700
packages have root access,

07:00.800 --> 07:02.700
that's a remote code vulnerability.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.700
Okay, okay, okay.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.700
So really, it's a couple of things here.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.700
I mean, essentially, at the core of it,

07:09.800 --> 07:11.700
it's a man-in-the-middle attack

07:11.800 --> 07:14.700
which perhaps something like using HTTPS

07:14.800 --> 07:16.700
would potentially help with.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.700
So even though the packages have signatures,

07:18.800 --> 07:21.700
doing everything over HTTP means

07:21.700 --> 07:23.600
that the things aren't getting verified as they would

07:23.700 --> 07:25.600
if they was using HTTPS, correct?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.600
Right, so yeah, basically, there's two possible attacks

07:27.700 --> 07:30.600
and one is a compromised mirror itself, right?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.600
Somebody takes over the mirror that you're using

07:32.700 --> 07:34.600
and HTTPS doesn't help you there.

07:34.700 --> 07:37.600
You're kind of just screwed and your trust is broken.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.600
But the bigger thing and the thing that HTTPS

07:39.700 --> 07:42.600
can protect against is network attacks,

07:42.700 --> 07:44.600
things like BGP hijacks or anytime someone

07:44.700 --> 07:46.600
is able to be a man-in-the-middle,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.600
change your connection so that you are presented

07:48.700 --> 07:50.600
with someone who's not real.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.500
If you've got an HTTPS connection,

07:52.600 --> 07:54.500
then you have a root certificate somewhere

07:54.600 --> 07:56.500
that presumably your man-in-the-middle attacker

07:56.600 --> 07:59.500
can't attack or at least it's a lot harder to do that

07:59.600 --> 08:01.500
than just to, say, put a man-in-the-middle

08:01.600 --> 08:03.500
between you and your corporate firewall.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.500
Okay, so what's going on here?

08:04.600 --> 08:06.500
Because I did a little looking around.

08:06.600 --> 08:11.500
OpenSUSE's zipper uses HTTPS, DNF uses HTTPS.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.500
Why is Ubuntu and Debian not using HTTPS?

08:15.600 --> 08:17.500
Seems like they should be.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.500
You know, that's a good question

08:18.500 --> 08:20.400
and it's kind of been quite the debate

08:20.500 --> 08:21.400
for a number of years.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.400
Now, of course, you can use HTTPS.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.400
It makes some things like setting up,

08:25.500 --> 08:28.400
easily setting up caches in between,

08:28.500 --> 08:29.400
it makes those things harder.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.400
So there are some downsides.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.400
And you might have less mirror selection, of course.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.400
But security really comes down to defense in depth.

08:37.500 --> 08:40.400
And so while most of the time signatures are enough,

08:40.500 --> 08:42.400
HTTPS can really be helpful.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.400
So it seems like why not make that the default?

08:44.500 --> 08:47.400
You can still have HTTPS available as a fallback.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.300
That's fine.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.300
Just let users have the most security right out of the gate.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.300
I think it's worth mentioning

08:52.400 --> 08:56.300
that this isn't just a theoretical threat.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.300
On March 9th, 2018,

08:58.400 --> 09:00.300
there was a report that a Turkish ISP

09:00.400 --> 09:03.300
had swapped the downloads of popular software

09:03.400 --> 09:06.300
with their own hosted spyware infected versions.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.300
Now, this was mostly targeted at Windows users

09:09.400 --> 09:12.300
so us Linux users don't really need to worry about it that much.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.300
But the concept is the same.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.300
And a lot of tools that you would download

09:16.300 --> 09:18.200
to just make your Windows box run decent

09:18.300 --> 09:22.200
were replaced with their own infected versions of the applications

09:22.300 --> 09:25.200
where the download links were just using HTTP.

09:25.300 --> 09:26.200
And it does kind of make you think

09:26.300 --> 09:29.200
like this could be done on a larger scale.

09:29.300 --> 09:33.200
Say, this could be an attack against all Ubuntu users potentially.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.200
It might not be a common threat, but it is a very real threat.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.200
Well, you still, remember, have the package signatures here.

09:38.300 --> 09:40.200
You still have to have a valid package

09:40.300 --> 09:42.200
that passes the signature check.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.200
But that assumes that everything from the get-go

09:44.200 --> 09:46.100
was set up without a man in the middle.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.100
Right. And with this vulnerability,

09:48.200 --> 09:51.100
it was possible to add additional...

09:51.200 --> 09:53.100
Because you can have these same problems,

09:53.200 --> 09:55.100
let's say, if you started off with something

09:55.200 --> 09:57.100
that was affected from the ISO,

09:57.200 --> 10:00.100
which is often also not served over HTTPS.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.100
Oh, no. Oh, no.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.100
Now we're going down a rabbit hole of paranoia.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.100
But it is something I think that is worth thinking about.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.100
And it's gotten a lot of attention.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.100
We should note, too, that this is already patched

10:12.100 --> 10:14.000
in recent versions of apt.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.000
And you can mitigate it just by enabling HTTPS

10:17.100 --> 10:19.000
and using an HTTPS repo.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.000
So go do those things if you need to.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.000
In both Debian and Ubuntu, this has been patched,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.000
but you have to be on a supported version, obviously,

10:25.100 --> 10:27.000
to get those fixes.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.000
Do you think this is something that they'll address?

10:29.100 --> 10:33.000
Do you think in a period of time we'll see HTTPS apt mirrors?

10:33.100 --> 10:35.000
Or is this something that will just kick down for a while?

10:35.100 --> 10:37.000
This is a can that will continue to get kicked.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.000
What do you think?

10:38.100 --> 10:39.000
Oh, that's hard to say.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.000
You know, I could see it certainly in Ubuntu.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.900
The times, the landscape, it's changing.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.900
HTTPS is just about everywhere.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.900
There's been a lot of pushers browser side.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.900
I think everyone's just a little more comfortable with it.

10:49.000 --> 10:49.900
So the time's ripe.

10:50.000 --> 10:50.900
Yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:51.900
Yeah.

10:52.000 --> 10:52.900
All right.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.900
Well, let's shift gears and talk about something

10:55.000 --> 10:58.900
that I think is the Linux user's version of defragging your disk.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.900
At least it is for me.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.900
You know, when you talk to Windows users,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.900
they'll talk about how they love watching disk defrag

11:05.000 --> 11:06.900
because it's sort of peaceful,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.900
like just to sit there and watch the data reassemble.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.800
And then they used to debate, like, when should you defrag the disk

11:12.900 --> 11:13.800
and all these kinds of things.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.800
Well, I do this myself with the Linux scheduler.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.800
I'm constantly wondering, like, am I using the best IO scheduler?

11:19.900 --> 11:24.800
Am I using an IO scheduler for a server when I'm in a desktop environment?

11:24.900 --> 11:29.800
I've also heard that Manjaro will ship a desktop optimized IO scheduler.

11:29.900 --> 11:34.800
And I guess, Wes, while we're still having you break things down for us,

11:34.900 --> 11:36.800
I wanted to have you break down this story.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.700
To the best of your ability, what the hell is an IO scheduler?

11:39.800 --> 11:42.700
And then kind of related to that,

11:42.800 --> 11:44.700
could you talk about this article that we found

11:44.800 --> 11:47.700
where they attempted to use eBPF,

11:47.800 --> 11:49.700
which is a new feature in the Linux kernel,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.700
which is super cool that we should talk about too.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.700
They attempted to use eBPF to determine which IO scheduler is the best.

11:56.800 --> 11:57.700
Yeah, absolutely.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.700
Okay, so there you are, Mr. Chris Fisher,

11:59.800 --> 12:02.700
and you're doing a recording, you're making Linux unplugged,

12:02.800 --> 12:03.700
and you got to save those bytes to disk.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.700
So you tell your operating system.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.600
I mean, really, you request your operating system,

12:07.700 --> 12:10.600
go save these files to the disk, please.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.600
But of course, you know, there's multiple blocks involved there.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.600
Your disk is probably already doing other things from other processes

12:15.700 --> 12:18.600
and maybe users running on that system.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.600
So you got to have a schedule, in this case, an IO schedule.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.600
And that's basically the kernel takes the input blocks

12:24.700 --> 12:26.600
and the requests coming in and orders those

12:26.700 --> 12:29.600
and then actually ships them out physically to the disk

12:29.700 --> 12:34.600
to go get written to disk through whatever firmware is involved with your fancy SSD.

12:34.600 --> 12:40.500
eBPF is a handy new feature that you see in modern kernels that does bytecode.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.500
So you get to write cool little programs that get loaded into the kernel

12:43.600 --> 12:46.500
and the whole idea is to be able to instrument and get statistics

12:46.600 --> 12:48.500
on all the things happening in the kernel.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.500
Basically, think of it as the building block we needed

12:50.600 --> 12:53.500
to have D-Trace-like functionality on Linux.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.500
This case, Fred over at Circonus, which is a monitoring company,

12:58.600 --> 13:00.500
well, he's always been curious, right?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.500
What is the best IO scheduler?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.400
Because you've got a couple options here.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.400
You've got the completely fair scheduler.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.400
There's deadline. There's no op.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.400
There can be more options in general,

13:10.500 --> 13:13.400
but those are the ones he's looking at here today.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.400
There's got to be differences on your workloads, right?

13:15.500 --> 13:17.400
So eBPF is something that you can use.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.400
Circonus has their own monitoring agent,

13:19.500 --> 13:23.400
so he installs that on some Ubuntu systems.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.400
You wouldn't have to do that.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.400
They just happen to have a fancy eBPF plug-in for it

13:27.500 --> 13:29.400
because eBPF is the new hotness, right?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.400
And that lets him make easy graphs.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.300
He sends it up to their service, and he can make charts and stuff.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.300
What's funny is that ends up biting him in the butt,

13:36.400 --> 13:38.300
as you'll see later on.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.300
But it is still a pretty handy feature,

13:40.400 --> 13:42.300
and I think it shows that those sorts of functionalities

13:42.400 --> 13:44.300
are now becoming common even in commercial products.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.300
Yeah, so the real story here isn't really the results

13:47.400 --> 13:49.300
that they got from the test

13:49.400 --> 13:51.300
because it doesn't really tell us much, unfortunately.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.300
But perhaps the real story is,

13:53.400 --> 13:56.300
holy shit, eBPF is awesome,

13:56.400 --> 13:58.300
and now we have this functionality built in

13:58.400 --> 14:00.300
to the fricking Linux kernel.

14:00.300 --> 14:04.200
People probably will be familiar with the Berkeley packet filter.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.200
Super quick version.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.200
How is this different than what the BSDs have

14:08.300 --> 14:10.200
with the Berkeley packet filter?

14:10.300 --> 14:12.200
What is eBPF, and why is it way better

14:12.300 --> 14:14.200
and so cool that we have it in Linux?

14:14.300 --> 14:18.200
Well, eBPF is extended BPF.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.200
And really why it's neat is it's always been super helpful,

14:21.300 --> 14:23.200
and it's something you can use to write little programs

14:23.300 --> 14:25.200
to go catch network traffic.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.200
So it's what you're using under the hoods

14:27.300 --> 14:28.200
when you're using TCP dump.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.100
You write your little TCP dump command line,

14:30.200 --> 14:33.100
which is basically just a DSL for writing this stuff.

14:33.200 --> 14:37.100
TCP dump under the hood compiles it into BPF,

14:37.200 --> 14:40.100
into bytecode, and then runs it against the network traffic,

14:40.200 --> 14:42.100
and then you can set up these really tight little routines

14:42.200 --> 14:44.100
to match, like, oh, I don't know,

14:44.200 --> 14:46.100
only UDP traffic on port 53, for example.

14:46.200 --> 14:50.100
Yeah, and that bytecode is running inside the kernel

14:50.200 --> 14:51.100
in a safe way.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.100
It's incredible.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.100
You can do a lot of fancy analysis to sort of prove,

14:54.200 --> 14:56.100
you know, this won't loop forever

14:56.100 --> 14:58.000
and other sort of escape analysis.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.000
And what's neat about it is that it's extended

15:00.100 --> 15:01.000
because it's not just for network stuff.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.000
You can load it all over the kernel.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.000
So you finally get access to a bunch of information

15:05.100 --> 15:07.000
that you couldn't do without manually instrumenting

15:07.100 --> 15:09.000
and recompiling your kernel before.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.000
I think that's a really important point to make there.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.000
It's not just about networking.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.000
In fact, we did a deep dive in TechSnap.

15:15.100 --> 15:19.000
Go to TechSnap.systems slash 388.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.000
It's the one about eBPF.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.000
It's like a super competitive game-changing feature

15:24.000 --> 15:25.900
that's coming, well, it's arrived.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.900
And it's so nice that there's really high-end hardware

15:31.000 --> 15:32.900
being built around this functionality now.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.900
And so it's not something that's probably on your radar,

15:36.000 --> 15:37.900
but it's such a cool thing that Linux can do now,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.900
and I really recommend you go check out that episode

15:40.000 --> 15:40.900
of TechSnap.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.900
But in the meantime, it appears it's getting easier

15:45.000 --> 15:48.900
than ever for Linux workloads on Windows 10.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.900
Now, the Windows subsystem for Linux

15:52.000 --> 15:52.900
has been around for quite a while,

15:52.900 --> 15:56.800
but it has one huge limitation.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.800
And that is it's actually lacking a functional Linux kernel.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.800
Now, of course, you could fire up an Ubuntu VM or a Debian VM

16:03.900 --> 16:06.800
or what have you in Hyper-V.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.800
But it's not quite as functional and as easy

16:10.900 --> 16:12.800
to script and control as you would, say,

16:12.900 --> 16:15.800
be able to fire up a VM on Linux.

16:15.900 --> 16:18.800
That's where Canonical's multipass comes in,

16:18.800 --> 16:22.700
which today is coming out of private beta.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.700
And it looks pretty nice.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.700
Oh, yes.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.700
Multipass, at its core, is a service to manage Linux

16:28.800 --> 16:30.700
and really, in this case, Ubuntu.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.700
Linux, Ubuntu, they're virtual machines running on Windows 10

16:33.800 --> 16:36.700
but without the overhead of having to deal with Hyper-V yourself.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.700
Maybe, especially, I think, in our case,

16:38.800 --> 16:41.700
if you are a Linux user who might just have to use Windows 10

16:41.800 --> 16:44.700
for some reason, for whatever job or particular workflow,

16:44.800 --> 16:45.700
but you still want your Linux.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.600
I'm not an experienced Hyper-V administrator.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.600
I respect it, but I don't know it very well.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.600
So multipass is awesome.

16:52.700 --> 16:53.600
Right.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.600
It's sort of using Hyper-V as an implementation detail

16:56.700 --> 16:59.600
to just get really fast VMs fired up on a Windows box

16:59.700 --> 17:03.600
that you can now access and control from the command line.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.600
And once they're launched,

17:04.700 --> 17:07.600
a PowerShell user could fire off commands and scripts

17:07.700 --> 17:09.600
at multipass and the VM itself,

17:09.700 --> 17:12.600
including things that run inside the VM,

17:12.700 --> 17:14.600
applications that should be loaded

17:14.600 --> 17:18.500
and features that can allow you to scale up multiples of these

17:18.600 --> 17:22.500
or reproduce VMs for development purposes.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.500
Yeah, I mean, really, that's it right there.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.500
David Chalmers, a product manager over at Canonical,

17:26.600 --> 17:30.500
told The Register that that's exactly what multipass is aimed at,

17:30.600 --> 17:32.500
developers in a corporate environment.

17:32.600 --> 17:33.500
There's a lot of challenges to do.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.500
It's not a good workflow normally, right?

17:35.600 --> 17:37.500
You might have either a horrible command line experience

17:37.600 --> 17:40.500
that doesn't have like a full kernel and it's sort of confusing

17:40.600 --> 17:42.500
or you've got this full virtualized GUI,

17:42.500 --> 17:44.400
which again is not what you want.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.400
It's nice to see Linux everywhere, isn't it?

17:46.500 --> 17:50.400
Like this is becoming the runtime.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.400
This is becoming the runtime of the enterprise environment

17:53.500 --> 17:55.400
and that's why this is important.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.400
This isn't really at desktop Windows 10 users

17:57.500 --> 17:59.400
that want to play Steam games.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.400
This is designed for people in the corporate environment

18:02.500 --> 18:04.400
that want to use Linux as sort of a runtime

18:04.500 --> 18:06.400
that they can get everywhere.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.400
And you have all kinds of options now on Windows.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.400
It's sort of amazing.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.400
You have the subsystem for Linux,

18:11.400 --> 18:15.300
which gets you a pretty usable Linux environment.

18:15.400 --> 18:20.300
Now you've got these easy optimized Hyper-V VMs

18:20.400 --> 18:22.300
that are the graphical way to do this

18:22.400 --> 18:26.300
where Microsoft has worked with upstream distribution creators

18:26.400 --> 18:31.300
like Canonical to make an optimized environment for Hyper-V,

18:31.400 --> 18:33.300
which gives you nice things like keyboard and mouse

18:33.400 --> 18:35.300
and copy and paste integration and alt-tabbing in and out

18:35.400 --> 18:37.300
amongst other things.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.300
And if that's not your flavor,

18:39.300 --> 18:41.200
you prefer to work on the command line and script

18:41.300 --> 18:45.200
and shell script things, you've got multi-pass now.

18:45.300 --> 18:51.200
And it really is a sort of what works best for you

18:51.300 --> 18:53.200
kind of option on Windows.

18:53.300 --> 18:58.200
In this weird way, Windows 10 gives you ubiquitous Linux.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.200
You can have a window that has Ubuntu up,

19:00.300 --> 19:03.200
that has OpenSUSE up, that has Fedora up

19:03.300 --> 19:05.200
and is running multiple types of different virtual environments

19:05.300 --> 19:07.200
all on Windows 10.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.200
There's no excuse, right?

19:08.200 --> 19:10.100
As a Windows user, you can have Linux

19:10.200 --> 19:12.100
in all or some of the ways that you like.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.100
We're looking at a kind of modularity here.

19:14.200 --> 19:18.100
It's Linux modularity on Windows.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.100
But what if this went even deeper?

19:20.200 --> 19:23.100
What if this went to the core of Windows itself?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.100
And that might just be what's happening

19:25.200 --> 19:28.100
thanks to what may go down as one of history's

19:28.200 --> 19:31.100
most ridiculous technology story leaks ever.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.100
Think about this in context.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.100
A massive story about Microsoft open sourcing

19:36.100 --> 19:39.000
core components of Windows itself.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.000
Windows itself.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.000
What are you talking about?

19:42.100 --> 19:43.000
What are you talking about?

19:43.100 --> 19:44.000
That cannot be true.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.000
I know.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.000
And then, get ready for this part,

19:47.100 --> 19:50.000
it gets leaked by some mid-level employee

19:50.100 --> 19:53.000
who's just updating his LinkedIn profile

19:53.100 --> 19:56.000
because that is apparently what has happened this week.

19:56.100 --> 19:59.000
We've never talked about Windows core before.

19:59.100 --> 20:02.000
It has been a rumor for a couple of years.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.000
I have heard it kicked around for a couple of years now.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.900
But we've never seen anything about it.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.900
And LinkedIn is advertised as a place

20:09.000 --> 20:10.900
where people can share their work experience,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.900
find jobs, and mingle with their peers.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.900
And it's also over and over again

20:17.000 --> 20:18.900
a roundabout way to leak information

20:19.000 --> 20:21.900
about what massive corporations are working on

20:22.000 --> 20:25.900
because one Microsoft employee profile mentions

20:26.000 --> 20:29.900
the quote, open source components in Windows core OS.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.900
Yeah, the profile in question

20:31.900 --> 20:35.800
is a security program manager tasked with managing quote unquote

20:35.900 --> 20:37.800
the security of Windows core OS

20:37.900 --> 20:39.800
from malicious actors and code.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.800
Hmm, now that's a little confusing

20:41.900 --> 20:45.800
since Windows core OS hasn't been announced yet.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.800
And that is the exact name of rumors

20:48.900 --> 20:50.800
that I have personally heard

20:50.900 --> 20:52.800
from people that would be familiar with the matter.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.800
So I'm a little confused

20:54.900 --> 20:57.800
because they were just rumors that I was dismissing until now.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.800
And that same security program manager then said quote

21:00.800 --> 21:03.700
that he improved the security posture

21:03.800 --> 21:06.700
of Windows open source components

21:06.800 --> 21:09.700
through initiatives that investigate vulnerabilities

21:09.800 --> 21:13.700
found and establish a process for redemption.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.700
So if you connect the dots between the two

21:15.800 --> 21:18.700
you have reason to suspect that the Windows core OS

21:18.800 --> 21:22.700
is going to rely on some mysterious open source components

21:22.800 --> 21:25.700
which essentially brings us to the story now.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.700
Yeah, I mean there's been rumors about core OS

21:27.800 --> 21:29.700
I think since 2017

21:29.700 --> 21:31.600
essentially people are suspect anyway

21:31.700 --> 21:34.600
that it's kind of the core of a modular version of Windows

21:34.700 --> 21:36.600
customized for all kinds of devices.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.600
Microsoft already tried something like that with Windows 10.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.600
Remember Windows 10 mobile, Chris?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.600
Yes, I do.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.600
But Windows core OS seems to be purpose built

21:45.700 --> 21:48.600
for more cross-platform, if anything.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.600
What do you think of this, Wes?

21:50.700 --> 21:53.600
I mean Windows core, could you imagine Windows core OS being free

21:53.700 --> 21:55.600
and the next version of the

21:55.700 --> 21:58.600
and even they speculate in this article over at Tom's Hardware

21:58.600 --> 22:01.500
they speculate about the next version of Windows desktop

22:01.600 --> 22:04.500
being based on this Windows core OS.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.500
This lines up, right?

22:05.600 --> 22:07.500
It does and it doesn't.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.500
I think it lines up because we've seen huge moves by Microsoft

22:10.600 --> 22:11.500
in the world of open source, right?

22:11.600 --> 22:14.500
They clearly understand, at least in their modern tooling

22:14.600 --> 22:15.500
that open source is useful

22:15.600 --> 22:17.500
and they take advantage of it and contribute to it.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.500
But we haven't really, excluding some of the.NET stuff

22:20.600 --> 22:22.500
.NET Core and PowerShell

22:22.600 --> 22:26.500
we haven't really seen any inroads into the world of Windows

22:26.500 --> 22:29.400
and that's where the Windows branding on this makes it kind of stand out.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.400
Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning Visual Studio Code

22:32.500 --> 22:35.400
has been pretty well received.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.400
In fact, when you look at their open source project

22:37.500 --> 22:39.400
remember they just recently released Azure Sphere

22:39.500 --> 22:41.400
which is based on Linux.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.400
They open sourced the old MS-DOS recently

22:44.500 --> 22:48.400
TypeScript, WinForms,.NET Core

22:48.500 --> 22:51.400
They keep writing all those little handy command line utilities for Linux?

22:51.500 --> 22:54.400
There's a lot of little things that over the years

22:54.500 --> 22:55.400
have been sort of adding up

22:55.400 --> 22:58.300
and this Core nomenclature has been the direction they've been going

22:58.400 --> 23:01.300
PowerShell Core,.NET Core, Core, Core, Core

23:01.400 --> 23:03.300
I could possibly see it.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.300
The reason why I don't get extremely excited about it

23:06.400 --> 23:10.300
is simply because you know it wouldn't be GPL

23:10.400 --> 23:12.300
and I don't mean to be that guy

23:12.400 --> 23:18.300
but, you know, it's not going to change the world if it's not GPL

23:18.400 --> 23:23.300
The GPL is that special kind of license that really made Linux grow

23:23.300 --> 23:26.200
because when Samsung was contributing to the GPL

23:26.300 --> 23:28.200
or was contributing code that was GPL

23:28.300 --> 23:31.200
they had to also work with competitors at the same exact time

23:31.300 --> 23:35.200
whereas if Linux wasn't GPL licensed

23:35.300 --> 23:37.200
they could have just kept all those innovations for themselves

23:37.300 --> 23:40.200
not necessarily shared them upstream if they didn't want to

23:40.300 --> 23:42.200
and I don't know if we would have had the same success story

23:42.300 --> 23:46.200
with say the Linux kernel on Android or etc.

23:46.300 --> 23:50.200
Right, I think it's less of a really big philosophical moment

23:50.300 --> 23:52.200
and probably just Microsoft being practical

23:52.200 --> 23:54.100
Yeah, exactly, and it's still good

23:54.200 --> 23:56.100
I don't mean to like diminish

23:56.200 --> 23:57.100
Oh yeah

23:57.200 --> 24:01.100
Yeah, but it's not like change humanity good

24:01.200 --> 24:04.100
It's more like it's a practical kind of good

24:04.200 --> 24:06.100
That all said

24:06.200 --> 24:08.100
I kind of want to ask Brent this question

24:08.200 --> 24:10.100
This is really out there

24:10.200 --> 24:11.100
This is really out there

24:11.200 --> 24:15.100
But let's just say we're 10 years down the road after this thing happened

24:15.200 --> 24:18.100
If you could sit there and say

24:18.200 --> 24:20.100
I can switch to Windows

24:20.100 --> 24:23.000
and say it's Windows 15 or Windows 25 at this point

24:23.100 --> 24:26.000
and it's got an open core

24:26.100 --> 24:28.000
I can run an operating system with an open core

24:28.100 --> 24:30.000
and I can use Adobe Photoshop

24:30.100 --> 24:32.000
I can use Adobe Lightroom

24:32.100 --> 24:34.000
I can use Adobe Premiere

24:34.100 --> 24:38.000
But when I open up my file manager

24:38.100 --> 24:41.000
when I browse the internals in my operating system

24:41.100 --> 24:43.000
when I open up my web browser

24:43.100 --> 24:44.000
that's all open source software

24:44.100 --> 24:45.000
when I open up my text editor

24:45.100 --> 24:47.000
that's open source software

24:47.100 --> 24:49.000
It's just Windows open source software

24:49.000 --> 24:52.900
Do you think that would be a compelling proposition to you?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.900
I'm throwing in my mind

24:56.000 --> 24:58.900
how is that different than the Linux I'm using currently

24:59.000 --> 25:01.900
You can run proprietary software on the top

25:02.000 --> 25:03.900
and all the base is mostly open

25:04.000 --> 25:06.900
The only difference here might be that it's going to be Win32 compliant

25:07.000 --> 25:10.900
It can run Windows traditional software

25:11.000 --> 25:12.900
I suppose would be the major difference

25:13.000 --> 25:15.900
That and the fact that it's a different type of license

25:16.000 --> 25:17.900
Your Linux desktop is GPL software

25:17.900 --> 25:21.800
where this might be BSD, Apache or some Microsoft license

25:21.900 --> 25:22.800
Yeah, interesting

25:22.900 --> 25:26.800
I think it would hit some of my

25:26.900 --> 25:29.800
partly some of my ideals

25:29.900 --> 25:32.800
I know the difference in GPL is huge

25:32.900 --> 25:35.800
But for some people

25:35.900 --> 25:38.800
simply the idea that they can have open source

25:38.900 --> 25:41.800
and see it and modify it is enough

25:41.900 --> 25:42.800
But I wonder

25:42.900 --> 25:44.800
So maybe I'll throw a question back at you guys

25:44.800 --> 25:50.700
What would be the advantage for some Linux users like us

25:50.800 --> 25:52.700
to have simply an open source Windows

25:52.800 --> 25:54.700
and how would that be any different

25:54.800 --> 25:57.700
from a usability standpoint from what we have today

25:57.800 --> 26:00.700
I don't think it is a net win

26:00.800 --> 26:01.700
I don't know

26:01.800 --> 26:03.700
I'm not fully convinced of this

26:03.800 --> 26:06.700
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact changed my mind

26:06.800 --> 26:09.700
I feel like if it's not GPL

26:09.800 --> 26:12.700
then it doesn't really stand the chance

26:12.700 --> 26:15.600
of the long term infinite time scale

26:15.700 --> 26:18.600
humanity scale kind of contribution

26:18.700 --> 26:21.600
When we talk about Richard Stallman

26:21.700 --> 26:23.600
and when he's talking about free software

26:23.700 --> 26:25.600
I've never installed GNU slash Linux

26:25.700 --> 26:27.600
He's talking about

26:27.700 --> 26:29.600
He's talking about keeping something from humanity

26:29.700 --> 26:33.600
He's talking about making software code

26:33.700 --> 26:37.600
that is sustainable long term by humanity

26:37.700 --> 26:40.600
versus something that is closed and proprietary

26:40.600 --> 26:42.500
and that doesn't advance humanity

26:42.600 --> 26:43.500
And when you think about it

26:43.600 --> 26:46.500
in those larger long term contexts

26:46.600 --> 26:49.500
I don't see the net positive of it

26:49.600 --> 26:52.500
A GPL desktop with a full GPL software stack

26:52.600 --> 26:55.500
could be around for a thousand years

26:55.600 --> 26:57.500
But a commercial operating system

26:57.600 --> 26:59.500
even if components of it are open source

26:59.600 --> 27:01.500
much like Mac OS

27:01.600 --> 27:05.500
is inherently tied to the commercial whims

27:05.600 --> 27:08.500
and the ebbs and flows of

27:08.500 --> 27:11.400
the United States stock market

27:11.500 --> 27:14.400
It's not at the same scale

27:14.500 --> 27:15.400
What do you think Wes?

27:15.500 --> 27:17.400
I see what you mean

27:17.500 --> 27:20.400
It's not going to take over the world in that way

27:20.500 --> 27:22.400
It's sort of just incremental change

27:22.500 --> 27:23.400
and it's nice to see

27:23.500 --> 27:26.400
but probably we can all just stick to

27:26.500 --> 27:27.400
our wonderful world of Linux

27:27.500 --> 27:30.400
and our free and open source desktops

27:30.500 --> 27:32.400
I find that interesting

27:32.500 --> 27:33.400
It's nice to see

27:33.500 --> 27:36.400
but doesn't really change that much does it?

27:36.400 --> 27:39.300
It's kind of like something to talk about

27:39.400 --> 27:42.300
but it doesn't really affect too much

27:42.400 --> 27:44.300
Okay, well we should probably

27:44.400 --> 27:45.300
we should probably stop at this point

27:45.400 --> 27:47.300
because this is all just rumor

27:47.400 --> 27:49.300
related to some LinkedIn stuff

27:49.400 --> 27:52.300
but it just got us thinking about this kind of thing

27:52.400 --> 27:54.300
You can never tell with modern Microsoft

27:54.400 --> 27:55.300
It just makes you wonder

27:55.400 --> 27:56.300
Right?

27:56.400 --> 27:57.300
Where is it going to go next?

27:57.400 --> 27:58.300
Like that is legitimately

27:58.400 --> 28:00.300
what is at the core of the story

28:00.400 --> 28:02.300
is at this point

28:02.400 --> 28:04.300
I think we're ready for anything

28:04.300 --> 28:06.200
in Windows core

28:06.300 --> 28:09.200
and that even in itself really tells you something

28:09.300 --> 28:11.200
Now, I think also

28:11.300 --> 28:13.200
we could continue this conversation

28:13.300 --> 28:15.200
into our next couple of major topics

28:15.300 --> 28:18.200
including an application designer for Linux

28:18.300 --> 28:21.200
as well as this whole S-storm

28:21.300 --> 28:23.200
around MongoDB

28:23.300 --> 28:25.200
which we've been covering pretty diligently

28:25.300 --> 28:26.200
in Linux Action News

28:26.300 --> 28:27.200
but I'll recap for you

28:27.300 --> 28:29.200
in a wider context

28:29.300 --> 28:31.200
that I think I'm a little concerned

28:31.300 --> 28:33.200
could affect the fundamental funding

28:33.200 --> 28:36.100
of future large scale open source projects

28:36.200 --> 28:39.100
because it just seems like we'd come to a new normal

28:39.200 --> 28:41.100
and now all of that's out the window

28:41.200 --> 28:43.100
but I want to do a little housekeeping

28:43.200 --> 28:45.100
because there's so many community events coming up

28:45.200 --> 28:47.100
that I want to make sure we have one episode right here

28:47.200 --> 28:49.100
where we really kind of bust through this stuff

28:49.200 --> 28:51.100
All of what I'm about to tell you

28:51.200 --> 28:53.100
will be linked up

28:53.200 --> 28:54.100
at linuxunplug.com

28:54.200 --> 28:56.100
slash 285

28:56.200 --> 28:58.100
So let's bust through some of the things

28:58.200 --> 29:00.100
that are coming down the road

29:00.200 --> 29:02.100
First up, extremely proud

29:02.100 --> 29:05.000
happy, thrilled, excited

29:05.100 --> 29:07.000
to say that our

29:07.100 --> 29:09.000
live audio stream

29:09.100 --> 29:11.000
is now once again in working order

29:11.100 --> 29:13.000
and sounding better than ever

29:13.100 --> 29:15.000
jblive.fm

29:15.100 --> 29:17.000
You can plug that into your mobile web browser

29:17.100 --> 29:19.000
and it'll just start streaming

29:19.100 --> 29:21.000
You can go into VLC, like open network

29:21.100 --> 29:23.000
and plug in http://jblive.fm

29:23.100 --> 29:24.000
Boom, enter

29:24.100 --> 29:26.000
and you're now streaming our audio stream

29:26.100 --> 29:29.000
And Wes has been working on some cool stuff on the droplet

29:29.100 --> 29:31.000
to kind of like make it so that way

29:31.000 --> 29:32.900
even when we're like at Linux Fest

29:33.000 --> 29:34.900
or when Alan's streaming BSC Now

29:35.000 --> 29:35.900
it's all up in there

29:36.000 --> 29:37.900
Is there any open source in any of that

29:38.000 --> 29:39.900
that you're doing?

29:40.000 --> 29:41.900
Yeah, I mean, whatever we decide on

29:42.000 --> 29:42.900
There's multiple interesting tools

29:43.000 --> 29:44.900
They're all open source that we're using

29:45.000 --> 29:46.900
It's kind of a hot race right now

29:47.000 --> 29:47.900
between a couple to see

29:48.000 --> 29:49.900
which will actually end up in production

29:50.000 --> 29:51.900
The good news is they all work

29:52.000 --> 29:53.900
They all sound great

29:54.000 --> 29:56.900
And it means that if it's on jblive.tv

29:57.000 --> 29:58.900
it'll be on jblive.fm

29:58.900 --> 30:00.800
Yeah, and we

30:00.900 --> 30:02.800
I'm just super happy with the way it sounds

30:02.900 --> 30:04.800
We were very picky with where we went

30:04.900 --> 30:05.800
and I think it sounds great

30:05.900 --> 30:07.800
It took us a little bit to get there

30:07.900 --> 30:08.800
But if you're on the road

30:08.900 --> 30:10.800
and you know we're doing like Linux Unplugged

30:10.900 --> 30:11.800
or something like that

30:11.900 --> 30:13.800
just plug in jblive.fm and listen live

30:13.900 --> 30:15.800
It's really nice

30:15.900 --> 30:17.800
And also, just a little other bit of

30:17.900 --> 30:19.800
network related housekeeping

30:19.900 --> 30:22.800
I'm really very, very happy to announce

30:22.900 --> 30:26.800
that Jim Salter has joined Mr. Wes Payne

30:26.800 --> 30:28.700
as the full-time co-host for TechSnap

30:28.800 --> 30:29.700
Oh, yeah

30:29.800 --> 30:30.700
Yeah, you guys did

30:30.800 --> 30:32.700
You just put out your first episode

30:32.800 --> 30:34.700
Episode 395, TechSnap.Systems

30:34.800 --> 30:36.700
Slash 395

30:36.800 --> 30:37.700
All about Let's Encrypt

30:37.800 --> 30:39.700
You guys do a deep dive

30:39.800 --> 30:40.700
I love it

30:40.800 --> 30:41.700
I love it, it was great

30:41.800 --> 30:42.700
You know, yeah, Jim is great

30:42.800 --> 30:44.700
I'm really excited for where this is going to go

30:44.800 --> 30:45.700
because he has a lot of experience

30:45.800 --> 30:46.700
a lot of knowledge

30:46.800 --> 30:47.700
and some great stories

30:47.800 --> 30:49.700
So expect a lot more from the TechSnap program

30:49.800 --> 30:50.700
coming right up

30:50.800 --> 30:52.700
Yeah, Jim's coming to Linux Fest too

30:52.800 --> 30:54.700
so I'm excited to get to meet him in person

30:54.800 --> 30:55.700
He's an author

30:55.700 --> 30:58.600
He's a writer over at Ars Technica

30:58.700 --> 31:01.600
He's been running Apache himself

31:01.700 --> 31:02.600
on his own hosted systems

31:02.700 --> 31:05.600
since FreeBSD 3.1

31:05.700 --> 31:08.600
and he's been a fierce advocate

31:08.700 --> 31:10.600
of free and open source software since then

31:10.700 --> 31:12.600
and he's published some books

31:12.700 --> 31:13.600
he's published some work

31:13.700 --> 31:17.600
and, of course, you can read him on Ars Technica

31:17.700 --> 31:19.600
and he covers everything from Wi-Fi

31:19.700 --> 31:20.600
to NAS distributions

31:20.700 --> 31:22.600
and next generation file systems

31:22.700 --> 31:24.600
And our favorite, WireGuard

31:24.600 --> 31:27.500
Yes, he's just like you and me

31:27.600 --> 31:28.500
he's a big WireGuard fan

31:28.600 --> 31:30.500
so I don't think we could have found a better co-host for you

31:30.600 --> 31:33.500
and that first episode is out

31:33.600 --> 31:34.500
and go check it out

31:34.600 --> 31:36.500
TechSnap.Systems slash 395

31:36.600 --> 31:37.500
go subscribe

31:37.600 --> 31:40.500
because they're going to a new fortnightly schedule

31:40.600 --> 31:41.500
so it's not too much

31:41.600 --> 31:42.500
but when they do an episode

31:42.600 --> 31:44.500
it's information dense

31:44.600 --> 31:45.500
and I loved it

31:45.600 --> 31:47.500
Alright, so I mentioned Linux Fest

31:47.600 --> 31:50.500
You know, we're going to Linux Fest Northwest

31:50.600 --> 31:52.500
LinuxFestNorthwest.org

31:52.500 --> 31:54.400
It's April 26th through the 28th

31:54.500 --> 31:57.400
although I don't really know what's going on on the 26th

31:57.500 --> 31:58.400
26th is a Friday, right Wes?

31:58.500 --> 31:59.400
Am I wrong on that?

31:59.500 --> 32:00.400
But 26th is a Friday

32:00.500 --> 32:01.400
No, you're absolutely

32:01.500 --> 32:02.400
Normally it's like two days

32:02.500 --> 32:03.400
this time it's three

32:03.500 --> 32:04.400
so I'm not sure either

32:04.500 --> 32:06.400
but I guess that means there's no reason

32:06.500 --> 32:08.400
not to be in Bellingham on Friday

32:08.500 --> 32:10.400
Does that mean we're supposed to be set up Thursday?

32:10.500 --> 32:13.400
That fundamentally changes everything

32:13.500 --> 32:16.400
You know, I suspect it's going to be just slightly more official

32:16.500 --> 32:17.400
because in times past

32:17.500 --> 32:19.400
they've had things like game nights on Friday

32:19.500 --> 32:20.400
or other get-togethers

32:20.400 --> 32:23.300
so it's probably just a little formalization of that

32:23.400 --> 32:26.300
Yeah, it's going to be the 20th anniversary

32:26.400 --> 32:27.300
of Linux Fest Northwest

32:27.400 --> 32:31.300
and we have a huge Jupiter broadcasting crew

32:31.400 --> 32:34.300
We have team members that you haven't even met yet

32:34.400 --> 32:36.300
that we're still trying to get them on air

32:36.400 --> 32:38.300
so you can meet them

32:38.400 --> 32:41.300
We have, everybody really is coming

32:41.400 --> 32:43.300
with pretty much the exception of Michael Dominic

32:43.400 --> 32:44.300
from Koda Radio

32:44.400 --> 32:47.300
Alan is going to make it

32:47.400 --> 32:49.300
Jim Salter is going to make it

32:49.300 --> 32:52.200
Popey and Wimpy are hoping

32:52.300 --> 32:53.200
I think they're making it

32:53.300 --> 32:56.200
I think they're like 95% locked in

32:56.300 --> 32:57.200
Joe's going to be out here

32:57.300 --> 32:58.200
Noah's going to be out here

32:58.300 --> 32:59.200
Wes will be there

32:59.300 --> 33:00.200
Angela will be there

33:00.300 --> 33:02.200
It's going to be a huge

33:02.300 --> 33:03.200
There's people I'm not even

33:03.300 --> 33:05.200
because I could just sit here and go on and on

33:05.300 --> 33:07.200
There's a huge crew coming

33:07.300 --> 33:11.200
and we're going to have our Saturday evening

33:11.300 --> 33:14.200
parking lot barbecue outside of Lady Jubes

33:14.300 --> 33:15.200
Huge hit

33:15.300 --> 33:17.200
I mean, how many people do you think were there last year, Wes?

33:17.300 --> 33:18.200
Oh, I don't know

33:18.200 --> 33:22.100
It was probably right around 50

33:22.200 --> 33:23.100
and it was a great time

33:23.200 --> 33:24.100
People were coming and going and hanging out

33:24.200 --> 33:26.100
and there was always someone new to meet

33:26.200 --> 33:28.100
someone friendly to hang out with

33:28.200 --> 33:31.100
I suspect there'll be a Levi friend again this year too

33:31.200 --> 33:32.100
You bet

33:32.200 --> 33:33.100
You bet

33:33.200 --> 33:35.100
Yeah, I've already talked to Emma at System 76

33:35.200 --> 33:38.100
when you and I went out there to do the Thaleos coverage

33:38.200 --> 33:40.100
We made sure we were on the same page

33:40.200 --> 33:43.100
and we're going to do an even bigger cookout

33:43.200 --> 33:45.100
We'll have multiple grills going

33:45.200 --> 33:47.100
Lady Jubes will be there

33:47.100 --> 33:49.000
Bring your drones

33:49.100 --> 33:51.000
and bring a friend

33:51.100 --> 33:53.000
and come hang out with us

33:53.100 --> 33:55.000
I have the Meetup page up right now

33:55.100 --> 33:57.000
You can find that at meetup.com

33:57.100 --> 33:59.000
It'll also be linked in the show notes

33:59.100 --> 34:01.000
Let us know if you're going to make it

34:01.100 --> 34:02.000
We also have a Telegram group

34:02.100 --> 34:04.000
that is now linked in the show notes for Linux Fest

34:04.100 --> 34:06.000
So we have an official Linux Fest 2019

34:06.100 --> 34:08.000
community Telegram group

34:08.100 --> 34:09.000
linked in the show notes

34:09.100 --> 34:11.000
as well as the Meetup

34:11.100 --> 34:12.000
This stuff is getting official

34:12.100 --> 34:13.000
We're getting excited

34:13.100 --> 34:15.000
There's probably going to be several of your

34:15.000 --> 34:16.900
broadcasting friends hosting talks

34:17.000 --> 34:18.900
at Linux Fest this year

34:19.000 --> 34:21.900
Definitely going to be a big show

34:22.000 --> 34:23.900
Really encourage that you go to it

34:24.000 --> 34:25.900
All the details are linked up in the show notes

34:26.000 --> 34:27.900
Now, moving right along

34:28.000 --> 34:28.900
Like I said, we've got a lot of community events

34:29.000 --> 34:30.900
A couple of more to go over

34:31.000 --> 34:32.900
At the Pasadena Convention Center

34:33.000 --> 34:34.900
March 7th through the 10th, 2019

34:35.000 --> 34:36.900
is Scale 17x

34:37.000 --> 34:38.900
Again, we're going to be there

34:39.000 --> 34:40.900
We won't have a booth necessarily

34:41.000 --> 34:41.900
but we'll be at the event

34:42.000 --> 34:43.900
One of our team members at least

34:43.900 --> 34:45.800
Maybe more will be giving talks

34:45.900 --> 34:47.800
I think both Wes and myself

34:47.900 --> 34:49.800
I think, Wes, you want to go, Wes?

34:49.900 --> 34:50.800
Yeah, why not?

34:50.900 --> 34:51.800
Let's do it

34:51.900 --> 34:52.800
Wes and I will be there

34:52.900 --> 34:53.800
as well as another one of our team members

34:53.900 --> 34:55.800
that you have yet to meet will be there

34:55.900 --> 34:57.800
And it's going to be a great show

34:57.900 --> 35:00.800
The convention center is beautiful

35:00.900 --> 35:03.800
The location next to it has great places to eat

35:03.900 --> 35:05.800
Always a great community at scale

35:05.900 --> 35:07.800
So Jupiter Broadcasting is going again

35:07.900 --> 35:09.800
March 7th through the 10th, 2019

35:09.900 --> 35:11.800
at the Pasadena Convention Center

35:11.800 --> 35:13.700
ScaleExpo.org

35:13.800 --> 35:14.700
We have a link in the show notes

35:14.800 --> 35:17.700
And we also have a telegram group

35:17.800 --> 35:18.700
already set up for that

35:18.800 --> 35:20.700
which is also linked in the show notes

35:20.800 --> 35:21.700
I encourage you to participate

35:21.800 --> 35:22.700
in these telegram groups

35:22.800 --> 35:24.700
because this is really where you get

35:24.800 --> 35:26.700
all of the information as it's developing

35:26.800 --> 35:27.700
A lot of times we're at these events

35:27.800 --> 35:29.700
and things change quick

35:29.800 --> 35:32.700
And that telegram group is the most up-to-date spot

35:32.800 --> 35:36.700
And now, last but not least

35:36.800 --> 35:39.700
May 31st through June 1st

35:39.700 --> 35:41.600
at the Irving Convention Center

35:41.700 --> 35:43.600
right there by Dallas

35:43.700 --> 35:46.600
Texas Linux Fest 2019

35:46.700 --> 35:48.600
We will be there

35:48.700 --> 35:50.600
And I'm very excited to say that again

35:50.700 --> 35:51.600
Talks will be had

35:51.700 --> 35:53.600
Meetups will be had

35:53.700 --> 35:54.600
We will have a telegram group

35:54.700 --> 35:56.600
All of that as it gets closer

35:56.700 --> 35:57.600
We actually have a telegram group

35:57.700 --> 35:59.600
JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Texas

35:59.700 --> 36:01.600
for that one

36:01.700 --> 36:03.600
And we'll do a meetup as it gets closer

36:03.700 --> 36:06.600
And yeah, I don't know how many of us

36:06.700 --> 36:07.600
are going to go there because it's in May

36:07.600 --> 36:10.500
And we have Linux Fest in scale ahead of us

36:10.600 --> 36:12.500
But a couple of us at least

36:12.600 --> 36:14.500
will also be at Texas Linux Fest this year

36:14.600 --> 36:16.500
So that's a lot of cool events, eh Wes?

36:16.600 --> 36:17.500
Like, boom!

36:17.600 --> 36:18.500
Oh my god, there's so much going on

36:18.600 --> 36:20.500
So many great opportunities

36:20.600 --> 36:21.500
to just meet people, hang out

36:21.600 --> 36:24.500
and chat about our love for Linux

36:24.600 --> 36:26.500
You know, we give time to these kinds of things

36:26.600 --> 36:28.500
in the show because these events

36:28.600 --> 36:30.500
build stronger connections in the community

36:30.600 --> 36:32.500
And in a community where people are

36:32.600 --> 36:35.500
dedicating their passion and their time

36:35.600 --> 36:36.500
and they're scratching their own itch

36:36.500 --> 36:38.400
to create software for other people

36:38.500 --> 36:41.400
It is so fundamentally important to do that

36:41.500 --> 36:43.400
It matters way more than it does

36:43.500 --> 36:44.400
in other contexts

36:44.500 --> 36:45.400
Like in the business world

36:45.500 --> 36:47.400
there's this profit motive that forces

36:47.500 --> 36:49.400
everybody to be fake nice to each other

36:49.500 --> 36:50.400
and get along because

36:50.500 --> 36:52.400
everybody wants to earn a buck

36:52.500 --> 36:54.400
and nobody wants to take any big risk

36:54.500 --> 36:55.400
or loss

36:55.500 --> 36:57.400
But in the open source community

36:57.500 --> 36:59.400
we don't have that fake pretext

36:59.500 --> 37:01.400
that forces us to get along

37:01.500 --> 37:03.400
People can be jerks to each other

37:03.500 --> 37:05.400
and it's very counterproductive

37:05.400 --> 37:07.300
But these events

37:07.400 --> 37:10.300
and not just chatting with other people

37:10.400 --> 37:11.300
even if you're anti-social

37:11.400 --> 37:13.300
just going there and being around other people

37:13.400 --> 37:15.300
that like the same things you like

37:15.400 --> 37:16.300
or are giving you information

37:16.400 --> 37:17.300
about things you need to know about

37:17.400 --> 37:19.300
like through the talks and whatnot

37:19.400 --> 37:22.300
It changes the game

37:22.400 --> 37:24.300
And if you've never participated

37:24.400 --> 37:25.300
in an event like this

37:25.400 --> 37:27.300
it will take your passion for Linux

37:27.400 --> 37:29.300
and open source up to an entirely new level

37:29.400 --> 37:31.300
And if you haven't been in a year or so

37:31.400 --> 37:32.300
it will re-energize you

37:32.400 --> 37:34.300
That's why we talk about this

37:34.300 --> 37:36.200
It does move the needle

37:36.300 --> 37:38.200
And one last thing in the show notes

37:38.300 --> 37:40.200
If you've ever considered

37:40.300 --> 37:41.200
maybe giving a talk

37:41.300 --> 37:43.200
but didn't know how to start

37:43.300 --> 37:44.200
didn't really have any resources

37:44.300 --> 37:45.200
for public speaking

37:45.300 --> 37:47.200
Go check the show notes again this week

37:47.300 --> 37:50.200
Linux Unplugged dot com slash 285

37:50.300 --> 37:52.200
Link in there to a Github

37:52.300 --> 37:55.200
that has so many great resources

37:55.300 --> 37:57.200
about getting started

37:57.300 --> 37:59.200
how to find a place to give a talk

37:59.300 --> 38:02.200
just figuring out the best idea

38:02.200 --> 38:05.100
how to write a CFP which is a call for papers

38:05.200 --> 38:07.100
how to handle that and submit it

38:07.200 --> 38:09.100
and write it in a way that's going to get accepted

38:09.200 --> 38:12.100
and then tools to use for your presentation

38:12.200 --> 38:14.100
I'm pretty sure you found this link, Wes

38:14.200 --> 38:16.100
and it's just a killer resource

38:16.200 --> 38:18.100
Yes, and that's because our little

38:18.200 --> 38:20.100
local homegrown conference, Seagull

38:20.200 --> 38:21.100
provides that link

38:21.200 --> 38:23.100
and I came across it when I did a talk

38:23.200 --> 38:24.100
for that last year

38:24.200 --> 38:25.100
and it really is helpful

38:25.200 --> 38:27.100
There's a ton of great things about

38:27.200 --> 38:29.100
how to understand who are you presenting for

38:29.200 --> 38:31.100
what should your talk be about

38:31.100 --> 38:32.000
and how do you get started?

38:32.100 --> 38:33.000
There you go

38:33.100 --> 38:34.000
I know it was a lot to go through

38:34.100 --> 38:36.000
in the housekeeping section

38:36.100 --> 38:38.000
and I know that some of these regional events

38:38.100 --> 38:40.000
aren't applicable to most of the people listening

38:40.100 --> 38:42.000
but I hope our enthusiasm for them

38:42.100 --> 38:44.000
at least encourages you to participate

38:44.100 --> 38:46.000
in the ones in your area

38:46.100 --> 38:49.000
or maybe go do a talk even

38:49.100 --> 38:51.000
I think we could use a lot more of that out there

38:51.100 --> 38:53.000
One last bit of housekeeping

38:53.100 --> 38:54.000
I was just doing

38:54.100 --> 38:56.000
I'm down here in Texas right now

38:56.100 --> 38:58.000
for a bunch of content releases

38:58.000 --> 39:00.900
I was co-hosting the live stream today

39:01.000 --> 39:02.900
and I had a chance to announce

39:03.000 --> 39:04.900
a new course that Linux Academy released

39:05.000 --> 39:07.900
called the Linux Operating System Fundamentals

39:08.000 --> 39:09.900
First of all, it's done by

39:10.000 --> 39:11.900
a training architect named Kenny

39:12.000 --> 39:13.900
He's a great guy

39:14.000 --> 39:14.900
He loves Linux

39:15.000 --> 39:15.900
but better than that

39:16.000 --> 39:16.900
he's got a great voice

39:17.000 --> 39:18.900
and he's got great production quality

39:19.000 --> 39:20.900
The reason why I wanted to mention this course

39:21.000 --> 39:22.900
and I'll have it linked in the show notes

39:23.000 --> 39:25.900
is it's about the Linux Operating System Fundamentals

39:25.900 --> 39:28.800
but a good 40% of the course

39:28.900 --> 39:30.800
I've taken it myself already this afternoon

39:30.900 --> 39:32.800
before we went on air

39:32.900 --> 39:34.800
is about the history of Linux

39:34.900 --> 39:36.800
and the history of the operating systems

39:36.900 --> 39:38.800
that existed before Linux

39:38.900 --> 39:41.800
and then what led to Linux

39:41.900 --> 39:43.800
and then also GNU

39:43.900 --> 39:45.800
and the Free Software Foundation

39:45.900 --> 39:47.800
and the Open Source Initiative

39:47.900 --> 39:49.800
and then the Linux distributions

39:49.900 --> 39:50.800
that came after that

39:50.900 --> 39:52.800
and the tail end of it

39:52.900 --> 39:54.800
is the uses of Linux

39:54.800 --> 39:56.700
that we have now today

39:56.800 --> 39:58.700
but I just didn't expect

39:58.800 --> 40:01.700
this great history of all this stuff

40:01.800 --> 40:03.700
and as somebody who's been using Linux

40:03.800 --> 40:05.700
since the 90s

40:05.800 --> 40:07.700
I have to say there's areas

40:07.800 --> 40:09.700
that being self-taught I missed

40:09.800 --> 40:11.700
and especially some of this history stuff

40:11.800 --> 40:12.700
I just really loved it

40:12.800 --> 40:13.700
so I'll put a link in the show notes

40:13.800 --> 40:14.700
Right, that's what's really hard

40:14.800 --> 40:15.700
when you are self-taught

40:15.800 --> 40:16.700
you don't learn that

40:16.800 --> 40:18.700
when you go read bash tutorials

40:18.800 --> 40:19.700
it doesn't tell you about

40:19.800 --> 40:20.700
where all this great software

40:20.800 --> 40:21.700
you're learning to use actually came from

40:21.800 --> 40:23.700
Yeah, it was great

40:23.700 --> 40:25.600
and if you're not a Linux Academy student

40:25.700 --> 40:27.600
they do have a seven day free trial

40:27.700 --> 40:28.600
I remember that from the ads

40:28.700 --> 40:29.600
I used to do for many years

40:29.700 --> 40:31.600
so you can sign it for free

40:31.700 --> 40:33.600
for seven days and take it

40:33.700 --> 40:35.600
but I was talking to Kenny about it

40:35.700 --> 40:37.600
when we were prepping for the stream

40:37.700 --> 40:39.600
and I was like, oh, I'm taking this

40:39.700 --> 40:41.600
and then I actually did take it earlier today

40:41.700 --> 40:43.600
because being in Texas

40:43.700 --> 40:45.600
I have two extra hours before the show

40:45.700 --> 40:46.600
so I'm like, what am I going to do?

40:46.700 --> 40:47.600
I'll take Kenny's course

40:47.700 --> 40:49.600
because it's like an hour and a half total

40:49.700 --> 40:50.600
and so I took it

40:50.700 --> 40:52.600
and he just has a great voice

40:52.600 --> 40:53.500
and he has a great production

40:53.600 --> 40:55.500
so anyways, good job to him

40:55.600 --> 40:56.500
and it was a good release

40:56.600 --> 40:59.500
and I'm hoping, by the way

40:59.600 --> 41:00.500
kind of related

41:00.600 --> 41:01.500
I'm hoping that Kenny makes it out

41:01.600 --> 41:02.500
to Linux Fest Northwest too

41:02.600 --> 41:04.500
so that's possible

41:04.600 --> 41:05.500
we could see him there

41:05.600 --> 41:08.500
Now, there's a lot of talk this week

41:08.600 --> 41:11.500
about a new design application

41:11.600 --> 41:13.500
for our beloved Linux

41:13.600 --> 41:15.500
something that's really missing

41:15.600 --> 41:17.500
the ability to sort of sketch out

41:17.600 --> 41:20.500
a general design for other applications

41:20.500 --> 41:22.400
and it's called, is it Arkea, Wes?

41:22.500 --> 41:23.400
Akira

41:23.500 --> 41:24.400
Akira, of course

41:24.500 --> 41:25.400
of course I missed it

41:25.500 --> 41:26.400
of course

41:26.500 --> 41:27.400
of course I missed it

41:27.500 --> 41:29.400
and do I have sort of the general premise right?

41:29.500 --> 41:30.400
It's like a sketch application

41:30.500 --> 41:31.400
for UI design?

41:31.500 --> 41:32.400
Yeah, yeah, exactly

41:32.500 --> 41:34.400
it's not something you're going to use

41:34.500 --> 41:36.400
to actually make actual interfaces

41:36.500 --> 41:38.400
it's for designers to play around with

41:38.500 --> 41:39.400
to mock up designs

41:39.500 --> 41:41.400
to ship to your client as an image

41:41.500 --> 41:43.400
to say, does this look about right?

41:43.500 --> 41:45.400
So Akira has been getting a lot of attention

41:45.500 --> 41:46.400
because this is an area

41:46.500 --> 41:49.400
that there's a lot of commercial solutions for

41:49.400 --> 41:52.300
including ones from Adobe and many others

41:52.400 --> 41:54.300
and there's not a lot of options

41:54.400 --> 41:56.300
for GNU slash Linux

41:56.400 --> 41:59.300
and Wes had a chance to sit down with Alex

41:59.400 --> 42:00.300
and talk to him about his Kickstarter

42:00.400 --> 42:02.300
that he's doing to try to raise money

42:02.400 --> 42:04.300
and to try to get people

42:04.400 --> 42:06.300
to develop for this thing full time

42:06.400 --> 42:07.300
it's a fascinating idea

42:07.400 --> 42:08.300
is there anything else we need to know

42:08.400 --> 42:10.300
before we listen to the interview, Wes?

42:10.400 --> 42:11.300
No, I don't think so

42:11.400 --> 42:12.300
Alex is the lead

42:12.400 --> 42:13.300
there's a broader team

42:13.400 --> 42:14.300
which he'll talk about

42:14.400 --> 42:16.300
Awesome, so here we are

42:16.400 --> 42:17.300
Welcome to the show, Alex

42:17.300 --> 42:19.200
and thank you for joining us today

42:19.300 --> 42:20.200
Thank you so much for having me

42:20.300 --> 42:22.200
it's a pleasure, absolutely

42:22.300 --> 42:24.200
Okay, well you're obviously here

42:24.300 --> 42:26.200
I mean, one, because you make a lot of good stuff

42:26.300 --> 42:30.200
actually I first saw your taxi application

42:30.300 --> 42:32.200
it's really pretty handy

42:32.300 --> 42:34.200
it's not what you're here to talk about today

42:34.300 --> 42:35.200
but it might come up again

42:35.300 --> 42:37.200
because you've got quite the background

42:37.300 --> 42:39.200
we're here to talk about Akira

42:39.300 --> 42:40.200
Yes, absolutely

42:40.300 --> 42:43.200
so just a little digression about taxis

42:43.300 --> 42:46.200
it's not 100% mine

42:46.200 --> 42:49.100
it's an old project that I took

42:49.200 --> 42:51.100
and I'm redeveloping

42:51.200 --> 42:54.100
and I'm refactoring and trying to update

42:54.200 --> 42:56.100
so I don't want to take all the credits for taxis

42:56.200 --> 42:58.100
it's not 100% mine

42:58.200 --> 43:01.100
but yes, I'm here to talk about Akira

43:01.200 --> 43:04.100
so I just launched a Kickstarter campaign

43:04.200 --> 43:05.100
for Akira

43:05.200 --> 43:08.100
or someone likes to call it Akira UX

43:08.200 --> 43:13.100
which is a UX design tool for Linux

43:13.200 --> 43:14.100
100% native for Linux

43:14.100 --> 43:16.000
it's not an electron app

43:16.100 --> 43:18.000
and UX design tools means

43:18.100 --> 43:21.000
that it's something similar to Sketch

43:21.100 --> 43:22.000
or Figma

43:22.100 --> 43:23.000
or Adobe XD

43:23.100 --> 43:27.000
that is not for creating GTK

43:27.100 --> 43:29.000
or Qt interfaces

43:29.100 --> 43:31.000
user interfaces like code

43:31.100 --> 43:34.000
is not made to speed out code

43:34.100 --> 43:35.000
That's a great point

43:35.100 --> 43:36.000
so it's not like something like Glade

43:36.100 --> 43:37.000
or Qt Creator

43:37.100 --> 43:39.000
it's not going to make a QXML file

43:39.100 --> 43:41.000
or anything like that for you

43:41.100 --> 43:43.000
so what formats are we talking about here?

43:43.000 --> 43:44.900
So basically, if I'm going to be a user

43:45.000 --> 43:46.900
what are we going to have as the output?

43:47.000 --> 43:47.900
Okay, the output

43:48.000 --> 43:49.900
the name probably is going to be

43:50.000 --> 43:51.900
like.Akira

43:52.000 --> 43:52.900
like a custom extension

43:53.000 --> 43:54.900
but it's just an SVG

43:55.000 --> 43:57.900
everything is going to be based on SVG

43:58.000 --> 44:00.900
we want to go the route of having a custom extension

44:01.000 --> 44:02.900
because we're going to try to save the file

44:03.000 --> 44:04.900
with a JSON format

44:05.000 --> 44:06.900
in order to have version control

44:07.000 --> 44:08.900
baked into your file

44:09.000 --> 44:10.900
that you can activate or deactivate

44:10.900 --> 44:12.800
based on your necessities

44:12.900 --> 44:16.800
so you can keep track of all the different versions of your file

44:16.900 --> 44:17.800
in the same file

44:17.900 --> 44:19.800
you don't have to have a dedicated repository

44:19.900 --> 44:21.800
or like the things that we used to do

44:21.900 --> 44:22.800
having version 1

44:22.900 --> 44:23.800
version 1 final

44:23.900 --> 44:25.800
version 1 final underscore reviewed

44:25.900 --> 44:26.800
version 1 final

44:26.900 --> 44:28.800
this is the actual final

44:28.900 --> 44:30.800
all this kind of good stuff

44:30.900 --> 44:32.800
when you do some design

44:32.900 --> 44:33.800
for a long time

44:33.900 --> 44:35.800
for a client that is never

44:35.900 --> 44:37.800
100% sure what to do

44:37.900 --> 44:38.800
That's fascinating

44:38.800 --> 44:40.700
obviously on the development side

44:40.800 --> 44:42.700
and you play in both these worlds

44:42.800 --> 44:44.700
on the development side version control goes back ages

44:44.800 --> 44:47.700
but I don't see it as often in the design community

44:47.800 --> 44:48.700
or at least not as standardized

44:48.800 --> 44:49.700
Exactly

44:49.800 --> 44:50.700
Sketch

44:50.800 --> 44:52.700
from like

44:52.800 --> 44:54.700
the Sketch app application

44:54.800 --> 44:56.700
that is currently only available on Mac OS

44:56.800 --> 44:58.700
has something like that

44:58.800 --> 45:00.700
but it's terrible

45:00.800 --> 45:02.700
because every time you save something

45:02.800 --> 45:04.700
like you move a square

45:04.800 --> 45:06.700
or you change one letter

45:06.800 --> 45:07.700
and you save the file

45:07.700 --> 45:09.600
it saves completely the entire file

45:09.700 --> 45:10.600
in itself

45:10.700 --> 45:12.600
so you end up with having a Sketch file

45:12.700 --> 45:15.600
that even if you have just one single artboard

45:15.700 --> 45:17.600
it waits for gigabytes

45:17.700 --> 45:18.600
Oh wow

45:18.700 --> 45:19.600
It's terrible

45:19.700 --> 45:20.600
yeah it's like

45:20.700 --> 45:22.600
it's really handy if you lose stuff

45:22.700 --> 45:23.600
and you can go back

45:23.700 --> 45:25.600
but there's no way of

45:25.700 --> 45:27.600
manually controlling what you can

45:27.700 --> 45:29.600
what you can save

45:29.700 --> 45:31.600
or if you want to pause

45:31.700 --> 45:33.600
the version control of this file

45:33.700 --> 45:34.600
and just like

45:34.700 --> 45:36.600
activate it only if you have some major release

45:36.600 --> 45:37.500
or stuff like that

45:37.600 --> 45:38.500
I'd say it's like

45:38.600 --> 45:39.500
it's the first approach

45:39.600 --> 45:40.500
of version controlling design

45:40.600 --> 45:42.500
but it's not that great

45:42.600 --> 45:43.500
That makes sense

45:43.600 --> 45:45.500
Okay well let's pivot back to Akira then

45:45.600 --> 45:46.500
and we were just starting to get there

45:46.600 --> 45:47.500
before I went down the other road

45:47.600 --> 45:48.500
of explaining just what you're targeting

45:48.600 --> 45:50.500
so you'll be outputting SVG

45:50.600 --> 45:53.500
so Akira is for designing interfaces

45:53.600 --> 45:55.500
and then producing vector images

45:55.600 --> 45:56.500
that you then might go share

45:56.600 --> 45:57.500
with the people downstream

45:57.600 --> 45:59.500
who actually built the thing

45:59.600 --> 46:00.500
Exactly

46:00.600 --> 46:02.500
It's mostly for designers

46:02.600 --> 46:03.500
which

46:03.600 --> 46:05.500
someone raised an eyebrows

46:05.500 --> 46:07.400
that oh why developers cannot use it

46:07.500 --> 46:08.400
why

46:08.500 --> 46:10.400
a lot of questions they were asked

46:10.500 --> 46:12.400
why Akira cannot generate code

46:12.500 --> 46:14.400
because we already have those things

46:14.500 --> 46:16.400
we already have those alternatives

46:16.500 --> 46:17.400
and those options

46:17.500 --> 46:19.400
something specifically targeting designers

46:19.500 --> 46:21.400
that they need to create

46:21.500 --> 46:22.400
just images

46:22.500 --> 46:24.400
they can share with developers

46:24.500 --> 46:26.400
or they can put

46:26.500 --> 46:27.400
online

46:27.500 --> 46:29.400
and create presentations

46:29.500 --> 46:31.400
or do some quick mockups

46:31.500 --> 46:32.400
and prototypes

46:32.500 --> 46:34.400
we don't have something like that

46:34.400 --> 46:36.300
right now on Linux

46:36.400 --> 46:37.300
Oh yeah right

46:37.400 --> 46:38.300
so maybe you can talk a little bit more

46:38.400 --> 46:39.300
because this is something

46:39.400 --> 46:40.300
you obviously know well

46:40.400 --> 46:41.300
as a professional

46:41.400 --> 46:43.300
and a Linux user

46:43.400 --> 46:44.300
can you talk a little bit about

46:44.400 --> 46:45.300
the pain of trying to have

46:45.400 --> 46:46.300
both of those things

46:46.400 --> 46:47.300
in today's world

46:47.400 --> 46:48.300
Oh my god it's terrible

46:48.400 --> 46:49.300
okay

46:49.400 --> 46:52.300
so feel free to interrupt me

46:52.400 --> 46:53.300
because I can go on forever

46:53.400 --> 46:55.300
I don't want to annoy everyone

46:55.400 --> 46:57.300
but I'm

46:57.400 --> 46:59.300
I've been doing development

46:59.400 --> 47:00.300
and design at the same time

47:00.400 --> 47:02.300
for more than 13 years

47:02.400 --> 47:03.300
professionally

47:03.300 --> 47:05.200
I was forced throughout my entire

47:05.300 --> 47:07.200
career to just use

47:07.300 --> 47:08.200
all Windows and Mac OS

47:08.300 --> 47:10.200
just because of applications

47:10.300 --> 47:12.200
I tried in

47:12.300 --> 47:13.200
digital studios

47:13.300 --> 47:14.200
or creative agencies

47:14.300 --> 47:15.200
that I worked in the past

47:15.300 --> 47:16.200
to go in and say

47:16.300 --> 47:18.200
hey let's not use Adobe

47:18.300 --> 47:19.200
let's use GIMP

47:19.300 --> 47:21.200
to do our photo retouching

47:21.300 --> 47:23.200
and everyone started laughing at me

47:23.300 --> 47:24.200
not because those tools

47:24.300 --> 47:26.200
like GIMP, Inkscape

47:26.300 --> 47:28.200
or Krita are bad tools

47:28.300 --> 47:29.200
those are amazing tools

47:29.300 --> 47:30.200
and they work great

47:30.300 --> 47:32.200
but the problem

47:32.200 --> 47:34.100
is the workflow

47:34.200 --> 47:36.100
is the user interface

47:36.200 --> 47:37.100
you can

47:37.200 --> 47:39.100
that's something that I always say

47:39.200 --> 47:41.100
you can do a square

47:41.200 --> 47:42.100
gray

47:42.200 --> 47:44.100
like a gray rectangle

47:44.200 --> 47:45.100
you can build a gray rectangle

47:45.200 --> 47:46.100
in Inkscape

47:46.200 --> 47:47.100
in GIMP, in Krita

47:47.200 --> 47:48.100
in Sketch, Figma

47:48.200 --> 47:49.100
it doesn't matter

47:49.200 --> 47:50.100
it will always be

47:50.200 --> 47:51.100
a gray rectangle

47:51.200 --> 47:52.100
but

47:52.200 --> 47:54.100
if you want to build

47:54.200 --> 47:55.100
a user interface

47:55.200 --> 47:57.100
with 20 different artboards

47:57.200 --> 47:58.100
and shared assets

47:58.200 --> 48:00.100
and design system

48:00.200 --> 48:01.100
and something that you can

48:01.100 --> 48:04.000
collaborate with other designers

48:04.100 --> 48:06.000
your options are really limited

48:06.100 --> 48:08.000
and there's nothing like that on Linux

48:08.100 --> 48:11.000
so it's all about

48:11.100 --> 48:13.000
optimizing the workflow

48:13.100 --> 48:14.000
of designers

48:14.100 --> 48:15.000
with a modern tool

48:15.100 --> 48:17.000
that offers a modern interface

48:17.100 --> 48:19.000
that's the main purpose

48:19.100 --> 48:20.000
so making Linux

48:20.100 --> 48:21.000
a habitable platform

48:21.100 --> 48:22.000
for designers

48:22.100 --> 48:23.000
so that someone

48:23.100 --> 48:24.000
you can have everything

48:24.100 --> 48:25.000
you can have your cake

48:25.100 --> 48:26.000
you can eat it too

48:26.100 --> 48:27.000
and design all your applications

48:27.100 --> 48:28.000
whether it's for another platform

48:28.100 --> 48:29.000
or for Linux natively

48:29.100 --> 48:30.000
absolutely

48:30.000 --> 48:31.900
and also the main purpose is

48:32.000 --> 48:32.900
helping Linux

48:33.000 --> 48:33.900
being like

48:34.000 --> 48:34.900
turning to a mainstream

48:35.000 --> 48:35.900
operating system

48:36.000 --> 48:36.900
that is not

48:37.000 --> 48:39.900
unfortunately for

48:40.000 --> 48:41.900
how we want to wish

48:42.000 --> 48:42.900
that this is the year

48:43.000 --> 48:43.900
of the Linux desktop

48:44.000 --> 48:44.900
it will never come

48:45.000 --> 48:45.900
if we don't have

48:46.000 --> 48:47.900
proper native

48:48.000 --> 48:48.900
alternative softwares

48:49.000 --> 48:49.900
that are

48:50.000 --> 48:50.900
comparable

48:51.000 --> 48:51.900
or even better

48:52.000 --> 48:52.900
than what are available

48:53.000 --> 48:54.900
on Windows and Mac OS

48:55.000 --> 48:56.900
and Akira wants to do that

48:57.000 --> 48:57.900
wants to say

48:58.000 --> 48:58.900
okay you don't want to use Sketch

48:58.900 --> 49:00.800
you don't want to pay

49:00.900 --> 49:01.800
$30 a month

49:01.900 --> 49:03.800
to use Adobe XD

49:03.900 --> 49:04.800
come on Linux

49:04.900 --> 49:05.800
we have exactly the same thing

49:05.900 --> 49:07.800
that works as well

49:07.900 --> 49:08.800
but it's open source

49:08.900 --> 49:09.800
it's free

49:09.900 --> 49:11.800
and we don't ask money for it

49:11.900 --> 49:12.800
so that's it

49:12.900 --> 49:13.800
so will Linux be

49:13.900 --> 49:14.800
the only targeted platform

49:14.900 --> 49:15.800
or will someday

49:15.900 --> 49:16.800
I will be able to run Akira

49:16.900 --> 49:17.800
on my MacBook

49:17.900 --> 49:19.800
that's a really good question

49:19.900 --> 49:20.800
for now

49:20.900 --> 49:21.800
it's 100% it's Linux

49:21.900 --> 49:22.800
because on MacBook

49:22.900 --> 49:23.800
or Windows

49:23.900 --> 49:24.800
you have

49:24.900 --> 49:25.800
20 different alternatives

49:25.900 --> 49:27.800
that can do the same

49:27.800 --> 49:29.700
but it's open source

49:29.800 --> 49:30.700
so if there's a crazy user

49:30.800 --> 49:31.700
out there

49:31.800 --> 49:32.700
that decides to compile

49:32.800 --> 49:33.700
and run GTK

49:33.800 --> 49:34.700
on Windows

49:34.800 --> 49:35.700
or Mac OS

49:35.800 --> 49:36.700
they can totally do it

49:36.800 --> 49:37.700
we're not opposed to that

49:37.800 --> 49:38.700
absolutely

49:38.800 --> 49:40.700
but it's not our goal

49:40.800 --> 49:41.700
okay well then

49:41.800 --> 49:42.700
while we're on this subject

49:42.800 --> 49:43.700
what about Linux distribution

49:43.800 --> 49:44.700
is it for all distributions

49:44.800 --> 49:46.700
I also happen to notice

49:46.800 --> 49:48.700
it looked like an older branch

49:48.800 --> 49:49.700
but a branch called

49:49.800 --> 49:50.700
AppImage on there

49:50.800 --> 49:51.700
so are there

49:51.800 --> 49:52.700
are there plans

49:52.800 --> 49:53.700
for these universal formats

49:53.800 --> 49:54.700
yes absolutely

49:54.800 --> 49:55.700
so by default

49:55.800 --> 49:56.700
we're going to start

49:56.700 --> 49:58.600
PPA

49:58.700 --> 49:59.600
like on LaunchPod

49:59.700 --> 50:00.600
we're going to release

50:00.700 --> 50:01.600
daily builds

50:01.700 --> 50:02.600
so pretty much

50:02.700 --> 50:03.600
all the Debian based

50:03.700 --> 50:04.600
distribution

50:04.700 --> 50:05.600
will be able to install it

50:05.700 --> 50:06.600
then in the team

50:06.700 --> 50:08.600
we have

50:08.700 --> 50:10.600
Flatpak maintainer

50:10.700 --> 50:11.600
really great guy

50:11.700 --> 50:13.600
his name is Bilal

50:13.700 --> 50:14.600
we're going to be sure

50:14.700 --> 50:15.600
to release

50:15.700 --> 50:16.600
daily Flatpaks

50:16.700 --> 50:17.600
or like

50:17.700 --> 50:18.600
weekly Flatpaks

50:18.700 --> 50:20.600
installed everywhere

50:20.700 --> 50:21.600
it's going to be released

50:21.700 --> 50:22.600
on the elementary OS

50:22.700 --> 50:24.600
App Center

50:24.600 --> 50:26.500
and we're open to

50:26.600 --> 50:27.500
we don't have the

50:27.600 --> 50:28.500
skill level

50:28.600 --> 50:29.500
right now to do it

50:29.600 --> 50:30.500
but we're open

50:30.600 --> 50:31.500
to contribution

50:31.600 --> 50:32.500
to release also

50:32.600 --> 50:33.500
a SnapImage

50:33.600 --> 50:34.500
and an AppImage

50:34.600 --> 50:36.500
so a SnapPak

50:36.600 --> 50:37.500
and an AppImage

50:37.600 --> 50:38.500
perfect

50:38.600 --> 50:39.500
okay well

50:39.600 --> 50:40.500
that pretty well

50:40.600 --> 50:41.500
answers my question

50:41.600 --> 50:42.500
yeah we want to try to

50:42.600 --> 50:43.500
cover as many

50:43.600 --> 50:44.500
distributions as possible

50:44.600 --> 50:45.500
and

50:45.600 --> 50:46.500
that's also why

50:46.600 --> 50:47.500
we want to

50:47.600 --> 50:48.500
buy as much hardware

50:48.600 --> 50:49.500
as possible

50:49.600 --> 50:50.500
in order to test it

50:50.600 --> 50:51.500
and be sure that

50:51.600 --> 50:53.500
every single Linux users

50:53.500 --> 50:55.400
it doesn't matter the distribution

50:55.500 --> 50:56.400
it doesn't matter

50:56.500 --> 50:58.400
how modern

50:58.500 --> 50:59.400
and performant

50:59.500 --> 51:00.400
their laptop

51:00.500 --> 51:01.400
or computer is

51:01.500 --> 51:02.400
they can run Akira

51:02.500 --> 51:03.400
because

51:03.500 --> 51:04.400
yeah

51:04.500 --> 51:05.400
we want to be just

51:05.500 --> 51:06.400
available

51:06.500 --> 51:07.400
to anyone

51:07.500 --> 51:08.400
okay so you said

51:08.500 --> 51:09.400
we there

51:09.500 --> 51:10.400
and that's another thing

51:10.500 --> 51:11.400
we should talk about

51:11.500 --> 51:12.400
it's not just you working here

51:12.500 --> 51:13.400
it sounds like you've got

51:13.500 --> 51:14.400
a great team behind you

51:14.500 --> 51:15.400
yes

51:15.500 --> 51:16.400
I'm the crazy guy

51:16.500 --> 51:17.400
that decided to start

51:17.500 --> 51:18.400
this thing

51:18.500 --> 51:19.400
like a couple of years ago

51:19.500 --> 51:20.400
and I was like

51:20.500 --> 51:21.400
oh it's actually harder

51:21.500 --> 51:22.400
than I thought

51:22.400 --> 51:24.300
like everything

51:25.400 --> 51:27.300
so in the past year

51:27.400 --> 51:28.300
I started

51:28.400 --> 51:29.300
releasing

51:29.400 --> 51:30.300
native Linux applications

51:30.400 --> 51:31.300
like SQLer

51:31.400 --> 51:32.300
and taxi

51:32.400 --> 51:33.300
like you mentioned

51:33.400 --> 51:34.300
and throughout this year

51:34.400 --> 51:35.300
I started collaborating

51:35.400 --> 51:36.300
with a lot of

51:36.400 --> 51:37.300
different developers

51:37.400 --> 51:38.300
in particular

51:38.400 --> 51:39.300
I feel really comfortable

51:39.400 --> 51:40.300
and

51:40.400 --> 51:41.300
these are great people

51:41.400 --> 51:42.300
other three developers

51:42.400 --> 51:43.300
that they helped me a lot

51:43.400 --> 51:44.300
with my applications

51:44.400 --> 51:45.300
or

51:45.400 --> 51:46.300
I contribute to

51:46.400 --> 51:47.300
their own applications

51:47.400 --> 51:48.300
by

51:48.400 --> 51:49.300
offering design and development

51:49.400 --> 51:50.300
stuff like that

51:50.400 --> 51:51.300
the team is

51:51.300 --> 51:53.200
there's myself

51:53.300 --> 51:54.200
of course

51:54.300 --> 51:55.200
and then there's

51:55.300 --> 51:56.200
Felipe Escoto

51:56.300 --> 51:57.200
which is

51:57.300 --> 51:58.200
a Mexican developer

51:58.300 --> 52:00.200
for Elementor US

52:00.300 --> 52:02.200
he released

52:02.300 --> 52:03.200
SpiceUp

52:03.300 --> 52:04.200
and NodeTap

52:04.300 --> 52:05.200
two amazing applications

52:05.300 --> 52:06.200
oh yeah

52:06.300 --> 52:07.200
mind blown

52:07.300 --> 52:08.200
yeah and these

52:08.300 --> 52:09.200
it's a kid

52:09.300 --> 52:10.200
like this guy is

52:10.300 --> 52:11.200
20-ish something

52:11.300 --> 52:12.200
he's like the smartest kid

52:12.300 --> 52:13.200
I've ever met

52:13.300 --> 52:14.200
I feel like

52:14.300 --> 52:15.200
so old

52:15.300 --> 52:16.200
and so behind

52:16.300 --> 52:17.200
when I talk to him

52:17.300 --> 52:18.200
a wonder kid

52:18.300 --> 52:19.200
yeah a wonder kid

52:19.300 --> 52:20.200
absolutely

52:20.200 --> 52:21.100
and then there's

52:21.200 --> 52:22.100
Alberto Vangiole

52:22.200 --> 52:23.100
which is

52:23.200 --> 52:24.100
a software engineer

52:24.200 --> 52:26.100
Agnome Foundation member

52:26.200 --> 52:27.100
is the maintainer

52:27.200 --> 52:28.100
of GitG

52:28.200 --> 52:29.100
which is

52:29.200 --> 52:30.100
a visual

52:30.200 --> 52:33.100
Git repository manager

52:33.200 --> 52:35.100
and then we have Bilal

52:35.200 --> 52:36.100
and I always butcher

52:36.200 --> 52:37.100
his last name

52:37.200 --> 52:39.100
Elmousaoui

52:39.200 --> 52:41.100
sorry Bilal

52:41.200 --> 52:42.100
I apologize deeply

52:42.200 --> 52:43.100
he's a developer

52:43.200 --> 52:44.100
and is an

52:44.200 --> 52:45.100
Agnome Foundation member

52:45.200 --> 52:46.100
and

52:46.200 --> 52:47.100
he's an engineer

52:47.200 --> 52:48.100
student

52:48.200 --> 52:49.100
so it's like

52:49.100 --> 52:51.000
the smartest of the bunch probably

52:51.100 --> 52:52.000
and

52:52.100 --> 52:54.000
he's one of the maintainer

52:54.100 --> 52:55.000
of a lot of

52:55.100 --> 52:56.000
Flatpak

52:56.100 --> 52:57.000
applications

52:57.100 --> 52:58.000
so if

52:58.100 --> 52:59.000
FlatHab

52:59.100 --> 53:00.000
is a

53:00.100 --> 53:01.000
great repository

53:01.100 --> 53:03.000
it's mostly thanks to Bilal

53:03.100 --> 53:04.000
wow that is impressive

53:04.100 --> 53:05.000
clearly a lot of people

53:05.100 --> 53:06.000
who know what they're doing

53:06.100 --> 53:07.000
and have experienced

53:07.100 --> 53:08.000
building these kinds of

53:08.100 --> 53:09.000
applications before

53:09.100 --> 53:10.000
and maybe

53:10.100 --> 53:12.000
that explains my next question

53:12.100 --> 53:13.000
how far along

53:13.100 --> 53:14.000
is Akira

53:14.100 --> 53:15.000
what should users know

53:15.100 --> 53:16.000
is it ready for use

53:16.100 --> 53:17.000
is it

53:17.100 --> 53:18.000
just starting out

53:18.000 --> 53:18.900
where are you

53:19.000 --> 53:20.900
that's a really good question

53:21.000 --> 53:21.900
okay Akira

53:22.000 --> 53:22.900
there's a

53:23.000 --> 53:23.900
barely working prototype

53:24.000 --> 53:24.900
that you can

53:25.000 --> 53:25.900
download

53:26.000 --> 53:26.900
from the

53:27.000 --> 53:27.900
open source

53:28.000 --> 53:28.900
GitHub repository compile

53:29.000 --> 53:30.900
and run

53:31.000 --> 53:32.900
what we're missing

53:33.000 --> 53:34.900
is basically the core

53:35.000 --> 53:35.900
in order to

53:36.000 --> 53:36.900
be actually usable

53:37.000 --> 53:37.900
which is the hardest part

53:38.000 --> 53:38.900
is the canvas

53:39.000 --> 53:39.900
right now

53:40.000 --> 53:40.900
it doesn't exist

53:41.000 --> 53:41.900
a canvas library

53:42.000 --> 53:42.900
that does

53:43.000 --> 53:43.900
what we need

53:44.000 --> 53:44.900
it doesn't exist

53:45.000 --> 53:45.900
a canvas library

53:46.000 --> 53:46.900
that by default interacts

53:46.900 --> 53:48.800
with SVGs

53:48.900 --> 53:49.800
and

53:49.900 --> 53:50.800
whenever you create an object

53:50.900 --> 53:51.800
it creates

53:51.900 --> 53:52.800
separated layers

53:52.900 --> 53:53.800
that you can manipulate

53:53.900 --> 53:54.800
without

53:54.900 --> 53:55.800
having an issue

53:55.900 --> 53:56.800
oh I see

53:56.900 --> 53:57.800
right you need this

53:57.900 --> 53:58.800
sort of

53:58.900 --> 53:59.800
rich environment

53:59.900 --> 54:00.800
the canvas to go interact

54:00.900 --> 54:01.800
so you can make shapes

54:01.900 --> 54:02.800
and drag them around

54:02.900 --> 54:03.800
and layer them

54:03.900 --> 54:04.800
and actually get the work done

54:04.900 --> 54:05.800
yeah right now

54:05.900 --> 54:06.800
it doesn't exist

54:06.900 --> 54:07.800
there are a lot of projects

54:07.900 --> 54:08.800
that they do that

54:08.900 --> 54:09.800
but are really limited

54:09.900 --> 54:10.800
or discontinued

54:10.900 --> 54:11.800
or

54:11.900 --> 54:12.800
it's all

54:12.900 --> 54:14.800
it's not a

54:14.900 --> 54:15.800
reusable library

54:15.800 --> 54:17.700
it's all like math based

54:17.800 --> 54:18.700
and it's C code

54:18.800 --> 54:19.700
there's nothing that

54:19.800 --> 54:20.700
we can simply

54:20.800 --> 54:21.700
grab and integrate

54:21.800 --> 54:22.700
inside Akira

54:22.800 --> 54:23.700
it's something

54:23.800 --> 54:24.700
that we need to create

54:24.800 --> 54:25.700
from scratch

54:25.800 --> 54:26.700
so yes

54:26.800 --> 54:27.700
the application

54:27.800 --> 54:28.700
is up and running

54:28.800 --> 54:29.700
it's a sort of like MVP version

54:29.800 --> 54:30.700
which

54:30.800 --> 54:31.700
comes with

54:31.800 --> 54:33.700
a built-in canvas

54:33.800 --> 54:34.700
that you can

54:34.800 --> 54:35.700
start to interact with

54:35.800 --> 54:36.700
but you cannot

54:36.800 --> 54:37.700
yet

54:37.800 --> 54:38.700
create shapes

54:38.800 --> 54:39.700
and save files

54:39.800 --> 54:40.700
and manipulate

54:40.800 --> 54:41.700
layers

54:41.800 --> 54:42.700
so

54:42.800 --> 54:44.700
the majority of the work

54:44.700 --> 54:45.600
is going to be about

54:45.700 --> 54:46.600
creating this canvas library

54:46.700 --> 54:47.600
which

54:47.700 --> 54:48.600
we want to make it available

54:48.700 --> 54:49.600
as

54:49.700 --> 54:50.600
like

54:50.700 --> 54:51.600
a package

54:51.700 --> 54:52.600
that everyone

54:52.700 --> 54:53.600
if they want to create their own

54:53.700 --> 54:54.600
mock-up

54:54.700 --> 54:55.600
design tool

54:55.700 --> 54:56.600
they can incorporate

54:56.700 --> 54:57.600
that library

54:57.700 --> 54:58.600
and reuse it

54:58.700 --> 54:59.600
oh great

54:59.700 --> 55:00.600
so just sort of a spin-off project

55:00.700 --> 55:01.600
of here you go guys

55:01.700 --> 55:02.600
here's a great little canvas

55:02.700 --> 55:03.600
you can use

55:03.700 --> 55:04.600
yes exactly

55:04.700 --> 55:05.600
because it doesn't exist

55:05.700 --> 55:06.600
something like that

55:06.700 --> 55:07.600
so yes

55:07.700 --> 55:08.600
it's going to be used

55:08.700 --> 55:09.600
in Akira

55:09.700 --> 55:10.600
but it's going to be available

55:10.700 --> 55:11.600
to anyone

55:11.700 --> 55:12.600
that they want to incorporate

55:12.700 --> 55:13.600
in their own project

55:13.600 --> 55:15.500
of two to three months

55:15.600 --> 55:16.500
to release

55:16.600 --> 55:18.500
the first usable

55:18.600 --> 55:19.500
alpha version

55:19.600 --> 55:20.500
that

55:20.600 --> 55:21.500
I'm trying to push it

55:21.600 --> 55:22.500
and not being

55:22.600 --> 55:23.500
an alpha version

55:23.600 --> 55:24.500
but probably

55:24.600 --> 55:25.500
it's going to be an alpha version

55:25.600 --> 55:26.500
but version one

55:26.600 --> 55:27.500
is going to be available

55:27.600 --> 55:29.500
if the Kickstarter campaign

55:29.600 --> 55:30.500
is successful

55:30.600 --> 55:31.500
in three months

55:31.600 --> 55:32.500
after the end

55:32.600 --> 55:33.500
of the Kickstarter campaign

55:33.600 --> 55:34.500
well let's talk a little bit more

55:34.600 --> 55:35.500
about that

55:35.600 --> 55:36.500
you've got a Kickstarter campaign

55:36.600 --> 55:37.500
going on

55:37.600 --> 55:38.500
and I know

55:38.600 --> 55:39.500
our listeners

55:39.600 --> 55:40.500
are going to want to know

55:40.600 --> 55:41.500
what's the money

55:41.600 --> 55:42.500
going to be used for

55:42.500 --> 55:43.400
is there some

55:43.500 --> 55:44.400
corporate structure

55:44.500 --> 55:45.400
behind the scenes

55:45.500 --> 55:46.400
do you have plans

55:46.500 --> 55:47.400
for exactly where

55:47.500 --> 55:48.400
everything's going to go

55:48.500 --> 55:49.400
and how you'll use it

55:49.500 --> 55:50.400
tell us more

55:50.500 --> 55:51.400
yes absolutely

55:51.500 --> 55:52.400
so I

55:52.500 --> 55:53.400
in the Kickstarter

55:53.500 --> 55:54.400
description

55:54.500 --> 55:55.400
I wrote down

55:55.500 --> 55:56.400
a breakthrough

55:56.500 --> 55:57.400
of how

55:57.500 --> 55:58.400
all the money

55:58.500 --> 55:59.400
will be used

55:59.500 --> 56:00.400
because

56:00.500 --> 56:01.400
honestly I'm asking

56:01.500 --> 56:02.400
for a lot of money

56:02.500 --> 56:03.400
it is

56:03.500 --> 56:04.400
totally 65,000

56:04.500 --> 56:05.400
Canadian dollars

56:05.500 --> 56:06.400
which

56:06.500 --> 56:07.400
roughly translate

56:07.500 --> 56:08.400
to fifty thousand

56:08.500 --> 56:09.400
US dollars

56:09.500 --> 56:10.400
and

56:10.500 --> 56:11.400
a lot of people

56:11.400 --> 56:13.300
thirty percent will go in taxes

56:13.400 --> 56:14.300
because

56:14.400 --> 56:15.300
I'm not a corporation

56:15.400 --> 56:16.300
we didn't

56:16.400 --> 56:18.300
create a foundation

56:18.400 --> 56:19.300
on anything like that

56:19.400 --> 56:20.300
on a non-profit

56:20.400 --> 56:21.300
I'm just like

56:21.400 --> 56:22.300
a single user

56:22.400 --> 56:23.300
so

56:23.400 --> 56:24.300
that money

56:24.400 --> 56:25.300
will be

56:25.400 --> 56:26.300
for the Canadian government

56:26.400 --> 56:27.300
is like

56:27.400 --> 56:28.300
income

56:28.400 --> 56:29.300
and I have to declare taxes

56:29.400 --> 56:30.300
on that income

56:30.400 --> 56:31.300
and I have to pay

56:31.400 --> 56:32.300
thirty percent

56:32.400 --> 56:33.300
ish

56:33.400 --> 56:34.300
that money

56:34.400 --> 56:35.300
so already thirty percent

56:35.400 --> 56:36.300
is gone forever

56:36.400 --> 56:37.300
burned

56:37.400 --> 56:38.300
and gave it to the government

56:38.400 --> 56:39.300
but it's fine

56:39.400 --> 56:40.300
then

56:40.300 --> 56:41.200
two thousand dollars

56:41.300 --> 56:42.200
will be used

56:42.300 --> 56:43.200
to hire

56:43.300 --> 56:44.200
these three developers

56:44.300 --> 56:45.200
for three months

56:45.300 --> 56:46.200
that's the main purpose

56:46.300 --> 56:47.200
I want to

56:47.300 --> 56:48.200
pay them

56:48.300 --> 56:49.200
as a full-time job

56:49.300 --> 56:51.200
so they can work on this

56:51.300 --> 56:52.200
eight hours per day

56:52.300 --> 56:53.200
five days a week

56:53.300 --> 56:54.200
for three months

56:54.300 --> 56:55.200
non-stop

56:55.300 --> 56:56.200
is the only way

56:56.300 --> 56:57.200
we can

56:57.300 --> 56:58.200
be able to deliver

56:58.300 --> 56:59.200
something like that

56:59.300 --> 57:00.200
they cannot work

57:00.300 --> 57:01.200
part-time

57:01.300 --> 57:02.200
one hour per day

57:02.300 --> 57:03.200
or during the weekend

57:03.300 --> 57:04.200
right

57:04.300 --> 57:05.200
they need time to focus

57:05.300 --> 57:06.200
if you're going to get

57:06.300 --> 57:07.200
good quality work out quickly

57:07.300 --> 57:08.200
absolutely

57:08.300 --> 57:09.200
so I asked them

57:09.200 --> 57:10.100
I'm going to cover

57:10.200 --> 57:11.100
the entire rate

57:11.200 --> 57:12.100
and then we have an extra

57:12.200 --> 57:13.100
twenty thousand dollars

57:13.200 --> 57:14.100
which

57:14.200 --> 57:15.100
ten thousand

57:15.200 --> 57:16.100
will be

57:16.200 --> 57:17.100
to pay

57:17.200 --> 57:18.100
my

57:18.200 --> 57:19.100
paycheck basically

57:19.200 --> 57:20.100
and

57:20.200 --> 57:21.100
sustain myself

57:21.200 --> 57:22.100
for three months

57:22.200 --> 57:23.100
so I don't need to

57:23.200 --> 57:24.100
I can take

57:24.200 --> 57:25.100
some three months

57:25.200 --> 57:26.100
off of work

57:26.200 --> 57:27.100
and I need to work

57:27.200 --> 57:28.100
I can focus on Akira

57:28.200 --> 57:29.100
a hundred percent as well

57:29.200 --> 57:30.100
and the rest of the

57:30.200 --> 57:31.100
ten thousand dollars

57:31.200 --> 57:32.100
will be used

57:32.200 --> 57:33.100
to buy

57:33.200 --> 57:34.100
hardware

57:34.200 --> 57:35.100
because

57:35.200 --> 57:36.100
yes every one of us

57:36.200 --> 57:37.100
has a laptop

57:37.200 --> 57:38.100
but we just have

57:38.100 --> 57:39.000
a laptop that it's

57:39.100 --> 57:40.000
probably not the best

57:40.100 --> 57:41.000
we don't have

57:41.100 --> 57:42.000
graphic tablets

57:42.100 --> 57:43.000
we don't have

57:43.100 --> 57:44.000
4k monitors

57:44.100 --> 57:45.000
we don't have

57:45.100 --> 57:46.000
touch

57:46.100 --> 57:47.000
touchpad interfaces

57:47.100 --> 57:48.000
and all this kind of stuff

57:48.100 --> 57:49.000
that

57:49.100 --> 57:50.000
are

57:50.100 --> 57:51.000
standard

57:51.100 --> 57:52.000
in

57:52.100 --> 57:53.000
a professional

57:53.100 --> 57:54.000
design world

57:54.100 --> 57:55.000
when you work in an agency

57:55.100 --> 57:56.000
it's normal

57:56.100 --> 57:57.000
having a 4k

57:57.100 --> 57:58.000
or 5k monitor

57:58.100 --> 57:59.000
it's normal

57:59.100 --> 58:00.000
having

58:00.100 --> 58:01.000
a Wacom tablet

58:01.100 --> 58:02.000
with a digital display

58:02.100 --> 58:03.000
how good

58:03.100 --> 58:04.000
are

58:04.100 --> 58:05.000
those things currently

58:05.100 --> 58:06.000
working

58:06.100 --> 58:07.000
on Linux

58:07.000 --> 58:08.900
not that great

58:09.000 --> 58:09.900
they work

58:10.000 --> 58:10.900
but

58:11.000 --> 58:11.900
they're not the best

58:12.000 --> 58:12.900
so

58:13.000 --> 58:13.900
having the ability

58:14.000 --> 58:14.900
to purchase

58:15.000 --> 58:15.900
that hardware

58:16.000 --> 58:16.900
and

58:17.000 --> 58:17.900
develop Akira

58:18.000 --> 58:18.900
since day one

58:19.000 --> 58:19.900
on

58:20.000 --> 58:20.900
that

58:21.000 --> 58:21.900
different hardware

58:22.000 --> 58:22.900
all those

58:23.000 --> 58:23.900
different resolutions

58:24.000 --> 58:24.900
and different

58:25.000 --> 58:25.900
input interfaces

58:26.000 --> 58:26.900
will give us

58:27.000 --> 58:27.900
the ability to

58:28.000 --> 58:29.900
release Akira

58:30.000 --> 58:30.900
working

58:31.000 --> 58:31.900
in every

58:32.000 --> 58:32.900
single environment

58:33.000 --> 58:33.900
possible

58:34.000 --> 58:34.900
right you won't have to just

58:35.000 --> 58:35.900
try to retrofit

58:35.900 --> 58:36.800
it literally on down

58:36.900 --> 58:37.800
down the stream later

58:37.900 --> 58:38.800
you're going to be planning for it

58:38.900 --> 58:39.800
because you know professionals

58:39.900 --> 58:40.800
want to use it

58:40.900 --> 58:41.800
exactly and

58:41.900 --> 58:42.800
how many times

58:42.900 --> 58:43.800
you use a project

58:43.900 --> 58:44.800
and you go into

58:44.900 --> 58:45.800
their repositories

58:45.900 --> 58:46.800
and there are issues like

58:46.900 --> 58:47.800
this doesn't work

58:47.900 --> 58:48.800
with my

58:48.900 --> 58:49.800
tablet

58:49.900 --> 58:50.800
or this

58:50.900 --> 58:51.800
doesn't work with my laptop

58:51.900 --> 58:52.800
because I have this resolution

58:52.900 --> 58:53.800
and the answer is

58:53.900 --> 58:54.800
sometimes

58:54.900 --> 58:55.800
I'm sorry

58:55.900 --> 58:56.800
I cannot test it

58:56.900 --> 58:57.800
because I don't have

58:57.900 --> 58:58.800
that hardware

58:58.900 --> 58:59.800
right yeah exactly

58:59.900 --> 59:00.800
yeah we want to try to avoid that

59:00.900 --> 59:01.800
it's like

59:01.900 --> 59:02.800
no we cannot fix it

59:02.900 --> 59:03.800
because we don't know

59:03.900 --> 59:04.800
how to recreate the issue

59:04.800 --> 59:05.700
so

59:05.800 --> 59:07.700
that's the main thing

59:07.800 --> 59:09.700
yeah on the Kickstarter page

59:09.800 --> 59:10.700
there's a full breakdown

59:10.800 --> 59:11.700
of everything

59:11.800 --> 59:12.700
percentages

59:12.800 --> 59:13.700
all the money

59:13.800 --> 59:14.700
and

59:14.800 --> 59:15.700
a lot of users

59:15.800 --> 59:16.700
were kind of like

59:16.800 --> 59:18.700
weirded out

59:18.800 --> 59:19.700
by the amount

59:19.800 --> 59:20.700
and

59:20.800 --> 59:21.700
the fact that I actually

59:21.800 --> 59:22.700
wrote down the money

59:22.800 --> 59:23.700
they didn't believe that

59:23.800 --> 59:24.700
30% goes in taxes

59:24.800 --> 59:25.700
or

59:25.800 --> 59:26.700
some didn't believe

59:26.800 --> 59:27.700
oh ten thousand dollars

59:27.800 --> 59:28.700
for

59:28.800 --> 59:29.700
your rent and your food

59:29.800 --> 59:30.700
and I'm like yeah

59:30.800 --> 59:31.700
I have to eat

59:31.800 --> 59:32.700
for three months

59:32.800 --> 59:33.700
but

59:33.700 --> 59:35.600
I want to reiterate the fact that

59:35.700 --> 59:36.600
I'm not trying to

59:36.700 --> 59:37.600
get rich

59:37.700 --> 59:38.600
or

59:38.700 --> 59:39.600
buy a Tesla

59:39.700 --> 59:40.600
or

59:40.700 --> 59:41.600
I don't know

59:41.700 --> 59:42.600
get a bunch of money

59:42.700 --> 59:43.600
and then disappear

59:43.700 --> 59:45.600
I really want

59:45.700 --> 59:47.600
to make this happen

59:47.700 --> 59:49.600
because it's literally

59:49.700 --> 59:50.600
the only thing

59:50.700 --> 59:52.600
that it's preventing me

59:52.700 --> 59:54.600
from using Linux

59:54.700 --> 59:55.600
every day

59:55.700 --> 59:57.600
I have one MacBook

59:57.700 --> 59:58.600
left in my apartment

59:58.700 --> 59:59.600
just because

59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.600
of one application

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.600
the design application

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.500
that I have to use

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.500
Wow okay Linux users

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.500
out there

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.500
if you weren't going to fund the Kickstarter

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.500
because you're not going to use

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.500
Zekira

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.500
you're not a designer

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.500
I think that's a pretty good reason

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:11.500
right there

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:12.500
get you

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.500
get you Alex

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.500
right off that MacBook

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.500
help me

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.500
yeah that's it

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.500
and you know

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.500
I mean to just put it

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.500
in a little perspective

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.500
if you think about

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.500
you know several developers

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.500
working for

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.500
a significant part of a year

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.500
at like a major

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.500
development company

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.500
well that's going to be

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.500
a lot more money

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.500
than you're asking for

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.500
yeah exactly

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.500
I'm not paying benefits

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.400
to them

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.400
I'm not paying

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.400
paid vacations

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.400
or something like that

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.400
so the cost is really

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.400
is really limited

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.400
compared to

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.400
what you're going to get paid

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.400
if you work on a full-time job

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.400
on an actual

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.400
company but

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.400
yeah that's

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.400
that's the amount of money

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:47.400
I wanted to be

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.400
as honest and clear

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.400
as possible

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.400
I put the full breakdown

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.400
of how I'm going to use the money

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:53.400
and also my wife

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:54.400
told me like

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.400
you shouldn't do that

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.400
because a lot of people

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.400
will question you

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.400
and will start like

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.400
having doubts

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.400
of what you wrote

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.300
it's

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.300
I want to be

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.300
open source

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.300
also with the money

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.300
so if we reach the goal

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.300
I'm going to

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.300
constantly do weekly updates

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.300
of how I'm going to

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.300
spend the money

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.300
where the money will go

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.300
and of course

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:14.300
if I end up

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.300
not spending all those

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.300
all the money

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.300
in taxes

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.300
or I can use the

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.300
accountant

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.300
to help me out

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.300
to save something

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.300
all the money

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.300
that I have left

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.300
will be funneled back

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.300
inside

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.300
the application itself

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.300
I'm going to

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.300
we're going to set up

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.200
some bounty sources

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.200
to help other developers

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.200
that want to

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.200
contribute to get paid

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.200
in order to work on Akira

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.200
so

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.200
it's not

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.200
yeah it's not to

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.200
get rich

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.200
or

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.200
take some time off work

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.200
and go on vacation

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.200
that's not the goal

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.200
that makes sense

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.200
I certainly wish you luck

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.200
I've actually already

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.200
backed it

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.200
so I hope it goes through

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.200
yeah

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.200
and we'll have links

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.200
to everything we've talked about

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.200
in this interview

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.200
in the show notes

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.200
is there anything else

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.200
you want the audience to know?

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.200
just one thing

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.100
everyone probably

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:00.100
the majority of the audience

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.100
is on Linux

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.100
and

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.100
in our entire life

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.100
we always

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.100
found ourselves

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.100
using an application

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.100
and thinking

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.100
oh this is great

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.100
but it doesn't do

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.100
what I actually want

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.100
Akira wants to fill that gap

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.100
Akira

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.100
we want to

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.100
give you the freedom

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.100
of saying

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.100
I'm on Linux

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.100
and I don't need

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.100
anything else

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.100
I don't want Adobe

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.100
to

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.100
create a port

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.000
for Linux

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.000
of the Adobe creative suite

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.000
because

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.000
I don't need it

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.000
I'm fine with this

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:31.000
that's our goal

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.000
professional caliber

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.000
Linux design application

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.000
that could be

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.000
the future of Akira

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.000
yes

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.000
where should people go

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:40.000
to find more from you Alex?

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.000
yes

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.000
there's my Twitter account

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.000
which is

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.000
at alecad

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.000
ddd

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.000
with 3d

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.000
and then

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.000
I'm on YouTube

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.000
I do actually

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.000
tutorials about Linux

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.000
design and development

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.000
because

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.000
I

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.000
don't like to sleep

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.900
but it's fine

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.900
and

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.900
that's it

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:57.900
pretty much

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:58.900
I'm everywhere online

01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.900
so people start

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.900
getting really

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:01.900
really annoyed

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.900
by my

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:03.900
online presence

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:04.900
perfect

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:05.900
well thank you so much

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.900
for joining us

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:07.900
and good luck

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.900
awesome

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:09.900
thank you so much for having me

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:10.900
such a great idea

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:11.900
and I like how

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:12.900
much Alex

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.900
has this together

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:14.900
he's got a real

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:15.900
plan of attack here

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:16.900
and

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:17.900
as Linux users

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:18.900
we're often in this position

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:19.900
of trying to decide

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.900
do I want to take a risk

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:21.900
on funding

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:22.900
this thing

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:23.800
although I know

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.800
that this is something

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:25.800
we really need

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.800
it's good

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.800
it's good to hear Alex

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:28.800
really seems to have it

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:29.800
we've debated a lot of

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:30.800
kind of questionable

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.800
kickstarters

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:32.800
over the years on this show

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:33.800
I don't think this is one of them

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.800
no

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:35.800
no you seem like

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:36.800
you had it figured out

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.800
so

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.800
I'm really glad

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.800
you had a chance to chat with him

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:40.800
and

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.800
we'll have a link

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:42.800
to their fundraiser

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.800
in the show notes

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:44.800
probably worth doing

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:45.800
if you're a developer

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.800
because I think

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.800
it would be an investment

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.800
in a possible workflow

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.800
and I like that

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.800
he's thinking about

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.800
multi distro packaging too

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.700
I think that's a good thing

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.700
I'm looking at our time here

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:56.700
and I'm thinking

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.700
we're going to have to wait

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.700
on the Ubuntu 19.04

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.700
first look

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.700
I've been running it now

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.700
since

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.700
pretty much

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.700
since our predictions episode

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.700
but you won't talk about it

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.700
I keep asking you

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:07.700
off air

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.700
you say no

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.700
no Wes

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.700
I'm going to tell you on air

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:11.700
and once again

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:12.700
no

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.700
I guess it's kind of good

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:14.700
it gives me more time

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.700
I just

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.700
I feel like by the time

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.700
we finally get around to this

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.700
it's going to be

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.700
just near release time

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.700
I just wanted to give a first look

01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:21.600
at what's coming down the road

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.600
for GNOME

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:23.600
it's

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:24.600
it's

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:25.600
for those of us

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.600
that have had

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.600
GNOME problems

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.600
there's a lot of good stuff

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.600
in the works

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.600
so we'll talk about that

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.600
in the future

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.600
but I wanted

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.600
while it's still fresh

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.600
I want to take a moment

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:35.600
and wrap up the show

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:36.600
with this

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.600
interesting challenge

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.600
that

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.600
I think is facing

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.600
open source software

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:41.600
and I think what we'll do

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.600
is

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:43.600
we'll open it

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.600
and if we

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.600
if we get some good responses

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.600
we'll conclude it

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:47.600
next week

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.600
and

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.600
if you followed

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.500
me on Twitter

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.500
you know that recently

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.500
MongoDB

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:53.500
went through

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:54.500
a series of changes

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.500
in attempt to

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.500
relicense in a way

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.500
that

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.500
that forced

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.500
providers that are

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.500
re-hosting MongoDB

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.500
to have to pay

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.500
a certain fee

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.500
get a certain kind of

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.500
relationship with MongoDB

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.500
and it's resulted

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.500
in

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:08.500
Red Hat

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:09.500
and Fedora

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.500
and Debian

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.500
and other distributions

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.500
deciding to no longer

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.500
include MongoDB

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.500
in the repositories

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.500
because they believe

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:16.500
that license conflicts

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.500
with free software

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.500
and

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.400
at the same time

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.400
another shoe has dropped

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.400
and that is that

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.400
Amazon has released

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.400
AWS

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.400
DocumentDB

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.400
which is a straight up

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.400
competitor to MongoDB

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.400
and even

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.400
implements

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.400
compatibility with

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.400
MongoDB's

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.400
MongoDB's

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.400
API

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.400
from the

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.400
version right before

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.400
they made the licensing

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.400
changes

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.400
I have all that right so far

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.400
right Wes?

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.400
Yeah I mean

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.400
it's not just MongoDB

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.400
Redis, Kafka

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.400
there's been kind of

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.400
a long line of projects

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.400
that are

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.400
you know came

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.300
from companies

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.300
that were all

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.300
all in on this

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.300
they had this open source

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.300
product kind of

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.300
freemium right

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.300
trying to sell

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.300
additional enterprise

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.300
services or different

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.300
licenses on top

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.300
it kind of varies

01:05:58.400 --> 01:05:59.300
from company to company

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.300
and then

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.300
well the cloud behemoths

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.300
came into the room

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.300
and it turns out

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:04.300
everyone wants them

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.300
to run the software

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.300
for them so

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.300
how do you make money?

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.300
Great idea

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.300
but now running at scale

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.300
is sort of what's happening

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.300
oh that open source project

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.300
there

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.300
great idea

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.300
now let's just take that

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.300
and implement it

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.300
on our own systems

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.200
and really

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.200
Microsoft kind of

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.200
did this first

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.200
with their Cosmos DB

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.200
over on Azure

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.200
it just

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.200
didn't quite get

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.200
the same attention

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.200
that AWS's DocumentDB

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.200
did

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.200
but they kind of

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.200
just straight up

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.200
did the same thing

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.200
did a MongoDB competitor

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.200
that's now an Azure branded

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.200
service that you pay for

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.200
and what they're selling

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.200
isn't the software

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:35.200
what they're selling

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.200
is the reliability

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.200
and the infrastructure

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.200
of AWS

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.200
or Azure

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.200
in this case

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.200
and

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.200
this is

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.200
I think

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.200
a huge threat

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.100
to open source software

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:47.100
not because

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.100
these large commercial

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.100
companies

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.100
are taking

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.100
open source software

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.100
and

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.100
re-implementing it

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.100
or even just

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.100
re-hosting it in some cases

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.100
and then calling it

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.100
their own service

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.100
and charging for it

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.100
like that's

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.100
that's going to happen

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.100
but

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.100
in a much

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.100
much

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.100
bigger picture way

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.100
it could fundamentally

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.100
undermine

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.100
how open source projects

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.100
that need to build

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.100
at a certain scale

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.100
get funded

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.100
kickstarters

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:13.100
don't build MongoDB

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.100
patreons

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.000
don't build MongoDB

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.000
large

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.000
corporate

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.000
VC backed

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.000
funding

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.000
builds things

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.000
that are at that scale

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.000
it's just the nature

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.000
of the software industry

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.000
and I want to

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.000
play a clip

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.000
from Ben Thompson

01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.000
who in his

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.000
podcast

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.000
Exponent

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.000
which we will link

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.000
in the show notes

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.000
he's talked about this

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:34.000
and written

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.000
we'll link to this

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.000
in the show notes

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.000
I want to play this

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.000
and then Wes and I

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.000
are going to chat

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.000
about it a little bit

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.000
and then

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.000
I'm going to leave it

01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.000
to the audience

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:43.900
in the podcast

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.900
where he talks about

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:45.900
this VC funding issue

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:46.900
this is

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.900
driving a lot of angst

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:48.900
sort of in the open source

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:49.900
world

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.900
which is

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:51.900
we kind of got this

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.900
cool new model

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.900
where

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:54.900
open source projects

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:55.900
could

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:56.900
not just be

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:57.900
sort of developed

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:58.900
by hobbyists

01:07:59.000 --> 01:07:59.900
or people in their free time

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.900
or

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:01.900
people supported by

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:02.900
foundations

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.900
or grants

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:04.900
or whatever it might be

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.900
but actually

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:06.900
like

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:07.900
getting VC money

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:08.900
and VC makes

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:09.900
so much sense for software

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:10.900
because

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:11.900
software is a lot of work

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:12.800
and tools

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:13.800
and if Amazon's coming along

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.800
and basically leveraging

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:16.800
their massive scale

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.800
and what they're selling

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:19.800
to enterprises

01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:20.800
which is

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:21.800
the sort of

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.800
reliability

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:23.800
and scalability

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.800
and all those things

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:25.800
that Amazon offers

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.800
is that business model

01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.800
going where

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:28.800
are we losing

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:29.800
what seemed to be

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:30.800
a workable business model

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:31.800
for open source

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:32.800
and that'd be a bummer

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:33.800
frankly

01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:34.800
it'd be a bummer for everyone

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:35.800
it'd be a bummer for Amazon

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:36.800
huge bummer

01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:37.800
I mean here's the concern Wes

01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.800
is if

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:39.800
if I'm a VC firm

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.800
and I'm looking at backing

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.700
a massive threat to that project

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.700
as if they ever get

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.700
any kind of market share

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.700
one of the big commercial

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:45.700
hosting companies

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.700
will just re-implement it

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:47.700
See I got a little bit

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.700
of a contrarian take here

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:50.700
I think Ben's totally right

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.700
and that's a great episode

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:52.700
of the show

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.700
but the key

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:54.700
is long term

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.700
he says

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.700
VC makes sense

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.700
for software

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.700
because you have to spend

01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.700
a lot of money

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.700
and then you try to be profitable

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.700
over the long term

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.700
but the VCs of today

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.700
that's not how we operate

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.700
and I think we all got a little too hopeful

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:05.700
that

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.700
things like Mongo

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.700
things on the billion scale

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:08.700
things that

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.700
you know San Francisco VCs

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.600
are funding

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.600
was actually a sustainable

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.600
business model

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:13.600
but

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.600
Amazon was

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.600
you know AWS didn't start

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.600
till like 2007

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.600
so we're really only

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.600
one tick in here

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.600
we've gone through one cycle

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.600
and we're seeing

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.600
we got really hopeful

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.600
because it is great

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.600
you do want

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:24.600
companies that can be like

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.600
you know like Elasticsearch

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.600
for instance

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.600
they're like this is a great product

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:28.600
we've hired great developers

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.600
to build it

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:30.600
and now you can have it for free

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:31.600
and it's open source

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:32.600
but it turns out

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:33.600
it's

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.600
it's a lot more complicated

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.600
I think you can still have

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:37.600
those things

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:38.600
but not at the scale

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.500
of you know making huge amounts of money

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.500
for people

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.500
you might be able to build a sustainable consultancy

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.500
on some open source software

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.500
but I think the days of

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.500
giant

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.500
multi-billion dollar companies on them

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.500
questionable

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.500
it seems like it could be

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:53.500
a huge issue

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.500
because then it means

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:55.500
only certain companies

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.500
will have the scale

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.500
to build those kinds of projects

01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.500
and

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.500
it also makes me wonder

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:01.500
if this doesn't

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.500
have something to do with the Red Hat sale

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.500
to IBM

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.500
here's here's what

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.500
before I

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.500
before I sound the alarm

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.400
and I say that these large commercial cloud companies

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.400
are going to consume

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.400
open source projects

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.400
that ever get successful

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.400
I would like to get the audience's take

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.400
but it does require

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.400
like some serious homework

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.400
and thought around this

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:21.400
but I would really love

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.400
to either have you join us

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.400
next week in the mumble room

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.400
or

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.400
just go to linuxunplug.com slash contact

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.400
but do consider the homework

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.400
we'll have it linked in the show notes

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:31.400
the first up is exponent

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.400
episode 159 of

01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.400
Ben Thompson's podcast

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.400
where they talk about this

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.300
then

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.300
I would encourage you

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.300
to read his piece on

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.300
Stratechery

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:42.300
which we will also have linked

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:43.300
in the show notes

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.300
and then additionally

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.300
one last thing

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.300
is I would encourage you

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.300
to listen to

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.300
Late Night Linux

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.300
episode 55

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.300
where the boys just debate

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:52.300
cloud lock-in

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.300
versus on-premises

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.300
to give you a fully

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.300
rounded picture

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.300
of the issue here

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.300
and then

01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.300
I would really encourage you

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.300
to at least engage in that

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.300
even if you're not going to participate

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:02.300
in the podcast

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.300
and but then

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.300
if you do have the time

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.300
come join us

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.200
in email and let us know what you think

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.200
I would throw into

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:10.200
Brian Cantrell

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.200
of all kinds of open source fame

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.200
he's been blogging about this stuff too

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.200
and it's a little bit different

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.200
it's a little more focused on the licenses

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.200
but I think it's an important component

01:11:17.300 --> 01:11:18.200
from someone who's been through

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.200
the open source

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.200
and trying to make money

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.200
process

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:22.200
yeah

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.200
there's a lot of different

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.200
moving pieces right now

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.200
around this discussion

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.200
and it's at a different scale now

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.200
because

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.200
essentially

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.200
the thing that

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.200
companies like AWS

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.200
are benefiting from

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.100
is the open source

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:37.100
community nature of a project

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:38.100
like MongoDB

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.100
and Redis and others

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.100
has led to

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.100
strong developer adoption

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:43.100
but then

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.100
and that developer adoption

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:45.100
is super beneficial

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.100
for like

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.100
creating applications

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.100
that use that type of database

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.100
it's great for that

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.100
right

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.100
you want to make it easy

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.100
to just pull down a Docker container

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.100
so that you can try it out

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.100
if you're going to decide

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.100
am I going to use this software

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.100
in my new project

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.100
yeah maybe you're building a prototype

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.100
or you're learning

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.100
and then

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.100
when it comes time

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.100
to put it in production

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.100
for millions of users

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.000
to bang on it

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.000
and you want to tell your boss

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.000
what system they should use

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.000
I mean

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.000
who's going to fire you

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.000
for suggesting DocumentDB

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.000
you could go do

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.000
your own bespoke

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.000
implementation of MongoDB

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:15.000
up on a VPS somewhere

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.000
and manage it

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.000
but then who's on call

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.000
you?

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.000
yeah and really

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:20.000
if AWS has an issue

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.000
that's not on you

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.000
nobody gets fired

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:24.000
for choosing AWS

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:25.000
just like nobody got fired

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.000
for choosing IBM

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.000
and Microsoft

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:28.000
back in the day

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.000
and so just by being AWS

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.000
I think they're going to have

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:32.900
massive success

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:33.900
with what is essentially

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:34.900
a MongoDB

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.900
competitor slash ripoff

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:36.900
I mean

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:37.900
ripoff is a little bit strong

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.900
but yes right

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.900
I mean they implement

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.900
the same interface

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:41.900
or at least largely compatible

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:42.900
and they do that

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:43.900
with other things right

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:44.900
they've got Aurora

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:45.900
their database

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:46.900
and has a coming backend

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:47.900
that they implement

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:48.900
some like Postgres

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:49.900
compatibility layers

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:50.900
on top of

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:51.900
so it's just

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:52.900
the commoditization

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:53.900
the world of cloud

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:54.900
where once you've hired

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:55.900
the one ops team

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:56.900
to run your stuff

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:57.900
you don't really want

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:58.900
to branch out

01:12:59.000 --> 01:12:59.900
yeah man

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:00.900
I just feel like

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.800
there's a lot of expectations

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.800
for really large scale

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:04.800
open source

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:05.800
I would love to have

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:06.800
a reality

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.800
and a future

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:08.800
where Red Hat

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:09.800
wasn't the largest

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.800
open source company ever

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:12.800
free software company

01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:13.800
wouldn't that be great

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:14.800
if we could have another

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:15.800
free software

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.800
open source success story

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:17.800
that's even larger

01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:18.800
than Red Hat

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.800
right yeah

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.800
let's hope we haven't peaked

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:21.800
right

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.800
and that's my concern

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.800
is that this sort of

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.800
stifles the long term

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:26.800
ramp

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:27.800
and how big these companies

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:28.800
can get

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.800
when

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.700
we want to the audience

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:31.700
if we get good engagement

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.700
people do their homework

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.700
and turn around

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.700
and give thoughtful responses

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.700
we'll continue this

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:36.700
conversation

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:37.700
in next week's episode

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.700
and hopefully we'll get

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.700
the Ubuntu 19.04 first look

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.700
in there too

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.700
it's the Gen 2 challenge

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.700
all over again

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.700
I apologize about that

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.700
in the meantime

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.700
go get more Wes Payne

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:47.700
and now Jim Salter

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.700
over on the TechSnap

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:49.700
TechSnap.Systems

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.700
I'm really happy about that

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:52.700
we've already talked about it

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:53.700
but I just think

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.700
it's super great Wes

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.700
I wanted to mention

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:56.700
well thank you

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.700
good work on the first episode

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.700
and there is more to come

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.600
and of course you can go get him on Twitter

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.600
he is at Wes Payne

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.600
I am at Chris Elias

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.600

we've got it all

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.600
I'm hopeless Wes

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.600
but you try

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:26.600
and that's what counts

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.600
I think

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.500
I'm starting to give up

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:30.500
starting to

he was the one right before Jim

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.200
Whitehurst

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.200
and

01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:45.200
what's really interesting about it

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.200
it's a new

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.200
model

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.200
of

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.200
supporting

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.200
open source projects

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.200
so

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:53.200
you know the Red Hat model is

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.200
you buy a subscription

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.200
for Linux

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.200
and that goes to

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.200
basically towards

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:58.200
Linux development

01:15:58.300 --> 01:15:59.200
for the most part right

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.200
but the

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.200
this one

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.200
it's far more broad

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.200
so like if you have

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.200
like a lot of

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.200
open source dependencies

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.100
in your application

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.100
you can

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.100
go to

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.100
Tidelift

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.100
and say hey

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.100
I need

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.100
to make sure that

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.100
this is

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.100
getting developed

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.100
and Tidelift will go

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.100
and pay

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.100
the

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.100
project maintainer

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.100
to continue

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.100
to maintain the project

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:25.100
it's like

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.100
it's like a

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.100
like not a foundation

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.100
but

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.100
yeah

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.100
it's an interesting way

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.100
of looking at it

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.100
I think

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.100
you know

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.100
they just got

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.100
Series B funding

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.100
so we'll see

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.000
you know

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.000
where it goes

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:39.000
I just heard about them

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.000
a couple weeks ago

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.000
they've been around

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.000
apparently

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.000
for a

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:44.000
little over a year

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.000
so

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.000
yeah

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.000
we'll see

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:48.000
where it goes

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:49.000
I'm really interested

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.000
to see

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:51.000
where it goes

01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:52.000
What's their website?

01:16:52.100 --> 01:16:54.000
It's Tidelift.com

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:55.000
Good one, thank you

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.000
that's good to know about

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.000
thank you Brandon

01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:58.000
I've got to take on

01:16:58.100 --> 01:16:59.000
the whole licenses

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:00.000
MongoDB thing

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.000
Yeah, do share

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.000
Yeah so

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.000
you know

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.000
the typical model

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.000
that has become

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:05.900
common for

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:06.900
open source companies

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:07.900
is that

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.900
they basically create a market

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:09.900
for their skills

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:10.900
by

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.900
creating a product

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:12.900
that

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:13.900
is

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:14.900
sufficiently complicated enough

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:15.900
that

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:16.900
other people require

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:17.900
their skills to support

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:18.900
and also

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:19.900
that they want updates

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:20.900
to that software

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:21.900
so

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:22.900
the problem being is that

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:23.900
you have companies

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:24.900
that

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:25.900
also have the same amount

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:26.900
of skills that you have

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:27.900
and if your project

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:28.900
is popular enough

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:29.900
that

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.900
they don't want to wait for you

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:31.900
to do updates

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:32.900
or they find your support

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:33.900
too expensive

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:34.800
on their own

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:35.800
they lose that control

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:36.800
and then

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:37.800
you know

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:38.800
groups like

01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:39.800
Mongo and

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:40.800
there's been countless in the past

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.800
there's the very real chance

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:43.800
that they'll lose the control

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:44.800
and then they're losing

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:45.800
the whole reason

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:46.800
that they created it

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:47.800
in the first place

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:48.800
I mean there's other

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:49.800
more altruistic reasons

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:50.800
for creating FOSS software

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:51.800
but the typical

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.800
I need to make money

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:53.800
using FOSS software

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:54.800
how do I do it

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.800
this is a typical

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:56.800
breakdown

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:57.800
path

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:58.800
that happens

01:17:58.900 --> 01:17:59.800
but you have to be prepared

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:00.800
for that to happen

01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:01.800
if you want to delve

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:02.800
in the world of open source

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.700
novels

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:05.700
every open source company

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.700
has a

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.700
cash flow

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.700
issues

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.700
especially

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.700
with getting people

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.700
to buy their products

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.700
because

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.700
you can just go

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.700
get it for free

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.700
I mean

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.700
Canonical

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.700
could easily be

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.700
larger than Red Hat

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.700
if they could just

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.700
figure out a way

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.700
to monetize

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.700
every Ubuntu license

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.700
out there

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.700
every Ubuntu

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.700
installation

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.700
out there right

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.700
but that's just

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.700
not going to happen

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:31.700
same with MongoDB

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.600
MongoDB would probably be huge

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.600
but

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:36.600
people can just

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.600
go run their software

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.600
for free

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.600
so that's

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.600
it's

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:43.600
got to figure out

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.600
a better way of

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.600
getting

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.600
money in the hands

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:47.600
of developers

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.600
I think that

01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:49.600
that's the big

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:50.600
that's the big

01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:51.600
problem

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:52.600
is

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.600
you have to

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:54.600
one of the things

01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:55.600
that I always

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:56.600
have to remind people

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:57.600
is that

01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.600
software

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.600
is not

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.500
it's people's time

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.500
it's people's

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.500
you can't

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.500
and they can't just

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.500
keep working for free

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.500
yeah it's like

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.500
the Venn diagram

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.500
that's existed

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.500
ever since like

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:12.500
1990s when they started

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.500
doing this stuff is

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.500
there's software

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.500
that's

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.500
the triangle

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.500
you pick two

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.500
of the three things

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.500
you can have it

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.500
high quality

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.500
you can

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.500
have it free

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.500
and

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.500
you can't have both of them

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.500
like if you want

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.500
good quality

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.500
FOSS software

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:28.500
you have to be able to pay the people

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:29.500
that are making the FOSS software

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.400
to create it well

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.400
otherwise

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.400
it'll be slow

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:33.400
it'll be somebody working

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.400
on their evenings and weekends

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.400
it's a fundamental

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.400
competition between

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.400
people who are quite happy

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.400
to use stuff for free

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.400
and not

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:43.400
fund the development of it

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.400
and

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:45.400
people who aren't willing

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.400
to just spend all their time

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.400
doing nothing

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.400
and not eating

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.400
and not living in a house

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:50.400
developing software for you

01:19:50.400 --> 01:20:00.300
this is negative
