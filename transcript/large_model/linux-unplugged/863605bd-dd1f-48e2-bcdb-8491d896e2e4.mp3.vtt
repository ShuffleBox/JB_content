WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.080
Yeah, so I would give Google Domains a very solid try.

00:07.080 --> 00:12.280
I don't think it offers all of the feature sets that something like a Hover does, but

00:12.280 --> 00:15.100
they do straight up real simple mail forwarding.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.420
You can do that.

00:16.420 --> 00:20.800
To configure that, it's very easy to go right in there and set that up.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.760
They definitely have made the process of setting your domain name, pointing it to somebody

00:25.760 --> 00:29.560
else's DNS server, so like for what I did, for example, is I registered my domain name

00:29.560 --> 00:33.720
and then I went over to DigitalOcean and I got the name server information from DigitalOcean

00:33.720 --> 00:38.160
and it was very easy to plug that into my Google DNS account and point my domain to

00:38.160 --> 00:39.160
my droplet.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.920
So now I've got – I had a droplet that I hadn't assigned a domain name to for a long

00:41.920 --> 00:42.920
time.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.040
I was just going by IP because it was just for me, but now I'm going to share it with

00:45.040 --> 00:48.580
Ange and I wanted something that she could just type in the domain name.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.760
So I thought, okay, it's a good excuse to try out Google Domains.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.800
So I went over to Google Domains because it just opened up to the U.S. public today.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.080
I bought the domain.

00:55.080 --> 00:59.040
The process is – it's very straightforward, just like you'd expect.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.120
You essentially search for the domain.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.160
You use your Google Wallet account to pay for it, so whatever funding source you have

01:04.160 --> 01:07.560
for like the Play Store is the funding source you'll use to buy the domain.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.080
Once that's set up, you go in there.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.680
It's very simple, like five-button interface to manage it.

01:12.680 --> 01:18.480
One nice thing is it lists all your domains in a nice list and the last item in the column

01:18.480 --> 01:23.440
is how many days remaining on that registration, so you get a – it's really very straightforward

01:23.440 --> 01:25.340
like how long you have.

01:25.340 --> 01:26.340
Very clear.

01:26.340 --> 01:27.680
It's very minimal.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.720
And once you click into it, the fields are very basic.

01:30.720 --> 01:31.760
There's some help.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.280
But like all Google products, if you want to dig any deeper, like for example, when

01:35.280 --> 01:39.480
I wanted to find out if I could get privacy for a.us domain, they have a learn more link.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.740
Once you click that, of course, it sends you into the hell of Google help pages which just

01:42.740 --> 01:45.460
go deeper and deeper and never really answer your question.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.500
So just like all Google products, if you're comfortable, you'll be able to get something

01:48.500 --> 01:50.080
done really quick.

01:50.080 --> 01:55.240
But if you go outside their area that they have support for, it's – you hit a wall.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.600
You're like, there's nobody you're going to call.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.960
For example, and this is an ad for Hover, they're not a sponsor, but with Hover, they

02:00.960 --> 02:06.800
are my domain name registrar and I had a very complicated thing happen that was like mistakes

02:06.800 --> 02:11.920
on multiple registrars and I – there was like literally I was trapped between three

02:11.920 --> 02:15.680
different registrars who had had like an internal database that disagreed with an external.

02:15.680 --> 02:22.100
It was very complicated and one call to Hover resolved the entire thing whereas with Google,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.240
I would have been kind of just out of luck I think.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.880
I don't know exactly.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.920
They say they have support, chat, phone or email support.

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
I haven't tried that yet.

02:29.920 --> 02:35.280
I'm kind of skeptical but Google has been stepping that up recently so.

02:35.280 --> 02:42.080
So is it just a registrar or can you actually manage your DNS zone files from within Google

02:42.080 --> 02:43.120
domains?

02:43.120 --> 02:44.660
You can go in and manage some of it.

02:44.660 --> 02:48.720
So a pre-specified amount of stuff like your name servers, you can set up DNSSEC, your

02:48.720 --> 02:53.640
registered hosts, you can add synthetic records to do common things like domain forwarding

02:53.640 --> 02:58.600
or you can go to Google apps, custom resource records so like your type A domains, your

02:58.600 --> 03:00.160
C names, your MX records, PDRs.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.160
Oh, okay.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.160
Okay, so you can.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
Okay.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.440
Yeah, you can set all that stuff up.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
Very minimal interface.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.400
I'd show it to you but it has all my IP info in it.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.400
The pricing is very fair.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.920
It was $12 for a.US domain, $20 I think for a.com – no, not 20.

03:15.920 --> 03:16.920
It was very – Harold, you know what?

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
I'll search for one right now.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.920
Let's see.

03:18.920 --> 03:19.920
Give me a domain name.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
Let's see.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
Let's do Ubuntu Touch.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.920
Let's see what we get.

03:22.920 --> 03:23.920
All right.

03:23.920 --> 03:24.920
One quick –

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
So here I can show you this UI.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.560
So now it searches – it gives you a little frowny face for the UI – for the domains

03:29.560 --> 03:30.560
that are not available.

03:30.560 --> 03:34.960
So I get frowny faces for Ubuntu Touch.com and Ubuntu Touch.net but I get green smiley

03:34.960 --> 03:39.600
faces for Ubuntu Touch.org and then it's also recommended Ubuntu Touch.equipment,

03:39.600 --> 03:42.240
Ubuntu Touch.properties and Ubuntu Touch.systems.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.600
So the Ubuntu Touch.org, $12 a year.

03:44.600 --> 03:49.720
Ubuntu Touch.equipment and properties and systems are like 20, 30 and 20 a year.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.560
And so it looks like.coms are about 12 bucks a year.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.560
Same with.US.

03:52.560 --> 03:57.200
One question I have is hover offers volume pricing.

03:57.200 --> 04:01.840
So like the more domains you have on your account in hover, the less you pay for renewals

04:01.840 --> 04:02.840
for all of your domains.

04:02.840 --> 04:03.840
Yeah.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.320
Does Google appear to offer anything like that?

04:05.320 --> 04:06.320
I don't think so.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.640
I don't – I haven't played with it long enough maybe to be able to fully answer that

04:09.640 --> 04:13.640
but from the looks of it, you're just doing one domain at a time and it's just always

04:13.640 --> 04:16.600
the same flat right every time.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.720
You can add multiple domains.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.760
There's like a cart but I don't think there's any discount but I could be wrong.

04:21.760 --> 04:26.560
I gave – over the weekend I gave their latest testing ISO a spin.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.560
And it's kind of slick.

04:27.560 --> 04:32.540
So like one thing that's nice is it does some notifications that are pretty good.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.700
And one of the things it'll do is it'll actually update the installer.

04:34.700 --> 04:38.280
So I boot the live environment and I get a notification that comes up and says, hold

04:38.280 --> 04:41.360
on a second, Antigros is updating the installer.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.360
It updates –

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
Yeah, I just had that as well.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.360
Yeah.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.720
And it closes and reopens it so you get the latest installer which is pretty nice.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.720
And –

04:47.720 --> 04:48.720
That's good.

04:48.720 --> 04:54.280
So I started with the KDE 4 implementation and when I was done, what I got was it's

04:54.280 --> 04:57.960
KDE 4 but with Numix and kind of a GTK look.

04:57.960 --> 05:03.920
And before you freak out because that sounds horrible, I am surprised at how not horrible

05:03.920 --> 05:04.920
it is.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.460
It flattens KDE out a little bit.

05:07.460 --> 05:12.520
It takes away the blue glow and the very oxygen look of it.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.920
You're going Numix icons.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.840
It's kind of a GTK look to it but I actually think it's – I don't know if I'm going

05:17.840 --> 05:22.400
to stick with that look but I was surprised how well they were able to take that and translate

05:22.400 --> 05:23.400
it to KDE.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.520
And the benefit was the GTK apps also looked – everything looked kind of at home.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.000
It was kind of – I was like, wow.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
You're giving me the itch.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.240
Do you want a little bit of Arch Linux inside info?

05:36.240 --> 05:37.240
Yes.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.240
Of course.

05:38.240 --> 05:46.280
So we had voting for new Arch Linux to use yesterday and one of the six trusted user

05:46.280 --> 05:52.000
– we're the people that look after the community repository and moderate the AUR

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
and other stuff.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.080
Look after backend infrastructure.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.000
But one of the new to use is the maintainer for LXQT.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, cool.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.600
So I guess what's coming to Arch Linux into the official archive soon.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.600
Yeah, no kidding.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
And we'll probably have first class support.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
That's great.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.600
Yeah.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.600
Yeah.

06:09.600 --> 06:15.760
I know him quite well because he's on the old existing LXDE team and he's the guy that

06:15.760 --> 06:20.640
does all of the package maintaining for LXDE for Lubuntu.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.280
So he's come the other way.

06:22.280 --> 06:28.920
So he's come from Ubuntu into Arch and I've just made the transition from Arch to Ubuntu.

06:28.920 --> 06:34.040
So we've sort of passed each other in between there somewhere.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.040
Poppy I was wondering, did you ever end up getting a new laptop?

06:37.040 --> 06:39.000
I know that was on your shortlist.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.960
No, I postponed it because my warranty on the ThinkPad X220 doesn't run out until next

06:44.960 --> 06:51.160
year and the and I wanted to keep hold of it just to keep it going until it dies really

06:51.160 --> 06:53.760
because I don't really need a new laptop.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.440
I was wondering if you saw that new XPS 13 from Dell.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.440
Yeah.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.100
The new one looks awesome.

06:59.100 --> 07:06.680
But also I like the new ThinkPads that have put back the old keyboard with the proper

07:06.680 --> 07:07.680
keyboard.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.680
It's a proper keyboard.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Yeah.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.680
Yeah.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.680
Yeah.

07:11.680 --> 07:14.120
Too bad the latest unbelievably I couldn't believe it.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.120
But I have to double check.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.120
I could be wrong.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.240
It seems so impossible to believe.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.000
I would definitely double check this.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.600
But I swear, after I saw the announcement of the new Lenovo's, I went look to the video

07:22.600 --> 07:25.060
cards and their Intel 4800s.

07:25.060 --> 07:26.060
How can that possibly?

07:26.060 --> 07:27.060
Is that bad?

07:27.060 --> 07:28.060
Yeah.

07:28.060 --> 07:29.060
Yeah.

07:29.060 --> 07:30.060
Yeah.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.060
That's really bad.

07:31.060 --> 07:34.160
Because I mean, like the Dell XPS is the Intel 5500 and when you get to 5000 and you're in

07:34.160 --> 07:37.200
the Iris series graphics, it's a whole new category of Intel graphics.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.640
Oh, I didn't realize that.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.880
5000 years from when to 5500 is the new Broadwell chip.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.320
Their Iris is 6000.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
The Lenovo must be.

07:47.320 --> 07:48.320
Oh, OK.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.320
The Lenovo must not be.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.040
So they're still based on the Aswell.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.040
That seems odd though, right?

07:53.040 --> 07:57.080
Well, no, because Broadwell isn't even shipping yet, technically.

07:57.080 --> 08:01.280
Like it's just starting to come out now, like it was announced at CES.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.360
Oh, so these laptops are all having, these laptops today shipping are with a processor

08:06.360 --> 08:10.400
that's already been replaced, essentially.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.400
Maybe a little bit, but.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.400
Yeah, I guess it's gotten so good at this point, doesn't matter too much, though.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.960
And Barton said there will be an Ubuntu version, so that's good.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.960
Yeah.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.960
Yeah.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.960
So that's cool.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.800
Did you guys all see Linus's rant on Google Plus that happened like back in December?

08:23.800 --> 08:24.800
I missed it.

08:24.800 --> 08:30.580
And I just wanted to read it real quick because I really hate HFS Plus a lot.

08:30.580 --> 08:34.080
So there was this talk about, I love it.

08:34.080 --> 08:39.360
It's this Google Plus thread and they're talking about a bug and a wild Linus Torvalds appears

08:39.360 --> 08:42.120
with a great HFS rant.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.460
He says, and he goes on to talk about how there's this bug, and he talks about how there's

08:46.460 --> 08:47.460
issues with HFS.

08:47.460 --> 08:51.200
He says, quite frankly, HFS Plus is probably the worst file system ever.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.800
Christ, what shit it is.

08:52.800 --> 08:58.040
NTFS used to have similar issues with canonicalizing UTF-8 using non-canonical representations

08:58.040 --> 08:59.040
of slashes.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.480
I think they at least fixed them.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.680
The OS 10 problem seems to be fundamental.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.780
He goes on to, which is like, okay, so fundamental problems, okay, all right.

09:07.780 --> 09:09.920
So then the thread kind of gets hot, right?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.600
And they start kind of, some people come in, come on, Linus, they're trying to call him

09:12.600 --> 09:13.600
out.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.000
Linus, then some people agree with him.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.040
He comes back in to say, further in the common thread, the true horrors of HFS Plus are not

09:19.040 --> 09:24.120
in how it's not a great file system, but in how it's actively designed to be a bad file

09:24.120 --> 09:27.040
system by people who thought they had good ideas.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.500
The case in sensitivity is just a horrible, horrible bad idea.

09:30.500 --> 09:35.000
And Apple could have pushed fixing it back in that era.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
They didn't.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.640
They doubled down on a bad idea and they actively extended it very, very badly to Unicode.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.800
Okay, so NTFS did some of the same, but Apple really took it to the next level with HFS

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
Plus.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.180
There's some excuse for bad case in sensitivity in a legacy model.

09:48.180 --> 09:49.520
We didn't know better.

09:49.520 --> 09:53.000
But people who think Unicode equivalency comparisons are a good idea in a file system shouldn't

09:53.000 --> 09:54.760
be allowed to play in that space.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.320
Give them some paste and let them sit in the corner, eat it, and they'll be happy and they

09:59.320 --> 10:00.880
won't be messing up your system.

10:00.880 --> 10:06.800
He goes, and Apple lets these monkeys work on their file system, seriously?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.600
It's not even a paste-eater quality thinking.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.840
It's actually actively corrupting user data by design, Christ.

10:12.840 --> 10:17.260
There are lots of good reasons not to move to ZFS though, cough Oracle, but they could

10:17.260 --> 10:22.040
have pushed people to a case sensitive HFS, which would have then made it much easier

10:22.040 --> 10:23.800
in the long run to migrate to anything else.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.280
But no, this is not the choice Apple took.

10:27.280 --> 10:31.080
There is a case sensitive option, but Apple actively hides it and doesn't support it.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
The stupidity.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.080
It burns.

10:33.080 --> 10:39.500
Here's the thing though, when is Apple ever not doubled down on a bad idea?

10:39.500 --> 10:43.480
Every time they've had an idea, they've always said, yeah, we're still doing this.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.240
They've never admitted that they are wrong.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.640
Yeah, they even found a way to ship a one button mouse that depending on what you do,

10:48.640 --> 10:49.880
actually has six buttons.

10:49.880 --> 10:54.120
So like, yeah, they've always just like, they won't admit when it's a bad idea.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.400
I've got a Logitech mouse that's like that, but I love it.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.400
Yeah.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
Yeah.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.680
I mean, it's not necessarily a horrible idea, but it does kind of feel like they, even there,

11:01.680 --> 11:02.680
they won't admit they were wrong.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
Yeah, that's true.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.680
That there's use there.

11:04.680 --> 11:05.680
All right.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.680
So there you go.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.120
Linus Torvalds rant segment over.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.360
We should have a Linus Torvalds rant jingle, I guess.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.560
Honestly, it's really too bad that Apple gave up on porting ZFS.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
Yeah.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.640
When Oracle, as soon as Oracle got involved, they're like, nope.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.640
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.080
It's like, well, if they had just held onto that and waited and then, oh look, open ZFS

11:23.080 --> 11:28.440
and they could have used that and every Apple user would be a happy camper.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
Yeah.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
It's funny.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.880
You know, I guess, I guess I just would, I would have expected Apple to keep working

11:33.880 --> 11:40.840
with Oracle since Jobs and Larry Ellison were BFF, but I don't know.

11:40.840 --> 11:41.840
So yeah.

11:41.840 --> 11:42.840
I mean, it really is.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.580
And the only reason why I really want to even bring it up is because we were talking last

11:45.580 --> 11:48.160
week about how power users are getting sick of the Mac.

11:48.160 --> 11:54.480
Well, I mean, what I like is I have been bitching about HFS for a few years now because of production

11:54.480 --> 11:55.480
problems.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.000
And now more and more people are talking about it and it's going to be more of these kinds

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
of things that'll come out.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
HFS is horrible.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Horrible.

12:02.000 --> 12:12.920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's barely finding the microphone

12:12.920 --> 12:15.620
in all of this Pacific Northwest fog.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.880
My name is Chris.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
And my name is Matt.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.920
Matt, is it foggy up in your neck of the woods like it is down here?

12:19.920 --> 12:21.200
It's just lingering.

12:21.200 --> 12:25.080
I haven't stuck my head outside yet, but I see sunshine coming through my blinds.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.080
I think we're okay.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.080
You are such a geek.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.080
I am, right?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.080
I haven't gone outside today.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.080
I know.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.800
I really haven't gone outside if I hadn't had to drive into the studio either.

12:33.800 --> 12:34.800
So I guess.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.920
I mean, I only go as far as the wifi allows.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.920
Right.

12:37.920 --> 12:38.920
That's a good point.

12:38.920 --> 12:39.920
That's a safe bet.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.920
Yeah.

12:40.920 --> 12:41.920
It's been like this since last week.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.000
We've been surrounded in a fog, but in this fog, we have that time to reflect on the state

12:46.000 --> 12:50.800
of Linux, and we have a great show coming up for you today on the Linux Unplugged show.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.440
So coming up, just a little bit, we're going to do some quick feedback this week.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.560
And then I want to discuss the four best new Linux distributions, according to Jack Wallen

12:58.560 --> 12:59.920
for 2015.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.640
And at first, I came into this list, and I'm thinking, the four best lists.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.640
These lists.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.640
These lists.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.640
I read the list, and I'm like, hold on.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.640
Hold on a second.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.640
I think Jack's on to something.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.560
These are some compelling distributions, and you might not have heard of a couple of them.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.920
We're going to talk about that plus then, after we gave the Mac a good bashing last

13:14.920 --> 13:16.760
week and in the pre-show.

13:16.760 --> 13:21.920
It is only fair that we get a little real about some Linux issues, but I actually think

13:21.920 --> 13:23.720
it's a really great thing.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.200
And it's a list, yes, of problems, but of problems I think are addressable, and we'll

13:27.200 --> 13:29.360
talk about that in the second half of the show.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.360
So Matt.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.360
Yeah.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.360
We probably should get started.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.360
Probably so.

13:33.360 --> 13:39.840
I'll put everything aside, close my VLC window, stop watching YouTube, and maybe we'll take

13:39.840 --> 13:42.640
a moment and welcome the Mumble crew to the Unplugged show.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.480
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.480
Good morning.

13:45.480 --> 13:46.480
Hello.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.480
Hello.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.480
Hello.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.480
Hello.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.480
Hey.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
Hi-oh.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.640
So before I managed to hit record today, Popey admitted to the entire live stream that he's

13:54.640 --> 13:55.640
switched over to Integra.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.800
He's now a happy Integra user.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.800
And I'm still gainfully employed.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.520
I had to give you a hard time.

14:03.520 --> 14:07.200
No, actually, I downloaded the latest Integra release.

14:07.200 --> 14:11.880
They just actually got the testing ISO, but Wimpy reminded me they just released a new

14:11.880 --> 14:14.960
stable ISO two days ago.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.520
And I, Matt, I tried something that was crazy.

14:17.520 --> 14:25.320
I did the KDE version of Integra, and when it installs, it's kind of a GTK-looking kind

14:25.320 --> 14:26.320
of KDE.

14:26.320 --> 14:30.360
Now, before you puke, it's Numix-themed, and it actually works.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.080
It's sort of a flatter KDE.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.200
It's still KDE, but with a slight GTK look.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.920
And the result is both Qt and GTK apps look great on the desktop.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.240
It's overall, it's really, it's really well done.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.240
It's interesting.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.240
I don't know if I like it a lot.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.440
I don't know if I'm gonna stick with it, but I was pretty interested in it.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.400
So anyways, go check out the latest Integra ISO, they just released them and-

14:50.400 --> 14:52.400
Screenshots where it didn't happen.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.840
Oh, okay, okay.

14:54.840 --> 14:59.800
Actually, Chris, the installer is running right now on a spare laptop.

14:59.800 --> 15:00.800
And I was surprised.

15:00.800 --> 15:05.060
I like you, you mentioned earlier the auto update thing the installer has, and I went

15:05.060 --> 15:09.080
through the installer and it looked really familiar and I've realized where they borrowed

15:09.080 --> 15:10.080
some of the design from.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.800
It looks exactly like the Ubuntu installer.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.040
I actually, when I first reviewed Integra ISO, I made the mistake of assuming they had

15:15.040 --> 15:16.680
forked the Ubuntu installer.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
I was very-

15:17.680 --> 15:20.160
Right, no, it's their own thing, isn't it?

15:20.160 --> 15:21.160
Yeah.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.160
And it's neat.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.080
Like Popey says, when you boot up the live environment, it automatically updates so you

15:24.080 --> 15:25.080
have the latest installer.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.320
Not to mention, once installing all of the packages, they're the absolute latest version.

15:28.320 --> 15:33.040
So if you're installing right now, you're gonna get kernel 3.18, which is crazy, and

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
it's great.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.040
What were you gonna say, Wimpy?

15:35.040 --> 15:41.760
I was gonna say that when they started making their installer, it was heavily influenced

15:41.760 --> 15:47.920
on Ubiquiti and they actually had Ubiquiti's source in their tree as reference for quite

15:47.920 --> 15:49.000
some time.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.480
That was why I actually thought it was.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.800
So in my review, I sort of matter-of-factly stated it was a fork of the Ubuntu installer

15:54.800 --> 16:01.400
because I went to their Git repo and I saw the code for the Ubiquiti installer and then,

16:01.400 --> 16:04.120
even once they made their own, they still took some assets and stuff.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.320
So some of the files were actually named Ubuntu something.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.760
And so I thought, well, dead ringer, it's just a fork, right?

16:09.760 --> 16:12.640
I actually looked at the freaking code and I'm like, dead ringer.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.320
And so I say it in the show and then I got a lot of people contacting me, including the

16:15.320 --> 16:18.360
Anticross developers, like, no, actually, we wrote that from scratch and we're kind

16:18.360 --> 16:19.360
of proud of it.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.360
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.360
Yeah, it's good.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.360
Yeah, it seems pretty nice.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.360
It is really good.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.360
Because the Ubuntu installer's really nice, too.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.360
Give me the itch.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.160
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.160
I'm sorry.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.160
I had the itch, too.

16:30.160 --> 16:35.200
I think they make a cream for that.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.000
You know, there's a branding opportunity here.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, that's true.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
That's very true.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Okay.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
All right.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.160
So anyways, just wanted to give those guys a plug because they do great work and Popi

16:44.160 --> 16:47.800
reminded me a little bit before the show started and then I had a weekend adventure that I

16:47.800 --> 16:49.800
forgot to share with everybody.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.400
So let's cover another distribution that's been getting a lot of attention.

16:53.400 --> 16:59.960
And I think it's a favorite around here, Ubuntu Mate, or Matai, or Matati, or Mate.

16:59.960 --> 17:00.960
So Eric writes in.

17:00.960 --> 17:01.960
He says, it's awesome.

17:01.960 --> 17:03.360
And I thought this was a great story.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.440
Different Eric, not producer Eric.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.600
And he was struggling.

17:08.600 --> 17:12.120
He was not super happy with the direction of Unity after 12.04.

17:12.120 --> 17:16.640
He says, when it came out, Ubuntu 12.04, I was very excited.

17:16.640 --> 17:21.120
And he says, but then Unity had to show its face and I quickly found out what garbage

17:21.120 --> 17:23.160
it is and my unhappiness began.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.760
I downgraded to Ubuntu 10.04 and I found I liked it more than 12.04.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.040
I tried Gnome 3 before downgrading to see if it was any better than Unity, but Gnome

17:30.040 --> 17:33.080
3 is such a pig with different makeup, only really stupid.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.440
Sorry, Chris, I know you like Gnome 3, but I'm just channeling my Endel Tervalds here.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.800
Of course, that sounds like he's trying an old version if he's doing it on 12.04.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.080
I'm so disappointed by the direction of the Gnome team took.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.460
It feels like it's different just for the sake of being different with absolutely nothing

17:44.460 --> 17:46.600
redeeming for the power user.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.040
Everything useful is turned off by default.

17:49.040 --> 17:53.080
By the time you're done turning things on, the desktop sort of resembles Gnome 2.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.760
So why bother, I asked myself.

17:55.760 --> 18:02.080
I tried Mint 17 and I was less frustrated by Cinnamon, but it still felt like a skinned

18:02.080 --> 18:03.080
Gnome 3.

18:03.080 --> 18:08.400
Guys, I have been truly miserable since Ubuntu 12.04 and when I heard on your show about

18:08.400 --> 18:10.800
Ubuntu Mate, there was a glimmer of hope.

18:10.800 --> 18:15.480
I thought I'd give it a try.

18:15.480 --> 18:20.880
Ubuntu Mate is what every Ubuntu since 12.04, including 12.04, should have been.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.600
Mate is as fast and snappy as Gnome 2 was.

18:23.600 --> 18:28.560
It's clean and I know where everything is, no need to search for anything.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.760
Ubuntu Mate makes me feel like I spent the last few years in a nightmare and I finally

18:32.760 --> 18:33.760
woke up.

18:33.760 --> 18:38.100
I have my desktop, I have my apps like I did before, but now I have access to sites like

18:38.100 --> 18:40.160
Netflix and apps like Steam.

18:40.160 --> 18:45.160
No shitty UI, no crappy ads from Software Center suggesting what I should try, no random crashes

18:45.160 --> 18:49.120
or UI elements disappearing, my system never uses more than a gigabyte of RAM.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.720
I'm just so happy with Ubuntu, mate.

18:51.720 --> 18:57.480
I'll just say it again, it's an effective desktop, yet I have way more than before.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.320
Hopefully Windows 10 will do the same for Windows users that Mate did for Gnome and

19:00.320 --> 19:02.600
just fix it while adding tons of more functionality.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
Eric.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.040
Wow, that's pretty steep praise there.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
I should say so.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
Yeah, it definitely feels like it.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.040
Sliding inside.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.040
Yes, yes.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.040
You should be.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
I think people will really appreciate that.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.720
Eric, you take issue though with maybe basing it on a really old version of Gnome, right?

19:16.720 --> 19:24.560
Yeah, basically 1204 has Gnome Shell 3.4, which is utter crap.

19:24.560 --> 19:29.040
If he were to use a more current version, I'm sure he would have a better experience

19:29.040 --> 19:36.400
because then you've got the client-side decorations, you've got the better...it's just better overall.

19:36.400 --> 19:41.560
And like some Destros like Fedora are pre-shipping the Gnome Classic environment now, so it's

19:41.560 --> 19:42.560
much...yeah.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.560
True.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.680
And you can obtain that in Ubuntu Gnome as well.

19:46.680 --> 19:50.480
Wimpy, did you see our interview with the Mate developer on Sunday's Linux action show?

19:50.480 --> 19:51.760
I did, yes.

19:51.760 --> 19:55.240
What did you think about his comments on the transition to GTK 3?

19:55.240 --> 19:58.000
Well, I obviously agree.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.360
I'm deeply familiar with the difficulties we've had.

20:02.360 --> 20:11.120
And although I've prepared that unofficial repository with Mate built against GTK 3 for

20:11.120 --> 20:19.200
Arch users, and that when Mate 1.10 ships, I will push the GTK 3 versions into the official

20:19.200 --> 20:24.880
Arch repositories, but they are very clearly tagged as experimental.

20:24.880 --> 20:31.080
And the reason for that is that whilst they're working fine against GTK 3.14 at the moment,

20:31.080 --> 20:37.080
as with every GTK 3 release, we can't be sure what's going to happen, change, and break

20:37.080 --> 20:39.040
with 3.16.

20:39.040 --> 20:48.160
So we're kind of hoping for the day that Gnome 4 comes along, and GTK 4 comes along, so that

20:48.160 --> 20:51.320
then we have a stable API to target.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.320
Wow.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.400
Wow, I can't believe you're already hoping for GTK 4.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.400
Meanwhile, I'm...wow.

20:56.400 --> 20:57.400
It's imminent, I think.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.400
I think it's imminent.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.600
I think it's going to come soon.

21:00.600 --> 21:07.720
And the other thing that...you asked Stefano about MIR support and Wayland support.

21:07.720 --> 21:13.040
So Wayland support has been on our roadmap for some time, and definitely Stefano is very

21:13.040 --> 21:20.720
keen to start work on Wayland, but quite recently, probably...I first heard about it around October

21:20.720 --> 21:30.080
time last year, Canonical have started to commit MIR compatibility patches for GTK 3.

21:30.080 --> 21:37.880
So if that continues and comes to fruition, technically, it should be possible through

21:37.880 --> 21:41.720
GTK 3 to target Wayland and MIR.

21:41.720 --> 21:47.120
And what we would need within the Marte team is somebody who's enthusiastic about actually

21:47.120 --> 21:51.320
doing it, because it's a small team, and there's lots of jobs to be done.

21:51.320 --> 21:54.440
So there's opportunity for somebody to come in there and own that.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.440
Yeah.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.720
Yeah, I think it's dependent on Canonical finishing their work, actually adding the

21:58.720 --> 22:04.080
support to GTK 3, but I should imagine that's going to happen given this push this year

22:04.080 --> 22:05.880
for Unity Next.

22:05.880 --> 22:12.240
Now to black out 24's question, and I don't know in the case of Wayland, but in the case

22:12.240 --> 22:18.040
of Wayland or MIR, is there extra burden on the Marte project to do things like the compositor

22:18.040 --> 22:19.700
or something like that?

22:19.700 --> 22:23.960
Is there more work you'll have to do besides just toolkit stuff, or is the toolkit going

22:23.960 --> 22:26.000
to bring most of that stuff for you?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Yeah.

22:27.000 --> 22:33.200
Well, with regards to Wayland, this is one of the conversations I had last year.

22:33.200 --> 22:38.240
GTK 3 alone is all we need to bring Wayland support to Marte.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.560
We don't need to sit on top of Mutter or anything like that.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
Nice.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.560
Very fantastic.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.520
Well, I'm really interested to see how that goes.

22:46.520 --> 22:50.800
Do you think, is this going to be a transition that will be very, is there going to be a

22:50.800 --> 22:56.520
big change for users when Marte goes to GTK 3, or is the theming going to hide a lot of

22:56.520 --> 22:57.520
it?

22:57.520 --> 22:58.520
Or what's that going to look like?

22:58.520 --> 23:01.520
Could be a big change.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.520
Not really.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.440
If you install it now, you can install that unofficial repository now.

23:06.440 --> 23:12.640
So if you run up a virtual machine with, do it the easy way, go with Antergis, seeing

23:12.640 --> 23:14.800
as though you were talking about that earlier.

23:14.800 --> 23:20.760
They have Marte support, and I know they have Marte support because I helped add it.

23:20.760 --> 23:24.560
You can start with that, and then they use the official Arch repositories.

23:24.560 --> 23:30.720
You can then add my unofficial repository, and it's designed to clean the upgrade from

23:30.720 --> 23:31.760
the official repository.

23:31.760 --> 23:40.960
So you could jump from Antergis with Marte 1.8 built against GTK 2 to GTK 3 for Marte

23:40.960 --> 23:46.480
1.9, and you'd be able to see firsthand what it looks like, and by and large, it looks

23:46.480 --> 23:47.480
very similar.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.480
Interesting.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.480
Yeah.

23:49.480 --> 23:50.480
Almost the same.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.480
I mean very close.

23:51.480 --> 23:56.360
There's a few applications where because GTK 3 just implements things differently, it looks

23:56.360 --> 23:57.400
a bit different.

23:57.400 --> 24:02.560
So when there's tabs in things, the tabs are laid out a little bit differently, but by

24:02.560 --> 24:07.560
and large, it looks very, very similar, and there are a few Arch users that are actually

24:07.560 --> 24:12.760
running that GTK 3 version and have been running a GTK 3 version for about six months now.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.280
So it is good enough as a daily driver.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.160
I saw the write-up on how to do it, and I thought about it.

24:18.160 --> 24:23.400
I think I even linked to it in the Linux Action Show show notes for Sunday, and I thought

24:23.400 --> 24:27.760
about doing it just for the interview so that way I could run it, but I ran out of time.

24:27.760 --> 24:28.760
But it looks interesting.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.480
I think I'm going to try it soon.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.480
See what I notice.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.480
All right.

24:32.480 --> 24:33.480
Yeah.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.480
Okay.

24:34.480 --> 24:35.480
You know what else you should all try soon?

24:35.480 --> 24:37.480
Something that I love quite a bit, something that Matt and I use the heck out of.

24:37.480 --> 24:40.640
In fact, a lot of the hosts here at the Jupiter Broadcasting use the heck out of, is Digital

24:40.640 --> 24:41.640
Ocean.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.120
Head over to digitalocean.com right now.

24:44.120 --> 24:47.480
Go over there and check out Digital Ocean while you can, too, because I'll tell you

24:47.480 --> 24:48.480
that.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.640
Things are a-changing, my friends, in the world, and you can have your own server up

24:51.640 --> 24:53.120
in the cloud.

24:53.120 --> 24:57.240
Earlier today, Matt, today I was like Mr. Productive, Matt.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.800
I don't know what it was.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.800
Maybe I tried butter coffee.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.400
Have you ever had butter coffee before?

25:01.400 --> 25:02.400
Butter coffee?

25:02.400 --> 25:03.400
No.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.400
I was going to say maybe it was the fog.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.400
But okay.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.400
Maybe.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.400
I just decided not to go outside, so I stayed inside and got a bunch of stuff done.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.400
Right?

25:08.400 --> 25:09.400
No.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.400
I got my butter coffee.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.120
That's coffee with a little bit of butter in it and coconut oil.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.120
Yeah.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.920
And then you immersion blend that, Matt, like a bouse.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.440
You immersion blend that.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.960
And then I decided, you know what?

25:18.960 --> 25:21.440
Let's go out there and let's see if I can get a little work done.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.540
So I tried out the new Google Domains, and I registered a domain and pointed it at my

25:24.540 --> 25:26.240
Digital Ocean Droplet.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.680
The Digital Ocean Droplet that I've been using for quite a while to do things like BitTorrent

25:29.680 --> 25:35.640
Sync and my Quasal Core, you know, stuff that is just handy to have running in the background.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.440
But I never really thought, I'll just set a couple things up.

25:38.440 --> 25:42.000
I'll never really use this very long, so it's not a, you know, I don't need to register

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
a domain name.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Well, today I got that done.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Right.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.720
This is the first Droplet that I ever created at Digital Ocean.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.880
I went and registered a domain name for.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.080
And now I feel official because they've all got domains.

25:52.080 --> 25:56.800
It's really easy to set it up over at Digital Ocean because they have a DNS, part of their

25:56.800 --> 26:00.940
control panel is a real nice DNS management system that makes it straightforward.

26:00.940 --> 26:01.940
So here's what I want you to do.

26:01.940 --> 26:04.120
I want you to remember our promo code, and then I'm going to tell you about Digital Ocean

26:04.120 --> 26:06.520
because they're really awesome.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.520
It's cool.

26:07.520 --> 26:08.520
It's brand new.

26:08.520 --> 26:09.520
And it's for the entire year of 2015.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.400
So use it wisely, my friends.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.880
D.O. Unplugged.

26:12.880 --> 26:13.880
D.O.

26:13.880 --> 26:14.880
Unplugged.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.880
All one word.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.880
Lowercase.

26:16.880 --> 26:17.880
D.O.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
Unplugged is our new promo code for Digital Ocean.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.000
So what is Digital Ocean?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Go check them out right now.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.840
It's simple cloud hosting that's really done right.

26:22.840 --> 26:26.240
I've got several systems up there now because it's straightforward.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.600
I get going in no time.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.560
It's intuitive and really easy to spin up your own cloud server.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.760
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.120
The pricing plans start at only $5 a month for your own rig.

26:36.120 --> 26:40.800
You get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

26:40.800 --> 26:46.080
These droplets are running on top of Linux using KVM, all riding on SSD drives across

26:46.080 --> 26:47.080
the board.

26:47.080 --> 26:51.280
Digital Ocean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

26:51.280 --> 26:52.280
and London.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.480
But it's really the interface.

26:53.480 --> 26:57.840
And I really, just today, just today, like before the show, I literally like, before

26:57.840 --> 27:05.000
I came down, so I probably was doing this 45 minutes ago, before I came down here, and

27:05.000 --> 27:07.800
it's just, I didn't even worry about like, oh well I need to go on air, I need to start

27:07.800 --> 27:11.440
the show up, because I know how straightforward and intuitive the Digital Ocean control panel

27:11.440 --> 27:12.440
is.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.720
So I know that once I get in there, it's just going to be boom, boom, and I'm done.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.760
And it really is crazy straightforward.

27:16.760 --> 27:21.380
And they've got this API, and they've done a few iterations of it now.

27:21.380 --> 27:22.380
It's really clean.

27:22.380 --> 27:26.180
It's a really elegant API that the community has embraced and built a ton of apps around.

27:26.180 --> 27:30.160
You can take advantage of that today, right now, or you can write something for yourself.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.680
They've got a great set of documentation for it as well.

27:32.680 --> 27:35.660
Head over to Digital Ocean, check out their tutorials.

27:35.660 --> 27:39.800
They've got the best tutorials on the web, and they'll even pay you to write for them.

27:39.800 --> 27:43.280
They've got editors that can work with you, and they'll pay up to $200 for a piece you

27:43.280 --> 27:46.660
write for their tutorials section.

27:46.660 --> 27:50.700
So if there's something that you're an expert on, setting something up that you see a gap

27:50.700 --> 27:54.740
and people are searching for that, you could go make a little cash on the side, and write

27:54.740 --> 27:55.740
it up for Digital Ocean.

27:55.740 --> 27:59.620
There's just great resources over there, digitalocean.com.

27:59.620 --> 28:00.620
Go check it out.

28:00.620 --> 28:03.500
DO1plugged is our new promo code to get the $10 credit.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.100
You can try out the $5 rig two months for free.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.100
DO1plugged.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.940
It's a great deal.

28:08.940 --> 28:09.940
Digitalocean.com.

28:09.940 --> 28:12.580
And a big thank you to Digital Ocean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.260
It's so neat to have.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.500
I feel like I have my own server farm up in the sky.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.500
I know, right?

28:17.500 --> 28:22.220
I'm actually still in the process of bringing stuff over from other folks that I work with,

28:22.220 --> 28:25.780
because I'm like, can you just move it over to DO, because then I can just do it, and

28:25.780 --> 28:28.200
I can just get in there and get things done without having to monkey with whatever you

28:28.200 --> 28:29.200
got going on over there.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.200
It's great.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.200
All right, guys.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.100
Matt, I think you might have a suggestion.

28:33.100 --> 28:39.180
I have one suggestion, but we really have never solved this problem for the audience.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.180
Let's take one more crack at it.

28:40.180 --> 28:45.100
We can always take submissions from the audience, too, but Dukaked wrote in, and he's looking

28:45.100 --> 28:51.540
for an open source solution for remote support, so I think that takes out TeamViewer and a

28:51.540 --> 28:52.540
few others.

28:52.540 --> 28:53.540
Thanks for an amazing show, as always.

28:53.540 --> 28:57.420
I wanted to ask you how you go about doing remote support and screen sharing and remote

28:57.420 --> 28:59.580
control for users behind routers.

28:59.580 --> 29:03.080
This is people like friends and family behind home routers and small businesses behind their

29:03.080 --> 29:07.180
business routers and firewalls, with them probably using Windows.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.580
The company I work for uses TeamViewer and Join.me, which work well for the purpose,

29:10.580 --> 29:13.980
but I want a solution that's open source, not licensed, and has no subscription.

29:13.980 --> 29:17.820
I'm considering connecting to a port forwarded SSH server, which might help, and then using

29:17.820 --> 29:21.180
further forwarding to get into their machine over RDP, but there's got to be a simpler

29:21.180 --> 29:22.220
way of doing this.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.460
Is there a TeamViewer-like solution that I haven't heard of?

29:24.460 --> 29:25.940
Thanks for any tips.

29:25.940 --> 29:26.940
Keep our Sundays rockin'.

29:26.940 --> 29:27.940
Dukaked.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.940
What do you think, Matt, anything jumping out at you?

29:30.940 --> 29:34.620
You know, he kind of hit the nail on the head as far as, if you want to go with an open

29:34.620 --> 29:39.980
source solution, it is certainly doable, but it's going to require some work, some SSH,

29:39.980 --> 29:44.420
some of this, a little bit of that, a little bit of forwarding, a little bit of IP magic.

29:44.420 --> 29:47.100
There's nothing out of the box that I know of specifically that's going to do what he

29:47.100 --> 29:52.500
wants that's open source, and I personally just happen to use TeamViewer or one of the

29:52.500 --> 29:56.100
others, just whatever works at the time, so not off the top of my head, no.

29:56.100 --> 30:00.180
Yeah, I was thinking maybe Chrome Remote Desktop, but again, that's not free.

30:00.180 --> 30:01.660
And that's been kind of buggy sometimes.

30:01.660 --> 30:03.180
I've had some issues, so.

30:03.180 --> 30:06.540
Wimpy, is there a way to accomplish this with X2Go?

30:06.540 --> 30:07.540
There is, yeah.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.620
X2Go has desktop sharing feature.

30:09.620 --> 30:10.620
Oh my gosh.

30:10.620 --> 30:14.140
So even if I'm not using it for like remote terminal services style things, somebody could

30:14.140 --> 30:17.180
remote control my sessions still using the X2Go client?

30:17.180 --> 30:18.420
Yeah, yeah.

30:18.420 --> 30:24.160
So I have this on my father-in-law's machine at his house, so he's got port forwarding

30:24.160 --> 30:32.460
on his router to his laptop, and when he needs help, I X2Go into his machine on a shared

30:32.460 --> 30:35.100
session and we talk through what he needs to do.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.860
How does the IP mapping and stuff like that work, like when he's behind his router?

30:37.860 --> 30:40.420
Does it universal plug and play that?

30:40.420 --> 30:47.140
No, what I've done is I've put his MAC address in the DHCP server on the router so he always

30:47.140 --> 30:52.300
gets the same IP on his laptop, so the port forwarding always works.

30:52.300 --> 30:56.620
Ah, so you set up port forwarding, so that's one disadvantage, but if you have the ability

30:56.620 --> 31:01.940
to set up port forwarding, how else would you do that, because you'd have to have a

31:01.940 --> 31:08.060
piece of software on the remote client that's updating the firewall in real time with your,

31:08.060 --> 31:09.060
you know.

31:09.060 --> 31:18.420
The only other one I know is you can do reverse VNC connections, so I would have to configure

31:18.420 --> 31:26.220
at my side the port forwarding, and I can set VNC to listen, and then the client, my

31:26.220 --> 31:33.140
father-in-law, can establish a remote connection to me, and I see his screen on mine, and I

31:33.140 --> 31:39.180
use that for tech support at work, so our customers at work can effectively send their

31:39.180 --> 31:40.180
screen to us.

31:40.180 --> 31:44.580
So I'm trying to think, Skype offers some remote control features, but again, it's pretty

31:44.580 --> 31:46.060
buggy and it uses Skype.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.060
Oh, it's horrible.

31:47.060 --> 31:48.060
Yeah, I wouldn't use Skype.

31:48.060 --> 31:52.860
Yeah, Skype's not open source, and VNC's really slow, and yeah, yeah.

31:52.860 --> 31:57.380
I'm seeing Romania, R-E-M-M-I-N-A, mentioned by Kapi in the chat room.

31:57.380 --> 32:00.780
Yeah, that was kind of where I was thinking, it's just one of those things where it requires

32:00.780 --> 32:03.580
a little bit of massaging to get there, but yeah, that would work.

32:03.580 --> 32:06.780
Right, and Bentley's reminding us that Universal Plug and Play will do the port forwarding,

32:06.780 --> 32:09.380
but you have to have something that calls on Universal Plug and Play to do it.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.380
And you have to have it enabled.

32:10.380 --> 32:11.380
A lot of people don't.

32:11.380 --> 32:12.380
Yeah.

32:12.380 --> 32:13.380
And Bentley's here in the boardroom as well.

32:13.380 --> 32:14.380
Yeah, no, I know.

32:14.380 --> 32:15.380
I know.

32:15.380 --> 32:20.180
We've already mentioned Universal Plug and Play twice, so I think, and I know, so we

32:20.180 --> 32:21.620
know there's ways to do it, right?

32:21.620 --> 32:25.780
Like if there was a way to trigger Universal Plug and Play using a remote client, I like,

32:25.780 --> 32:30.900
I like honestly, if you have the ability, X2GO is going to give you unquestionably the

32:30.900 --> 32:35.340
best performance, probably better performance than any commercial packages out there.

32:35.340 --> 32:38.380
The only downside is you got to have the port forwarding set up.

32:38.380 --> 32:41.600
That doesn't, I mean, that might be, if you're doing a small group of people, that might

32:41.600 --> 32:42.600
be doable.

32:42.600 --> 32:46.220
Yeah, I was wondering too if Jitsi, I don't know if Jitsi offers a remote screen control.

32:46.220 --> 32:49.820
I think it's just remote screen sharing with Jitsi, so I don't think that would do it.

32:49.820 --> 32:53.460
But if anybody out in the audience knows the feedback thread in the Linux Action Show subreddit

32:53.460 --> 32:57.300
or go over to the contact page on Jupiter Broadcasting and let us know.

32:57.300 --> 33:01.460
I would love a fully fledged open source remote control product because right now I'm doing

33:01.460 --> 33:07.220
a mix of Splashtop, which is hit and miss, Chrome remote desktop, which is, so I like

33:07.220 --> 33:11.700
literally Matt, sometimes I have Chrome remote desktop and, and Splashtop on the same rig

33:11.700 --> 33:14.260
because at any given time, one of them doesn't work.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.860
See and that's been it for me is that like on Ubuntu boxes, Splashtop is great.

33:17.860 --> 33:23.100
On anything other than Ubuntu, Splashtop is a face to a brick wall as far as on the Linux

33:23.100 --> 33:24.100
side of things.

33:24.100 --> 33:27.420
So I tend to go like with TeamViewer and like maybe if I'm running something like Arch-based

33:27.420 --> 33:29.980
or something like that, I generally have had better luck in that space.

33:29.980 --> 33:31.780
Usually it's TeamViewer or Splashtop for myself.

33:31.780 --> 33:36.980
Oh, you know one that we've talked about like three years ago on the show is Guacamole,

33:36.980 --> 33:37.980
which is an HTML file.

33:37.980 --> 33:38.980
Oh!

33:38.980 --> 33:39.980
Or maybe it was like two years ago.

33:39.980 --> 33:42.060
I remember we talked about Guacamole really briefly.

33:42.060 --> 33:43.060
I do.

33:43.060 --> 33:44.060
Yeah, that was briefly.

33:44.060 --> 33:45.060
Yeah.

33:45.060 --> 33:50.340
And so that's another one to check out is Guacamole at guac.dev or guac-dev.org or something

33:50.340 --> 33:51.340
like that.

33:51.340 --> 33:53.100
Anyways, that's a good one that came in.

33:53.100 --> 33:57.820
Most of the WebRTC ones I can think of are all just like views you can't modify.

33:57.820 --> 33:58.820
Yeah.

33:58.820 --> 33:59.820
Yeah.

33:59.820 --> 34:00.820
Yeah.

34:00.820 --> 34:02.500
Because you wouldn't want the browser to be able to give someone remote control.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.500
Guacamole.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.500
I like the name.

34:04.500 --> 34:09.300
It's a great question and it's, it's something at the towards the end of the show, major

34:09.300 --> 34:11.660
problems on the Linux desktop 2015 edition.

34:11.660 --> 34:15.880
One of the things he calls out is remote desktop support solutions like this.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.780
So I think Ducaite kind of nailed it a little bit.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.680
I think he's kind of right.

34:20.680 --> 34:23.600
And I know there's other things out there you could obviously do.

34:23.600 --> 34:27.820
Like for example, at first I thought I always needed, if they're on Linux boxes, I always

34:27.820 --> 34:28.820
thought, oh, I need remote desktop support.

34:28.820 --> 34:30.380
And then you know what I realized?

34:30.380 --> 34:35.220
A lot of the times I can just SSH into the box, kill a process, update a thing, uninstall

34:35.220 --> 34:36.220
a thing.

34:36.220 --> 34:37.220
Exactly.

34:37.220 --> 34:41.380
And then you log in nearly as often as I thought I did when you're escaping the bloat too.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.980
So that if the, if the hangup is in fact, gooey based, a lot of times you can slide

34:44.980 --> 34:48.140
in under the radar like that and deal with whatever the hangup is.

34:48.140 --> 34:49.140
Yeah.

34:49.140 --> 34:50.140
Yeah.

34:50.140 --> 34:51.140
Yeah.

34:51.140 --> 34:53.220
Get so, I'm not familiar with get so, but there's a suggestion coming from, oh yeah,

34:53.220 --> 34:54.220
that's that.

34:54.220 --> 34:55.780
I think that's the reverse VNC thing actually.

34:55.780 --> 34:56.780
Yeah.

34:56.780 --> 34:57.780
That's exactly it.

34:57.780 --> 34:58.780
Yeah.

34:58.780 --> 35:00.620
That's the, the, the client side of the reverse VNC.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.620
Yeah.

35:01.620 --> 35:04.540
I'm making notes as we go here cause some of these are really useful.

35:04.540 --> 35:05.540
Yeah.

35:05.540 --> 35:06.540
Yeah.

35:06.540 --> 35:09.060
And I think that could be used to make a program to do this.

35:09.060 --> 35:10.060
Oh, okay.

35:10.060 --> 35:11.060
Thanks Bentley.

35:11.060 --> 35:12.060
That's good.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.620
So I guess there's, I guess you could string a few things together.

35:14.620 --> 35:15.620
That's kind of my thought.

35:15.620 --> 35:16.700
Yeah, that's definitely it.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.260
Although the extra go stuff sounds really cool.

35:18.260 --> 35:19.260
Yeah.

35:19.260 --> 35:20.620
If you just, all you need is just access to that port.

35:20.620 --> 35:23.700
So anyways, if you give us your, give us your experiences out there, send them into the

35:23.700 --> 35:27.360
show and we'll follow them up as a feedback next week.

35:27.360 --> 35:31.740
One thing I talked about today on tech talk today, and again, Chrome remote desktop hit

35:31.740 --> 35:37.380
and miss, not open source, but they did just announce the Chrome remote desktop client

35:37.380 --> 35:38.380
for iOS.

35:38.380 --> 35:43.060
So now you could like use an iPad and run it into your Linux box and have remote control.

35:43.060 --> 35:45.060
So that's kind of cool.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.060
I don't know.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.140
And you could also do on your phone.

35:47.140 --> 35:51.100
And speaking of phones, why don't we mention our next sponsor, Ting, and then we'll get

35:51.100 --> 35:54.900
into the top four distributions to look at for 2015.

35:54.900 --> 35:58.860
Linux.ting.com is where you go to support the Linux Unplugged show.

35:58.860 --> 35:59.860
Linux.ting.com.

35:59.860 --> 36:01.380
Mobile that makes sense.

36:01.380 --> 36:05.020
No contract, no other termination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

36:05.020 --> 36:06.980
Flat six dollars, pay for what you use.

36:06.980 --> 36:09.880
They just take your minutes, your messages, megabytes, add them all up.

36:09.880 --> 36:10.940
That's what you pay.

36:10.940 --> 36:11.940
It's really straightforward.

36:11.940 --> 36:15.220
Linux.ting.com will also get you $25 off your first device.

36:15.220 --> 36:20.320
If you have a Ting compatible device, they'll give you a $25 credit and they're adding GSM

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
support in February.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.240
So Ting service is going to get even better and better.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.920
And it's all still going to be pay for what you use.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.740
You can still have hotspot and tethering.

36:27.740 --> 36:30.200
They're still going to have no hold customer support.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.180
And also, they're still going to rock some great tips.

36:33.180 --> 36:36.300
Ting has always got great tips on their blog and they're doing Ting tips right now for

36:36.300 --> 36:37.500
Android.

36:37.500 --> 36:42.380
And here is a great tip for probably most of the audience is if you have a podcast catcher

36:42.380 --> 36:47.820
on Android, they've done a roundup of not only great podcast clients, but how you can

36:47.820 --> 36:51.880
set these up, fully animated GIFs so you can look at it on the smartphone itself, where

36:51.880 --> 36:57.260
you need to go so that makes your podcast only download on Wi-Fi.

36:57.260 --> 36:59.540
Hey, look at that Linux Action Show HD right there.

36:59.540 --> 37:00.540
Look at that.

37:00.540 --> 37:03.980
So that way, you only get the show, especially when you're downloading Linux Action Show

37:03.980 --> 37:07.060
HD over Wi-Fi, right?

37:07.060 --> 37:08.060
That's a nice tip.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.200
And again, think about this.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.640
This is a mobile carrier telling you how to save money.

37:12.640 --> 37:16.760
And the reason they're doing that is they've based their business model not on incentivizing

37:16.760 --> 37:18.740
you to keep buying the bigger and bigger packages.

37:18.740 --> 37:19.740
Oh, you know what?

37:19.740 --> 37:20.740
I might need four gigs.

37:20.740 --> 37:21.740
Ah, four gigs isn't enough, honey.

37:21.740 --> 37:22.740
We better go to six gigs.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.740
Oh, you know what?

37:23.740 --> 37:24.740
We're using six gigs a month now.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.220
We better go to 10.

37:26.220 --> 37:29.420
And then of course, you really end up using six, one month, four, one month, eight.

37:29.420 --> 37:30.420
The next month.

37:30.420 --> 37:31.420
Exactly.

37:31.420 --> 37:33.340
It's a huge range because your life is different every single month.

37:33.340 --> 37:34.840
So that's where Ting comes in, right?

37:34.840 --> 37:39.580
So their model is you just pay for what you use and that doesn't cost them any more if

37:39.580 --> 37:41.280
you use less or more.

37:41.280 --> 37:43.280
So they don't mind telling you how to save money.

37:43.280 --> 37:44.820
And that's why these blog posts are so handy.

37:44.820 --> 37:48.700
So this is a great roundup of how to set up your podcast catcher to only download while

37:48.700 --> 37:51.580
it's over Wi-Fi on your phone to make sure you don't get any surprise bills.

37:51.580 --> 37:53.500
It's among a bunch of other great tips.

37:53.500 --> 37:57.760
Start by going to linux.ting.com, try out their savings calculator, see how much money

37:57.760 --> 38:01.500
you would save, I'm getting like $2,000 in savings now with their savings calculator.

38:01.500 --> 38:04.820
It's crazy because I've been a Ting customer for like two years, got my Nexus 5 now and

38:04.820 --> 38:06.460
I'm just paying for what I use.

38:06.460 --> 38:07.540
Linux.ting.com.

38:07.540 --> 38:10.380
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

38:10.380 --> 38:12.220
Linux.ting.com.

38:12.220 --> 38:15.480
And thank you to all of our listeners out there who go there, check out Ting's offerings

38:15.480 --> 38:17.180
and resources.

38:17.180 --> 38:19.500
You really are helping us stay on the air by doing that.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.700
So we really appreciate you supporting our sponsors.

38:21.700 --> 38:28.220
Okay, so Jack Wallin wrote a piece for linux.com saying the four best new Linux distributions

38:28.220 --> 38:32.860
to watch in 2015, and I almost always pass over these top lists because usually they're

38:32.860 --> 38:36.780
for clicks and I don't think they're necessarily bad, but not my style.

38:36.780 --> 38:37.780
It's usually fluff.

38:37.780 --> 38:38.780
It's usually fluff.

38:38.780 --> 38:41.740
Yeah, I kind of thought this was going to be the case with this one.

38:41.740 --> 38:44.700
It's not necessarily not fluff, but it's good fluff, I guess.

38:44.700 --> 38:49.180
So he says every year new Linux distributions pop up, something new and game changing.

38:49.180 --> 38:51.820
So he's looking at some of the distributions for 2015.

38:51.820 --> 38:54.840
And Mumbaroon, feel free to jump in if you disagree.

38:54.840 --> 39:00.460
Number one distribution to look forward to, he says, is Evolvo S. Ironically, I got an

39:00.460 --> 39:05.800
email this morning that was raving about Evolvo S. He says it's incredibly simple to use.

39:05.800 --> 39:09.360
It's inspired by the Chrome OS desktop with a user-friendly interface that anyone can

39:09.360 --> 39:11.340
sit down and use immediately.

39:11.340 --> 39:14.540
The developers of Evolvo S have taken a page from Chrome OS design look and created the

39:14.540 --> 39:15.700
Bungie desktop.

39:15.700 --> 39:20.020
Bungie is not a fork of another desktop, but is built from the ground up.

39:20.020 --> 39:23.380
And I'm pulling up a screenshot right here for those of you watching the video version.

39:23.380 --> 39:25.580
It does look very nice.

39:25.580 --> 39:27.500
So Evolvo S, number one.

39:27.500 --> 39:31.540
Number two, Sparky Linux Game Over Edition.

39:31.540 --> 39:32.980
It's based on Debian testing.

39:32.980 --> 39:34.860
It's a rolling release distribution.

39:34.860 --> 39:39.580
Sparky Linux Game Over Edition adds Steam, Steam Launcher, Wine, Play on Linux to Sora

39:39.580 --> 39:44.520
along with standard gaming tools and services like Game Over Edition.

39:44.520 --> 39:50.020
Also has in it the PSX emulator, the Kega Fusion and Sega Mega Drive Genesis emulators

39:50.020 --> 39:51.620
and PSP emulator.

39:51.620 --> 39:53.820
So it comes with a lot of great stuff.

39:53.820 --> 39:56.460
And also really low resource desktops.

39:56.460 --> 39:57.460
So there's one for you.

39:57.460 --> 40:01.380
And then number three, Korora Linux.

40:01.380 --> 40:02.900
Korora Linux is a Fedora remix.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.180
We've talked about it before.

40:04.180 --> 40:07.460
You can choose between KDE, Mate, Cinnamon, GNOME, Xfce desktops.

40:07.460 --> 40:10.140
It includes a number of packages that Fedora can't ship.

40:10.140 --> 40:13.240
It's based on, like the current one's based on Fedora 21.

40:13.240 --> 40:17.260
So it includes things like Adobe Flash, Dropbox, Google Chrome, Google Earth, Google Talk plugin,

40:17.260 --> 40:22.000
RPM Fusion repos pre-setup, VirtualBox, all based on Fedora.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.100
It's like Fedora that's ready to use.

40:23.100 --> 40:27.500
In addition to all of this, Korora includes packages called Flarp, I guess, or Phalarp

40:27.500 --> 40:28.500
or whatever it is.

40:28.500 --> 40:29.500
Phalarp?

40:29.500 --> 40:30.500
Yeah, I don't know.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.580
It makes installing drivers like the Nvidia graphics driver super easy.

40:32.580 --> 40:33.780
I like that.

40:33.780 --> 40:34.780
Yeah.

40:34.780 --> 40:35.780
So that's Korora.

40:35.780 --> 40:36.780
That sounds pretty badass.

40:36.780 --> 40:38.660
That sounds pretty badass actually.

40:38.660 --> 40:40.940
And there they have great, he has a great screenshot here.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.020
Ozone OS.

40:42.020 --> 40:44.300
We first heard about this on the Linux action show.

40:44.300 --> 40:48.300
There's very little to see at the moment, but Ozone OS will be based on Fedora and will

40:48.300 --> 40:49.500
have a Numix flavored spin.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.500
It's from the Numix guys.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.500
Oh, okay.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.180
And it's going to be based on the GNOME desktop.

40:53.180 --> 40:54.180
Totally Numix stuff.

40:54.180 --> 40:58.020
What's even more interesting about this project is it's partnered with Nutrix, which sells

40:58.020 --> 41:02.980
Numix themed desktop PCs, so you might be able to buy desktops already with this distribution

41:02.980 --> 41:03.980
as well.

41:03.980 --> 41:16.460
So four distributions, Evolvo OS, Sparky Linux, Game Over Edition, Korora, and Ozone OS.

41:16.460 --> 41:19.740
All pretty different distributions.

41:19.740 --> 41:20.980
I think they might have a shot.

41:20.980 --> 41:26.180
Eric, do any of these excite your distro hopping bone that would make you want to maybe try

41:26.180 --> 41:27.180
them out?

41:27.180 --> 41:31.780
Well, not really the distro hopping bone, but one I would add to the list would be Kubuntu

41:31.780 --> 41:36.860
4, because they will be shipping Plasma 5, so that's really kind of something to keep

41:36.860 --> 41:37.860
an eye on, I think.

41:37.860 --> 41:38.860
It's a game changer.

41:38.860 --> 41:39.860
Yeah.

41:39.860 --> 41:40.860
Yeah.

41:40.860 --> 41:45.220
Derek Delvin, you feel like maybe a certain elementary OS is missing?

41:45.220 --> 41:46.220
Yes.

41:46.220 --> 41:54.180
Actually, in 2015, and I have some rumors from some of the devs that they're working

41:54.180 --> 42:00.100
in making their desktop less tightly coupled with just specific Kubuntu, which could yield

42:00.100 --> 42:01.900
good interesting results.

42:01.900 --> 42:02.900
Hmm.

42:02.900 --> 42:07.020
Like the elementary OS desktop environment, what is that called?

42:07.020 --> 42:08.020
Luna, right?

42:08.020 --> 42:09.020
Pantheon.

42:09.020 --> 42:10.020
Oh, Pantheon.

42:10.020 --> 42:11.020
Yeah, thank you.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.020
Luna is one of the releases.

42:12.020 --> 42:13.020
And there's also...

42:13.020 --> 42:18.740
And in distribution-wise, there's also Deepin, which it's a Chinese company backing it up.

42:18.740 --> 42:24.140
They have full-time developers working on it, and they're submitting code.

42:24.140 --> 42:29.380
They actually have a very different desktop environment, basically multiple type of things,

42:29.380 --> 42:32.180
but they have something unique coming out of there.

42:32.180 --> 42:35.860
I feel like Karora should be getting more attention than it is.

42:35.860 --> 42:36.860
You think?

42:36.860 --> 42:37.860
Yeah.

42:37.860 --> 42:38.860
Yeah, I do.

42:38.860 --> 42:42.180
I think Fedora is compelling, but it's just not really usable without a lot of changes,

42:42.180 --> 42:45.140
like number one, RPM fusion, and probably Dropbox and Flash.

42:45.140 --> 42:46.140
Right.

42:46.140 --> 42:48.420
But it's for someone that wants to open up the hood and get in there and actually do

42:48.420 --> 42:49.420
things themselves, right?

42:49.420 --> 42:50.420
I don't know.

42:50.420 --> 42:51.420
I think Karora has some potential.

42:51.420 --> 42:54.300
I've installed it, and I've been pretty impressed by it.

42:54.300 --> 42:59.320
And it's close to a mainline distro, so you get all the benefits of a largely supported

42:59.320 --> 43:02.500
big community distro, but with some niceties added to it.

43:02.500 --> 43:08.220
I guess that was my question, but it's like, why does each feature have to have its own

43:08.220 --> 43:10.260
different version of Linux?

43:10.260 --> 43:11.740
Oh, Alan.

43:11.740 --> 43:15.180
Well, no, I just mean even as a Linux user-

43:15.180 --> 43:16.620
No, I think it's a fair question.

43:16.620 --> 43:17.620
It's a fair question.

43:17.620 --> 43:22.540
Honestly, I want that feature, but I want it on the Fedora that I'm used to or the

43:22.540 --> 43:24.540
Ubuntu that I already have.

43:24.540 --> 43:28.360
That's why the rest of us just run Arch, because then we just install Arch and then just install

43:28.360 --> 43:30.460
whatever you want.

43:30.460 --> 43:32.380
A lot of times it's because it's silly things, Alan.

43:32.380 --> 43:35.680
It's like, well, this is based on this and this version of the desktop, which requires

43:35.680 --> 43:37.500
this version of the toolkit.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.620
And the main version of Ubuntu ships this version of the toolkit because they're shipping

43:40.620 --> 43:41.900
this version of the desktop environment.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.820
So therefore we're going to go off on our own direction.

43:43.820 --> 43:47.300
It usually starts something simple like that, that is sort of-

43:47.300 --> 43:51.900
Yeah, we've had similar complications on other systems with bundled software, and that's

43:51.900 --> 43:55.820
why we've seen a lot of unbundling happening lately, getting everything out of the base

43:55.820 --> 44:00.700
system as you can, so that the package repo determines what version of this toolkit you

44:00.700 --> 44:04.700
get or what version of this that's going to work with that and so on.

44:04.700 --> 44:14.180
I think my predictions is the top three distros for 2015 are Arch, Ubuntu Mate, and regular

44:14.180 --> 44:16.960
Ubuntu, and followed by Fedora.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.260
That's what I think the top three- I'm not saying in that order necessarily either, could

44:20.260 --> 44:25.580
be a different order, but I mean these distros are great, but I think you just can't deny

44:25.580 --> 44:29.700
the fact that every time we look at Arch numbers, they've exploded since the last time we looked

44:29.700 --> 44:30.700
at Arch numbers.

44:30.700 --> 44:31.700
So I think you got to figure that.

44:31.700 --> 44:34.300
And Mate is obviously rocking people, like look at you Matt, you just switched over to

44:34.300 --> 44:35.300
Ubuntu Mate.

44:35.300 --> 44:36.860
Oh yeah, all my systems except for two.

44:36.860 --> 44:41.740
I think I still have one running Arch proper, but everything else is running Ubuntu Mate,

44:41.740 --> 44:42.740
so yeah.

44:42.740 --> 44:43.740
Yeah.

44:43.740 --> 44:44.740
For sure.

44:44.740 --> 44:45.740
There you go.

44:45.740 --> 44:46.740
There you go.

44:46.740 --> 44:47.740
Chatroom says Quora is not that great.

44:47.740 --> 44:48.740
All right, I'll take the word.

44:48.740 --> 44:49.740
I don't actively use it.

44:49.740 --> 44:51.880
Well, and one thing I want to touch on in that article is that I think articles like

44:51.880 --> 44:55.860
that are cool in the sense that maybe they bring a little limelight to distros we might

44:55.860 --> 44:58.700
not have otherwise heard of, and they're cool to check out, you know?

44:58.700 --> 45:00.300
Yeah, that's very true.

45:00.300 --> 45:04.900
You know, I've heard some folks in the community talking about Evolvo S now to see this written

45:04.900 --> 45:08.500
up here, and I haven't really been following Sparky Linux Game Over Edition because it's

45:08.500 --> 45:09.500
called Sparky Linux.

45:09.500 --> 45:10.500
Right?

45:10.500 --> 45:11.500
Yeah.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.500
Yeah, it does sound a little unusual.

45:12.500 --> 45:13.500
It's like, okay.

45:13.500 --> 45:14.500
Yeah, I know.

45:14.500 --> 45:15.500
I know.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.220
I'm just going to plug it because I already plugged it.

45:18.220 --> 45:23.420
Linux says in the chatroom, no KDE Plasma 5 love, and yeah, you know, that's why I mentioned

45:23.420 --> 45:28.180
Kabuntu is because they're going to have a Plasma 5 straight up starting in April, so

45:28.180 --> 45:29.180
that'd be good.

45:29.180 --> 45:30.180
Yeah, definitely.

45:30.180 --> 45:31.180
Wimpy, what do you think?

45:31.180 --> 45:32.740
Do you think Deepin should be getting some love?

45:32.740 --> 45:34.980
Well, it's definitely interesting.

45:34.980 --> 45:41.460
I installed it a few months ago to have a play because I'd heard good things about it,

45:41.460 --> 45:48.060
and I have to say, if you've got a Mac switcher who's looking to go to a Linux platform, they're

45:48.060 --> 45:51.820
going to feel very comfortable with Linux Deepin.

45:51.820 --> 45:57.660
You need a fairly decent machine because it's composed to the hilt, but it's got some very

45:57.660 --> 46:02.680
sexy transitions, and it's got a unique take on control panels and what have you.

46:02.680 --> 46:09.060
It's a very tidily put together modern distribution that I have to say is different from everything

46:09.060 --> 46:10.060
else out there.

46:10.060 --> 46:11.060
Yeah.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.060
It's not at all like GNOME 3.

46:12.060 --> 46:15.020
It's not at all like KDE or KDE Plasma.

46:15.020 --> 46:17.240
It's not at all like Unity.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.340
You know, they've really done something different.

46:19.340 --> 46:20.340
Huh.

46:20.340 --> 46:22.620
Derek Devon, were you going to say something?

46:22.620 --> 46:23.620
Were you adding something?

46:23.620 --> 46:27.680
I was saying that it's not even looking like elementary.

46:27.680 --> 46:29.980
He mentioned, you know, the Mac familiarity.

46:29.980 --> 46:30.980
Yeah.

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
Yeah.

46:31.980 --> 46:32.980
Yeah.

46:32.980 --> 46:33.980
Yeah, you're right.

46:33.980 --> 46:36.540
It is distinctive, and it's quite good.

46:36.540 --> 46:38.660
If you've got a decent machine, it's worth a look.

46:38.660 --> 46:39.980
Yeah, it does look very nice.

46:39.980 --> 46:43.100
It looks like they don't do very many releases, but that's not necessarily a bad thing at

46:43.100 --> 46:44.820
all.

46:44.820 --> 46:50.780
And I know I've even looked at it before, but I cannot remember what it is based on.

46:50.780 --> 46:52.900
I think it was Debian.

46:52.900 --> 46:56.020
Yeah, it's definitely a Debian-based system.

46:56.020 --> 46:57.380
I don't know if it's a bootstrap.

46:57.380 --> 47:04.380
And I seem to remember their software manager was very creative, very colorful.

47:04.380 --> 47:05.380
Yes.

47:05.380 --> 47:06.380
We liked that a lot, didn't we?

47:06.380 --> 47:07.380
We did.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.380
Yeah.

47:08.380 --> 47:09.380
Real robust.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.380
Yeah.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.380
The deep in store.

47:11.380 --> 47:12.380
Yeah.

47:12.380 --> 47:13.380
And the reason it's difficult to pin it down is because every time they have a release,

47:13.380 --> 47:14.820
the UI is completely different.

47:14.820 --> 47:20.380
So I don't know if they've settled on this current incarnation of the UI, but every version

47:20.380 --> 47:23.860
of Deepin has been distinct from the last.

47:23.860 --> 47:26.860
But maybe they've settled on this one now.

47:26.860 --> 47:29.420
It'd be worth a review if you're doing a distro review.

47:29.420 --> 47:32.260
Yeah, we should look at it again, because it's been a year, and they have a new release.

47:32.260 --> 47:36.180
And Urban 120 in the chatroom says it's Ubuntu-based, and I believe Urban.

47:36.180 --> 47:37.180
I trust them.

47:37.180 --> 47:38.180
Makes sense.

47:38.180 --> 47:39.180
Yeah.

47:39.180 --> 47:43.180
And they have some of their own tools, like Deepin Movie Player, Deepin Music, Deepin

47:43.180 --> 47:44.180
Shot, even.

47:44.180 --> 47:48.640
And they actually look like decent tools, too, which is nice.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.740
This is definitely worth another look, I think.

47:50.740 --> 47:53.540
So I will put this on the list.

47:53.540 --> 47:55.760
You're talking about my distro hopping bone.

47:55.760 --> 47:58.460
This kind of itches my distro hopping bone a little bit.

47:58.460 --> 47:59.900
I wonder which version of Ubuntu...

47:59.900 --> 48:02.860
I bet, you know, if we did some digging, we could probably figure out exactly which version

48:02.860 --> 48:03.860
it's based on.

48:03.860 --> 48:04.860
LTS all day.

48:04.860 --> 48:05.860
I would hope so.

48:05.860 --> 48:06.860
I'm sure of it.

48:06.860 --> 48:07.860
Yeah.

48:07.860 --> 48:08.860
I'm sure of it.

48:08.860 --> 48:09.860
If it is, then...

48:09.860 --> 48:10.860
I'm going to give it a go.

48:10.860 --> 48:11.860
I think I might give it a go.

48:11.860 --> 48:12.860
Yeah.

48:12.860 --> 48:13.860
I'm going to give it a go.

48:13.860 --> 48:14.860
Deepin...

48:14.860 --> 48:20.420
And by the way, the URL that you at home would like to check out, linuxdeepin.com, linux-d-e-p-i-n.com

48:20.420 --> 48:21.420
to check it out.

48:21.420 --> 48:24.340
And you can download the 2013 or 2014 edition.

48:24.340 --> 48:25.340
And let us know what you think.

48:25.340 --> 48:26.500
We'd love to hear your thoughts.

48:26.500 --> 48:33.460
I'm looking at the view package list right now, which just redirected me to distro watch.

48:33.460 --> 48:34.460
Oh, okay.

48:34.460 --> 48:37.300
I'll do some post-show digging, because it's been a little while since I've looked into

48:37.300 --> 48:38.580
it, and it looks pretty good.

48:38.580 --> 48:39.580
Okay.

48:39.580 --> 48:41.900
We've got our last topic of the day to get into.

48:41.900 --> 48:43.740
Major problems on the Linux desktop.

48:43.740 --> 48:46.660
And at first, I thought, oh, great.

48:46.660 --> 48:49.700
This is a troll.

48:49.700 --> 48:53.980
You know, I do appreciate, boy, the snow is making my browser freak out, though.

48:53.980 --> 48:54.980
I'll tell you that.

48:54.980 --> 48:58.020
So it's got a snow background, which I do appreciate quite a bit.

48:58.020 --> 49:02.140
And I do think the headline is not quite as provocative, major Linux problems on the desktop.

49:02.140 --> 49:05.420
I think we've heard other headlines out there for these types of things that are much more

49:05.420 --> 49:06.420
attention-grabbing.

49:06.420 --> 49:07.420
So I think that's reasonable.

49:07.420 --> 49:09.620
The snow, though, really puts it over the top for me.

49:09.620 --> 49:11.380
But it is an epic write-up.

49:11.380 --> 49:13.580
And it is a long-running release, too.

49:13.580 --> 49:15.380
This is the 2015 edition.

49:15.380 --> 49:16.700
And it's brutal.

49:16.700 --> 49:17.900
So we're going to talk about that.

49:17.900 --> 49:21.420
And I think, you know, maybe counter some of it, but acknowledge some of it, and maybe

49:21.420 --> 49:22.420
not all bad.

49:22.420 --> 49:23.420
Maybe not all bad.

49:23.420 --> 49:24.620
First, I want to talk about something that's great.

49:24.620 --> 49:25.620
And that's Linux Academy.

49:25.620 --> 49:26.620
I'll shake it up.

49:26.620 --> 49:27.620
Shake, shake, shake it up.

49:27.620 --> 49:29.660
I think that's a song, actually.

49:29.660 --> 49:30.660
LinuxAcademy.com.

49:30.660 --> 49:31.660
Shake, shake, shake it.

49:31.660 --> 49:32.660
Yeah.

49:32.660 --> 49:33.660
Yeah.

49:33.660 --> 49:34.660
Shake, shake it, right?

49:34.660 --> 49:35.660
LinuxAcademy.com.

49:35.660 --> 49:36.660
Hey, Matt.

49:36.660 --> 49:37.660
Yeah.

49:37.660 --> 49:38.660
Linux Academy just added some NGINX courses.

49:38.660 --> 49:41.080
Now, we've talked about NGINX quite a bit on TechSnap.

49:41.080 --> 49:43.180
And if you've heard us mention it, and you're like, what is it?

49:43.180 --> 49:44.340
Why is it so great?

49:44.340 --> 49:45.620
Why not go take some courseware?

49:45.620 --> 49:47.300
Docker courses were recently updated.

49:47.300 --> 49:49.300
Vagrant was recently updated.

49:49.300 --> 49:50.500
Puppet stuff was recently updated.

49:50.500 --> 49:53.980
I mean, it's really all the stuff that you really got to get current on.

49:53.980 --> 49:57.420
And the great thing is that Linux Academy folks are super passionate about all this

49:57.420 --> 49:58.420
material.

49:58.420 --> 49:59.580
So they're the experts to go to.

49:59.580 --> 50:01.020
They've got step-by-step video courses.

50:01.020 --> 50:02.340
You'll be able to take advantage of this.

50:02.340 --> 50:06.500
So once you go over to LinuxAcademy.com right now, unplugged is the slash you go to.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

50:07.980 --> 50:10.980
Get your 33% discount, which is a killer discount.

50:10.980 --> 50:14.620
And then you get access to all of the content at Linux Academy.

50:14.620 --> 50:16.700
Get your own server as the courseware requires it.

50:16.700 --> 50:18.580
You choose from seven plus Linux distributions.

50:18.580 --> 50:20.340
It'll spin up that virtual server.

50:20.340 --> 50:24.100
It'll give you a public IP address and a DNS name, and you SSH into it to do all of your

50:24.100 --> 50:25.580
management courseware.

50:25.580 --> 50:28.820
And then, of course, when you've chosen, like, say you choose a CentOS rig to do your courseware

50:28.820 --> 50:29.820
on.

50:29.820 --> 50:34.340
Well, then, since that's your virtual machine, all of the courseware, all of the stuff automatically

50:34.340 --> 50:36.620
adjusts to match that distribution.

50:36.620 --> 50:38.180
You've got only a limited amount of time available.

50:38.180 --> 50:39.620
Well, they've got learning plans.

50:39.620 --> 50:44.340
You go in there and say, with sliders, Monday I have two hours, Tuesday I have one hour,

50:44.340 --> 50:45.340
Wednesday I have no time.

50:45.340 --> 50:46.340
I've got them filtered.

50:46.340 --> 50:47.340
It's crazy.

50:47.340 --> 50:48.340
I don't have any time Wednesdays.

50:48.340 --> 50:50.700
Thursdays, well, TechSnap's kind of like going to school, so I'll just do one hour.

50:50.700 --> 50:52.660
Fridays, I'll put in three hours.

50:52.660 --> 50:57.060
Then it generates me a learning plan, automatically just fits that schedule for me, keeps me in

50:57.060 --> 50:58.060
the loop.

50:58.060 --> 51:00.220
Like, it'll send me a little reminder, like, hey, bro, you've got a quiz coming up tonight.

51:00.220 --> 51:01.220
Don't forget to study.

51:01.220 --> 51:02.220
Okay.

51:02.220 --> 51:03.320
And I'll be like, thanks, Linux Academy.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.320
It's great.

51:04.320 --> 51:05.320
It keeps you right there.

51:05.320 --> 51:06.320
You go back in.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.320
You see how long the next section's gonna take.

51:07.320 --> 51:10.100
They download this content and listen to it on the go like a podcast.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.260
They have live streams where you can ask the educators questions directly.

51:12.260 --> 51:13.260
They've got a community.

51:13.260 --> 51:15.420
They'll get you going if you ever have a little bit of a bump.

51:15.420 --> 51:20.220
It's a really cool system, you guys, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

51:20.220 --> 51:22.340
Why not start with the OpenStack Essentials?

51:22.340 --> 51:23.460
Really.

51:23.460 --> 51:27.020
Like OpenStack is such a fundamental technology in the industry, and if you don't know about

51:27.020 --> 51:29.460
it, why not go just take the fundamentals courseware?

51:29.460 --> 51:33.340
I hear from folks all the time that start with Linux Academy as a total noob on a topic

51:33.340 --> 51:37.140
and take it all the way and go get certifications.

51:37.140 --> 51:42.140
It's kind of a pretty neat phenomenon, and it's unbelievable.

51:42.140 --> 51:45.200
There's folks that have gone to Linux Academy here in Washington state, some listeners of

51:45.200 --> 51:49.500
our shows that have taken Linux Academy courseware and are now working at Amazon.

51:49.500 --> 51:53.620
Linux Academy has a full set of AWS courseware, too, so you can go in there.

51:53.620 --> 51:58.120
I heard from one of them recently who gave me some info that was really useful that helped

51:58.120 --> 52:02.500
me correct something I made a mistake on, and he says, yeah, by the way, I got the job

52:02.500 --> 52:03.500
thanks to my courseware at Linux Academy.

52:03.500 --> 52:04.500
Nice.

52:04.500 --> 52:05.500
Isn't that neat?

52:05.500 --> 52:06.500
It's really cool to hear that.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.500
Yeah, it's really cool.

52:07.500 --> 52:08.500
Yeah, so go check it out yourself.

52:08.500 --> 52:09.500
LinuxAcademy.com.

52:09.500 --> 52:14.940
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

52:14.940 --> 52:16.660
You guys are doing an awesome job.

52:16.660 --> 52:18.140
They're adding new stuff like crazy, too.

52:18.140 --> 52:19.980
Holidays didn't slow them down.

52:19.980 --> 52:27.820
Okay, so this article is super, super, super long, and it is full of snow, but it is a

52:27.820 --> 52:34.820
regularly updated article that is trying to be the most comprehensive list of problems

52:34.820 --> 52:38.100
anywhere on the internet with the Linux desktop.

52:38.100 --> 52:39.900
Now this person is not a Windows advocate.

52:39.900 --> 52:43.860
He even says here, this is not a Windows versus Linux comparison.

52:43.860 --> 52:49.220
He says, I want to make this crystal clear, Windows, in some regards, is worse than Linux,

52:49.220 --> 52:51.320
and it's definitely not ready for the desktop, either.

52:51.320 --> 52:56.580
So it's not, and this guy fixes bugs for the Linux kernel, for many of the desktop environments.

52:56.580 --> 52:58.860
A long time developer.

52:58.860 --> 53:03.900
And he writes in here, in different categories, the problems that are wrong with Linux.

53:03.900 --> 53:06.180
So I'll just read a couple of them, okay guys?

53:06.180 --> 53:11.740
And this isn't about bashing Linux, but I actually think, if we look at this list, it's

53:11.740 --> 53:16.620
not such a bad idea to itemize the problems we have with Linux, because then we have a

53:16.620 --> 53:22.380
central place to sort of acknowledge these problems and work on them, right?

53:22.380 --> 53:25.420
And it definitely reads like an article that was written by someone with a clue.

53:25.420 --> 53:28.740
I disagree with a number of points, and I think there's some cherry picking, but I think

53:28.740 --> 53:30.180
it's worth looking at.

53:30.180 --> 53:35.500
So he, of course, bashes on NVIDIA Optimus technology and AKI dynamic GPU switching.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.180
Still not supported on Linux.

53:37.180 --> 53:41.460
Open source driver limitations he bashes on.

53:41.460 --> 53:44.860
He says, open source NVIDIA drivers not properly and fully support power management features

53:44.860 --> 53:46.900
and fan speeds.

53:46.900 --> 53:48.260
Mesa problems, of course.

53:48.260 --> 53:52.460
You cannot easily mix proprietary drivers and open source drivers.

53:52.460 --> 53:55.940
So you know, some things in the audio subsystem, he picks on the audio system, no reliable

53:55.940 --> 53:56.940
sound.

53:56.940 --> 53:58.900
He's referencing a lot of things here.

53:58.900 --> 54:03.020
He complains like one of ours is too many layers of abstractions lead to situations

54:03.020 --> 54:06.860
where you just cannot determine why his audio input and output is not working.

54:06.860 --> 54:12.180
So you have also kernel drivers, also libraries into DMX, pulse the audio server to also library,

54:12.180 --> 54:16.140
then pulse the backend into the application, six layers of audio redirection, and if you're

54:16.140 --> 54:21.180
on KDE, it's seven layers of audio redirection because of phonon.

54:21.180 --> 54:26.080
No reliable high definition audio support, things like above 96 kilohertz or greater

54:26.080 --> 54:29.180
than 24 bits, pretty much unusable often on Linux.

54:29.180 --> 54:31.420
No reliable system wide echo cancellation.

54:31.420 --> 54:33.760
You might notice that from our mumble room sometimes.

54:33.760 --> 54:38.320
On Windows and Mac OS, there's a system level echo cancellation that applications can take

54:38.320 --> 54:41.320
advantage of.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.580
Lots of slamming on X.

54:42.580 --> 54:45.620
X is largely outdated, unsuitable, insecure.

54:45.620 --> 54:48.580
X doesn't automatically switch between desktop resolutions if you have an application that

54:48.580 --> 54:51.220
goes full screen and running and crashes for some reason.

54:51.220 --> 54:53.900
X doesn't restore gamma properly if an application changes.

54:53.900 --> 54:56.820
So if you play a Valve or a Wine game and experience a problem, you know, he's got a

54:56.820 --> 54:58.660
command here that'll fix that.

54:58.660 --> 54:59.660
Lots of complaints with X.

54:59.660 --> 55:01.380
A huge section on X.

55:01.380 --> 55:04.900
High DPI support is pretty much nonexistent at the X level.

55:04.900 --> 55:07.660
Wayland, he's got complaints about Wayland.

55:07.660 --> 55:11.060
Applications must implement their own window shadowing under Wayland because Wayland decorator

55:11.060 --> 55:13.940
has no access to application subwindows.

55:13.940 --> 55:18.900
Applications must implement their own font anti-aliasing, or the GTK or Qt toolkits must,

55:18.900 --> 55:21.860
and there's no API for setting system wide font rendering.

55:21.860 --> 55:25.460
He says most sane advanced window systems, windowing systems, have exactly this.

55:25.460 --> 55:28.800
Windows, Android, Mac OS, you can all set system wide font rendering.

55:28.800 --> 55:34.680
In Wayland, all clients read all applications are totally independent in this regard.

55:34.680 --> 55:38.580
Applications read GUI toolkits must also implement their own DPI scaling.

55:38.580 --> 55:40.660
Again, Wayland doesn't do that.

55:40.660 --> 55:44.500
Wayland, even though there's a, even though it's version is above 1.0, is still largely

55:44.500 --> 55:48.300
incomplete and not supported by proprietary Nvidia and AMD GPU drivers.

55:48.300 --> 55:53.180
It's got a whole section on font rendering, the Linux kernel driver, problems stemming

55:53.180 --> 55:55.500
from vast number of different Linux distributions.

55:55.500 --> 55:57.620
It's a pretty long list of problems.

55:57.620 --> 56:03.180
Well, and he does link, you know, he does provide citation for 99% of the stuff, and

56:03.180 --> 56:05.900
so I'll give him props for that.

56:05.900 --> 56:10.140
I think my only real gripe with it, because it's really well written, I mean, really,

56:10.140 --> 56:11.140
I mean, it's very detailed.

56:11.140 --> 56:12.420
A lot of work went into this.

56:12.420 --> 56:16.780
Yeah, I mean, he actually cares and honestly knows what he's talking about, but I do feel

56:16.780 --> 56:21.420
like there's someone that might need to just, whatever he's developing or working on, take

56:21.420 --> 56:22.420
a break, dude.

56:22.420 --> 56:23.420
Calm down.

56:23.420 --> 56:24.420
It's not going to bite you.

56:24.420 --> 56:25.420
It's okay.

56:25.420 --> 56:27.700
And there's some stuff where it seems a little arbitrary and there's not enough information.

56:27.700 --> 56:31.260
He says the new init system, system D has been utterly broken by design.

56:31.260 --> 56:34.140
System D can and does segfault, crash, and freeze.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.500
In the same world, init system should never crash.

56:36.500 --> 56:39.300
And he even says in the comments that it's crashed for him.

56:39.300 --> 56:43.540
And then his proof for this is, well, he Google searched system D segfault, and that's his

56:43.540 --> 56:44.540
proof.

56:44.540 --> 56:48.460
I've got system D running on nine systems on a pretty heavy production load right now.

56:48.460 --> 56:50.460
And I've never had it.

56:50.460 --> 56:52.580
They've never crashed period, let alone system D crash.

56:52.580 --> 56:57.740
I've never had system D crash ever in two and a half years.

56:57.740 --> 57:02.660
And if you look at his regressions link, great writer, I have no problem with who he linked

57:02.660 --> 57:08.100
to specifically, but it doesn't actually prove anything.

57:08.100 --> 57:09.100
It's just a citation.

57:09.100 --> 57:11.900
And so it's kind of like, there's a lot of subjective stuff here.

57:11.900 --> 57:16.900
It's like how, at the end of the day, if he's really this upset about it, let's maybe flip

57:16.900 --> 57:19.340
this upside down and try and find solutions to it.

57:19.340 --> 57:23.740
Okay, there's a lot of layer abstractions, there's a lot of layering stuff in Linux distributions

57:23.740 --> 57:24.740
in general.

57:24.740 --> 57:26.500
It's kind of the nature of the beast.

57:26.500 --> 57:29.860
In 2015, computing holistically blows.

57:29.860 --> 57:32.460
I don't care what platform you're on, and that's okay.

57:32.460 --> 57:35.060
We don't have to, you don't have to make it your daily thing.

57:35.060 --> 57:36.060
So I don't know.

57:36.060 --> 57:37.060
I agree.

57:37.060 --> 57:40.700
I look at this list and I think to myself, all right, some of these problems are legitimate

57:40.700 --> 57:41.700
problems.

57:41.700 --> 57:45.340
There's a lot of layer abstractions with X and stuff, but they don't really prevent an

57:45.340 --> 57:50.580
average user from using the computer and they don't maybe even notice that if you're really

57:50.580 --> 57:51.580
an average user.

57:51.580 --> 57:52.580
No one knows.

57:52.580 --> 57:54.620
If I park this in front of some random guy on the street, they don't care.

57:54.620 --> 57:55.620
Yeah, DPI scaling, sure.

57:55.620 --> 57:56.620
Yeah.

57:56.620 --> 57:57.620
But yeah, sure.

57:57.620 --> 57:58.620
There's a bunch of stuff like that.

57:58.620 --> 58:01.940
It just makes it really hard to use a system where if you used a different operating system

58:01.940 --> 58:02.940
would just work.

58:02.940 --> 58:06.140
And it's really annoying, but at the same time, it's the kind of thing where a developer

58:06.140 --> 58:10.300
can work around it and just decide they don't care, but it's the type of thing that you

58:10.300 --> 58:12.500
can't convince your mom to live with it.

58:12.500 --> 58:17.420
Well, and the toolkit does provide, like GTK and Qt can provide some, so if they're just

58:17.420 --> 58:21.540
using, if it's a GTK app or Qt app, they'll still have the whatever the GTK and Qt systemwide

58:21.540 --> 58:27.180
anti-aliasing setting is, but like over pulse audio, you know what, I'm just, it sucks.

58:27.180 --> 58:28.180
It's just still not working.

58:28.180 --> 58:30.580
I mean, like as soon as I try a KD desktop, it's not working.

58:30.580 --> 58:32.740
If I'm on anything else, it's fine, but it's just, it's too much.

58:32.740 --> 58:36.820
It's Alex, do you have something, do you have input on the audio frameworks?

58:36.820 --> 58:42.780
Yes, I wanted to mention that the audio situation is very complicated.

58:42.780 --> 58:50.420
I would, what I would like would be a port of the media kit from Haiku.

58:50.420 --> 58:57.000
Media kit seems to be the best competitor to the sound solution on the Mac OS, which

58:57.000 --> 59:02.620
is by far the best one so far on any computing.

59:02.620 --> 59:03.620
I'll look into that.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.620
That's interesting.

59:04.620 --> 59:08.180
Dylan, you had a point on the Wayland and fonts issue.

59:08.180 --> 59:13.780
Yes, actually the windows in their design, it's systemwide and everything, but also it's

59:13.780 --> 59:19.540
worth noticing that whenever you're using anything else that is not the windows forms,

59:19.540 --> 59:21.120
you also have issues.

59:21.120 --> 59:26.100
Not to mention that actually it opened up an extremely dangerous vulnerability just because

59:26.100 --> 59:28.380
they did it in that design or that model.

59:28.380 --> 59:32.380
I remember the font bug, yes, where you could take, you could own a system with a font.

59:32.380 --> 59:39.140
Yes, it's like with a browser at that point because you can send fonts via browser.

59:39.140 --> 59:40.140
That was a good one.

59:40.140 --> 59:43.940
You know, when I looked at his list here, I thought it was exactly what you said, Matt.

59:43.940 --> 59:49.820
God, in a way, computers suck in 2015, and then I thought to myself, you know, I couldn't

59:49.820 --> 59:50.820
use anything else.

59:50.820 --> 59:52.580
I just can't use anything else.

59:52.580 --> 59:53.580
That's just it.

59:53.580 --> 59:56.460
Well, like his printer and scanner argument, that made me angry because I will tell you

59:56.460 --> 59:59.780
any day of the week, you give me a printer and you hook me up on a windows box, I'll

59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.580
drop the CD in, and then I'll take a trip up to visit Alan, and then I'll come back

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.740
and it'll still be installing the software, okay?

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:06.740
I'm just saying.

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:11.180
I didn't even read that because I just felt like, and also that's an old argument, well,

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.660
these don't work with a Macintosh, you can't, well then you buy the stuff that works with

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660
what you use.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:17.700
That's what, so that argument is crap.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:21.740
If you bought a win modem back in the day and then decided to switch over to Linux and

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.340
the win modem didn't work, well, then you bought the wrong device or you shouldn't have

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:25.940
switched to Linux.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.160
When you buy a printer, you check compatibility.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.020
That just seems like a given.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:34.500
Well, specifically when I bought my new printer, I bought one that was networked so that it

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.060
wouldn't matter, I didn't have to plug it into any machine.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.460
Exactly, because then you don't care.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.540
It also meant I didn't have to have that machine on when I wanted to print, because I wanted

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:44.180
to put the printer in my office downstairs and I didn't want to have to leave a computer

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.180
on.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.180
Yep.

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:49.260
So, Zero, I was curious about your point regarding the NVIDIA driver.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.340
So the thing with NVIDIA, it kind of piggybacks along with what you said about printers and

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:58.540
printers, you know, get hardware that works with what you use, a lot of people complain

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:04.500
that NVIDIA doesn't have good support using Linux, and that's mostly, especially Optimus

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:10.180
and things like that, that's because we have proprietary drivers that work well when they

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:19.180
work but can fail often from NVIDIA, who has time and time again shown that they really

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:24.980
don't care about Linux at all, you know, and got the finger from Linus Torvalds over

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.980
that.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.980
That's true.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.380
And the people who are trying to make these things work in Linux, who are reverse engineering

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.540
these things, you know, there aren't very many people like that because the people who

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:38.460
cared about freedom in the first place enough to potentially reverse engineer these things

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.780
just didn't buy NVIDIA in the first place.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.780
Yeah.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.660
Wimpy, you have a point regarding printers, I'd like to hear that.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:49.740
Yeah, just like any bit of hardware, when you buy a printer these days, you should buy

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:54.700
a printer that supports your operating system, just like Alan said, and when I went shopping

01:01:54.700 --> 01:02:01.340
for a new printer last year, I was able to find one that not only clearly had Linux support

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:07.340
but also supported Android, and that wasn't through the Google Cloud Print API, they actually,

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:13.980
this is a brother printer, and they actually have a printing app in the Google Play Store.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:20.580
So you can even now, you know, find hardware that's compatible with your mobile devices

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.580
as well.

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.580
Yeah, very good point.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.780
And Urban, I'll let you have the final word, because it's a great point, you can't necessarily

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:33.540
blame Linux if HP doesn't make a driver for a scanner, right?

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:43.060
I think that responsibility for drivers is entirely on the company that makes that hardware,

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.500
and it's not on Linux.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:51.340
If HP doesn't do the drivers for Linux, screw them, we'll use something else.

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.340
That's right.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.980
I mean, that's why I bought a brother laser printer for the Office, because it just had

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.500
great Linux support.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.580
What I did is I just went and checked CUPS and saw the driver in CUPS, and I'm like,

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:02.980
okay, well then I know it'll work on everything that runs CUPS, and I'm good.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.460
Yeah, that's just it.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.700
At the FreeBSD Foundation, I've been trying to take that argument kind of the other way,

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:13.420
instead of being like, hey, this manufacturer doesn't make drivers for their device, screw

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.940
them, it's more like, well, why don't we get together a big group and demonstrate the demand

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.180
to them, and then they'll bother, and we'll give them the resources to help them build

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.180
the driver.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.180
That's a good idea, too.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.180
I like that.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.180
That's excellent.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:29.500
And that's how we have more 40 gigabit network drivers than other operating systems now, because

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.020
we demonstrated the need.

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:39.340
Well, and shops like Microsoft, they have huge departments dedicated to specific pieces

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.340
of hardware.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:44.900
So they have, like for the Windows Server development team, on that team, there are

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:49.660
sub-hardware teams that work just with manufacturers on getting drivers into that version of Windows.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.140
So there's a networking card department, a printer department, a storage department,

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.140
and they might even have sub-departments.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:00.500
I mean, it's very structured, and all those teams do is work with vendors to get drivers

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.000
written and certified for Windows.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.180
So the FreeBSD approach makes sense, because that's what the commercial shops have been

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:08.180
doing for a while.

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:11.300
So one last thing with this article, too, I want to point out that I wish he would have

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.420
addressed is that when it comes to legacy devices, such as an older printer, an older

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:20.980
scanner, including Canon products, you will find that Linux is quite supportive, whereas

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.380
newer versions of Windows will tell you to go F yourself.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.380
You're on your own.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.720
So, you know, just saying.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.100
He's got a great bunch of stuff.

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:32.220
And the reason why I like it is it's hard, it's a little aggressive in its language,

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:35.780
but it's accurate, it's referenced for the most part, some of its conjecture, some of

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:38.140
its personal opinion, but some of its fact, and you can't deny it.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.540
It's a pretty good citation, too.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:42.780
I actually think it's not bad to, some people think I'm being negative.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:47.100
I don't think it's bad to lose sight of shortcomings so that way we can focus on those and make

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.980
them even better, because there's opportunity if Linux shores these things up.

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.220
So the only way to do that is if we keep ourselves accountable.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.220
Absolutely.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:58.380
Well, and to his credit, when an adjustment is made or he discovers something that actually

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:02.780
counters a previous point, he will cross it out and actually update it.

01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:03.780
So that's cool.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.780
Yeah, very much.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:05.780
All right.

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:10.820
And if you're not thick-skinned and you might be a little hard to read, I don't know, I

01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:11.820
just wanted to say.

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.820
Put your big, warm pants on, you'll be all right.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.820
Yeah.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.820
Pour yourself a cold one.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.820
Exactly.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:16.820
Well, go on.

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:17.820
Okay, that's fair enough.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.820
You can read it.

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.220
Throw it in your read later queue or something like that.

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:25.820
Oh, by the way, just fun to point out, he does, I just went off the whole list of problems

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.820
with Linux.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.260
It might be fun to mention.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.060
Here's a few things he thought was wrong with Windows.

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:32.060
Devastating Windows rot occurs.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.540
No enforced file system and registry hierarchies.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:38.380
Svshost.exe, no more needed to be said there.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.100
Not a true safe mode, it's not legitimately a true safe mode.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.780
No clean state option.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:49.860
The user as a system administrator is bogus and most users just totally ignore UAC.

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.500
No good packaging mechanism, MSI is a fragile abomination.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:57.140
No system-wide update mechanism, which includes third-party software.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.460
Windows is extremely difficult to debug.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.100
Windows boot problems are often fatal and unsolvable unless you reinstall from scratch.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.140
Windows is hardware-dependent, especially when you're running from UEFI.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:11.420
Windows updates are unreliable and they also waste disk space and there's no way to cleanly

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:12.420
upgrade your system.

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.820
There will be thousands of leftover files, etc.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.020
So again, he's not saying Windows is great.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.380
And I would agree with all that list.

01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:20.380
Yeah.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.380
Yeah.

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.380
He did a pretty good job, I think.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.380
I mean, considering.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.380
Yeah.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.380
Yeah.

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.380
Alan, final thought on the topic?

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:31.300
Oh, I thought I heard Alan, but then I didn't.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.300
Oh, I guess he left.

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.940
He said something in the mumble room and then he left.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.940
He dropped his PSD microphone.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:35.940
He's like, you know what?

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:36.940
Boom!

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.940
Yeah.

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:42.820
But Alan wanted me to mention before he left that TechSnap, episode 200 of the TechSnap

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.060
program is coming up just in a couple of weeks.

01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:51.540
And if you've listened to TechSnap and something we've talked about, a story we've covered,

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:55.620
a question we've answered or anything like that has ever helped you at home on your network

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:59.660
or in your office, project, somewhere out there a little TechSnap advice has been helpful

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.660
for you.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:04.180
So just send it into the TechSnap program, go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact,

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.740
choose TechSnap from the dropdown and send in your story.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.800
We're going to have a special episode 200 where we'll be reading through some of those

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.040
to celebrate.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.060
So it's kind of amazing, 200 episodes in a row too.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.060
Wow.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:17.060
Wow.

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.060
Which is nuts.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.060
All right, guys.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.060
Well, I just will wrap it up there.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.980
I want to remind you that I'm looking for your personal runs Linux, either ones you

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.100
find, that's fine too, but I'd really love to see your setups.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:30.160
Email them to linuxactionshow at jupitabroadcasting.com and put runs Linux in the subject line.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.180
And if you need to send in a video, put that up on YouTube.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.660
If you've got a picture, please put that up on Imgur and link that because I just pull

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:37.660
down the text.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.100
I don't pull down attachments.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:41.260
And I'd love to feature those in an upcoming Linux action show.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:46.140
You can also submit ones you find out in the wild to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.700
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com is also a great place to make this show and our other shows

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.660
even better and give feedback.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:57.540
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com, anything like a story, community engagement, an app pick,

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:01.100
runs Linux, anything like that on the subreddit, it's really welcome.

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.340
And it helps make everything better.

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:06.780
And don't forget you can join us live at jblive.tv, 2pm Pacific, jupitabroadcasting.com slash

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:11.420
calendar to get that in your local time zone and then you can hang out in our chat room,

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.860
join our open mumble room, and even title our show.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.340
It's a lot to do, so join us, won't you?

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:21.620
All right Matt, well coming up on Sunday's Linux action show, we'll have a great show

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.180
and I've been following the news already, got a few stories I can't wait to talk about.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.860
So join us on Sunday for that, so I'll see you then Matt.

01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:28.860
See you then.

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:29.860
Okay everybody.

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:30.860
Well guess what?

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.540
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.540
Do join us, won't you?

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.100
And don't forget we've also got Android apps so you can watch Jupiter Broadcasting on the

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:41.020
go and jblive.info which is an audio only stream which works great when you're in the

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.340
car over 3G or maybe you're at your desk and they don't want you using video.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.580
It's a great option, jblive.info.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.580
Okay everybody, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:08:49.580 --> 01:09:10.860
We'll be right back here next Tuesday.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:49.300
I don't know if there's been a series of videos.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.700
We're going to be talking about the Ubuntu Touch Terminal Emulator.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:53.700
It came out once before but we didn't talk about it on the show.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:10:01.740
And this is the new multiple tab Ubuntu terminal that we might see ship in 1504.

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:06.860
And one of the things I would look at is the animation is pretty smooth, it's pretty slick,

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.900
it looks pretty good.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.980
So watch as now he'll click this and there he zooms out and there's the different tabs.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.020
So instead of tabs along the top you have sort of like a tab overview, sort of almost

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:18.540
like the Firefox tab overview page.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.900
And you can see like the scroll action there looks real smooth, it's nice looking.

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:23.900
Looks like a nice equal product.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:29.020
So just to be clear, this is the terminal for the phone that we happen to have made

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:33.740
sure it works on the desktop and tablet, Convergence, which is...

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.220
CONVERGENCE!

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:40.380
But it's not in the phone yet, it's in the store if you've got a phone and you can grab

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.380
the code, it's all open source, it's cool.

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:51.060
It's actually maintained by the same guy who made Cool Retro Terminal.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:56.300
You know, I just gotta say, it's stuff like this that makes Linux so compelling.

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.300
This is just good!

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:03.120
Yeah, this is fun and I like the...

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:08.140
It's definitely not like desktop optimized, but I like that they didn't make it for the

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:10.600
desktop necessarily, but yet it's still functional.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:11.600
So that's good.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.460
And I saw it had a Retro Cool Terminal mode too, which is really neat.

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:18.220
Yeah, the little thing down the bottom, I don't know if you can see this, there's a

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:23.780
little pop-up menu and what we're planning for that is for it to be customizable.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:30.020
So you can have a pop-up menu for Emacs and a pop-up menu for Vi and it has all your keyboard

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.820
shortcuts pre-filled in and you can define your own.

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.820
Oh, shut your mouth, that's cool!

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.820
That's great, guys.

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:38.700
JSON file or something, that's really quite cool.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.700
I can't wait for that.

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:44.060
Did I just hear customizable and Ubuntu in the same sentence?

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.060
Oh boy.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.060
Oh snap.

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.060
Sure snappage.

01:11:47.060 --> 01:12:10.140
Get it back in your box.
