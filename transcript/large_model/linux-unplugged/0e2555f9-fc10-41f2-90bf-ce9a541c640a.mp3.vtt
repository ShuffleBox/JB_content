WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.920
All right, Eric, you got me to boot into Windows.

00:03.920 --> 00:04.920
Oh, nasty.

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
I know.

00:05.920 --> 00:06.920
I know.

00:06.920 --> 00:07.920
Blame me.

00:07.920 --> 00:08.920
Blah, blah, blah.

00:08.920 --> 00:09.920
Oh, jeez.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
This is a bad sign.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
So it's a Broadcom manufacturer.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.120
It says it's a Dell Wireless 1560.

00:15.120 --> 00:16.120
What have you got?

00:16.120 --> 00:17.120
What have you got?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.120
What have you got?

00:18.120 --> 00:19.120
What have you got?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.120
Ayo, it's a Broadcom chip.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.240
It's in a Dell laptop.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.440
It says it's a Dell Wireless 1560 802.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.720
What Dell laptop?

00:25.720 --> 00:28.160
Is it that new sexy, shiny one with no bezels?

00:28.160 --> 00:29.160
Yep, yep, yep.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.640
Oh, you're a bad man.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.640
Is it nice?

00:31.640 --> 00:36.120
Yeah, it's very nice, except for the wireless on the Antigros Live CD isn't getting picked

00:36.120 --> 00:37.120
up.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.520
So I'm trying to work back what I've got to do to make this happen here, because I'd love

00:40.520 --> 00:44.120
to get it installed during the show, but jeez, I don't even know where my USB adapter is.

00:44.120 --> 00:48.000
I'm willing to bet the Broadcom STA driver will do just fine.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.280
All right, well, I will be right back.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.600
I'm going to go see if I can find my USB.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.600
Oh, yeah.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.600
Okay, I'll just share this.

00:54.600 --> 01:00.240
So in the Ubuntu documentation, or Ask Ubuntu, or all those various places, it says about

01:00.240 --> 01:05.440
installing the Broadcom STA, bloody, bloody, bloody, and actually what I found worked best

01:05.440 --> 01:13.080
is installing the Linux firmware package, and magic happened, and my Broadcom card in

01:13.080 --> 01:16.840
that one laptop that was a pain in the ass just works with the firmware.

01:16.840 --> 01:23.120
So I shipped that in Ubuntu MATE because it works on those machines where it says, oh,

01:23.120 --> 01:27.120
what you really should do is, you know, if you go into the Give Me Additional Drivers,

01:27.120 --> 01:32.000
it recommends that Broadcom STA thing, which, by the way, doesn't work for this particular

01:32.000 --> 01:36.320
chipset in my laptop, but just lobbing the Linux firmware on does.

01:36.320 --> 01:41.720
So I'd start there because it does less damage than installing the Broadcom drivers, which

01:41.720 --> 01:44.720
if they don't work are a bit of an ass to then yank out.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.200
And it has to be compiled with DKMS, yeah.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.840
Okay, so I'll go see if I can find a USB adapter, and maybe by the end of the show I can try

01:51.840 --> 01:52.840
to get the wireless working.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.840
Oh, what?

01:53.840 --> 01:54.840
Now it doesn't see.

01:54.840 --> 02:00.320
I brought, so I realized I got the Ethernet adapter all set up, but of course, guess what?

02:00.320 --> 02:02.580
All my Ethernet's in use in here right now.

02:02.580 --> 02:10.720
So I went and took a Wi-Fi adapter off of our Raspberry Pi here, but for some reason

02:10.720 --> 02:11.720
it's giving me a hard time.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.720
Oh, here we go.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.720
Here we go.

02:13.720 --> 02:14.720
Now it's prompting me for the password.

02:14.720 --> 02:19.360
So I'll be using an old Wi-Fi adapter, and then once I get it installed, hopefully I'll

02:19.360 --> 02:22.080
be able to get the drivers installed for the built-in Wi-Fi adapter.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
So as a-

02:23.080 --> 02:24.080
I've got-

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
Pre-show flight-

02:25.080 --> 02:26.080
I've got questions for you, Chris.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.080
All right, yeah.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.040
So as a pre-show flight, right now before we go, I'm at the Antigros live CD.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.440
It's updating the installer right now.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.840
I've got a wireless dongle off on the side.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.080
We'll see if by the end of the show if I have a successful installation.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.960
What was your question, Mr. Whippy?

02:37.960 --> 02:44.680
Well, first of all is aside from proprietary Wi-Fi chipsets, is it nice?

02:44.680 --> 02:45.680
Oh yeah.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.040
Oh yeah, it's pretty exceptional.

02:48.040 --> 02:53.200
So it has a nice sturdy bottom feel to it.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.640
It's definitely very thin, and it's surprisingly light.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.700
In fact, when I picked it up, I wondered if the battery was missing.

02:58.700 --> 03:04.160
And the screen is indeed touch, and the touch works under Linux, which is nice.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.760
And the glass is pretty much edge to edge.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.000
It's pretty nice.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.540
And the keyboard looks like a good size keyboard, and the trackpad's a good size too.

03:11.540 --> 03:14.120
So hopefully by the end of the show, I'll have working Antigros, and I'll tell you how

03:14.120 --> 03:15.120
else it works under Linux.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.960
The main thing right now for me is I'm a little worried about the Wi-Fi, which I'm sure

03:17.960 --> 03:20.600
if folks got the Sputnik edition or whatever they're going to call it, they'd probably

03:20.600 --> 03:22.520
have that worked out.

03:22.520 --> 03:28.960
So do you think you could remove a panel on the bottom and expose the Wi-Fi chip and replace

03:28.960 --> 03:32.520
it with an Intel something works in Linux variety?

03:32.520 --> 03:37.800
Well, it looks like it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight torque screws,

03:37.800 --> 03:40.440
and there's a panel that pops off, and then the bottom comes off.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.480
I can see the motherboard through the ventilation, so it's probably doable.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.480
Okay.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.960
Well, yeah, we don't want to do that yet.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.800
You don't want to bastardize it before you get started.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.760
If the Linux firmware trick works and I can get the driver working that way, that'll probably

03:53.760 --> 03:54.760
be the way I go.

03:54.760 --> 03:59.320
Yeah, because I'm cheap, I only buy old hardware, and the first thing I do is yank out the Broadcom

03:59.320 --> 04:05.800
things and buy an Intel something from Germany for nine euros, and then install that and

04:05.800 --> 04:07.320
all your problems go away.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.640
So do you want to hear a story from the other side of the fence?

04:10.640 --> 04:18.440
You've got this lush new Dell machine, which is felt and is an Apple Mac beta, so at work

04:18.440 --> 04:23.040
my boss has decided that it's time for a new laptop, and it absolutely is time for a new

04:23.040 --> 04:27.320
laptop for him, and he wanted something that was relatively lightweight and super powerful.

04:27.320 --> 04:33.320
So he scoured the internet, and he asked me a few questions, and he found the HP ZBook

04:33.320 --> 04:38.680
14 mobile workstation, which on paper is a very competent machine.

04:38.680 --> 04:45.680
It's got an i7, and it's got integrated graphics and discrete graphics, and it's got automated

04:45.680 --> 04:47.720
flip-overs and all of that good stuff.

04:47.720 --> 04:52.320
He doesn't care about Linux, so that's not an issue for him, and it just works.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.960
So he said, I want one of those.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.960
Can you get me one of those?

04:54.960 --> 04:55.960
And I said, sure, no problem.

04:55.960 --> 04:56.960
Of course I can.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.760
So you go to the HP website.

04:58.760 --> 05:04.720
The first thing about the HP website is unlike any other PC manufacturer, you can only buy

05:04.720 --> 05:06.640
what they're prepared to sell you.

05:06.640 --> 05:12.440
You cannot customize a system and say, I want this with these modifications.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.200
So that sucks.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.040
So then I say, right, well, we want this one, so order that.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.360
And then he comes back to me and says, oh, no, no, I want the one with the touch screen.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.920
So I say, right, no problem.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.640
So I phone up HP and said, that order that you've placed, we want to cancel that because

05:25.640 --> 05:27.520
we want to order one with the touch screen.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.200
So they cancel the order, and then they tell me, well, there isn't one with the touch screen.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.440
And I say, but your specification document says that there is.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.760
A week goes by, the order that we've canceled arrives, and we have to arrange for it to

05:38.760 --> 05:41.000
be picked up and returned to them.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.920
They then tell us, oh, yeah, actually, we do make that one with the touch screen, but

05:44.920 --> 05:46.440
it wasn't in our sales catalog.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.640
So we're going to add that to our sales catalog.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.840
So another few days pass, it's in our sales catalog.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.440
Would you like to place the order now?

05:53.440 --> 05:55.120
So yes, I'd like to place the order now.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.000
So I order the laptop and all the extra accessories.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.100
And this is last Friday, and today I get an email out of nowhere saying, your order has

06:02.100 --> 06:03.100
been canceled.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.560
And we don't know why, and we're not quite sure what happened.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.160
But could you phone us up and place the order again, please?

06:08.160 --> 06:09.160
Oh, my God.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.160
I hate that.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.160
HP suck.

06:11.160 --> 06:15.560
If anyone from HP is listening, you suck.

06:15.560 --> 06:20.840
Lenovo and Dell have got you beaten hands down six ways of Sunday.

06:20.840 --> 06:21.840
You suck.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.920
You have wasted three weeks of my life to buy one fuckmothering laptop.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.480
Waste of my arcing time.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.340
And it's not even that stellar.

06:30.340 --> 06:34.120
I've been trying to talk my boss into getting a Lenovo Carbon X1.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.920
Awful, awful, awful people don't buy HP computers.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.560
It's like they don't want to make money.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.360
Oh, it's just crap.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.840
I actually had a little bit of a bumpy ride with the Dell.

06:44.840 --> 06:50.680
So the Dell is, first of all, the whole buying process on the Dell website is way too cluttered.

06:50.680 --> 06:55.960
I don't mean to make comparisons, but like, and obviously System76 has a lot less parts,

06:55.960 --> 06:58.840
but it's so much more clear what I'm getting and if I'm getting the right one.

06:58.840 --> 07:03.460
On Dell's website, I fundamentally question if I'm ordering the right part under the right

07:03.460 --> 07:04.980
division, et cetera.

07:04.980 --> 07:05.980
So that's very confusing.

07:05.980 --> 07:09.640
Then they canceled my order at one point, but none of the accessories.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.960
So they were billing me and shipping me the next day all of the accessories instead of

07:13.960 --> 07:17.260
shipping all as one shipment, they shipped each thing independently.

07:17.260 --> 07:18.920
So I've had the inverse of that.

07:18.920 --> 07:24.400
So today we've replaced the order and the order is just for the laptop, but for none

07:24.400 --> 07:30.840
of the accessories that we had previously requested in the original order.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.440
So then I'm like, okay, so I'm getting the, so then I call them up and they had to verify

07:34.440 --> 07:35.880
something about the address.

07:35.880 --> 07:42.620
So the studio here is, it's a duplex, so we have a unit A, unit B, and I put the address

07:42.620 --> 07:47.200
in and then the second address line, I put unit A. Well Dell's system wants unit A on

07:47.200 --> 07:50.940
the first address line and the street address on the second address line.

07:50.940 --> 07:54.560
And because I did those backwards, they canceled the order.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.560
Yeah.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.560
Brilliant, isn't it?

07:56.560 --> 08:00.120
Honestly, it should be buying a computer be this difficult.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.280
And the thing is, is that I'm going to phone them up to, I'm going to put a, cause I was

08:03.280 --> 08:07.920
busy with other stuff today, so I had to ask one of the guys in the office to sort the

08:07.920 --> 08:16.320
reorder out, but I'm going to phone them up to her and give them, well, the air will be

08:16.320 --> 08:21.640
blue around my desk tomorrow morning because you know, I order all of the equipment for

08:21.640 --> 08:25.800
all of the people that work in the company and all of our customers, which is not an

08:25.800 --> 08:33.360
insignificant amount of hardware and I am not going to buy any HP equipment ever again.

08:33.360 --> 08:39.780
And my purchasing experience, you have to set as a backdrop to ordering some really

08:39.780 --> 08:47.080
sophisticated complicated server hardware from IX systems and you cannot, you cannot

08:47.080 --> 08:49.280
even begin to compare the difference.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.440
Right. So much more complex too, which is ironic.

08:52.440 --> 08:59.360
I know, I know a lot more complex. Each individual machine we're talking, you know, $30,000 per

08:59.360 --> 09:04.220
server versus a couple of thousand dollars for a laptop. And you know, it takes weeks

09:04.220 --> 09:09.480
to negotiate the parts and the build and the fit. You remember those mega core systems

09:09.480 --> 09:14.680
that FreeBSD Foundation have got? Yeah, we're buying like those, like they go out of fashion

09:14.680 --> 09:15.680
at the moment.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.680
Really?

09:16.680 --> 09:17.680
We think they're great.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
Oh yeah.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.680
I'd love to see pictures.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.680
Do you ever get to see them?

09:20.680 --> 09:24.720
Yeah. I'll get you pictures. We've got a floor to ceiling rack of those.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
Woo!

09:25.720 --> 09:29.800
Doesn't TechSnap have a discount code you could be using?

09:29.800 --> 09:30.800
No, just the URL.

09:30.800 --> 09:36.720
Don't you, I'll tell you what, I first got the idea through listening to TechSnap and

09:36.720 --> 09:42.480
went off and read about IX, say August, whenever it was. And I didn't actually get around to

09:42.480 --> 09:48.600
calling them and placing an order until about six months later. But in the order code, it

09:48.600 --> 09:54.040
triggered the fact that I'd first visited the website from TechSnap months and months

09:54.040 --> 09:59.000
and months before and attributed the thing to TechSnap.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Thank you.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.200
Even though a lot of time had passed in between the first contact.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.560
You maybe you're a big part of the reason why IX renewed for 2015 then.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.560
I hope so.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.560
I hope so. That's really cool.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
But they make stellar.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.560
Aren't they?

10:11.560 --> 10:15.840
Like I really wish when I was doing IT purchasing that I, I think they were around for a big

10:15.840 --> 10:21.840
part of it, but I just didn't know about them. And I instead fought with folks like HP and

10:21.840 --> 10:23.520
Dell all the time.

10:23.520 --> 10:31.600
Yeah. No, we use IX for all of our server equipment now. And as much as I like love

10:31.600 --> 10:42.560
Linux, for firewalls, we use HACOM for their PF sense firewalls. They're pretty great.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.480
So they're active passive PF sense firewalls.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.520
Oh, they are PF sense on the software side though?

10:49.520 --> 10:57.240
Yeah. Yeah. So it is dedicated to PF sense. So it's a 1U rack with two blades in it. So

10:57.240 --> 10:58.240
two firewalls.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
Are they loud?

10:59.240 --> 11:01.280
With carp. No, no, no, they're quite quiet.

11:01.280 --> 11:02.280
Yeah.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.280
How much does one go for?

11:03.280 --> 11:08.280
I think it's about two and a half thousand, $4,000 I think by the time we'd got all the

11:08.280 --> 11:09.280
bits and bobs I did.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.280
Of course.

11:10.280 --> 11:11.280
Of course.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.480
So, you know, they're, they're, they're proper, they've got six Ethernet ports on each blade.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.880
So they're, you know, proper, proper job.

11:16.880 --> 11:21.000
So you guys want to see another gadget. So I, with the Dell, I ordered a bunch of accessories.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.160
This I don't know if you're watching the video stream. It's a, it's about, it's about the,

11:25.160 --> 11:29.280
it's about half the length of a credit card, maybe about a little more than that and thicker.

11:29.280 --> 11:33.280
So it's a, I don't know what to describe it. It's, it's smaller than a Roku. It's a small

11:33.280 --> 11:37.080
little thing. You could probably fit it in your pocket. And what it is, is it has a USB

11:37.080 --> 11:43.720
3.0 plug that flips out on one side and on one, on one side it has VGA and HDMI out.

11:43.720 --> 11:48.960
And on the other side it has gigabit Ethernet and another USB 3.0 port. And so you plug

11:48.960 --> 11:53.320
this into the Dell and you get HDMI and you also get Ethernet, which I thought was probably

11:53.320 --> 11:56.840
pretty good because I'd like to have both of those pretty much every time I sit down.

11:56.840 --> 12:01.120
And I think it was like 60 bucks or maybe even less than that. So, cause there's no

12:01.120 --> 12:02.120
Ethernet.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.120
That's a nifty gizmo, isn't it?

12:03.120 --> 12:06.160
Yeah. And I think it's all using standard stuff. So I'm going to find out. All this

12:06.160 --> 12:09.520
is, I mean, I'm going to try to do the full review. I'm going to try to, you know, say

12:09.520 --> 12:13.800
these accessories work and don't work and stuff. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Did you

12:13.800 --> 12:17.960
guys hear about this? This is a great post from Linus over the weekend. Linux kernel

12:17.960 --> 12:23.920
development halted. Linus is pretty upset. Of course he's not on the East coast, but

12:23.920 --> 12:26.760
it's still when it snows on the East coast, it affects Linus pretty bad. He says, you

12:26.760 --> 12:31.120
people on these coasts think you have it bad with snow storms and whatever. That's nothing.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.800
My coffee maker broke and calling the service hotline says we're not open today due to inclement

12:34.800 --> 12:38.720
weather. You guys get a little snow and suddenly civilization breaks down. My coffee maker

12:38.720 --> 12:42.840
is broken and nobody's answering the phone and CNN just keeps talking about snow. What

12:42.840 --> 12:47.600
about my coffee? Priorities people priorities. What am I going to do without my coffee maker?

12:47.600 --> 12:54.080
Am I just going to sit here in a corner crying? That's what I thought that was supposed.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.960
Some of the comments were pretty good too because it's like, well obviously you need

12:56.960 --> 13:06.440
your coffee maker in a raid. Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's

13:06.440 --> 13:12.120
installing all its updates and blocking kernel modules right now. My name is Chris. And my

13:12.120 --> 13:17.160
name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. How you doing? Doing pretty good. Doing pretty good. I'm

13:17.160 --> 13:20.960
excited today. I got a new laptop in that I'm messing with right now. I just got the

13:20.960 --> 13:27.200
base OS installed during the pre-show. That's exciting. I got that new computer smell. Right.

13:27.200 --> 13:32.200
Also that new computer wireless frustration. So I've got like a, I've got like a wireless

13:32.200 --> 13:36.960
dongle that's hanging off the side of the thing that I took from a raspberry pie. Other

13:36.960 --> 13:43.160
than that, it's not so bad. So yeah, I got the new XPS 13 in and it came a lot sooner

13:43.160 --> 13:47.800
than I was expecting. And uh, I guess, I guess the big point, I guess they want safe and

13:47.800 --> 13:52.120
assuming there's a Broadcom thing going on. Yeah. It's called Dell wireless, but it's

13:52.120 --> 13:55.520
a Broadcom. And I guess Dell wanted to cash in those Bitcoins before they dropped any

13:55.520 --> 14:00.300
further. So they send it quick. And uh, so I'm, I'm, uh, I'm providing you right now

14:00.300 --> 14:04.280
as we do the show with the wireless, I got a few things. I got, I just installed the

14:04.280 --> 14:08.180
before or whatever it is firmware. I got the firmware just installed, but I think I'm like

14:08.180 --> 14:11.480
halfway through there. So we'll see if I get it by the end of the show. I might get distracted

14:11.480 --> 14:15.480
by the show, but I gotta say it's, it's a nice device. So I'll give you a quick update

14:15.480 --> 14:19.920
about the, uh, the laptop and my first impressions, uh, later on in the show and just a little

14:19.920 --> 14:23.520
bit, because I got a few things and then I'll run Linux on it for a little while and give

14:23.520 --> 14:26.800
you the, uh, the final opinion. I've already gotten several emails, people asking what

14:26.800 --> 14:30.960
I think about it. So I'll tell you that. Hey Matt, you know, it's not a, it's not a real

14:30.960 --> 14:34.980
Linux unplugged without bringing in our virtual lug. So let's delay no longer time appropriate

14:34.980 --> 14:43.600
greetings. Mumble room. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hello. So we've got a great show today coming up

14:43.600 --> 14:47.800
on today's episode of Linux unplugged. We're going to do the feedback like we always do.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.080
Then there's been a topic that the IRC room has been chatting about all day. It's this

14:52.080 --> 14:57.560
new Vivaldi browser. No, not the tablet. No, not the Vivaldi tablet. Stop it. No, it's

14:57.560 --> 15:03.080
a browser. And, uh, it's, it's making a lot of waves today. And of course it premiered

15:03.080 --> 15:05.860
on Linux. So we're gonna talk a little bit about that and I'll give you a quick demo

15:05.860 --> 15:11.560
of it in the show. Uh, there's also a couple of items to follow up on in, uh, from last

15:11.560 --> 15:16.320
week's show. And then, uh, we have a little surprise for Matt at the end of the show.

15:16.320 --> 15:21.920
Ooh, really? Yeah. Surprise for Matt. Surprise for Matt at the end of the show. So we'll

15:21.920 --> 15:26.800
see what that's about. So let's start with a quick followup sort of errata from a Sunday's

15:26.800 --> 15:31.880
Linux action show crossroads one, one, one, two writes in to say just a quick note on

15:31.880 --> 15:36.520
the Lumina desktop on arch thing. I actually just had to rename the AR package is now Lumina

15:36.520 --> 15:41.320
dash desktop dash get to avoid confusion with the German locale. Uh, so he says, uh, please

15:41.320 --> 15:45.440
stress also on air that it's missing some features. Most of the network management icon

15:45.440 --> 15:50.520
does not show up yet. Uh, probably cause PCB SD has its own network manager. There's some

15:50.520 --> 15:54.120
upstream work to make it work with Debian. When I get time, I'll look into further Linux

15:54.120 --> 15:57.660
improvements. So it's just early, but just a reminder, the Lumina desktop, which we've

15:57.660 --> 16:01.620
talked about on the show, we've demoed it on the show and we've interviewed Chris, Chris's

16:01.620 --> 16:05.480
brother who's working on it on this show. So I just quick follow up to that. You can

16:05.480 --> 16:08.880
get it on the Lumina desktop. It has now moved over to arch, but there's a few pieces missing

16:08.880 --> 16:12.560
in the packages called Lumina dash desktop dash get and Crossroads wanted me to make

16:12.560 --> 16:18.540
a quick mention of that. So there we go. Jed writes in, and I love this email, Chris, Matt,

16:18.540 --> 16:22.720
my son has finally gotten motivated to actually do something more than play flash games on

16:22.720 --> 16:27.260
Linux. He's been using an old Dell lapi with a broken screen hinge. I decided he could

16:27.260 --> 16:32.240
have my broken Lenovo T 43. I like it. Just give him die, passing down broken rigs. Just

16:32.240 --> 16:37.260
like I do. Uh, one of the offices, but here's the conditions. He backed up his old computer

16:37.260 --> 16:41.240
home director using our sink. Uh, he does this his, and then his own district install

16:41.240 --> 16:45.240
and then he installs wine. I gave him links to some, to some tutorials about using our

16:45.240 --> 16:50.200
sink and he already knew how to use G edit. He installed an SSH key for his backup. He

16:50.200 --> 16:55.120
installed 1404 Ubuntu and the XFC weather plugin. And then we churn through a play on

16:55.120 --> 16:59.120
Linux and he learned that we needed to move aside his previous post files and restored

16:59.120 --> 17:04.000
his backup from his files from his first laptop. So now my sixth grader runs Guild Wars two

17:04.000 --> 17:08.720
from his own install effort. He made a deal to get on track and fit and, uh, on field

17:08.720 --> 17:12.680
team and the school in the spring as sort of like a tit for tat. Matt, thank you for

17:12.680 --> 17:15.760
all the efforts on last. We cannot wait for your tutorial show listening since episode

17:15.760 --> 17:17.600
one, Jed.

17:17.600 --> 17:22.000
That's awesome. That's so cool. Sixth grade man. And he's already rocking SSHs. That's

17:22.000 --> 17:27.480
so cool. I love that. I mean, that's like, wow, I'm thinking about like what I was doing

17:27.480 --> 17:30.640
at sixth grade and it's like, uh, had that been an option, that would not probably been

17:30.640 --> 17:35.040
what I was doing. So that's really cool. Yeah. I wonder about like, uh, my kids, like I want

17:35.040 --> 17:39.880
to, uh, I have, uh, I started with the, uh, the Chromebook, but it's just such an unreliable

17:39.880 --> 17:43.880
piece of junk when it's running just Linux and I haven't replaced the, uh, the bios that

17:43.880 --> 17:49.240
they nuke it from time to time. So, uh, I, I have like this old HP that's falling apart

17:49.240 --> 17:54.360
that they've used for a while. And I have this really old janky iMac that's it's old,

17:54.360 --> 17:58.400
but I was thinking about maybe putting Linux on that, but really what, what, what my son

17:58.400 --> 18:03.440
Dylan wants it for is to play Minecraft. That's what he wants Linux for. Yeah. He wants Minecraft.

18:03.440 --> 18:08.040
Respect that. Respect that. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, I, he also, you know, would probably play

18:08.040 --> 18:10.840
around with it, but I've, I've, I've been thinking a lot about like, what's the right

18:10.840 --> 18:14.720
computer to get for a kid. Something that is powerful enough to play Minecraft and maybe

18:14.720 --> 18:20.260
a few other games, uh, but not super expensive and a really good Linux box. And I keep thinking

18:20.260 --> 18:25.080
of like the NUC and stuff, but even that's pressing the price of what I want to pay.

18:25.080 --> 18:29.160
So this is an area I've been thinking about. Maybe I need to do is just buy myself more

18:29.160 --> 18:34.960
computers and give them a hand-me-down. This is what he's talking about. That sounds like

18:34.960 --> 18:39.000
what Jed does too. And you know what, in a way that's kind of what I've done with my

18:39.000 --> 18:43.660
smartphones. Uh, it's, and it's so straightforward with our first sponsor Ting because you only

18:43.660 --> 18:47.480
pay for what you use. So I can actually have them get like a little tablet and then they

18:47.480 --> 18:50.720
just, whenever we go out in the road and they have, they have to do something that has data,

18:50.720 --> 18:53.400
which happens from time to time. I don't, I don't stress about having to have some sort

18:53.400 --> 18:57.600
of data plan. They just pay for it when they use it. Go over to linux.ting.com to check

18:57.600 --> 19:02.740
out our sponsor Ting. I've been Ting customer for over two years now, saved over $2,000

19:02.740 --> 19:07.040
and I still recommend them every single day. I'm really happy. And I got to say almost

19:07.040 --> 19:09.920
every month since I've been a Ting customer, I feel like there's something new for me to

19:09.920 --> 19:15.360
be excited about something that Ting is bringing that I'm like, like they read my mind. And

19:15.360 --> 19:20.180
of course the one I'm thinking of right now is the rollout of GSM. They've already sent

19:20.180 --> 19:24.720
out the first SIM cards to early GSM beta testers. You can actually go over and order

19:24.720 --> 19:29.080
one on the Ting store right now. And I got two of them and I'm going to slide one in

19:29.080 --> 19:32.520
the, I'm going to reload my Nexus 5, get it all clean just cause I wanted to start fresh

19:32.520 --> 19:36.160
anyways and we'll have, or I'm going to try to talk Rekai into doing it. And then after

19:36.160 --> 19:41.160
Rekai does it, I'm going to put my new Ting GSM SIM in there. I'm going to rock Ting GSM

19:41.160 --> 19:44.300
for a while. And you only pay for what you use with Ting. They just take your messages,

19:44.300 --> 19:47.400
your minutes and your megabytes. They add them all up. Whatever bucket you fall into, that's

19:47.400 --> 19:51.560
what you pay at the end of the month. It's just $6 for the line. You starting to see

19:51.560 --> 19:56.160
how much sense this makes when you can take advantage of CDMA or GSM. Plus you then consider

19:56.160 --> 20:01.200
all the value you get from an incredible dashboard and no hold customer service. And Ting has

20:01.200 --> 20:05.120
a ton of great devices. I wanted to recommend also you check out their blog. They have a

20:05.120 --> 20:08.400
ton of great tips and tutorials over there. Like here's one. It turns out G plus can be

20:08.400 --> 20:12.720
a huge data hog. The app on your phone, the G plus app can be a massive data hog. So they

20:12.720 --> 20:16.600
just have a quick tutorial on how to clean that up so you can keep G plus, but maybe

20:16.600 --> 20:22.520
not have it use up as much data. Nice quick tips like that. Here's just an idea of devices.

20:22.520 --> 20:28.080
Right now you can pick up an iPhone 4S from Ting for $130. That's it. You own it right

20:28.080 --> 20:33.440
there. No contract, no early termination fee. iPhone 4S, $130. What about the HD Desire

20:33.440 --> 20:40.440
510 Blue? Also $130. Just add it. A great HTC built phone for $130. Or if you want to

20:40.520 --> 20:46.140
go get the Cadillac, the HTC One, $340 over at Ting and you own that phone that's yours.

20:46.140 --> 20:50.580
And that is an amazing phone with an incredible screen, unbelievable speakers, and you might

20:50.580 --> 20:55.000
think that the universal remote that it has built in there is kind of gimmicky, but it's

20:55.000 --> 20:58.800
super cool, especially if you have kids and they lose the remote all the time because

20:58.800 --> 21:03.060
you can turn on stuff with your freaking phone and it really feels like the future. Plus

21:03.060 --> 21:07.600
those front facing speakers kind of alleviate the need for external speakers. So if you

21:07.600 --> 21:10.240
like to listen to podcasts on the go or maybe like when you're doing something and you just

21:10.240 --> 21:13.240
want to set your phone down, like I set it down next to me when I'm doing dishes and

21:13.240 --> 21:18.280
I can hear podcasts, perfect with the HTC One. $340, you own that phone, it's yours

21:18.280 --> 21:21.780
from Ting. Isn't that neat? They have all kinds of great devices including just SIM

21:21.780 --> 21:26.940
cards if you want to put a CDMA or GSM SIM in your own device. Linux.ting.com, that supports

21:26.940 --> 21:32.300
the show and saves you $25 off your first Ting device or if you have one you can bring,

21:32.300 --> 21:38.200
get your $25 credit. Linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

21:38.200 --> 21:43.000
Great devices, great prices, and great stuff coming up. There's a Wolf writes in and this

21:43.000 --> 21:47.600
one is kind of, I'm going to punt over to our mumble room to see if they have any experience

21:47.600 --> 21:51.200
with this. He wants to know, he says, hey Chris and Matt, but I'm going to ask the mumble

21:51.200 --> 21:55.920
room Matt if you don't mind. He says, I've heard about ArchBSD. The site is an exact

21:55.920 --> 22:00.400
copy of the Linux homepage but with some BSD modifications. It says the project is all

22:00.400 --> 22:05.920
about porting Pac-Man to free BSD, which they did back in 2010, and they say they keep following

22:05.920 --> 22:10.320
the KISS philosophy. I'm not a BSD guy at all but this might actually be worth a try.

22:10.320 --> 22:14.400
He says keep up the great work. He says he's practicing Markdown, he loves all the shows.

22:14.400 --> 22:20.280
So anyone in the mumble room have any experience with this ArchBSD thing?

22:20.280 --> 22:22.560
A tiny bit.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.640
Yeah? And?

22:24.640 --> 22:29.880
It works and it is BSD with Pac-Man on it. It's kind of compelling.

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
Interesting.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.880
Is it current BSD?

22:31.880 --> 22:38.840
That I couldn't say because I'm not so familiar with BSD to tell how current the underpinnings

22:38.840 --> 22:43.240
are, but in terms of the packages I could install in it, the packages were definitely

22:43.240 --> 22:44.240
current.

22:44.240 --> 22:47.920
Too bad Alan's not here. I'm sure he'd have something to say.

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
Yeah, yeah.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.680
I'm sure he'd have some mocking to say. He'd say, what's the point? That's what the port

22:51.680 --> 22:54.000
system is for. That's what package add is for.

22:54.000 --> 23:00.080
Well, that's what the AUR is. It's just a kind of portstree effectively, isn't it? Compile

23:00.080 --> 23:01.080
from source portstree.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.080
Yeah, a better one.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.080
Yeah, well said.

23:03.080 --> 23:09.080
Well, now that I have package NG, which I think is a port of Debian package manager.

23:09.080 --> 23:13.400
Well, it's similar, right? Like in functionality, I've only used it very little. So I, yeah,

23:13.400 --> 23:19.400
but I mean, it's, I mean, FreeBSD, honestly, in a lot of ways is doing it right. Yeah,

23:19.400 --> 23:24.260
you have the core system and then you have the port system. And so I would imagine if

23:24.260 --> 23:29.000
you could add the AUR on top of that, the problem I would imagine, I have no idea and

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
having never used this, but it seems like a crap ton of stuff wouldn't build. It seems

23:34.000 --> 23:35.640
like a lot of stuff wouldn't build.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.640
Why not?

23:36.640 --> 23:40.120
Well, because it's like, it's just a totally different system. It's not an arch system

23:40.120 --> 23:44.300
and there's, it's a totally, I mean, I don't know. I don't move a lot. I don't move around

23:44.300 --> 23:48.960
a lot, but it seems to me like it's already a little tenuous sometimes if stuff is going

23:48.960 --> 23:52.520
to build using AUR. It's not super tenuous, but you still have situations where stuff

23:52.520 --> 23:57.560
just fails to build because something's different. I guess, I guess if you had a completely separate

23:57.560 --> 24:02.160
copy of the AUR and you could modify all the package builds and I guess that was, I guess

24:02.160 --> 24:06.840
if you totally had a separate AUR, then I could see it working, but it doesn't seem

24:06.840 --> 24:11.720
like it would be as beneficial because it wouldn't be as popular. Am I missing something

24:11.720 --> 24:12.720
here?

24:12.720 --> 24:18.200
No, no, no, no. I mean, I don't know about, I think cross-platform compatibility won't

24:18.200 --> 24:23.960
be such a big, big issue for most projects. I think most things all port almost seamlessly.

24:23.960 --> 24:28.520
I think a lot of the upstream developers these days pay attention to making sure their stuff

24:28.520 --> 24:31.360
works on other platforms other than just Linux.

24:31.360 --> 24:35.200
I suppose the problem's getting less and less as FreeBSD gets more and more popular.

24:35.200 --> 24:42.040
And if you look at projects like Arch Linux ARM, for example, they pull in the Arch Linux

24:42.040 --> 24:52.160
packages and they just replace the I-686 and X86-64 architecture flags for ARM6 hard float

24:52.160 --> 25:02.400
and ARM7 hard float and things just flow in and 99 times out of 100, stuff just works.

25:02.400 --> 25:09.080
But why would you have the AUR? I mean, it would take the focus away from ports.

25:09.080 --> 25:14.080
It's not just the AUR. They've actually got the community and extra repositories, you

25:14.080 --> 25:19.120
know, so they're binary distributions of the packages rather than everything compiled from

25:19.120 --> 25:20.120
source.

25:20.120 --> 25:27.600
Yeah, I suppose the way I look at FreeBSD and OpenBSD, because I mainly float around

25:27.600 --> 25:33.920
the OpenBSD world, you're better off getting those resources that want to work on an AUR

25:33.920 --> 25:38.600
to sort of come on board and submit patches into the ports tree and then maintain ports

25:38.600 --> 25:43.000
because then that way it gets a lot more coverage, a lot more visibility and a lot more testing.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.120
You have a lot more people looking over the code that you're submitting as a port and

25:47.120 --> 25:52.040
then that way you've got a better balance of quality.

25:52.040 --> 25:57.900
Most of the Arch derivatives just use the AUR without any abstraction though, because

25:57.900 --> 26:05.320
by adding a few architecture flags to a package in the AUR, it's applicable to ARM and PowerPC

26:05.320 --> 26:14.040
hardware for those architectures and those spin-off projects that support those platforms.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.160
I find it to be interesting, but it to me never seems like it's something that would

26:17.160 --> 26:18.160
go mainstream.

26:18.160 --> 26:24.480
Yeah, it is interesting. It's not for me, but it's kind of fun to tinker with.

26:24.480 --> 26:29.200
Yeah, it could maybe be for somebody, it could be like the perfect setup, or for a lot of

26:29.200 --> 26:32.000
somebodies even.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.080
So I want to talk about... Oh, a couple of quick things I wanted to mention. I have this

26:39.080 --> 26:45.320
XPS 13 laptop. I'll give that just a quick overview. And then also, if anybody out in

26:45.320 --> 26:52.520
the audience has considerable audio production editing, like with music and creating sequences

26:52.520 --> 26:57.640
potentially even, and laying that down to an audio track and things like that, and multi-track

26:57.640 --> 27:02.960
editing, send in a shout... Just send me a shout, chris at jupitabroadcasting.com. Let's

27:02.960 --> 27:03.960
talk.

27:03.960 --> 27:09.000
That was one thing I had. And there was another item, but I forget what it was, but I'll think

27:09.000 --> 27:12.840
of it as the show goes on. But there's another topic of business that I need to talk to the

27:12.840 --> 27:17.440
audience about. But why don't I mention while I'm thinking about it, this XPS 13, because

27:17.440 --> 27:19.280
that's what's got my attention right now.

27:19.280 --> 27:24.540
So I didn't actually expect to get this until halfway into February. So when somebody rang

27:24.540 --> 27:30.280
the doorbell, my response is, who the hell is that? That was a joke.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.280
Matt came by to troll you.

27:31.280 --> 27:35.640
Right, so I go down there, and of course it's a small box, and I thought, well this can't

27:35.640 --> 27:38.960
be the laptop, because it doesn't come in a box. It's like this small little box. But

27:38.960 --> 27:48.080
no, it was the actual laptop. And it came with Windows 8.1 installed. And I normally,

27:48.080 --> 27:51.400
if I was buying this for myself, I probably wouldn't buy a Dell to begin with. That was

27:51.400 --> 27:55.960
a question that came up on the subreddit. I kind of bought this for two reasons. The

27:55.960 --> 27:59.840
first reason is we have a machine that's going to be getting replaced here in the studio,

27:59.840 --> 28:04.440
and this could go there if it meets all expectations. But the real reason I wanted to get this is

28:04.440 --> 28:09.080
I think this is going to be, from a hardware design standpoint, people who love Lenovo

28:09.080 --> 28:13.080
love Lenovo. But if you're not a Lenovo fan or maybe you want something else, I think

28:13.080 --> 28:19.880
this is going to be the laptop to beat Buildwise. I think this is a MacBook Pro killer, really.

28:19.880 --> 28:24.320
This screen is better than what's shipping on the Macs right now. The resolution's fantastic.

28:24.320 --> 28:29.960
The edge-to-edge glass is super nice. It really looks good. Plus it's a touch screen, which

28:29.960 --> 28:35.640
I, you know, it's not like a big deal for me, but it's an augmented way to do input.

28:35.640 --> 28:39.720
The keyboard's nice. The trackpad's nice. The button reach is good. The build is very

28:39.720 --> 28:43.400
sturdy but it's light. I feel like it doesn't give at all when I'm holding it with one hand

28:43.400 --> 28:47.480
and shaking it. And I don't hear any moving parts. Everything's solid, which is really

28:47.480 --> 28:54.960
cool. And it's got two USB 3 ports on it. It has a DisplayPort, SD in, and audio out.

28:54.960 --> 28:58.560
It also has a little battery gauge button on the side that you can press. Speakers are

28:58.560 --> 29:02.000
also on the side. I haven't had a good chance to test them yet. And the battery life, when

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
I took it out of the box, said 14 hours remaining. I didn't leave it unplugged because Andrew

29:08.000 --> 29:12.480
gross bitches at you during the installation. So, and the keys light up and the keyboard

29:12.480 --> 29:17.720
does feel quite nice. The top has this sort of pattern etched into it that it feels good.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.680
It's not overdone. It's not irritating, but it feels good on the hand. It kind of feels

29:21.680 --> 29:27.240
like a carbon kind of stamping. The hinge is very strong. You know, I'm shaking it right

29:27.240 --> 29:32.240
now and it doesn't give at all. So I think from like a portable tiny Linux rig, I think

29:32.240 --> 29:35.480
this could be a killer unit. Right now I'm fighting with the wireless. So, and I think

29:35.480 --> 29:40.320
if you were to buy the, the developer edition is what they're probably going to call it.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.280
When it ships, you'd probably wouldn't have to worry about things like wireless. I'll

29:43.280 --> 29:44.280
probably just put it like an Intel chip.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.400
They'll probably give you Intel or something. Yeah.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.520
So I'll give, I'll give this further, you know, I'll use this more. The things that

29:49.520 --> 29:53.480
really jumped out at me so far is the speed's great. I got an i7 in there with eight gigs

29:53.480 --> 29:59.360
of RAM and the display is very vibrant. It really pops. I don't know how things are going

29:59.360 --> 30:05.720
to work high DPI wise. Gnome itself looks real good. I, you know, I, you know what I'll

30:05.720 --> 30:10.200
do here real quick cause I'll fire up Chrome. Cause I'm thinking where I'm going to, and

30:10.200 --> 30:13.160
the terminal looks really good. So that's, that's kind of the only apps I've used so

30:13.160 --> 30:17.520
far is just Gnome and the terminal. But I'm, I'm firing up Chrome right now and we'll see

30:17.520 --> 30:22.520
how that works. Let's see. Oh yeah. Chrome's a little small.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
Oh, is it?

30:23.520 --> 30:27.040
Yeah, it's a little small. I think there's some tweaks in the config you can do, but

30:27.040 --> 30:31.760
yeah, it's definitely a little on the small side. Yeah. So I'll have to do some of that.

30:31.760 --> 30:36.080
So I'll experiment with all of that. So I'll have a full report on Linux and high DPI support

30:36.080 --> 30:41.320
and what tweaks I had to do a wireless tweaks I had to do and stuff like that. Hopefully

30:41.320 --> 30:44.760
I'll get it all a straightened out. And then if you guys make the purchase, by the time

30:44.760 --> 30:49.240
you buy it, I'll have a full report on if it's worth your money or not. And that's the,

30:49.240 --> 30:53.280
that's really the reason why I wanted to get it now. Well, and that price of Bitcoin was

30:53.280 --> 30:57.960
totally crashing. So there you go. I'll give you my full impressions very soon. I got the

30:57.960 --> 31:02.840
one with the 3,200 by 1,800 resolution. I did that on purpose because in a lot of our

31:02.840 --> 31:07.280
distro distro reviews, one of the areas I felt like we didn't really touch on a lot

31:07.280 --> 31:11.320
because we couldn't is how it handles a high resolution display. High resolution displays

31:11.320 --> 31:15.840
are here. High DPI is a real thing in 2015 and a lot of laptops across the line are going

31:15.840 --> 31:18.580
to start shipping with it. So it's time for the Linux to really step up and have good

31:18.580 --> 31:21.840
support for that. So I think it's time to incorporate that. It's not going to be a deal

31:21.840 --> 31:26.080
breaker for the reviews, but I think it's kind of important to incorporate that in the

31:26.080 --> 31:29.460
review. So, you know, if this is a distribution or a desktop environment or whatever it is

31:29.460 --> 31:33.520
we're talking about, that'll look good on a high DPI display. So that's another reason

31:33.520 --> 31:37.800
I got this too. So I can speak to the audience from that standpoint too. There you go.

31:37.800 --> 31:42.140
It makes sense to come up with some common set of criteria that people could test their

31:42.140 --> 31:45.120
laptop against, like a list of all the things you should check.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.880
Because I know that's something that we've tried to come up with for a different open

31:49.880 --> 31:54.800
source operating system whose name I won't say just because. Anyway, the problem becomes

31:54.800 --> 31:59.220
everybody goes and tries to test things, but they always forget to test the thing that

31:59.220 --> 32:03.520
matters to you, right? The thing that like, you know, high DPI, they might not consider

32:03.520 --> 32:09.520
that. You know, they didn't consider does this feature work and how granular is the

32:09.520 --> 32:13.680
backlight control or whatever. And it just seems like it would make sense to come up

32:13.680 --> 32:18.600
with a big set of common criteria that anyone when they bought a laptop could just run all

32:18.600 --> 32:23.940
their laptops through all these tests and post the results so that, you know, you kind

32:23.940 --> 32:28.200
of crowdsource the information gathering since, you know, you can't buy every model of laptop

32:28.200 --> 32:29.200
to do this with.

32:29.200 --> 32:33.360
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crowdsourcing reviews would be interesting. I'm looking at the

32:33.360 --> 32:39.360
myfixguide.com breakdown and it looks like not only is the bottom pretty removable, but

32:39.360 --> 32:44.920
the wireless LAN card is right there front and center and labeled very, very generously

32:44.920 --> 32:45.920
by Intel.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.960
Yeah, they're usually like mini PCIe, right?

32:47.960 --> 32:51.840
Yeah, and it doesn't look like it's too buried. Looks like it's just you take off those eight

32:51.840 --> 32:54.560
torque screws and then there you go.

32:54.560 --> 32:58.400
So if you do get one that doesn't have wireless that works, like I think that's the problem

32:58.400 --> 32:59.400
you're having with yours, right?

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
Yeah.

33:00.400 --> 33:05.280
The Intel Centrino 6205 is like $19 at Newegg.

33:05.280 --> 33:08.600
Yeah, I might just get that anyways just that way when I reinstall I don't have to fight

33:08.600 --> 33:09.720
it even if I can get it working.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.720
Yeah.

33:10.720 --> 33:14.520
And here's the SSD storage right there too. So the storage and the wireless look like

33:14.520 --> 33:20.160
they're really easy to interchange. So I like that a lot. So cool. So I'll give you an update

33:20.160 --> 33:23.480
because I literally just took it out of the box before the show started. I put it into

33:23.480 --> 33:27.920
Windows once. Yeah, there's a better shot of the wireless card right there. Yeah, that's

33:27.920 --> 33:31.040
going to be a really easy swap out.

33:31.040 --> 33:35.800
I think that OS that Alan was referring to just a little bit ago rhymes with CDFB.

33:35.800 --> 33:42.880
That doesn't ring a bell, Eric. I think he's talking about Haiku.

33:42.880 --> 33:43.880
Yeah.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.880
No, BUS.

33:44.880 --> 33:50.560
Yeah. Oh, jeez, gosh, guys. The question, Marky asked, what's the Markdown editor I

33:50.560 --> 33:54.960
use? It's called Herupad. Herupad's really great. And there's other ones too.

33:54.960 --> 33:55.960
Spell that for us.

33:55.960 --> 34:00.280
What's that? Herupad? Yeah, sure. It's H-A, let me pull it up right here. Of course, it

34:00.280 --> 34:01.280
doesn't just say.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.280
Even Chris doesn't know how to spell it.

34:02.280 --> 34:11.400
No, I just want to make sure I get it right. H-A-R-O-O-P-A-D. And this is it right here

34:11.400 --> 34:14.760
on my screen. This is today's episode of Tech Talk Today on my screen. And you see in one

34:14.760 --> 34:20.160
column is my Markdown code, and the other column is the output. But what, okay, you're

34:20.160 --> 34:23.840
like, okay, that's not too neat, Chris. A lot of Markdown editors do that. What's really

34:23.840 --> 34:28.040
cool about this Markdown editor is you can go into the settings and you can pull down

34:28.040 --> 34:31.960
your CSS files from your website and have the stuff in the preview rendered with your

34:31.960 --> 34:35.480
website's real CSS, and you can really see really what it's going to look like on your

34:35.480 --> 34:40.560
website. That is really cool because, for example, the Jupyter Broadcasting website,

34:40.560 --> 34:44.160
it renders quotes slightly different than other websites render quotes, just the way

34:44.160 --> 34:50.080
the block quote looks. So it's nice to have that. So yeah, it's Herupad, and it's a bit

34:50.080 --> 34:57.480
of a monster. It's written on top of Node.js, but it has all of like under the insert menu,

34:57.480 --> 35:01.480
it has all of the Markdown, like all your basic Markdown stuff all ready to go, and

35:01.480 --> 35:05.760
these are also hot keyed. You can pull up in the help menu, it has all the key commands.

35:05.760 --> 35:10.040
And so, you know, like, for example, Control Shift I inserts an image. Control Shift Q

35:10.040 --> 35:17.520
makes everything a quote. Control 4 is a heading 4. Control 2 is a heading 2. So it's really

35:17.520 --> 35:22.760
nice and makes it really fast to rip through Markdown. So it's Herupad, and we've talked

35:22.760 --> 35:26.360
about it before. I've made it a pic a long time ago on last, so it's probably also linked

35:26.360 --> 35:32.160
in the last pics. So there you go. If you can stomach Node.js, you won't even know.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.640
It's all like a self-contained Chromium app.

35:33.640 --> 35:37.760
You know, I think you should do it just for the shortcuts alone, because shortcuts rock.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.760
Yeah.

35:38.760 --> 35:39.760
I love shortcuts. I'm all about the keyboard.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.920
Yeah, and don't forget, if you want to practice your Markdown, we have OpenYourMouth.recipes,

35:42.920 --> 35:47.720
which are open source GPLed community recipes written in Markdown. It's a great place to

35:47.720 --> 35:51.160
scratch that Markdown itch. And Herupad, you could write in there and then post it up on

35:51.160 --> 35:57.040
our GitHub page, OpenYourMouth.recipes, open source recipes from the community. Hey, Matt,

35:57.040 --> 36:01.160
you know, if you're going to say maybe you want to have your own GitLab or host your

36:01.160 --> 36:05.200
own Ghost installation, or maybe you want to just mess around with free BSD, well, then

36:05.200 --> 36:09.400
our next sponsor might have something that could interest you. That's DigitalOcean. Yes,

36:09.400 --> 36:12.600
DigitalOcean's a great place to go to get your own cloud server. They're a simple cloud

36:12.600 --> 36:15.600
hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin

36:15.600 --> 36:20.360
up your own cloud server. You'll get root access to it, powered by Linux and KVM. You

36:20.360 --> 36:26.640
can get started in less than 55 seconds. Jay e-mailed me today. 23 seconds was his spin

36:26.640 --> 36:31.120
up time. He got it all set up in 23 seconds. That is nuts. And pricing plans start only

36:31.120 --> 36:36.960
$5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a freaking terabyte

36:36.960 --> 36:41.120
of transfer. Oh my gosh, I cannot even, this just blows my mind. I've been around for a

36:41.120 --> 36:45.760
long time. This is just, I cannot, I remember a time in a data center when I had a colo

36:45.760 --> 36:51.240
rig and I spent over $1,500 for a terabyte of transfer in a single month. DigitalOcean

36:51.240 --> 36:55.260
has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London,

36:55.260 --> 36:59.720
and their interface is amazing. It's so simple and intuitive and extremely powerful at the

36:59.720 --> 37:04.480
same time. They didn't water it down. You can do your DNS management. You can take your

37:04.480 --> 37:08.800
backup snapshots. You can resize your images. You can add RAM. You can move them. You can

37:08.800 --> 37:14.760
transfer them. You can do console HTML5 level access, even watch the boot up screen from

37:14.760 --> 37:19.320
post all the way up to your main Linux rig. It's so, or freeBSD, it's so cool. And they've

37:19.320 --> 37:24.680
got core OS as well. And they've got this API that the community has just written a

37:24.680 --> 37:28.880
ton of great stuff for. You could write your own stuff for it and, you know, extend the

37:28.880 --> 37:32.080
functionality of the dashboard, however you like, snap it into whatever you need to snap

37:32.080 --> 37:35.760
it into for management. But me, I just take advantage of all the great apps that have

37:35.760 --> 37:43.840
been written. DigitalOcean.com. Go over there. Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED. DOUNPLUGGED.

over? This week's episode of Quota Radio, Mike was giving some tips on ways to save

38:25.440 --> 38:30.040
money for development and primarily a great way to push updates out to your websites and

38:30.040 --> 38:33.960
stuff totally for free once you set up the DigitalOcean Droplet. It was a great tip and

38:33.960 --> 38:37.320
it's another great example of things you can use DigitalOcean for. We've got it running

38:37.320 --> 38:40.600
a whole bunch of Ruby. We've got it running our BitTorrent for the backend syncing of

38:40.600 --> 38:44.440
all the unfilter stuff, which is nuts. I mean, we have hundreds of syncs going on there.

38:44.440 --> 38:49.220
It's all running off DigitalOcean Droplets. It's really awesome. It's unbelievably, it's

38:49.220 --> 38:54.080
just an incredible great value and the management is so straightforward. DigitalOcean.com, use

39:04.160 --> 39:08.240
Now, I want to talk a little bit about this Vivaldi browser because everybody's writing

39:08.240 --> 39:11.920
about it. Everybody's talking about it. Chatter's been going about it. It's not a tablet. It's

39:11.920 --> 39:17.120
a Chromium-powered, multi-platform browser. It's making some waves, if that's still a

39:17.120 --> 39:23.760
thing. It's supported by Linux, Windows, and OS X. It's currently offered as a tech preview,

39:23.760 --> 39:27.280
so it's got Chromium under the hood, but another, a bunch of features that sort of remind you

39:27.280 --> 39:32.480
maybe of Opera during its glory days. Among them is speed dial and mouse gestures. Also

39:32.480 --> 39:36.320
new features like allowing multiple tabs to be combined into a single stack. Support for

39:36.320 --> 39:40.740
note-taking within the browser. You know, you need to take notes on a website. And other

39:40.740 --> 39:45.980
improvements to the Chromium base. Started by a former CEO of Opera who has not been

39:45.980 --> 39:52.720
with Opera for years. They plan in the future to include things like mail built-in, sync,

39:52.720 --> 39:56.320
spatial navigation, greater performance. They want to be the fastest browser in the universe,

39:56.320 --> 40:01.480
they say. Extensions and other community features. And it's available right now for Linux. I

40:01.480 --> 40:03.280
have it installed right here if you're watching the show.

40:03.280 --> 40:08.120
Matt, are you ready for another browser? Oh yes, absolutely. You know what we need?

40:08.120 --> 40:12.260
We need another browser. And preferably one that's based on an existing browser because

40:12.260 --> 40:16.760
then we can really hit, geez. You know, I'm going to not be cynical about it. It could

40:16.760 --> 40:19.880
be awesome. It really could. I'm going to just hold my hopes up.

40:19.880 --> 40:25.280
Well, okay, I'll play devil's advocate. I mean, I kind of agree with you, but if we

40:25.280 --> 40:29.320
accept that maybe Blink and WebKit are as good as we're going to get for a little while,

40:29.320 --> 40:32.760
then maybe it is good that the innovation's done more at the UI because I think you and

40:32.760 --> 40:37.480
I both have lamented, the browsers really suck still. Like, there's not a browser, either

40:37.480 --> 40:41.960
one of us are like totally jazzed up like, man, I just love Chrome. I love Firefox. You

40:41.960 --> 40:45.540
know, like I use Firefox, I use Chrome.

40:45.540 --> 40:49.080
So for me, it's like from a UI perspective, and this is excluding bookmarks because that's

40:49.080 --> 40:55.400
a separate issue. From a UI perspective, Firefox makes people want to eat bags of glass and

40:55.400 --> 40:59.360
Chromium and Chrome are frankly just more pleasant to use. Now, that being said, Firefox

40:59.360 --> 41:03.720
performance destroys Chrome and Chromium because it sucks on Linux, and then you have bookmarks,

41:03.720 --> 41:08.160
which is a completely separate issue because the problem with bookmarks is, hi, 1995, can

41:08.160 --> 41:13.000
I have my bookmarks, please? I mean, this is stupid. The bookmarking system is what

41:13.000 --> 41:18.120
really needs to evolve, more so than in my opinion. Bookmarks suck. I add stuff. I've

41:18.120 --> 41:23.000
got bookmarks from like 2002 in there. I don't even know what they are. What is this?

41:23.000 --> 41:28.320
I do like the UI. I think it's very nice, but they're not bringing a lot of new stuff

41:28.320 --> 41:33.120
to the team, you know, and they don't have all of my plugins that I want to use. It seems

41:33.120 --> 41:38.000
pretty fast. The UI is okay. It actually does have a few specific features that I've never

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
seen in anything else. Alright, lay it on me, sir. One, UI changes. Yeah, chameleonic.

41:42.000 --> 41:50.900
If you ever used, what is it? That little fucking text editor, it actually has a little

41:50.900 --> 41:55.320
command UI you can press F2 and you can do commands. Yeah, it does support like hotkey

41:55.320 --> 42:01.400
navigation and stuff. Yes, that. I've never seen that in anywhere else. Also, since Opera

42:01.400 --> 42:08.320
has done a lot of those weird little browser enhancements, it's got little tab UI. You

42:08.320 --> 42:12.820
can drag the top down and see previews of your tabs or hover over them, which is what

42:12.820 --> 42:16.560
the old Opera used to do. Oh, that is nice. But it's actually quite interesting. I like

42:16.560 --> 42:19.880
the way it displays your current tab too. It's really easy to see which is the current

42:19.880 --> 42:24.500
active tab. Okay, so the first implementation, it's not so bad. This is actually the way

42:24.500 --> 42:29.760
they color the tabs is actually kind of smart. It's chameleonic depending on the... The whole

42:29.760 --> 42:34.960
top bar changes. Yep, take a look at the whole top bar. Everything changes. I gave it a snapshot

42:34.960 --> 42:41.240
of Jupiter Blood. Those tab stacks are brilliant. Yeah, that is pretty cool. Oh yes, there is

42:41.240 --> 42:47.080
some interesting bits about it. Yeah, so tab stacks in their words, yeah. I think tab stacks

42:47.080 --> 42:51.520
I like better because you can see it right by hovering over it. For me, tab stacks is

42:51.520 --> 42:54.720
easier than tab groups because tab groups are put off somewhere else. They're hidden

42:54.720 --> 43:00.200
in a way. Whereas tab stacks are just right here. And the way they demonstrate the lines

43:00.200 --> 43:05.600
so you can see how many tabs are in this stack is really clever too. You can actually drag

43:05.600 --> 43:11.740
down right above the URL bar. You can actually have a little thing like the little drag down

43:11.740 --> 43:16.480
and you can drag down the top and have visual pieces of tabs right up at the top. And their

43:16.480 --> 43:21.680
settings looks very deep in our progression. Oh, I see. The settings manager is very interesting.

43:21.680 --> 43:24.400
Oh, look at that. You can just get a little peek too. You can just have a little peek

43:24.400 --> 43:29.600
of the... That's really cool. Yes, it's the old Opera. It's coming back. The guys, the

43:29.600 --> 43:33.440
real balls are actually putting their ideas forth again. That's cool. I don't know how

43:33.440 --> 43:38.240
much you guys have used it but I've been using it all today and it is super fast. This is

43:38.240 --> 43:43.680
the first time I've tried it. I mean, after Chrome and Firefox, this is refreshingly quick.

43:43.680 --> 43:48.280
It feels like 2015 on the internet, the speed at which... Oh, and you can put the tabs on

43:48.280 --> 43:52.800
the left side which is really nice for widescreen. Actually, you can remove the tabs. Completely

43:52.800 --> 43:57.840
say none. No tabs at all. There's no other one I've seen which can remove the tabs. Chris,

43:57.840 --> 44:01.640
this is one of the reasons that people that used to use Opera are so passionate about

44:01.640 --> 44:05.800
it is because they do things in a completely fundamentally different way. And when you

44:05.800 --> 44:12.540
get used to it, going to a standard Firefox or a standard Chrome browser is just... It

44:12.540 --> 44:19.360
feels clunky. I'm digging all the key commands. So Wimpy says it's super fast. I find that's

44:19.360 --> 44:24.840
the case on a brand new clean install of Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, or basically insert name

44:24.840 --> 44:30.040
of browser here. As soon as you start using it and fill in some... Throw in some extensions,

44:30.040 --> 44:34.640
yeah. Yeah, throw some extensions in there and then all your bookmarks and then you start

44:34.640 --> 44:43.680
visiting a load of pages. They all slow down to a bag of crap. All of them. If you take

44:43.680 --> 44:51.760
a fresh Chrome or a fresh Firefox and you don't fill it with the shit ton of plugins

44:51.760 --> 44:58.160
that you use, Poppy. You know I don't use shit ton. I have like three plugins on all

44:58.160 --> 45:06.560
my browsers and they all run like you're swimming in treacle. If you go for a plugin less Chrome

45:06.560 --> 45:12.080
or Firefox and compare the speed that this renders pages and visit pages that you've

45:12.080 --> 45:17.440
not been to in any of the browsers, this is very, very quick at rendering pages. Are we

45:17.440 --> 45:26.680
doing another browser challenge? I've not been that excited about a new browser since

45:26.680 --> 45:33.720
I first started using Chrome in 2008. This is really good. Should I tell you the one

45:33.720 --> 45:40.520
drawback? Yeah, sure. Sounds amazing. The user interface is basically Amiga OS 3.5.

45:40.520 --> 45:47.480
It's so flat. It's $19.99. But other than that, it's brilliant. I like the loading bar

45:47.480 --> 45:52.080
too. Sublime text. The little command thing. You can press F2 and it'll give you a sublime

45:52.080 --> 46:01.280
text command. Oh my gosh. That is so cool. That is the neatest. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

46:01.280 --> 46:09.120
Oh my gosh. That is so cool. Can you hear that guys? Look at there's all my tabs and

46:09.120 --> 46:15.120
then here's all of the commands I could do. Oh my gosh. This is so cool. One of the reasons

46:15.120 --> 46:19.760
why Firefox can slow down over time is because you're building up that SQLite database for

46:19.760 --> 46:24.520
the awesome bar and a bunch of other stuff. So if you feel your browser is slow, try a

46:24.520 --> 46:29.600
fresh profile. It's not necessarily just plugins that make it slow. That's excellent. If you

46:29.600 --> 46:36.760
can add this alongside a fresh profile. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I said just

46:36.760 --> 46:42.480
now which is any browser which is super clean is good and then after you use it for a while

46:42.480 --> 46:45.860
it turns to shit. Yeah, but you were saying it was the plugins that were default and usually

46:45.860 --> 46:51.160
it's not. No, I didn't. The only thing that I miss is the ad blocker. Have you seen how

46:51.160 --> 46:56.600
the... Is the databases and stuff and maybe we should find something better. Yeah, I noticed

46:56.600 --> 47:04.140
this. It's a nice little touch. The navigational buttons, so back home, reload and all of that,

47:04.140 --> 47:10.320
as you visit a website it automatically themes those controls to the color profile of the

47:10.320 --> 47:16.440
website that you're viewing. For a debut, for a technical preview, this is really polished

47:16.440 --> 47:21.900
and very slick. Yeah. And I've already mentioned on this forum to open source this thing as

47:21.900 --> 47:25.800
much as they can because I want them to because this is pretty darn interesting. Yeah, that

47:25.800 --> 47:29.160
is the thing we have to talk about. That's the elf in the room is that it's not open

47:29.160 --> 47:34.080
now. Blink or whatever, Chromium or whatever you're going to say it's based on is but the

47:34.080 --> 47:40.680
Chrome around it is not. Well, Opera is the same situation. I'm trying to put their balls

47:40.680 --> 47:44.960
in a vise to get them to open their code. I guess the question is how do they make a

47:44.960 --> 47:50.680
business out of it then? Donations? Like most open source projects depend unless they're

47:50.680 --> 47:58.360
going to sell their code to the Wii again like they used to with the old Opera. So Wimpy,

47:58.360 --> 48:01.960
you think it's a bigger deal than we're giving it credit because the browser is the new OS?

48:01.960 --> 48:07.080
You think this is a huge thing? Yeah, this is precisely my point. I think that from this

48:07.080 --> 48:13.240
point onward the browser is the operating system and Chromebooks have proven that point

48:13.240 --> 48:19.320
over the last year more than anything else. And I think having a choice in our browser

48:19.320 --> 48:27.000
options is as important as having choice over our operating systems. I would agree. The

48:27.000 --> 48:30.920
only reason internet browsers got better is because we've had competition otherwise we'd

48:30.920 --> 48:38.200
all still be stuck. Helpy competition is a good thing. May the best browser win. May

48:38.200 --> 48:43.240
the best browser help everyone else. And I think this is one to watch and I like that

48:43.240 --> 48:47.640
they launched with cross-platform support out of the bag. I think that's a really good

48:47.640 --> 48:51.200
sign. I don't think it's going to make me switch. Well, maybe. It depends on where the

48:51.200 --> 48:56.920
plug-in direction goes. I see the thing is that that launcher that it has, I could probably

48:56.920 --> 49:02.400
go get that for any browser with an extension, but I do like that a lot. That is really cool.

49:02.400 --> 49:05.000
So it's the Vivaldi browser. We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to

49:05.000 --> 49:08.280
check it out. That sounds like a lot of you have been trying it though. So I'm going to

49:08.280 --> 49:12.240
keep it around for a little bit. I need things like tab sync and all kinds of fancy stuff

49:12.240 --> 49:18.360
though. I really am pretty demanding. All I want is a better bookmark handling. That's

49:18.360 --> 49:22.580
all I want. And I've tried the plug-ins and I've tried all these hacks and variations

49:22.580 --> 49:27.200
and well, everybody's got the new, what? No, it's crap. It's crap. It's still the same

49:27.200 --> 49:33.400
old. What is the problem with bookmarks though? I have 5,000 plus of them and I'd like to

49:33.400 --> 49:40.800
make heads and tails out of them. I have Firefox bookmarks because I actually can't not use

49:40.800 --> 49:45.320
Firefox because of the bookmark structure is so awesome. With the keywords searching

49:45.320 --> 49:52.000
where I can just jump back and forth with just using commands. I need something to automate

49:52.000 --> 49:58.600
bookmarks. I think there's probably a self-help group for Matt. For people like Matt who have

49:58.600 --> 50:05.360
thousands of bookmarks. I personally have zero. I just don't use bookmarks. I just

50:05.360 --> 50:10.960
use Google really, really well. I have about a thousand. I use Pinboard as a third-party

50:10.960 --> 50:15.120
service I can access from any computer in any browser by logging in. That might be an

50:15.120 --> 50:21.040
option. Yahoo failed as an entity because they tried to catalogue the internet by themselves.

50:21.040 --> 50:27.600
What would you try? They tried it with humans was the problem. All right, I will give...

50:27.600 --> 50:32.040
X marks has some kind of like auditing the stuff. Yeah. I'll give, because Alex has been

50:32.040 --> 50:36.160
wanting to say it a hundred times. Alex, you wanted to say something from the perspective

50:36.160 --> 50:45.920
of a Firefox user. I've been using Firefox with a lot of tabs and a lot of bookmarks.

50:45.920 --> 50:51.680
For me, bookmarks are like my own personal search engine. What I would like one day would

50:51.680 --> 50:58.560
be to have Yacy integrated into Firefox. Sure. A real search engine in my browser. Yeah,

50:58.560 --> 51:05.960
that'd be cool. About tabs, the old Operado version 12 and the current Firefox are the

51:05.960 --> 51:15.120
only tab browsers that support over 200 tabs. I usually have around 100 open tabs at some

51:15.120 --> 51:29.000
point and the maximum I reached is around 600 at some point. That is respectable. I've

51:29.000 --> 51:32.240
heard a few other people, like I had a client that always had a whole bunch of browser windows

51:32.240 --> 51:36.240
open a whole bunch. I always get worried. I always get worried that my browser is going

51:36.240 --> 51:40.960
to die on me and that I'll lose all that. I don't have faith in the auto restore system.

51:40.960 --> 51:44.980
That's what I actually use bookmarks for is I use just mainly my menu bar and I just stashed

51:44.980 --> 51:51.440
stuff in there. Matt, we have a surprise for you that I want to get to, but before we do

51:51.440 --> 51:54.920
that, I've got something really exciting to talk about. That's Linux Academy, the sponsor

51:54.920 --> 51:59.680
of the Linux Unplugged show. Linux Academy is always rolling out tons of new features.

51:59.680 --> 52:03.120
That's why I want to encourage you to go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and take

52:03.120 --> 52:07.160
advantage of our discount. They just rolled out a new Ruby course, which is perfect for

52:07.160 --> 52:10.640
me because Matt, I'm going to go, I don't know if I'm crazy, but I'm going to go teach

52:10.640 --> 52:17.120
myself Ruby. I hadn't decided. I was on the fence and then Linux Academy was like, yeah,

52:17.120 --> 52:20.760
we got a new course on Ruby. I'm like, all right, well now I feel like I've been given

52:20.760 --> 52:24.760
the pathway to follow. I can't really mess it up if I go with Linux Academy. I want you

52:24.760 --> 52:28.560
to go check them out too. Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. Get your special unplugged

52:28.560 --> 52:32.040
discount. They've got step-by-step video courses for everything you're doing, comprehensive

52:32.040 --> 52:35.520
study guides you can download, getting to break you out time estimates of how long each

52:35.520 --> 52:38.960
stuff's going to take. It comes with your own server as the lab course requires it,

52:38.960 --> 52:42.000
pins it right up, whatever Linux distribution you've chosen. That's what the server OS is

52:42.000 --> 52:46.280
and of course all the courseware just kind of adapts to match that. And I think that's

52:46.280 --> 52:49.300
a pretty nice feature if you're maybe moving from one distro to another, like if you switch

52:49.300 --> 52:53.440
jobs from a Red Hat place to an Ubuntu place or Debian to CentOS, something like that.

52:53.440 --> 52:56.360
You get to keep track of your progress as you're going right as you log in the dashboard

52:56.360 --> 52:59.000
to give you a percentage heads up of where you're at with your different stuff, how long

52:59.000 --> 53:02.280
the next section is going to take you. They have learning plans. You go in there and you

53:02.280 --> 53:05.840
say, hey, I've got this much time on Monday, this much time on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

53:05.840 --> 53:10.400
Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I can allocate this much time, generate me a plan, and Linux Academy

53:10.400 --> 53:14.240
system will create a custom plan that matches that schedule that you've laid out with reminder

53:14.240 --> 53:17.760
systems to keep you going. Plus, as a Jupyter Broadcasting community member, you'll meet

53:17.760 --> 53:21.440
lots of like-minded folks who are there from Jupyter Broadcasting in the community that

53:21.440 --> 53:25.300
can give you a bump when you're kind of slowing down a little bit. Also, go make sure you

53:25.300 --> 53:28.620
check out their new Docker courseware. There's not another technology that's hotter right

53:28.620 --> 53:33.680
now in the Linux space and they've got great stuff, great courseware on Docker. Also, vagrant

53:33.680 --> 53:37.480
virtualization options up the wuzang from KVM to Zen. They got it all. You guys should

53:37.480 --> 53:42.480
go check it out at Linux Academy. Ruby, Android development, OpenStack, the whole DevOps category

53:42.480 --> 53:47.440
they've got courseware for over at Linux Academy. It's a really valuable service. LinuxAcademy.com

53:47.440 --> 53:53.040
slash unplugged. Go check them out and support your favorite talk show, Linux Unplugged.

53:53.040 --> 53:57.440
That's a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show. LinuxAcademy.com

53:57.440 --> 54:01.800
slash unplugged. Thanks, you guys, and thanks to all the audience members who support Linux

54:01.800 --> 54:10.000
Unplugged. Okay, Matt. I think there's probably a portion of folks who watch this show or

54:10.000 --> 54:15.160
listen to this show that don't watch or listen to last. For those who are not current, this

54:15.160 --> 54:20.260
Sunday, the episode that just aired, was Matt's last official day as co-host, although I'm

54:20.260 --> 54:25.340
sure he'll be back to the show from time to time to visit. He's launching with producer

54:25.340 --> 54:31.680
Q5SIS who's here today as well. The rebirth, the raising from the ashes of our How-To Linux

54:31.680 --> 54:38.320
show. Better focused, stronger than before. Matt, we thought we'd do a little parting

54:38.320 --> 54:43.620
tradition as a send-off for the years of great service on the Linux action show right here

54:43.620 --> 54:49.120
on Unplugged for our last segment of the show. I'm going to kick it off. You may have heard

54:49.120 --> 54:54.400
there's this great new graphics card that's out there on the market. In fact, Ferronix

54:54.400 --> 54:58.720
just gave it a great review for Linux gamers. It's called the GeForce GTX 960. It uses the

54:58.720 --> 55:04.640
latest Maxwell GPU from Nvidia. I, as a thank you to Matt, now it's here at the studio,

55:04.640 --> 55:09.720
Matt, but I ordered you a brand new video card, a GTX 960, so you can try out the 960

55:09.720 --> 55:13.040
in the Linux rig and give us a report back on how it works here on the Unplugged show

55:13.040 --> 55:18.800
because now on Sundays you're going to need to get some gaming picked up. Some folks in

55:18.800 --> 55:22.320
the Mumble Room to kind of sweeten the deal a little bit are going to send some Steam

55:22.320 --> 55:25.400
games that they have available in the library. I want to encourage anybody in the audience

55:25.400 --> 55:31.440
too that wants to help Matt put his new Nvidia 960 card to use. I have Matt's Steam profile

55:31.440 --> 55:36.560
linked in the show notes. It's ironspankingmatt, which is, I don't know, where does ironspanking

55:36.560 --> 55:40.160
come from, Matt? Is that like a metal reference? Oh, that was an unreal, actually a little

55:40.160 --> 55:44.760
bit. No, it was actually an Unreal Tournament thing. Back when I was really playing that,

55:44.760 --> 55:48.840
someone felt like they, there's like a backstory to it, basically long and short of it. It's

55:48.840 --> 55:52.200
an Unreal Tournament ironspanking kind of deal. So I thought a good way to do it would

55:52.200 --> 55:56.620
be to get you to waste a bunch of time. So the audience and I came together and Blaster

55:56.620 --> 56:00.840
chipped into on the video card here. So that'll be here in the studio next time when you come

56:00.840 --> 56:06.360
down to shoot your first batch of how to Linux, you can leave with the new GTX 960. Oh, that

56:06.360 --> 56:10.400
is awesome. Thanks. I appreciate that. That's fantastic. That's really cool. Then just give

56:10.400 --> 56:14.440
us a report here on Unplugged in the future of how it went. Yeah, for sure. Thanks, Matt.

56:14.440 --> 56:17.000
And watch out for Steam games coming your way. I think a few folks in the audience are

56:17.000 --> 56:20.560
going to send you some. Yeah, I'm still sorting through email and I've actually got a couple

56:20.560 --> 56:27.640
thanks to send it out. Cool. And then you'll keep us posted on when how to Linux launches,

56:27.640 --> 56:31.480
which we'll have probably in February sometime. Q5, is there anything you want to jump in

56:31.480 --> 56:36.640
at this point before we move off from that topic? You good? Going once? Just that if

56:36.640 --> 56:45.200
anybody has ideas for good topics, send them in. That's about it. There you go. Okay. And

56:45.200 --> 56:49.200
we'll have ways to do that too. And I think we still have the, we still have the how to

56:49.200 --> 56:52.520
Linux email account you can email as well. Or you can ping us in the subreddit. We're

56:52.520 --> 57:00.000
checking that or email Matt or Q5. Yeah. Either way. There's a lot of ways to get in your

57:00.000 --> 57:02.600
suggestions and we'll come up with some official ways to submit them into the show. I know

57:02.600 --> 57:06.680
we've had some, we've had some like spreadsheets in the past, but we'll figure it out. So Matt,

57:06.680 --> 57:11.400
enjoy the new gaming setup. Oh, definitely. You now got like a way nicer video card than

57:11.400 --> 57:15.480
I've got, I think. I was going to say that's really stylin'. That's hard, Matt. I was like

57:15.480 --> 57:23.840
no, no, it's a nice parting gift. It's a have fun with this. That's awesome. And then on

57:23.840 --> 57:28.640
Sunday show, I actually don't have the full show planned out yet, but Noah is landing

57:28.640 --> 57:34.860
in the Pacific Northwest probably Thursday, depending on his work schedule. And he'll

57:34.860 --> 57:39.000
be in studio for Sunday's Linux action show. And I'm probably going to take him out to

57:39.000 --> 57:41.720
dinner and stuff like that. So I don't know what all our plans are, but I think it's going

57:41.720 --> 57:45.920
to be a really fun show on Sunday. We'll have some, some shenanigans that we'll probably

57:45.920 --> 57:49.840
have planned by, by Sunday. So we'll have Noah in studio to kick off his new reign as

57:49.840 --> 57:54.880
co-host on the show. And we'll update you guys on the how to Linux progress as we've

57:54.880 --> 57:58.080
got it. I think it's getting, it's coming along quite well. So we'll probably have an

57:58.080 --> 58:03.140
update very soon. Okay. Cool. All right. Well, and thanks to everybody who sent the stuff

58:03.140 --> 58:08.000
to, to Matt. We were talking about it on tech talk after today. We were scheming while still

58:08.000 --> 58:10.480
on the air and I wasn't sure if you were listening or not. I didn't think you were. I thought

58:10.480 --> 58:14.280
we were safe. Cause it was, you know, I was obliviously. Yeah, no, I was actually, I think

58:14.280 --> 58:21.280
I was picking up dog do at the time. But yeah, my glamorous life as a co-host. I like that.

58:21.280 --> 58:25.280
It's good. I think that's a good way to do that and listen to Chris's other show. I think

58:25.280 --> 58:29.240
that's, you know, you can do both at the same time. You can do both at the same time. Yeah,

58:29.240 --> 58:32.640
you can, you can. Although, although it's an art form to pick up the poo. You just go

58:32.640 --> 58:37.140
over to jblive.info on your portable device and we've got a high bit rate and low bit

58:37.140 --> 58:40.680
rate audio streams. Or you can go to jblive.tv if you're on the wifi where you're out there

58:40.680 --> 58:45.480
picking up the poop, Matt. So there you go. It's a little tech talk tip. That is the tech

58:45.480 --> 58:48.960
talk show. We do that on a, we do that in the mornings. You guys should check that out.

58:48.960 --> 58:53.480
But Hey, don't forget who cares about tech talk. Join us next Tuesday for the episode

58:53.480 --> 58:57.440
78 of Linux Unplugged. Come get it in. If you've never made a live show, get it in before

58:57.440 --> 59:00.680
we had episode 80. You got a little bit of time left. We do the show on Tuesday and if

59:00.680 --> 59:27.200
I don't see you on Tuesday, hope to see you on Sunday. Bye, everybody.

59:31.680 --> 59:42.680
Matt, picking up poop like a good neighbor should. Well, you know, after a while, you

59:42.680 --> 59:46.920
step in it so many times. It's just a sanitary, it's a sanitary thing for the dogs. I don't

59:46.920 --> 59:52.160
want to walk through it. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah. No, I'm old school. Get yourself a bag,

59:52.160 --> 59:56.280
be a man, bend over, pick that stuff up. I don't understand why we're wasting our times

59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.720
on Roombas when this is a job that can be done by robots. I don't get it. There's actually

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.840
a poop 911 business here in town, you know, for people who don't want to pick up their

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:11.080
own apparently. All right. JBtitles.com. JBtitles.com. Yeah, Matt, they have those on the East Coast.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:17.680
It's called Duty Calls. Nice. I like that. The fourth browser, the fourth browser is

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.320
not bad. The fourth browser is not bad. All right, you guys go over there. JBtitles,

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.920
go boat. I had a little shout out. I noticed a thread in the subreddit that needs more

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:31.320
of. A day ago, Stofaloaf2 submitted, what does your prompt look like? And he submitted

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:36.040
his and we've got a few other folks. There's 12 comments in here, but not a lot of pictures.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.940
So I want to look at people's desktop porn. So if you would go over to that subreddit

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:46.000
post and I'll have it linked in the post show notes. Go submit your desktop. I like looking

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.080
at people's desktops. I even tried to do an episode of it once. It's in the subreddit.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.480
I'll link to it in the IRC right now and I'll have it linked in the show notes for this

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.480
episode of Unplugged. But I like looking at people's desktops so much, I tried to make

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.840
an episode out of it. It was like a super boring episode. So I don't do it anymore,

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.280
but I still like looking at them. So go over there so I can, I get ideas. And I just got

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.280
a new laptop. Just for reference, when Angela did it, it was an exciting show. I know. Because

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:18.200
she does it with awards. I don't have awards. I just gawk. But I got a new laptop set up,

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:25.120
so I want inspiration. I've actually converted my KDE set up to look like Gnome. Oh jeez.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:31.560
That's where it starts. And by the way, I have 931 unread Reddit messages. So if you

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:37.000
message me on Reddit... Good grief. Good luck with that now. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't mean

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.080
to ignore you, but at a certain point I can only respond to so many different communication

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:46.920
methods. Same with Facebook. I don't really respond on Facebook either. Okay. JBtitles.com,

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.720
Vivaldi, the 4th browser. Is that too long? What about just the 4th browser? It just seems

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.720
like it, because it's four words. Yeah, alright. I do like having Vivaldi in the title. Yeah.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:03.400
Alright, we'll go with that. Nicely done, Wimpy. Nicely done. You're welcome. I'm glad

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.680
you had a chance to get the tires too, because you guys had some great tips for me to check

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:11.800
out, because I literally just installed it before the show. Or during the pre-show. And

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:18.560
it's pretty nice. I think I'm going to live with this for a good little while, because

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.560
it's really terrific. Well, I'm going to check back in with you then. Oh, geez, Wimpy. Get

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.280
a room. Well, you know, I'm usually a miserable old curmudgeon. I've found something that's

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:34.840
really quite... It's new and it's good. What is it? The Luddites say? This is the antithesis,

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:41.560
the opposite of that. Some change is progress. Popey, don't judge. It makes them happy. And

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:46.840
I know Alan, don't ruin my mood. You've been super helpful the last two days. Don't make

01:02:46.840 --> 01:03:12.960
me all grouchy and miserable, coming in here and bitching at me.
