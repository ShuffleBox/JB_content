00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
You remember the Runs Linux segment on Linux Action Show?

00:02.560 --> 00:03.440
Oh yeah, of course.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.480
Check out this Runs Linux for this week.

00:05.480 --> 00:07.640
NASA, NASA Runs Linux.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.520
You know, there's this recent epic landing on Mars.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.360
Heck yeah.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.200
And on the live stream, I got a screen cap of it here.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.520
I noticed up on the projector,

00:15.520 --> 00:20.260
a kind of older Plasma desktop running VNC,

00:20.260 --> 00:22.600
looking into another Unix box

00:22.600 --> 00:26.200
to pull the images down live from the landing.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.040
All on Linux.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.000
You've got Linux, Linux,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.240
and then I think that might be some old Unix possibly.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.080
Chris, when you're landing on another world,

00:33.080 --> 00:35.120
you don't have time for proprietary software.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.600
That's right, you gotta make sure it works right.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.280
And VNC is the old go-to remote control,

00:39.280 --> 00:40.860
even for NASA.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.640
This is Linux Unplugged,

00:43.640 --> 00:58.840
episode 277 for November 27th, 2018.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

00:59.960 --> 01:01.400
your weekly Linux talk show

01:01.400 --> 01:03.040
that might be slightly distracted

01:03.040 --> 01:04.440
by that keyboard over there

01:04.440 --> 01:06.320
that's got a Linux box built into it.

01:06.320 --> 01:07.160
My name's Chris.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.440
My name is Wes, and I know I am very distracted.

01:09.440 --> 01:10.920
It's the Keyboardio.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.480
It's a wood keyboard with a pretty eclectic layout

01:15.480 --> 01:18.940
and Arduino boards built into both halves of it,

01:18.940 --> 01:21.080
connected via an ethernet cable.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.560
And then USB-C back to the machine.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.900
And it's all programmed.

01:25.900 --> 01:26.960
You got LED lights.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.640
You could do RGB if you wanna be a elite gamer.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.480
So Wes is gonna be putzing with that project,

01:31.480 --> 01:32.640
but that's actually not what we're here

01:32.640 --> 01:34.240
to talk about today, no, no.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.760
We're gonna do a bunch of community news.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.860
A nice batch, not too much, but a good solid batch.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.520
Wimpy whetted my appetite recently

01:40.520 --> 01:42.960
with some really cool home server setup talk.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.120
So we'll deep dive with Mr. Wimpress on that.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.000
And then after the KDE Corner,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.400
we're gonna talk about this proposal by the Fedora Project.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.920
After Fedora 30, they wanna punt an entire release,

01:56.920 --> 02:00.320
take a year and focus on themselves,

02:00.320 --> 02:02.520
and wait for 31.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.080
Now that's a massive proposal with huge ramifications

02:06.080 --> 02:08.280
and kind of a precarious timing

02:08.280 --> 02:10.040
with the other news out there.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.320
So we're gonna bring on the project lead, Matthew Miller,

02:12.320 --> 02:15.680
to explain what's going on, what the objective is,

02:15.680 --> 02:19.720
what might go wrong, and what stage this proposal is in.

02:19.720 --> 02:20.880
We're gonna get the whole scoop from him.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.280
That's like everything.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.600
He's gonna be on it a little bit

02:23.600 --> 02:25.000
to tell us what's going on there.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.360
And then we'll wrap it up with some pics,

02:28.360 --> 02:30.600
some interesting year-end news,

02:30.600 --> 02:32.240
including like when we're doing our special

02:32.240 --> 02:33.360
for predictions and stuff like that.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.200
We got all that nailed down.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.160
And then for one last time, hopefully,

02:37.160 --> 02:39.440
I'll tell you my current Dropbox hack,

02:39.440 --> 02:41.760
which those bastards at Dropbox.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.160
I sat down in a machine upstairs,

02:43.160 --> 02:44.320
I started popping up that error message.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.200
I just got so disappointed.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.640
The XT4.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.040
Oh, so frustrating.

02:49.040 --> 02:49.880
You know what?

02:49.880 --> 02:50.800
Let's focus on something positive.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.120
Let's focus on that virtual log.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.640
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.480
Good morning.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.320
Good morning.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.160
Hello.

02:56.160 --> 02:57.000
Hello.

02:57.000 --> 02:57.840
Hello.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.680
Hello, everybody.

02:58.680 --> 02:59.520
Good to have you with us.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.640
Thank you for joining us.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.040
We're gonna have a great show today.

03:02.040 --> 03:06.480
And I wanted to start with a topic that just won't go away.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.400
And Wes, you set it up so beautifully

03:08.400 --> 03:09.280
the other day in our chat.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.440
You said we're in the ascendancy of these projects.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.960
And so we are not fully realizing

03:14.960 --> 03:17.000
all of the long-term ramifications.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.120
And what you were talking about

03:19.120 --> 03:21.600
is how everything has its own package manager right now.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.520
And we're gonna get to a new story that just happened here.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.640
But we've talked about this before.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.400
Docker Hub, flat pack apps that have been packaged

03:28.400 --> 03:30.800
with old libraries or elementary apps

03:30.800 --> 03:33.440
that aren't properly supported and distributed as flat packs

03:33.440 --> 03:35.680
or snaps that had a crypto miner in them

03:35.680 --> 03:38.120
or the most recent one that I think

03:38.120 --> 03:41.640
has gotten a lot of attention is this Node.js package hack.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.120
So for some context, a widely used MPM package

03:45.120 --> 03:47.280
was discovered to have a dependency

03:47.280 --> 03:48.800
with an encrypted payload in it,

03:48.800 --> 03:51.800
which then tried to steal bitcoins.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.640
Of course.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.480
I mean, that's what you do.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.120
That's always what they try to steal.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.280
But when you start reading through the community reaction,

03:58.280 --> 04:01.800
there is tremendous outrage at the developer

04:01.800 --> 04:04.960
for essentially screwing millions of people.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.160
People are very, very angry.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.840
And they have not really a lot of ground to stand on.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.160
Cause if you look at any open source software,

04:12.160 --> 04:14.520
it generally comes with, it's provided as is,

04:14.520 --> 04:15.360
use at your own risk.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.960
I think that's what makes it so interesting

04:16.960 --> 04:18.880
is because none of these are hard and fast rules.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.480
It's all about community norms

04:20.480 --> 04:22.040
and what we expect from software.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.880
And these days, like everything you build

04:23.880 --> 04:27.520
is gonna be pulling in six, 10 more libraries

04:27.520 --> 04:29.920
that you're linking features and adding value on top.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.160
And that's great.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.680
But we do have to question,

04:32.680 --> 04:34.400
like how do we be responsible about this?

04:34.400 --> 04:37.080
And yes, it's not your responsibility necessarily

04:37.080 --> 04:38.000
to do any of these things

04:38.000 --> 04:39.760
if you're an open source project maintainer,

04:39.760 --> 04:42.320
but if you're interested in doing that well,

04:42.320 --> 04:44.000
what are some guidelines that can help you do that?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.560
How do you, and when you're ready to not do it anymore,

04:46.560 --> 04:47.840
which is totally reasonable,

04:47.840 --> 04:50.280
how do you transfer ownership to somebody reasonable way?

04:50.280 --> 04:52.640
Right, so it doesn't just die and become vulnerable.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.840
But I mean, how deep does this rabbit hole go though?

04:54.840 --> 04:58.640
Because you've got a distribution package repository

04:58.640 --> 05:00.800
and maintainers, then you've got things

05:00.800 --> 05:03.120
that have their own package managers built into them,

05:03.120 --> 05:04.600
lots of software does.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.360
Then you've got containers that have hubs

05:06.360 --> 05:08.760
that people have automatically submitted software to.

05:08.760 --> 05:11.440
Then you also just have rando drive by websites.

05:11.440 --> 05:15.080
So like this rabbit hole is never ending to me.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.560
And we're just building on top of it.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.000
Like building a package manager now

05:18.000 --> 05:20.840
is like the keen thing that's the bee's knees,

05:20.840 --> 05:22.080
that everybody's doing.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.440
And it seems like we aren't appreciating

05:25.440 --> 05:29.280
the amount of work it takes to sustain these systems.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.960
The more packages a system has,

05:30.960 --> 05:35.120
the bigger it becomes, then it becomes,

05:35.120 --> 05:36.720
it's like it's on a Richter scale.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.480
Like it becomes way more work to actually maintain it all.

05:39.480 --> 05:43.080
Maybe we need a minor free certification process.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.760
There are three layers to this, right?

05:44.760 --> 05:46.800
There's the ethical component,

05:46.800 --> 05:49.320
there is the trust component,

05:49.320 --> 05:52.160
and then there is the legal one.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.400
Ethically wrong, just throw it away.

05:55.400 --> 05:59.480
Trust, well, people trusted the repository

05:59.480 --> 06:00.720
where things were sorted out.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.800
So the responsibility really gets attributed to them

06:03.800 --> 06:06.200
in my perspective, not so much the original developer

06:06.200 --> 06:08.280
because transfer of ownership

06:08.280 --> 06:11.680
is not immediate transfer of access to a repository.

06:11.680 --> 06:12.920
When I think of that rabbit hole,

06:12.920 --> 06:17.360
it seems insurmountable to solve at the management layer.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.200
In fact, it seems like ultimately the responsibility

06:20.200 --> 06:23.720
is on the sys admin who installed that on his own server

06:23.720 --> 06:25.800
or the end user who decided to install

06:25.800 --> 06:27.120
that desktop software.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.480
I kind of like to get your perspective on this Brent.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.720
I'm not saying I audit all of the things I installed,

06:31.720 --> 06:34.440
but don't you think ultimately if you installed something

06:34.440 --> 06:37.720
that stole your Bitcoin wallet, it's your fault?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.800
Yeah, I think that is the case.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.760
And we have to be careful

06:40.760 --> 06:43.000
with the end user perspective there,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.160
is that not all of our end users are educated enough

06:46.160 --> 06:48.760
to know to look at all of that stuff

06:48.760 --> 06:50.040
or pay that much attention, right?

06:50.040 --> 06:54.280
Like Linux, we sometimes tout as really quite safe

06:54.280 --> 06:56.400
for end users, but in this case,

06:56.400 --> 06:57.240
they may not even know

06:57.240 --> 06:58.360
what they're installing in the background.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.960
So yeah, absolutely, especially as a sys admin,

07:00.960 --> 07:02.960
should feel responsible for that.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.640
But as an end user, you need to kind of have your eye out

07:06.640 --> 07:07.600
for that kind of stuff too.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.680
I'm on Arch and as everyone knows, the AUR is great

07:11.680 --> 07:14.840
and can have some pitfalls, right, in that respect.

07:14.840 --> 07:17.360
So I think, yeah, it is ultimately responsible

07:17.360 --> 07:18.600
for what you're installing.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.800
But I will say there's even a bigger catch

07:20.800 --> 07:22.840
that is often missed and with this one,

07:22.840 --> 07:26.680
which is companies that tend to use open source packages,

07:26.680 --> 07:30.000
they generally will have some sort of artifactory

07:30.000 --> 07:33.800
or internal repository that they clone.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.560
If they can't just easily pick up from the original source,

07:37.560 --> 07:39.440
they will stop contributing back

07:39.440 --> 07:41.280
the little they already contribute back

07:41.280 --> 07:43.720
because at this point, the risk is too high.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.320
So I would refrain from trying to put these things

07:48.320 --> 07:51.160
into this perspective of, hey, let's just,

07:51.160 --> 07:53.160
the user is responsible because a company

07:53.160 --> 07:55.800
really doesn't want to do that all the time

07:55.800 --> 07:58.040
because then it just worth it to pay the developer

07:58.040 --> 07:59.320
to write it in the first place

07:59.320 --> 08:00.920
and we're the ones to lose.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.120
So I really think that we want to take ownership

08:04.120 --> 08:07.800
and responsibility for it while it's still convenient

08:07.800 --> 08:09.680
for us to have that responsibility.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.560
I think one of the problems that we see here

08:11.560 --> 08:13.520
is in our quest for more software availability,

08:13.520 --> 08:15.120
we've made it easier to get software

08:15.120 --> 08:16.840
and that can make, like with the AUR,

08:16.840 --> 08:18.440
it can mean that you can rebuild things

08:18.440 --> 08:20.960
from Git really easily and get the latest security patches

08:20.960 --> 08:23.640
or things can never get updated.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.400
But I think some systems are doing it

08:25.400 --> 08:27.240
in a little bit different because you'll never be able

08:27.240 --> 08:29.640
to solve, or at least it doesn't seem likely will solve

08:29.640 --> 08:31.160
the problem of people just didn't update

08:31.160 --> 08:33.280
all their dependencies the right way anytime soon.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.600
But maybe another approach is limiting the damage

08:35.600 --> 08:38.320
that can be done like with snaps, right Wimpy?

08:38.320 --> 08:40.560
Yeah, this is an interesting conversation.

08:40.560 --> 08:45.560
So when we think back to 1970s Unix,

08:45.640 --> 08:49.800
everything's a string, do one job and do it well,

08:49.800 --> 08:54.000
and pipes, these were profound ideas

08:54.000 --> 08:55.520
that have stood the test of time

08:55.520 --> 08:58.160
and lasted for 40 plus years.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.520
But back then when Unix was being created,

09:01.520 --> 09:03.400
there were a handful of people

09:03.400 --> 09:05.520
that were building the system.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.120
And there was implicit trust that existed

09:08.120 --> 09:10.800
between all of those people that were working

09:10.800 --> 09:13.440
on the Unix derivatives.

09:14.760 --> 09:18.240
And you can even trace that back to the level of trust

09:18.240 --> 09:21.240
that existed in the networking tools back then.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.240
Everything worked on a trust relationship.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.200
Everybody knew who everybody else was.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.560
Now, when you roll forward 40, 50 years,

09:29.560 --> 09:31.280
that's not the case anymore.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.800
There are tens of millions of developers just on GitHub,

09:34.800 --> 09:37.200
and there are other places that you can manage

09:37.200 --> 09:39.720
your source code in the world today.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.760
There are millions upon millions upon millions of projects

09:43.760 --> 09:47.920
in GitHub and other public source code repositories.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.400
You as a sysadmin or a DevOps engineer,

09:51.400 --> 09:54.720
or a developer who are pulling in components,

09:54.720 --> 09:57.320
you may just pull in component foo,

09:57.320 --> 10:00.880
but component foo may have dependencies upon dozens

10:00.880 --> 10:03.640
and dozens and dozens of other libraries.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.640
You can't trust all of that other stuff.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.960
And this is where snaps are a re-imagining

10:10.960 --> 10:14.480
of old 1970s AT&T Unix,

10:14.480 --> 10:16.480
where you take all of those things,

10:16.480 --> 10:19.760
you put them in a container that can't tread

10:19.760 --> 10:23.680
on the host operating system or the other applications

10:23.680 --> 10:25.360
that are installed in that way,

10:25.360 --> 10:27.920
because we can't guarantee these trust relationships

10:27.920 --> 10:31.080
that used to exist in the distribution models

10:31.080 --> 10:34.480
and the creation of the distributions

10:34.480 --> 10:36.320
in their earliest forms anymore.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.040
It's a new era, and it seems like something that's actually,

10:40.040 --> 10:41.240
now that we're this far into it,

10:41.240 --> 10:44.240
has been a long time coming.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.560
So, and there's also, obviously, as technology gets better,

10:47.560 --> 10:49.240
there's other ways to solve this.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.480
Almost every major repository is built in

10:51.480 --> 10:54.280
some sort of basic scanning for malware

10:54.280 --> 10:56.480
or trust verification system of publishers.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.520
Like, there's other ways of tackling this

10:58.520 --> 11:00.720
at the distribution end as well.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.120
Somebody could build a machine learning model

11:03.120 --> 11:05.680
which is good at smashing crypto miners or something.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.720
Yeah, I bet you it's in the works.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.560
That seems like something that would get a lot of hype.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.280
Crypto miners by themselves are not illegitimate though.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.560
True, true.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.600
Yeah, basically scan for anything

11:15.600 --> 11:17.960
that's not specifically flagged as a crypto miner.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.320
Like, when you upload your package,

11:19.320 --> 11:22.080
you get a flag that says, this is a crypto miner.

11:22.080 --> 11:22.920
Yeah.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.480
And it would come up on when you install a package saying,

11:25.480 --> 11:26.840
hey, this is a crypto miner.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.840
Are you okay with that?

11:27.840 --> 11:28.680
You're like, yes, I know.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.720
I want to get onto Bitcoin.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.320
Yeah, let's not talk about Bitcoin right now.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.960
It makes me sad.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.320
All right, well, I wanted to also discuss this story

11:37.320 --> 11:39.760
that's coming out of the United Space Alliance.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.360
When's the last time we got to do that?

11:41.360 --> 11:42.760
Too long, too long, I say.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.200
May have been never on this show, actually.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.040
We're going to take a look page

11:46.040 --> 11:47.520
from SciByte here for a moment.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.760
This is the group that manages the computers

11:49.760 --> 11:51.880
aboard the International Space Station,

11:51.880 --> 11:53.480
and they work with NASA.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.360
And they just recently announced

11:55.360 --> 11:57.120
that the Windows XP computers

11:57.120 --> 11:59.320
aboard the International Space Station

11:59.320 --> 12:01.960
have been switched to GNU slash Linux.

12:01.960 --> 12:02.800
No way.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.040
Wow. Isn't that awesome?

12:04.040 --> 12:05.080
That's fantastic.

12:05.080 --> 12:05.920
Yeah.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.800
Yeah, they write, we migrated key functions

12:07.800 --> 12:08.720
from Windows to Linux

12:08.720 --> 12:12.400
because we needed an operating system that was...

12:12.400 --> 12:14.480
Stable. Stable and reliable.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.320
Of course.

12:15.320 --> 12:18.000
Yep, yep, in specific, the dozens of laptops

12:18.000 --> 12:19.760
will make the change to,

12:19.760 --> 12:21.880
can you guess which version of Debian?

12:21.880 --> 12:22.720
Oh, it's Debian.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.640
I was going to say Fedora 29,

12:23.640 --> 12:25.480
but no, that wouldn't make sense.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.920
No, they had to wait around for 30.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.360
It's going to be supported for a while.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.360
Okay, so Debian 8, let's say.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.200
Yeah, give me the number

12:31.200 --> 12:32.480
because I don't remember all the Debian names

12:32.480 --> 12:34.120
off the top of my head all the time.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.320
So, all right.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.040
Okay, let's see if anybody can,

12:37.040 --> 12:39.160
see if you can guess what version of Debian

12:39.160 --> 12:40.880
it's going to be up in space for a long time.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.520
So you're going to want something probably recent, right?

12:43.520 --> 12:45.040
Something current and well supported.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.200
We'll have security updates for going forward.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.360
It's an old one.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.920
It is, you're right, it is.

12:49.920 --> 12:50.760
All right, okay.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.880
It is Debian 6.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.720
The laptops will join many other systems

12:56.720 --> 12:58.520
aboard the ISS that already run

12:58.520 --> 12:59.920
various flavors of Linux.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.720
These ones will be running Debian 6.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.040
There's also Red Hat up there, as you would imagine,

13:05.040 --> 13:08.000
and some scientific Linux, as you probably guessed already.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.040
And after the transition,

13:09.040 --> 13:11.000
there won't be a single computer of the ISS

13:11.000 --> 13:12.680
that runs Windows anymore.

13:12.680 --> 13:13.600
It was kind of interesting that

13:13.600 --> 13:15.480
another reason they liked was that

13:15.480 --> 13:16.800
they wanted in-house control,

13:16.800 --> 13:17.960
which is a thing we talk about,

13:17.960 --> 13:19.760
but you don't always actually see people using it, right?

13:19.760 --> 13:21.160
But here they can just,

13:21.160 --> 13:22.840
they can mess things up as much as they want to

13:22.840 --> 13:24.560
and customize it.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.800
Yeah, well, you know, they got a virus back in 2008.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.960
I guess they blame it on a Russian cosmonaut.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.880
Those Russians and their viruses.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.360
Brought about a worm, I guess, technically not a virus,

13:34.360 --> 13:37.040
which then spread to the other laptops.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.160
And they think that switching to Linux will

13:39.160 --> 13:41.960
essentially immunize them from that particular type

13:41.960 --> 13:43.720
of attack in the future.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.560
I mean, I guess against casual malware,

13:45.560 --> 13:47.960
not perhaps a more malicious attack.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.160
Yeah.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.520
Yeah, but I don't think any of us

13:50.520 --> 13:52.040
are too surprised by this, are we?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.960
Because Linux is the scientific community's

13:53.960 --> 13:55.280
operating system of choice.

13:55.280 --> 13:59.640
We know that the Large Hadron Collider is used by Linux.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.160
It uses Linux and uses KDE Plasma.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.480
NASA and SpaceX ground stations run Linux.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.480
DNA sequencing labs technicians use Linux.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.440
It's pretty much anybody that has a serious job.

14:09.440 --> 14:13.040
Yeah, a lot of astronomy software and packages

14:13.040 --> 14:14.880
for analyzing images you get from telescopes.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.240
That's already running Linux, too.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.320
So kind of part of the course.

14:18.320 --> 14:21.080
Did you see this bit on here about the robot?

14:21.080 --> 14:22.640
They got a robot up there, too.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.240
In other news, yeah, the first humanoid robot in space,

14:25.240 --> 14:29.120
Robonaut 2, also runs Linux, is due for an upgrade.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.000
So they got Robonaut.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.640
And Robonaut 2 is also going to be like they got two robots,

14:32.640 --> 14:34.800
but only one of them is in production.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.000
And the one that's up there now, the one that's

14:37.000 --> 14:40.280
being reassembled and built, has been delivered in pieces.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.560
The last big pieces actually went up in 2011.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.600
Right now, it's just a torso with two arms.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.280
But they also have legs that they're

14:48.280 --> 14:50.280
going to be giving it soon and a battery pack

14:50.280 --> 14:51.800
that will be delivered soon.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.600
And then eventually, it'll be able to perform

14:53.600 --> 14:56.240
menial tasks like vacuuming, changing the filters,

14:56.240 --> 14:59.160
the air filters, and possibly dangerous tasks

14:59.160 --> 15:00.360
like during spacewalks.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.320
Space butler.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.520
You saw it here first, folks.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.360
Running Linux, Wes.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.000
How about that, huh?

15:06.000 --> 15:09.120
If you like running Linux, friends,

15:09.120 --> 15:11.480
if you enjoy the GNU slash Linux operating system.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.120
And you like talking to people who also

15:13.120 --> 15:14.320
enjoy that operating system.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.560
Then I invite you out to Linux Fest Northwest,

15:16.560 --> 15:22.600
coming up April 26 and the 28th in Bellingham, Washington,

15:22.600 --> 15:24.800
the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.640
And it's at the Bellingham Technical College,

15:26.640 --> 15:28.800
which is a great campus because they

15:28.800 --> 15:30.720
got all kinds of things like robotics there

15:30.720 --> 15:33.640
and they have gaming labs there.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.220
So it's great for kids, too, if you've got little ones.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.080
They have things for little ones to do.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.500
They have a gaming room that is a ton of fun

15:40.500 --> 15:42.160
that my young ones like.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.560
And there is tons of talks to attend.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.120
And of course, we're going to be there.

15:46.120 --> 15:46.840
We're going to have a booth.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.040
And we're even considering doing a little bit more this year,

15:49.040 --> 15:50.720
maybe having a room where we're giving talks all day

15:50.720 --> 15:51.680
and things like that.

15:51.680 --> 15:52.320
It's all in the works.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.240
It's all early days.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.280
But I wanted to mention it now while we're still in 2018.

15:56.280 --> 15:58.300
So maybe it could possibly be on your radar

15:58.300 --> 16:00.880
because we're hoping to have a hell of a party.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.320
It's been a good year for us.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.320
We've had things to celebrate.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.440
A year like no other.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.800
Not only have we joined Linux Academy,

16:09.800 --> 16:13.440
and now we have full-time people on our team.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.860
And we have new hosts in the works

16:15.860 --> 16:18.440
that are going to be able to join us there that you haven't

16:18.440 --> 16:19.480
even heard about yet.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.800
It's been a really good year for us.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.420
And we're going to have a great party.

16:22.420 --> 16:26.120
Plus, it's the 20th Linux Fest Northwest.

16:26.120 --> 16:26.840
20 years.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.880
20 years of Linux Fest Northwest.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.560
Wow.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.680
So they have a few things, a few surprises in the works

16:32.680 --> 16:33.920
to celebrate that.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.360
And they're doing a big past, present, and future theme

16:36.360 --> 16:37.320
to kind of bring it all together.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.080
All this kind of sounds like if you've

16:39.080 --> 16:40.520
been wanting to go to one of these,

16:40.520 --> 16:42.280
you want to go to a conference and hang out with us

16:42.280 --> 16:43.200
or other JP fans.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.080
Yeah, this is the one.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.080
Yeah, this is the one.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.680
And last year, we did a barbecue outside of Lady Joop's.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.160
We had a couple of barbecues going.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.600
Plus, we had the kitchen inside Lady Joop's going.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.360
Just a tremendous party that was a huge success.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.080
And so I think we're going to do it again.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.080
I haven't talked to the folks at System76 yet,

16:58.080 --> 17:00.080
but I know they thought it was a huge success.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.800
Yeah, I'm sure they'll be back.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.600
And if not, hey, we've got the crew.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.560
I mean, maybe we'll be lucky enough

17:05.560 --> 17:06.920
to see Brent there joining us.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.560
I can carry two barbecues on Lady Joop's alone.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.600
So I'm just saying.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.600
Yeah, Brent, are you planning to make it back this year?

17:12.600 --> 17:13.320
I'm definitely going.

17:13.320 --> 17:14.960
I think after the experience last year

17:14.960 --> 17:18.080
and just the huge connection to the JB community

17:18.080 --> 17:22.040
here over this year, there's no reason not to go, really.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.720
Even if it's across the continent, really.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.440
I'm feeling like this is going to be one of our big years.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.280
I'm really excited.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.120
I've talked to Noah.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.200
He's going to be there too.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.520
He'll be at the booth.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.960
And we'll be doing live shows.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.600
And it's just, oh, it's going to be fun.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.840
JB family blowout.

17:35.840 --> 17:37.720
It's going to be a JB family blowout.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.840
So if you want to come out, and so far, it even

17:40.840 --> 17:43.160
sounds like I've talked Joe into coming out and doing

17:43.160 --> 17:44.360
the live Linux action news.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.560
That mysterious, mysterious Joe.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.400
The first live Linux action news

17:48.400 --> 17:51.360
we'll have ever done live at Linux Fest Northwest.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.680
And the first time we've ever seen each other in person.

17:54.680 --> 17:57.120
So I'm looking forward to that just alone.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.080
That's going to be great.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.840
So if you can make it, it's one to go to.

17:59.840 --> 18:02.440
Anybody else in the mumble room, anybody?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.000
Anybody in particular?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.760
Might make it for the 20th anniversary, yes.

18:06.760 --> 18:07.600
Thinking about it.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.520
Gosh, that'd be great.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.120
That would be wild.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.160
That would be so great.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.080
It would be great to have a barbecue at the same time,

18:15.080 --> 18:15.480
I think.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.000
Absolutely.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.120
Just a crazy suggestion.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.320
A barbecue, we almost always have an after party

18:20.320 --> 18:20.960
at the studio.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.840
Although this year, I have a restaurant in mind

18:22.840 --> 18:25.440
to go to just because the crowd's getting bigger.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.080
And the studio's not that big.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.440
So yeah, but we almost always have an after party.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.440
Well, we try to have an after party each night.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.600
So it gets a little ridiculous because you've

18:34.600 --> 18:36.560
got Friday night, which is set up night.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.280
And then the-

18:37.280 --> 18:39.160
You need to blow off some steam after that.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.520
The actual Fest is Saturday and Sunday.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.600
So then you've got things to do at Saturday night and Sunday

18:43.600 --> 18:44.320
night.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.280
And then it's like Sunday, you're all done with the Fest.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.320
You've done your live Linux action news.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.360
Well, now you want to go have a party.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.400
So then there's another party.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.360
And they're not like crazy blowout parties.

18:52.360 --> 18:56.160
Well, actually, sometimes they are.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.880
It just depends on the crowd every year.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.360
But I'd just love to have you there.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.280
And you can check out and get more information

19:01.280 --> 19:03.040
at linuxfestnorthwest.org.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.920
Also, as we do this recording, there's still 65 days

19:05.920 --> 19:07.680
left to submit papers.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.600
I'm encouraging our team, Wes, and others on our team

19:11.600 --> 19:14.480
to submit papers and for talks because I

19:14.480 --> 19:16.720
think we have a lot to contribute that we don't

19:16.720 --> 19:17.960
normally do those things.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.240
But because we're going to have such a big crew,

19:19.240 --> 19:21.400
we'll have plenty of coverage at the booth and stuff

19:21.400 --> 19:23.480
so we can do that kind of thing this year.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.000
Wow, very excited about that.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.640
Well, Wimpy, I really, really do hope you make it.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.120
That would be one of the highlights of the year, I think.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.840
But while I've got your ear, you really

19:34.840 --> 19:38.160
kind of piqued my interest on a recent episode of Ubuntu

19:38.160 --> 19:40.280
podcast, big fan, as you know.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.640
And you touched on a new setup using some software

19:44.640 --> 19:46.340
that I have heard mentioned several times

19:46.340 --> 19:49.000
by the audience, SnapRaid, and a couple of other projects

19:49.000 --> 19:51.520
to really build yourself what sounds like, oh, I mean,

19:51.520 --> 19:53.400
this might, you could correct me if I'm wrong,

19:53.400 --> 19:56.200
but it almost sounds like a free open-source Drobo,

19:56.200 --> 19:58.000
like a home-built Drobo in a way.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.400
Yeah, I think a comparison with a Drobo is fair, yes.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.840
OK, so this obviously sounds very tempting.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.800
I just had another drive die in my FreeNAS server.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.560
I don't know why this happens to me.

20:10.560 --> 20:15.200
And I don't know, I don't grok in FreeNAS's UI

20:15.200 --> 20:16.280
how I'm supposed to solve it.

20:16.280 --> 20:16.960
I don't get it.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.800
So then I get.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.120
That's funny.

20:18.120 --> 20:18.640
I had the same.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.520
I just bought two replacement drives on Black Friday.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.800
So I'm going to be rebuilding the array myself.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.360
I didn't even notice until yesterday.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.760
So I didn't even think to look.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.640
So I don't know.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.400
I'm just kind of sick and tired of this.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.560
It's not that FreeNAS is bad.

20:31.560 --> 20:33.000
I love FreeNAS.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.160
But when I have disk die on me, I

20:35.160 --> 20:37.480
feel like I can never clear the error messages out of FreeNAS

20:37.480 --> 20:39.000
for the rest of the life of that install.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.040
And it's just because I'm an idiot.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.240
Because Alan sits down, and he has it figured out

20:42.240 --> 20:42.880
in two seconds.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.320
So it's my fault. But I have been thinking about,

20:46.320 --> 20:49.200
if this was a Linux-based system,

20:49.200 --> 20:51.640
I could probably just take care of it.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.240
And it's because it's this quasi-appliance

20:54.240 --> 20:56.200
without a full user land, running

20:56.200 --> 20:58.560
on top of a kernel and system tools

20:58.560 --> 21:01.800
that I am not as familiar with, that I feel like my data is

21:01.800 --> 21:04.080
kind of in peril.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.720
So help me, wimpy one.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.360
You're my only hope.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.280
Is this something where you could actually

21:09.280 --> 21:10.400
hack it on the command line?

21:10.400 --> 21:13.080
You can SSH into your box and mess around with stuff,

21:13.080 --> 21:14.580
and you're not going to break it.

21:14.580 --> 21:17.320
Explain this setup to me and how it all kind of fits together.

21:17.320 --> 21:17.840
OK.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.080
So yes is the answer to that question.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.680
What I have started with is just an install of Ubuntu server

21:24.680 --> 21:26.400
1804.1.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.360
So just straight up Ubuntu server.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.240
So yes, you can SSH into it.

21:31.240 --> 21:34.440
And you can do all of the management from that point

21:34.440 --> 21:36.280
onwards just over SSH.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.720
With no fancy file system set up beforehand or anything

21:38.720 --> 21:39.280
like that?

21:39.280 --> 21:39.920
Correct.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.400
Yeah, so this is where SnapRaid is interesting.

21:42.400 --> 21:46.520
So let's just start this by saying ZFS is all well and good,

21:46.520 --> 21:48.520
and it has its place in the world.

21:48.520 --> 21:53.760
But I've specifically chosen these tools of SnapRaid

21:53.760 --> 21:58.720
and MergerFS because I am addressing specific issues

21:58.720 --> 22:03.320
that home users would have, not enterprises with terabytes

22:03.320 --> 22:04.960
and terabytes of storage.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.360
So is an example of that like mismatched disks,

22:08.360 --> 22:09.640
or what's an example of that?

22:09.640 --> 22:13.120
Yeah, so examples of that would be with SnapRaid,

22:13.120 --> 22:16.960
you can use mismatched sizes of disks.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.440
You don't have to create the array upfront.

22:20.440 --> 22:25.600
You can use your existing disks with your existing data on it

22:25.600 --> 22:28.600
and add those into a SnapRaid configuration

22:28.600 --> 22:32.200
without any formatting or anything like that.

22:32.200 --> 22:37.960
So in terms of the home user for budgeting, it's very flexible.

22:37.960 --> 22:44.240
And for my position, I lost some disks a year ago

22:44.240 --> 22:47.360
in last year's summer due to heat.

22:47.360 --> 22:52.200
So I'm very sensitive to disks running and spinning

22:52.200 --> 22:54.080
and generating heat.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.760
And the way that SnapRaid works is you, so for example,

22:57.760 --> 23:01.280
I have four drives in one of my arrays.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.320
I just formatted all of them with, well, one of them

23:05.320 --> 23:08.600
I formatted with XFS, and the other three I

23:08.600 --> 23:11.040
formatted with ext4.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.920
So you can choose what file system

23:12.920 --> 23:14.760
you want to put on the disks you're

23:14.760 --> 23:17.400
going to use in your SnapRaid array.

23:17.400 --> 23:22.440
The way that SnapRaid works is that you just copy files

23:22.440 --> 23:23.880
onto a file system.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.360
So nothing clever, nothing fancy.

23:26.360 --> 23:30.840
But consequently, a file exists on one

23:30.840 --> 23:33.360
of the disks in your array.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.480
An array is like in air quotes now,

23:35.480 --> 23:39.080
because it's not like a RAID array where the whole thing is

23:39.080 --> 23:41.120
a logical volume.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.520
Which means when this is actually in use,

23:44.520 --> 23:47.440
only one disk is spinning.

23:47.440 --> 23:51.400
And I have SmartMon power down the disks

23:51.400 --> 23:53.400
after 10 minutes of activity.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.520
So this keeps the disks cool.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.520
It keeps the power down, and it keeps the noise down.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.520
So these are all important factors for home users.

24:02.520 --> 24:03.020
Right.

24:03.020 --> 24:03.780
That makes sense.

24:03.780 --> 24:06.240
Instead of focusing on a constantly available,

24:06.240 --> 24:07.680
high performance NAS system, this

24:07.680 --> 24:09.440
is more of like, here's my backup server,

24:09.440 --> 24:10.600
and I just want to keep things safe.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.880
It doesn't have to be ready to respond at all moments.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.840
I mean, it's sitting there idle a large chunk of the day.

24:16.840 --> 24:17.320
Indeed.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.120
That's a good point.

24:18.120 --> 24:22.600
So SnapRaid is designed for media servers

24:22.600 --> 24:26.080
where the files on the media server

24:26.080 --> 24:28.840
are changing infrequently.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.400
So let's just talk about SnapRaid for a minute.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.800
I had four drives.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.680
I formatted one with XFS, the other three with ext4.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.560
We'll get to why I did that in just a moment,

24:39.560 --> 24:41.880
because I'm sure that will come as a surprise to you.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.600
I would have thought of an XFS myself,

24:43.600 --> 24:46.240
but a gentleman's file system.

24:46.240 --> 24:47.200
We'll get to it.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.480
You'll understand.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.480
And the drive that I formatted XFS,

24:53.480 --> 24:55.920
that I used as my parity drive.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.440
So within the SnapRaid configuration,

24:58.440 --> 25:03.960
I say this disk mounted in this location is used for parity.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.520
The other three drives that I formatted,

25:06.520 --> 25:10.000
I say these disks are data disks.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.040
And they are each mounted in their own discrete location.

25:13.040 --> 25:18.920
So one is called HDD1, another is HDD2, another is HDD3.

25:18.920 --> 25:21.280
And that's basically the SnapRaid configuration.

25:21.280 --> 25:23.560
That's all it cares about, where the disks are,

25:23.560 --> 25:26.320
which one has got parity, which one's got data.

25:26.320 --> 25:30.000
And then you also specify the path

25:30.000 --> 25:31.760
to what are called content files.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.680
And these are the files that store the hashes.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.640
So the checksums and hashes for the files.

25:37.640 --> 25:41.240
And this is where SnapRaid has a great property,

25:41.240 --> 25:45.360
because it offers you the same kind of bit rot protection

25:45.360 --> 25:47.680
that ZFS offers you.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.760
With checksums?

25:48.760 --> 25:50.560
With checksums, indeed.

25:50.560 --> 25:56.920
And it can recover from files where the data has become

25:56.920 --> 26:01.800
corrupt over time, and repair that data from the parity

26:01.800 --> 26:03.080
and the hashes.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.840
You probably have heard a lot of people say this sounds

26:04.840 --> 26:06.640
similar to Unraid, since you talked about it

26:06.640 --> 26:07.960
on the Ubuntu podcast.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.560
It is similar to Unraid.

26:09.560 --> 26:14.120
It's far more robust than Unraid in my experience.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.200
Yes, indeed.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.960
Yeah, and Unraid is more than just a disk manager now.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.340
It does a whole lot more than that.

26:19.340 --> 26:20.840
Is it a web UI to manage it?

26:20.840 --> 26:21.760
What's the interface?

26:21.760 --> 26:25.560
It's just a config file and a command line application

26:25.560 --> 26:26.960
called SnapRaid.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.240
So once I've created that configuration,

26:30.240 --> 26:33.040
that configuration defines my array.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.960
And now I can just copy some files onto those disks

26:35.960 --> 26:36.600
willy-nilly.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.200
So I copied some files onto hard disk 1,

26:39.200 --> 26:43.160
I copied some onto hard disk 2, and some onto hard disk 3.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.160
And then I ran the command SnapRaid sync,

26:46.160 --> 26:49.060
and that then builds the parity file.

26:49.060 --> 26:54.360
So it inspects every file in the array, builds the parity file,

26:54.360 --> 26:58.440
and builds the tables of hashes for all of the files that

26:58.440 --> 26:59.440
are in there.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.960
And at that point, my data is now protected.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.480
So I have a parity drive, which means one of my disks can fail

27:06.480 --> 27:08.700
and I will be able to recover.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.780
And I have hashes of all of my data.

27:10.780 --> 27:12.320
So if there's any bit rot, I can also

27:12.320 --> 27:15.600
recover any data that's become corrupt over time.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.480
Now, explain to me, because I feel

27:17.480 --> 27:21.220
like I'm missing one piece, is I understand that MergerFS

27:21.220 --> 27:22.440
is also part of this.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.640
And I know MergerFS is a union file system,

27:25.640 --> 27:28.000
but I'm not clear how that's fitting in with your setup.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.120
Right, OK.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.880
Well, I'll get to that in just one moment,

27:30.880 --> 27:34.600
because there's one other important feature of SnapRaid.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.140
You have to run the sync command manually

27:37.140 --> 27:40.960
to rebuild your parity, unlike, say, something like ZFS,

27:40.960 --> 27:42.920
where that's happening on the fly.

27:42.920 --> 27:48.440
And this is where SnapRaid now has backup kind of functions.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.840
So in the intervening periods where I haven't run a sync,

27:52.840 --> 27:59.480
if I delete files or overwrite files I didn't mean to,

27:59.480 --> 28:03.480
I can now go onto my volume, and I can say SnapRaid fix,

28:03.480 --> 28:06.200
and I can undelete the files and recover them

28:06.200 --> 28:08.600
from the parity that I have.

28:08.600 --> 28:12.520
So in the times between the syncs being run,

28:12.520 --> 28:16.960
it operates as a backup tool, and you can pull files out

28:16.960 --> 28:17.720
of the backup.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.000
That could be nice in a small office environment, too.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.960
Right, yeah, or at home, when if I do a sync every week,

28:23.960 --> 28:26.280
I've got a week's grace that I may have deleted something

28:26.280 --> 28:27.920
accidentally, and I can go and recover it

28:27.920 --> 28:31.720
without having to go to actual backups.

28:31.720 --> 28:37.680
So because now the files are spread across three disks,

28:37.680 --> 28:40.520
that's a bit inconvenient, because now you

28:40.520 --> 28:43.020
have to know that this disk has got these files in it,

28:43.020 --> 28:44.720
and this disk has got these files in it,

28:44.720 --> 28:47.480
and this disk has got these files in it.

28:47.480 --> 28:51.280
So then I've installed some software called MergerFS,

28:51.280 --> 28:59.040
and that uses Fuse, and it uses wildcards in your FS tab.

28:59.040 --> 29:03.720
So you can say, go and mount all of my HDD star

29:03.720 --> 29:08.200
under slash media slash MergerFS.

29:08.200 --> 29:12.200
And now, under that directory, I have a union

29:12.200 --> 29:14.680
of those three disks presented.

29:14.680 --> 29:19.480
And MergerFS then has some strategies about how files,

29:19.480 --> 29:22.800
if you say, copy a file to the union,

29:22.800 --> 29:27.740
how it decides where to place those files.

29:27.740 --> 29:29.880
So I've got it in a mode where it will say,

29:29.880 --> 29:32.700
does the directory, the endpoint directory

29:32.700 --> 29:35.200
that I'm being asked to put this file in already exist?

29:35.200 --> 29:37.560
If it does, put it on the disk that already

29:37.560 --> 29:39.840
has that directory on it.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.520
Or you can say, just scatter them willy nilly.

29:42.520 --> 29:45.080
There's a whole different bunch of right strategies

29:45.080 --> 29:46.120
you can use there.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.440
But because I want to have disks generally,

29:48.440 --> 29:50.720
only one disk spinning at a time,

29:50.720 --> 29:53.460
I have it say, where does this data already exist?

29:53.460 --> 29:54.760
Let's write it there.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.460
And then I've got a configuration option

29:56.460 --> 29:58.560
that says, and if there is not enough space

29:58.560 --> 30:01.040
on that actual disk, then fail over

30:01.040 --> 30:04.840
to the disk that has the most available space

30:04.840 --> 30:06.800
and start writing those files there.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.560
And now, how does the system respond

30:08.560 --> 30:10.920
if you were, say, to slot in a couple of new drives

30:10.920 --> 30:16.180
or put in one that's maybe six terabytes and another that's

30:16.180 --> 30:17.080
two terabytes?

30:17.080 --> 30:17.960
Right.

30:17.960 --> 30:20.200
So the only thing you have to do is make sure

30:20.200 --> 30:22.560
that the drive you're using for parity

30:22.560 --> 30:24.840
is at least as big as the largest drive

30:24.840 --> 30:26.200
that you're using for data.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.120
Is there a migration?

30:27.120 --> 30:28.960
Can you move parity drives?

30:28.960 --> 30:32.120
You can now spread across, spread the parity

30:32.120 --> 30:33.280
across multiple drives.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.080
So you could spread it out, and then you

30:35.080 --> 30:37.280
could reclaim that parity drive as one of your storage drives.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.200
Yes.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.000
Exactly so.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.040
Yes, yes.

30:40.040 --> 30:43.280
And let's imagine I have this terrible situation where

30:43.280 --> 30:46.720
two disks fail, and I've only got one parity drive.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.840
So I can't recover the whole array.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.940
But the two disks that I have left,

30:50.940 --> 30:52.840
because they're just file systems,

30:52.840 --> 30:54.720
I have that data on those disks.

30:54.720 --> 30:59.640
There's no special file system or RAID mechanism behind that.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.960
That data is just accessible to me.

31:01.960 --> 31:06.000
I can just plug that into an external USB adapter

31:06.000 --> 31:07.240
and just suck that data off.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.960
So it's extended for or whatever.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.120
Yeah, exactly so.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.120
Yeah.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.020
But yes, if you want to add another drive,

31:14.020 --> 31:15.600
you just plug the disk in.

31:15.600 --> 31:19.080
You add, you format it, you mount it somewhere,

31:19.080 --> 31:22.320
and then you put in the Snap RAID configuration.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.720
Hard disk 5 is in this location, and that's it.

31:25.720 --> 31:27.240
It's very, very simple.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.280
That does sound simple.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.200
And it's surprisingly fast as well.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.200
So again, because this is home stuff,

31:33.200 --> 31:36.400
I have these arrays hooked up over USB 3 even.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.160
Right, because you're not even looking

31:38.160 --> 31:39.480
for super high performance.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.640
You're looking for storage.

31:40.640 --> 31:45.480
Yeah, but even over USB 3, I'm pushing 170 megabytes

31:45.480 --> 31:47.400
a second across the array.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.960
So not too shabby.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.600
No, what kind of hardware is that?

31:50.600 --> 31:55.400
It's their ICDock Black Vortex enclosures

31:55.400 --> 31:57.640
connected over just regular USB 3 to a NUC.

31:57.640 --> 32:00.840
Is it like an i7 machine, or is it a NUC?

32:00.840 --> 32:05.120
It's a NUC with a mobile chip, a mobile i7.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.720
So it's a quad core mobile i7.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.920
That sounds like a perfect home server for what you're going for.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.160
That's a great setup.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.560
Well, that piques my interest.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.760
Wimpy, thank you for sharing with the class.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.640
And we'll have links to the projects

32:18.640 --> 32:20.920
that Wimpy talked about with their documentation

32:20.920 --> 32:23.160
in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com

32:23.160 --> 32:24.560
slash 277.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.320
And he also went into some detail in the Ubuntu podcast.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.760
So go check that out.

32:29.760 --> 32:33.200
And I am definitely looking at SnapRate.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.920
I wanted to mention for anybody that's

32:35.920 --> 32:38.600
listening the week that this comes out,

32:38.600 --> 32:40.780
or if you're listening live right now,

32:40.780 --> 32:42.360
I don't exactly know what happened.

32:42.360 --> 32:47.040
But Linux Academy decided to extend the $2.99 per year

32:47.040 --> 32:50.960
deal, which makes it $24 a month to get Linux Academy for five

32:50.960 --> 32:52.840
more days as we record this.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.280
I think on Cyber Monday, the sign-up page

32:56.280 --> 32:58.040
went down or something because of everybody

32:58.040 --> 32:59.160
trying to get the deal.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.240
So they're like, all right, well.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.720
And it was only like, I mean, they freaked out

33:01.720 --> 33:03.520
because it was like 20 minutes, right?

33:03.520 --> 33:04.000
It wasn't like a hoot.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.800
But they're like, we're going to extend it for five more days.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.640
I think that's what happened.

33:07.640 --> 33:08.600
But it's a great deal.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.040
And if you didn't jump on it, you're saving 33%.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.840
And the reason I mentioned that is because they obviously

33:13.840 --> 33:14.360
don't pay us.

33:14.360 --> 33:14.980
Well, I mean, they pay us.

33:14.980 --> 33:16.600
But they don't ask me to do these ads.

33:16.600 --> 33:19.320
But I know what they have in the works.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.360
So if you get it at $24 a month, that's

33:21.360 --> 33:22.800
going to be worth it for a long time

33:22.800 --> 33:24.800
because it stays at that price.

33:24.800 --> 33:25.560
Lock it in.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.840
You can lock it in.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.760
Well, the big news this week really

33:29.760 --> 33:34.240
is that the Fedora project is considering canceling,

33:34.240 --> 33:37.240
or maybe you should say significantly delaying,

33:37.240 --> 33:39.080
the release of Fedora 31.

33:39.080 --> 33:43.360
So following the release of Fedora 30 in May,

33:43.360 --> 33:45.920
the project is considering essentially hitting

33:45.920 --> 33:50.540
the pause button for a year, skipping the traditional 31

33:50.540 --> 33:53.920
release cycle, and working on themselves,

33:53.920 --> 33:56.440
retooling and those kinds of things.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.360
It's one of those that they've gone through in the past

33:59.360 --> 34:01.920
when they began doing additions.

34:01.920 --> 34:05.120
And it's one that comes at a kind of precarious time.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.840
So we thought the best route to go

34:06.840 --> 34:09.520
would be to get it from the horse's mouth, as they say,

34:09.520 --> 34:11.080
and bring the project lead on the show

34:11.080 --> 34:12.800
and chat with Matthew Miller.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.280
Matthew, welcome back to the show.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.560
And thanks for joining us on the Unplugged program.

34:16.560 --> 34:17.440
Hi, Chris.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.160
Glad to be here.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.760
Well, we are glad to have you on a day

34:19.760 --> 34:22.560
where we're trying to parse the news that it sounds like there

34:22.560 --> 34:25.960
is a proposal in the works to essentially bump the 31

34:25.960 --> 34:28.800
release, hang out on 30 for a while,

34:28.800 --> 34:32.480
while the back end, I guess infrastructure really,

34:32.480 --> 34:34.640
of the Fedora project is retooled.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.480
Can you explain really what is being proposed?

34:36.480 --> 34:37.440
That's my understanding.

34:37.440 --> 34:42.760
But what's going on from your actual horse's mouth words?

34:42.760 --> 34:44.400
Yeah, that's basically it.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.720
And I don't know if you remember back to five years ago,

34:47.720 --> 34:50.200
we actually did this one time before.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.920
And they worked out OK.

34:52.920 --> 34:57.200
A lot of the problem is we have a six-month release cycle.

34:57.200 --> 35:01.160
And a lot of the people who work on our Fedora infrastructure

35:01.160 --> 35:05.440
also are people who are engaged in the business of getting

35:05.440 --> 35:07.200
that release out the door, the release

35:07.200 --> 35:10.000
engineering, the infrastructure stuff that

35:10.000 --> 35:14.520
makes the bits ship, QA and QA tooling and things like that.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.480
And so as we're going on that rapid cycle,

35:18.480 --> 35:20.680
a lot of technical debt accumulates.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.480
We get a lot of Band-Aids put on things that are problems

35:23.480 --> 35:25.400
and not enough time to fix it.

35:25.400 --> 35:29.800
And then just because this is Fedora 30

35:29.800 --> 35:31.640
we're talking about working on now,

35:31.640 --> 35:33.240
there's been a lot of releases.

35:33.240 --> 35:35.720
And a lot of our tools have grown organically

35:35.720 --> 35:37.240
in the last 15 years.

35:37.240 --> 35:40.320
And so some of the things are scripts

35:40.320 --> 35:42.040
that have another script that they run.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.720
And that script does some other things.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.760
So there's a lot of redundancy.

35:45.760 --> 35:48.120
And performance isn't so good.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.640
So specifically one of the things that's a problem,

35:51.640 --> 35:54.200
when we do a compose, that basically

35:54.200 --> 35:56.280
takes all the software in Fedora.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.000
The packages are already built. But they're put together

35:59.000 --> 36:03.640
into one tree and then put into the different images

36:03.640 --> 36:06.760
for you making Fedora server, for making for a workstation,

36:06.760 --> 36:10.560
and then for making all of our various spins, KDE desktop,

36:10.560 --> 36:13.880
the Python lab, the Docker image, all those things.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.160
That's the compose.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.960
And that's one big monolithic process.

36:17.960 --> 36:24.200
And we were up to that taking something like 18 hours to run.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.560
Although there's been some improvements in that.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.720
But so now it's down to like 12.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.720
But 12 is a very long time.

36:31.720 --> 36:35.400
So that means from making a change

36:35.400 --> 36:37.080
to getting it actually to a place

36:37.080 --> 36:40.520
where our QA can test it takes a day.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.360
And so as we're putting out a release,

36:43.360 --> 36:44.800
that can get very frustrating.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.080
Because let's say we want to sign off

36:47.080 --> 36:48.880
on a release on Thursday.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.920
Well, in order for QA to have time,

36:51.920 --> 36:54.880
that release needs to be ready on Wednesday morning,

36:54.880 --> 36:57.520
which means it needs to be kicked off on Tuesday, which

36:57.520 --> 37:00.960
means we basically have, during that whole last week,

37:00.960 --> 37:05.480
two chances, Monday and Tuesday, to get changes in,

37:05.480 --> 37:10.120
which leads to 20 changes or 50 changes being put in all

37:10.120 --> 37:12.760
at once, which is not very scientific.

37:12.760 --> 37:15.000
And if something messes up, too bad,

37:15.000 --> 37:17.160
we have to delay for a week.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.720
So getting that compose time down,

37:19.720 --> 37:22.360
I think the proposal aims for an hour,

37:22.360 --> 37:23.840
which is nicely ambitious.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.240
But even getting it down to four hours,

37:26.240 --> 37:30.480
so during one normal workday, you could start off a compose.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.480
And then if something goes wrong,

37:32.480 --> 37:35.720
do another one would be a radical improvement.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.200
So that's one of the things.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.120
But there are a lot of things in our processes

37:40.120 --> 37:42.360
that are like that, where it seems

37:42.360 --> 37:44.080
like taking some time to look at it

37:44.080 --> 37:47.720
and focus on actually improving the tooling and processes

37:47.720 --> 37:48.600
would be worthwhile.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.880
Now, I noted, too, in the pretty well-written problem statement

37:52.880 --> 37:54.880
that's on the Wiki, that it says,

37:54.880 --> 37:58.320
currently Fedora can't scale for more community ownership

37:58.320 --> 37:59.560
of the things we release.

37:59.560 --> 38:04.240
Only a few people can build and push our releases.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.760
Is that also a team retooling problem there?

38:06.760 --> 38:08.360
To me, when I read that, it sounds

38:08.360 --> 38:11.360
like perhaps the Fedora project is seeking

38:11.360 --> 38:13.000
to be able to independently release

38:13.000 --> 38:15.640
bits of software they cannot currently independently

38:15.640 --> 38:16.520
release.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.040
Yeah, and some of it's a process thing.

38:19.040 --> 38:22.280
Some of it's actually tooling, because the tooling

38:22.280 --> 38:25.560
to do this literally has no permission structure.

38:25.560 --> 38:28.000
So it's a, you can build everything

38:28.000 --> 38:29.240
or you can build nothing.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.800
And so having the tooling being a little bit smarter

38:31.800 --> 38:34.520
about who can do what, not because we don't trust people,

38:34.520 --> 38:38.600
but just so you don't accidentally rebuild KDE when

38:38.600 --> 38:42.520
you went to rebuild XFCE and then it caused trouble.

38:42.520 --> 38:46.040
It doesn't have that fine grain thing.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.440
And again, because it's all one big compose,

38:48.440 --> 38:52.040
basically it's just a, you could trigger the compose,

38:52.040 --> 38:55.400
but you couldn't say build XFCE.

38:55.400 --> 39:00.560
And that's one of the things we actually, like our XFCE spin,

39:00.560 --> 39:03.200
didn't get built properly for the final release

39:03.200 --> 39:05.720
for Fedora 29, which was bad, because we've

39:05.720 --> 39:07.600
got a lot of people who love XFCE,

39:07.600 --> 39:10.240
and we want that, even though that's not our main offering,

39:10.240 --> 39:12.200
we want that to be successful for people.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.280
I don't know what's the matter with them,

39:13.280 --> 39:14.280
but they just stick to it.

39:14.280 --> 39:15.200
They sure do.

39:15.200 --> 39:19.200
Yeah, you like your interface as it is.

39:19.200 --> 39:21.800
It's very personal, so it's important for people to have it.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.840
There's really only one XFCE user out there.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.720
I'm giving a hard time, and he knows who he is.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.760
Yeah, that's right.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.000
Actually, some of the Fedora infrastructure team

39:30.000 --> 39:34.720
actually have XFCE users, so it was close to home.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.440
I bet.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.280
I bet.

39:36.280 --> 39:39.200
Well, OK, so speaking of XFCE and other sort

39:39.200 --> 39:42.600
of user-facing things, what does all this internal

39:42.600 --> 39:45.760
infrastructure process work mean for user-facing features?

39:45.760 --> 39:47.120
Fedora's doing a lot of stuff.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.480
In particular, I'm thinking of things like Silverblue.

39:49.480 --> 39:50.780
Does that mean these are going to be delayed,

39:50.780 --> 39:53.320
or will that work continue side by side?

39:53.320 --> 39:57.240
Yeah, no, that's a hard thing with this.

39:57.240 --> 39:59.800
And yeah, I think we've done a really good job of getting

39:59.800 --> 40:03.120
onto our six-month cadence and making that fire successfully.

40:03.120 --> 40:06.040
So I actually have a little bit of skepticism

40:06.040 --> 40:08.600
about this plan of stopping things.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.440
So I want to make sure that if we do this,

40:10.440 --> 40:14.120
we have a good plan in place for making sure

40:14.120 --> 40:17.160
that we actually succeed at the things we want to fix,

40:17.160 --> 40:19.600
and then also that we don't break things

40:19.600 --> 40:21.440
for people who have become accustomed to

40:21.440 --> 40:24.480
and happy with having fast releases and good upgrades.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.000
I mean, that seems like a key point.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.360
If you're going to take this break,

40:27.360 --> 40:30.640
it's really got to be worth it.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.140
Because I look at the market right now,

40:32.140 --> 40:34.200
and I see there's going to be some uncertainty

40:34.200 --> 40:37.440
around the future of Fedora, misplaced or not.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.400
But also, really, on the desktop side,

40:40.400 --> 40:43.440
that could potentially mean skipping a GNOME release

40:43.440 --> 40:46.300
cycle, which is kind of like a hard time

40:46.300 --> 40:47.960
to miss a GNOME release cycle right now,

40:47.960 --> 40:50.360
because so many great fixes are landing in GNOME.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.560
Yeah.

40:51.560 --> 40:55.000
And we did do this with the Fedora 20 release.

40:55.000 --> 41:02.280
And I think we put GNOME as a copper to update to,

41:02.280 --> 41:03.560
mixed results there.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.440
We could do something like that again.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.160
Flat packs.

41:06.160 --> 41:09.200
Yeah, put all of GNOME in a flat pack.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.400
You watch, it's going to happen.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.520
One of the things we have now that we didn't

41:13.520 --> 41:16.200
is this modularity system, which lets

41:16.200 --> 41:18.160
us have two different versions of things.

41:18.160 --> 41:21.480
So one idea is to make a GNOME module

41:21.480 --> 41:24.720
so users could opt in to the newer version

41:24.720 --> 41:25.840
using modularity.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.240
That seems brilliant, actually.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.040
Yeah.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.120
And that's kind of what modularity was made for.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.080
So it's also a good test for, hey,

41:32.080 --> 41:34.280
can modularity do something major like this?

41:34.280 --> 41:36.280
Let's make sure it can.

41:36.280 --> 41:37.920
And then for something like Silverblue,

41:37.920 --> 41:40.240
which is more on the experimental side,

41:40.240 --> 41:43.120
the Silverblue OS tree compose could just

41:43.120 --> 41:44.440
pick the newer module.

41:44.440 --> 41:47.760
So Silverblue could have the newer version of things.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.080
So we could have a more conservative and a more

41:50.080 --> 41:51.760
aggressive release.

41:51.760 --> 41:54.200
And then the idea would be to maintain the 30

41:54.200 --> 41:56.760
packages for that whole year.

41:56.760 --> 42:00.160
So I mean, in some ways, perhaps as a server user,

42:00.160 --> 42:02.040
Fedora 30 could be a great release

42:02.040 --> 42:03.880
because it's going to be, in some ways,

42:03.880 --> 42:05.600
an extra long supported version of Fedora.

42:05.600 --> 42:06.480
Is that true?

42:06.480 --> 42:08.440
Yeah, if this proposal goes through.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.920
And yeah, we actually see that in our stats

42:10.920 --> 42:14.440
for the Fedora 19 and 20 releases, which ended up

42:14.440 --> 42:17.160
having a longer cycle because of this.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.040
Those were very, very popular releases

42:19.040 --> 42:21.160
and still continue to, you know, there's

42:21.160 --> 42:25.000
a long tail of people who should upgrade but never have,

42:25.000 --> 42:26.720
who are still using those releases.

42:26.720 --> 42:30.760
And I think that extra year definitely helped with that.

42:30.760 --> 42:31.440
Interesting.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.040
So yeah, that's a side effect as well.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.480
Yeah, OK, that makes sense.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.800
One thing that stood out to me in some of the top level

42:36.800 --> 42:40.080
proposals here is defining a base platform.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.680
And maybe this is something Red Hat wants to see some focus on,

42:42.680 --> 42:45.120
but we were curious, what does that mean?

42:45.120 --> 42:48.800
Yeah, so I'll talk about it from a Red Hat hat on

42:48.800 --> 42:50.360
for a little bit here.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.800
Just slightly, if you looked at the rel8 beta at all,

42:53.800 --> 42:55.960
one of the things that Red Hat did

42:55.960 --> 42:58.800
is split into a base OS and an app stream

42:58.800 --> 43:00.920
where they can have different life cycles.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.640
And things are different in Fedora,

43:02.640 --> 43:05.560
but the basic concept kind of is helpful.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.120
One of the things in Fedora, I don't

43:08.120 --> 43:10.080
know if you followed all Fedora's history,

43:10.080 --> 43:12.400
but one of the important good moves

43:12.400 --> 43:16.040
was merging together Fedora Core, which

43:16.040 --> 43:18.440
came from Red Hat Linux, and Fedora Extras,

43:18.440 --> 43:20.080
which was kind of the community thing,

43:20.080 --> 43:22.120
into one big community project.

43:22.120 --> 43:24.560
That was great and really good for Fedora

43:24.560 --> 43:27.080
and helped Fedora grow and become something

43:27.080 --> 43:29.800
that was really a whole community distribution

43:29.800 --> 43:33.360
rather than something that was just a corporate thing

43:33.360 --> 43:36.000
that the community could build stuff on the fringes.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.440
So that was great.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.360
But one of the outcomes of that is

43:39.360 --> 43:42.520
that Fedora is one gigantic repository

43:42.520 --> 43:47.560
of undifferentiated packages, where some little toy thing

43:47.560 --> 43:50.320
that I am interested in playing with is important to me.

43:50.320 --> 43:53.800
But if it breaks, like five users will care,

43:53.800 --> 43:55.520
and I'm one of them.

43:55.520 --> 43:58.920
That is undifferentiated from something

43:58.920 --> 44:02.280
like glibc in the distribution, or gnome,

44:02.280 --> 44:06.240
or the things that if it breaks, a lot of people

44:06.240 --> 44:09.400
will have their systems not work.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.880
And I've been talking about this since before

44:11.880 --> 44:15.080
as Fedora project leader with the Fedora rings idea,

44:15.080 --> 44:18.360
basically making different policy levels for some

44:18.360 --> 44:19.200
of our pack.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.840
All of our packages are important,

44:20.840 --> 44:24.600
but some of them kind of need a focus in QA.

44:24.600 --> 44:27.000
And we've never had a defined set of,

44:27.000 --> 44:29.480
we've got some that are like critical path,

44:29.480 --> 44:31.240
but it's kind of a loose definition

44:31.240 --> 44:32.880
of getting up to boot.

44:32.880 --> 44:35.400
But some packages that we basically

44:35.400 --> 44:38.680
say this is a QA set of packages together

44:38.680 --> 44:42.040
that maybe if we're looking at doing a longer term maintenance

44:42.040 --> 44:45.760
kind of situation, these are the ones we'd focus on.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.360
If we want to make sure QA focuses on these things.

44:48.360 --> 44:52.760
So it's narrowing down from our whatever 15,000 package

44:52.760 --> 44:55.520
set to something like 1,000 packages

44:55.520 --> 44:58.640
that we can really focus on polish on,

44:58.640 --> 44:59.840
I think is a good idea.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.840
That strikes me, too, that it might provoke

45:01.840 --> 45:04.600
a few deeper conversations within the project about what's

45:04.600 --> 45:07.920
our focus and what does it mean to ship this set of packages

45:07.920 --> 45:08.760
and things like that.

45:08.760 --> 45:12.440
So that could be a really fascinating event to watch.

45:12.440 --> 45:13.320
Yeah.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.600
And I think one of the things, focus is definitely important.

45:16.600 --> 45:20.520
We want to make it so that the core resources of the project

45:20.520 --> 45:25.200
are focused on this enabling core package set

45:25.200 --> 45:30.200
and that people who do have those other cares can focus

45:30.200 --> 45:33.600
on their part of it, not have to worry about the base part

45:33.600 --> 45:35.760
falling apart on them, but they can also

45:35.760 --> 45:38.760
focus their energy on the thing they care about

45:38.760 --> 45:42.240
and develop solutions on top of that and give that to users.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.640
So we should keep in mind that at this stage,

45:44.640 --> 45:48.400
as we record this episode, this taking some time

45:48.400 --> 45:51.360
to refocus on the tools is in most part

45:51.360 --> 45:52.920
just a proposal at this stage.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.040
So what happens next?

45:55.040 --> 45:57.960
What process does this proposal go through to either become

45:57.960 --> 45:59.720
reality or get rejected?

45:59.720 --> 46:02.360
Yeah, so one of the key things here

46:02.360 --> 46:04.640
is there's not secret room cabals

46:04.640 --> 46:06.400
in Fedora deciding things.

46:06.400 --> 46:11.560
So a lot of these things, you're seeing the process in action.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.720
So when somebody proposes it, that means they had in.

46:14.720 --> 46:19.160
This is an idea that several people have worked on.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.440
One of the things we have in Fedora

46:21.440 --> 46:23.720
is the idea of an objective.

46:23.720 --> 46:27.200
And so an objective is something that the Fedora Council,

46:27.200 --> 46:29.000
our leadership body, has said, this

46:29.000 --> 46:32.040
is an area we think the project needs to focus on.

46:32.040 --> 46:36.840
So we have an objective around the Fedora lifecycle

46:36.840 --> 46:42.440
and the Fedora long-term maintenance possibilities.

46:42.440 --> 46:47.240
Fedora, if you go to fedoraproject.docs

46:47.240 --> 46:50.960
at fedoraproject.org and look under the project docs,

46:50.960 --> 46:53.280
I can provide an actual link for this.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.560
There's a section about our different objectives there.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.240
And you can find link to documentation.

46:57.240 --> 47:02.040
So this particular proposal came out of that objective

47:02.040 --> 47:05.640
because there are people looking at these problems.

47:05.640 --> 47:08.360
And so the general process is you

47:08.360 --> 47:09.960
have this community discussion.

47:09.960 --> 47:12.240
And then the Fedora Council will talk about it.

47:12.240 --> 47:13.920
And the Fedora Council will probably

47:13.920 --> 47:20.160
give a non-technical heads up, yes or no, we like this idea.

47:20.160 --> 47:25.240
And the Fedora Council consists of me, community action

47:25.240 --> 47:28.040
and impact coordinator Brian Exelbeer,

47:28.040 --> 47:30.120
some elected people from the community,

47:30.120 --> 47:33.520
and then also people selected by different committees

47:33.520 --> 47:35.400
to be on the council.

47:35.400 --> 47:38.640
And so it kind of gives an overview of the whole.

47:38.640 --> 47:40.760
We try to take the input from the whole project

47:40.760 --> 47:44.640
and reflect that into a definitive decision.

47:44.640 --> 47:49.200
And then also because this is an engineering decision,

47:49.200 --> 47:51.800
the engineering committee will probably also want

47:51.800 --> 47:53.880
to skip a yes or no to this.

47:53.880 --> 47:56.360
So that's basically the processes we'll go through.

47:56.360 --> 47:58.840
It'll be interesting to watch that unfold.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.520
And how do you feel about it personally?

48:01.520 --> 48:04.240
I know as somebody who sits atop of this project

48:04.240 --> 48:06.560
and has been watching it now for I think what is a record

48:06.560 --> 48:08.520
breaking run, what do you think?

48:08.520 --> 48:10.120
Is this a necessary delay?

48:10.120 --> 48:13.080
Is this something that's sort of like taking your medicine?

48:13.080 --> 48:15.080
Yeah, so like I said before, I've

48:15.080 --> 48:16.320
got mixed feelings about it.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.880
I feel really good that we've gotten ourselves

48:18.880 --> 48:24.080
onto a well-firing Mother's Day Halloween release cadence, which

48:24.080 --> 48:25.160
has always been our goal.

48:25.160 --> 48:27.400
But we've sometimes slipped off of that.

48:27.400 --> 48:28.360
Every now and then.

48:28.360 --> 48:28.880
You're right.

48:28.880 --> 48:34.720
So we hit our target schedule a couple times in a row now.

48:34.720 --> 48:36.000
That's awesome.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.600
So just when we've got that going,

48:37.600 --> 48:40.360
seems like maybe not the best time to mess it up.

48:40.360 --> 48:42.120
The joke almost makes itself at this point.

48:42.120 --> 48:42.840
I'm not making it.

48:42.840 --> 48:43.440
I'm just saying.

48:43.440 --> 48:44.640
Yeah, exactly.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.480
So I've got some skepticism about it.

48:47.480 --> 48:49.960
On the other hand, I think it did work for us

48:49.960 --> 48:52.640
when we did that Fedora 20 release.

48:52.640 --> 48:56.280
And I think the problems are real.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.040
The compose problem has been something

48:58.040 --> 49:00.000
that's been frustrating to me for a while.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.800
So spending some time to tackle it seems worthwhile.

49:03.800 --> 49:07.280
But I also do want to make sure that we keep the concerns.

49:07.280 --> 49:09.880
The upstream GNOME community is concerned.

49:09.880 --> 49:13.080
I'm proud of Fedora as a premier GNOME distribution.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.360
I want to keep that.

49:14.360 --> 49:15.480
Sure.

49:15.480 --> 49:19.080
And I want to make sure that people who are packagers who

49:19.080 --> 49:23.440
aren't involved in all of the day-to-day release stuff

49:23.440 --> 49:26.280
are able to keep getting their work to users

49:26.280 --> 49:28.200
and don't feel like they're blocked for a year

49:28.200 --> 49:31.000
from getting the things they're worked on out to people.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.240
So yeah, it's a balance.

49:33.240 --> 49:34.400
Yeah, it sounds like it.

49:34.400 --> 49:37.320
Well, maybe we can check in at some point.

49:37.320 --> 49:39.280
Yeah, I'd love to.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.880
I have been following the project

49:40.880 --> 49:42.000
with more and more interest.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.720
He is at Matt DM on Twitter.

49:44.720 --> 49:48.200
And we will have links to the problem documents

49:48.200 --> 49:50.880
they have in the wiki, as well as the mailing list and the docs

49:50.880 --> 49:52.840
that Matthew just mentioned there.

49:52.840 --> 49:56.160
Is there anywhere else you want to send folks before we run?

49:56.160 --> 49:58.160
Getfedora.org is always a great place

49:58.160 --> 50:00.520
to check out if you don't have Fedora already installed.

50:00.520 --> 50:01.040
Yeah, do it.

50:01.040 --> 50:01.720
Good answer.

50:01.720 --> 50:02.440
Good answer, man.

50:02.440 --> 50:04.480
Matthew, thank you for coming on the show.

50:04.480 --> 50:06.760
One of the things he touched on there that is a little more

50:06.760 --> 50:09.040
obvious if you follow the links in our show notes

50:09.040 --> 50:11.840
is this is the result of a larger objective they

50:11.840 --> 50:14.440
set a while ago as a project.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.080
And this is how they, as a project,

50:16.080 --> 50:17.720
think they can achieve the objective

50:17.720 --> 50:19.280
that they set for themselves.

50:19.280 --> 50:22.560
And it's kind of in a broader context.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.760
I know every project struggles with these tooling issues

50:24.760 --> 50:25.520
sometimes.

50:25.520 --> 50:26.980
But at the same time, you're like,

50:26.980 --> 50:31.040
this is such a precious time to take off because.

50:31.040 --> 50:32.320
Everyone else is moving fast.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.960
There's been lots of good releases.

50:33.960 --> 50:36.320
Yeah, and there's a lot of good fixes coming down the pipe

50:36.320 --> 50:38.200
to GNOME that people are going to want.

50:38.200 --> 50:40.520
So I think they're going to have to come up with a way

50:40.520 --> 50:42.520
to get fresh GNOME to Fedora users.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.320
At least I would think.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.280
Otherwise, people might get a wandering eye

50:46.280 --> 50:48.800
and go to a distribution that's maybe shipping patches

50:48.800 --> 50:51.400
with performance fixes or something.

50:51.400 --> 50:52.680
But we'll see.

50:52.680 --> 50:55.400
You know, we have been talking about a predictions episode.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.740
And we actually nailed down a date and time.

50:57.740 --> 50:58.680
Oh, and by the way, again, thank you

50:58.680 --> 50:59.680
to Matthew for coming on the show.

50:59.680 --> 51:00.000
No kidding.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.240
It's really nice to just get it from him.

51:01.240 --> 51:03.400
We don't have to speculate and just understand

51:03.400 --> 51:05.960
it's a proposal right now.

51:05.960 --> 51:09.800
But yeah, so moving on, we will be recording

51:09.800 --> 51:11.920
a special edition of the Unplugged.

51:11.920 --> 51:14.080
Our special edition of the Unplugged program.

51:14.080 --> 51:14.480
Do you remember?

51:14.480 --> 51:15.080
Oh, yeah.

51:15.080 --> 51:16.480
I do remember what the dates are.

51:16.480 --> 51:19.080
So we'll be doing a predictions episode.

51:19.080 --> 51:24.600
And I kind of feel like maybe we should do the predictions

51:24.600 --> 51:26.160
episode while it's still 2018.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.200
That seems appropriate.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.100
Yeah, I agree.

51:28.100 --> 51:31.200
So instead of doing, see, Linux Unplugged

51:31.200 --> 51:33.000
gets the holiday hammer.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.040
It is on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, the 25th

51:36.040 --> 51:36.820
and the 1st.

51:36.820 --> 51:38.960
So it's both our live days.

51:38.960 --> 51:40.460
So what we're going to do, and I know

51:40.460 --> 51:42.040
this is difficult for some of you,

51:42.040 --> 51:44.040
but I'm hoping maybe it'll open up for others,

51:44.040 --> 51:46.400
is we're just going to move the show one day.

51:46.400 --> 51:49.120
So it'll be on Wednesday for those weeks.

51:49.120 --> 51:50.920
So it'll be the day after Christmas

51:50.920 --> 51:53.040
and it'll be the day after New Year's, so the 26th

51:53.040 --> 51:53.800
and the 2nd.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.000
Same time, just move it one day.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.920
So on the 26th, we're going to do our predictions for 2019.

51:59.920 --> 52:02.960
And if you really have a great prediction

52:02.960 --> 52:05.000
and you have good audio, I invite

52:05.000 --> 52:07.960
you to record a clip and then tweet it to me.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.800
And I will try to include it in the show.

52:09.800 --> 52:10.640
If you can't make it.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.560
But otherwise, our Mumble Room will be open.

52:12.560 --> 52:15.720
You can be here as part of our great virtual council

52:15.720 --> 52:18.960
and make your predictions and pontifications for 2019.

52:18.960 --> 52:21.400
And then you will have world fame, if you nail it,

52:21.400 --> 52:24.280
because we will try to review them the following year

52:24.280 --> 52:25.640
to see how we all did.

52:25.640 --> 52:27.060
So that'll be on the 26th.

52:27.060 --> 52:30.600
And then on the 2nd, maybe if you're still in party mode,

52:30.600 --> 52:33.440
join us for the Mumble Room extravaganza,

52:33.440 --> 52:36.240
where we will do what we want to see.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.000
Wishes, reviews of what happened.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Yeah, you can get a little hopeful.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.760
You don't have to be realistic in this here more fun episode.

52:41.760 --> 52:44.160
That one's a little more low-key laid back.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.600
You're not going to get reviewed.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.880
And we're going to be also doing look back

52:47.880 --> 52:51.360
at some of our favorite stories and be doing the,

52:51.360 --> 52:56.120
if I had a magic wand and I could make project XYZ do ABC,

52:56.120 --> 52:57.080
I would do it.

52:57.080 --> 52:59.640
And then we consider and go, that's a great idea,

52:59.640 --> 53:01.520
because it would mean more users come on board.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.240
It's a fun thing to do.

53:03.240 --> 53:07.160
So those will be just moving one day from our regularly

53:07.160 --> 53:09.960
bat time on our, but obviously on the same bat channel,

53:09.960 --> 53:10.800
right?

53:10.800 --> 53:11.640
Is that the message I wanted to convey?

53:11.640 --> 53:13.240
Yeah, there's a lot of bats involved.

53:13.240 --> 53:14.740
So if you're scared of bats, watch out.

53:14.740 --> 53:15.800
But otherwise, just come.

53:15.800 --> 53:16.640
It's a great time.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.480
You're probably going to get sick of your family anyway,

53:18.480 --> 53:20.440
or maybe you're all by yourself

53:20.440 --> 53:21.800
and we'll be your family for a day.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.000
Our plan is to try to have something for you to listen to

53:24.000 --> 53:27.520
over the holidays, because it's nice when,

53:27.520 --> 53:29.640
not every, we get like the lowest downloads ever,

53:29.640 --> 53:32.360
but it's like for me, like if I'm ever in a situation

53:32.360 --> 53:34.580
where it's like all of a sudden I have like a bunch of time

53:34.580 --> 53:36.320
in the car because I'm traveling for the holiday

53:36.320 --> 53:39.360
or like sometimes I have like these weird gaps

53:39.360 --> 53:41.200
in my schedule where it's like been rush, rush, rush, rush,

53:41.200 --> 53:42.080
rush for the holiday.

53:42.080 --> 53:44.620
And then all of a sudden I find myself without kids,

53:44.620 --> 53:45.600
without my significant others,

53:45.600 --> 53:47.360
like I got half a day to burn.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.000
And then when nobody's releasing stuff,

53:49.000 --> 53:49.840
it's kind of a bummer.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.440
So we thought let's try to stick with it this year

53:52.440 --> 53:53.900
and we'll just bump the schedule a bit.

53:53.900 --> 53:56.440
So it'll be out a day later those weeks,

53:56.440 --> 53:57.640
but there will be a show.

53:57.640 --> 54:00.800
And if you go to linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe,

54:00.800 --> 54:02.720
you can just grab the episode automatically

54:02.720 --> 54:04.440
and don't have to worry about it.

54:04.440 --> 54:06.040
You can also go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com

54:06.040 --> 54:07.920
and check out the calendar if you forget

54:07.920 --> 54:09.120
just when that's happening.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.200
Well, really quickly, one last item on the agenda,

54:11.200 --> 54:13.800
it's that Dropbox quote unquote hack I've been using.

54:13.800 --> 54:16.320
I mean, ultimately, this is a temporary fix.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.800
In fact, big disclaimer here,

54:17.800 --> 54:19.400
I mean, this could potentially even lead to data loss.

54:19.400 --> 54:20.680
So don't do what Chris does, okay?

54:20.680 --> 54:21.520
Is that fair?

54:21.520 --> 54:22.480
Can we make that disclaimer?

54:22.480 --> 54:23.700
Don't do as Chris does.

54:23.700 --> 54:27.480
But I'm using the Dropbox file system fix project.

54:27.480 --> 54:30.760
And the thing I like about this is it lets you run Dropbox

54:30.760 --> 54:34.080
and any damn encryption or any damn file system you please.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.520
And I think that's what's important.

54:35.520 --> 54:39.320
It essentially fixes the file system detection

54:39.320 --> 54:42.240
in the Linux client to restore the sync capability.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.600
So bear in mind, it's doing some trickery here.

54:44.600 --> 54:46.040
And if they introduce something in the future

54:46.040 --> 54:48.560
to the Dropbox client, you could have some problems.

54:48.560 --> 54:52.080
Oh, yeah, as you might suspect, this is an LD preload trick.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.600
So you have to run make, you got to build yourself

54:54.600 --> 54:57.080
a little.so from the included C,

54:57.080 --> 54:59.080
and then it provides a separate Python script

54:59.080 --> 55:01.800
that will start Dropbox with the custom library.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.680
So it's making ext4 assumptions

55:03.680 --> 55:06.120
that aren't just what file system is this,

55:06.120 --> 55:07.080
there could be issues,

55:07.080 --> 55:08.760
but so far, it sounds like it's working for you.

55:08.760 --> 55:09.720
Yeah, it's been fine.

55:09.720 --> 55:11.000
And I did have to build it.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.160
And then I had to disable Dropbox from starting at startup.

55:14.160 --> 55:16.780
And then I essentially just created a new desktop launcher

55:16.780 --> 55:18.360
and added that to my startup items.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.960
So the Python script has kicked off that way.

55:19.960 --> 55:20.800
It's fine.

55:20.800 --> 55:21.620
It's been working good.

55:21.620 --> 55:23.640
It's been going for about half a week,

55:23.640 --> 55:25.720
survived a couple of reboots just fine.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.040
So I'll do this as I transition off.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.120
I might do what Wimpy did

55:29.120 --> 55:31.920
and might toss it on a headless box somewhere.

55:31.920 --> 55:34.400
And that'll be how I begin the transition to something else.

55:34.400 --> 55:37.120
A hacky solution to a problem we should never have had.

55:37.120 --> 55:38.360
Yeah, I've sent them my feedback.

55:38.360 --> 55:40.000
They know how I feel, Wes.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.440
So also a little plug here for the TechSnap show,

55:42.440 --> 55:44.280
the TechSnap.Systems, Wes Payne,

55:44.280 --> 55:47.360
and myself are doing a show over there

55:47.360 --> 55:48.920
that if you're in the IT field,

55:48.920 --> 55:50.000
if you are a sysadmin,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.340
if you work on servers or on the cloud

55:52.340 --> 55:54.780
and want somebody to commiserate with,

55:54.780 --> 55:59.080
hear about particular topics like WireGuard, eBPF,

55:59.080 --> 56:00.240
what's some other things we've done recently?

56:00.240 --> 56:02.000
Boy, we did, we had a great breakdown of the whole

56:02.000 --> 56:04.600
Spectre meltdown stuff when that came out.

56:04.600 --> 56:06.400
The show is just famous for doing the deep dives.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.180
And we're gearing it up to do even more.

56:08.180 --> 56:09.760
We'll have more details about that soon.

56:09.760 --> 56:11.200
So check out TechSnap.Systems

56:11.200 --> 56:12.920
because there's a lot of good stuff going on over there

56:12.920 --> 56:14.200
and even more coming.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.880
And then go check out the Gentleman Show,

56:16.880 --> 56:19.360
Ubuntu podcast, my favorite show

56:19.360 --> 56:20.480
that's not a Jupiter broadcasting show

56:20.480 --> 56:22.720
that's not late night Linux.

56:22.720 --> 56:23.560
Because I love all the-

56:23.560 --> 56:24.400
Careful, man, careful, man.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.560
I know, I have to be really careful.

56:25.560 --> 56:28.560
It's a little awkward, but I try.

56:28.560 --> 56:30.720
All of our brothers in arms.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.800
Go check that out at UbuntuPodcast.org

56:32.800 --> 56:34.560
and go check out Late Night Linux too

56:34.560 --> 56:36.160
because they're doing some great work over there.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.260
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode.

56:38.260 --> 56:40.520
You are always welcome to join us live,

56:40.520 --> 56:43.400
hang out in that mumble room, chat with Wes and I.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.600
Oh, please do.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.600
We miss you already.

56:45.600 --> 56:48.160
You get a little pre-show and you get a little post-show

56:48.160 --> 56:51.680
in the released version, but there's probably 30 times more

56:51.680 --> 56:52.520
than what actually gets released.

56:52.520 --> 56:54.400
And to be honest, we say all the best things

56:54.400 --> 56:55.600
when we're not in the release.

56:55.600 --> 56:57.600
Especially when I'm cursing about YouTube.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.920
Oh, it gets me so fired up.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.520
Anyways, that's all for this week.

57:00.520 --> 57:03.480
Check out all our links at linuxunplugged.com slash 277.

57:03.480 --> 57:04.560
I'm at Chris Elias.

57:04.560 --> 57:05.400
He's at Westpaint.

57:05.400 --> 57:06.320
Thank you for joining us.

57:06.320 --> 57:07.160
See you next Tuesday!

57:07.160 --> 57:28.160
I'm Chris Elias, and I'll see you next week.

57:37.160 --> 57:43.640
Hey, Unplugged Show.

57:43.640 --> 57:44.800
Oh, man.

57:44.800 --> 57:46.640
277.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.000
Rapidly approaching the 300.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.280
Oh, diggity-do.

57:50.280 --> 57:52.840
Wimpy, before you leave tonight, I have a problem

57:52.840 --> 57:54.640
and I want to know if you've experienced this.

57:54.640 --> 57:57.040
I think it might be because I went with the GPU dock.

57:57.040 --> 57:59.700
A little bit of real-time GPU dock follow-up.

57:59.700 --> 58:03.400
I've got a vertical monitor and a horizontal monitor

58:03.400 --> 58:05.540
at 2K resolution hooked up over DisplayPort,

58:05.540 --> 58:08.400
and ever since I've done that, my window performance

58:08.400 --> 58:10.160
has gone in the tank.

58:10.160 --> 58:13.040
Like, on my main laptop, the quote-unquote prime display,

58:13.040 --> 58:13.520
it's fine.

58:13.520 --> 58:14.440
It's butter smooth.

58:14.440 --> 58:17.400
But on the external monitors, it's choppy, it's laggy.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.160
Like, resizing Windows is jittery.

58:20.160 --> 58:22.280
Even my typing is sometimes stuttery.

58:22.280 --> 58:23.800
It's way worse than I expected.

58:23.800 --> 58:24.880
Have you had this problem?

58:24.880 --> 58:25.920
Is this a?

58:25.920 --> 58:28.000
I have not experienced that, no.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.520
Oh, it's got to be something with that multiple GPU

58:30.520 --> 58:31.880
setup then.

58:31.880 --> 58:33.880
I would think it's all using the NVIDIA

58:33.880 --> 58:36.800
because I can manage the panels with the NVIDIA Control Panel.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.340
So it's all going through the NVIDIA,

58:38.340 --> 58:40.480
and it should be able to handle three displays.

58:40.480 --> 58:42.960
Yeah, it should.

58:42.960 --> 58:46.240
I've only ever run two until recently, though.

58:46.240 --> 58:48.760
And obviously, the third display that I now have

58:48.760 --> 58:52.080
is a panel on the laptop.

58:52.080 --> 58:53.560
But no, I've not experienced that.

58:53.560 --> 58:56.400
I've only experienced that when I've moved a game off

58:56.400 --> 59:00.740
of the prime display into an IGP-powered display,

59:00.740 --> 59:02.440
and that's expected.

59:02.440 --> 59:07.480
But you've got one, and I also run both of mine landscape.

59:07.480 --> 59:10.640
I haven't done that mix of portrait and landscape.

59:10.640 --> 59:12.960
Yeah, and I've noticed 3D performance

59:12.960 --> 59:16.040
on the Prime main laptop display still seems perfectly fine.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.880
I can play a game and have those other displays

59:17.880 --> 59:19.920
with displaying stuff.

59:19.920 --> 59:21.040
And it's good enough.

59:21.040 --> 59:22.560
If I put things that's fairly static,

59:22.560 --> 59:24.960
like chats and even a YouTube video is fine.

59:24.960 --> 59:27.400
But if I want to resize a window or start typing it,

59:27.400 --> 59:29.120
sometimes just can't keep up.

59:29.120 --> 59:31.000
And I just don't understand what's going on.

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
I've wondered if it's a plasma problem, even.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
But I doubt it.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.560
But I've heard that there's issues with Plasma and NVIDIA

59:37.560 --> 59:39.160
doing multiple monitors.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.960
I'm not going to switch to GNOME over this,

59:40.960 --> 59:43.880
because like I said, it's butter smooth on the main display.

59:43.880 --> 59:46.320
And again, I can't speak to anything other than Mate,

59:46.320 --> 59:48.600
because that's the only desktop that I've used.

59:48.600 --> 59:49.760
I think we want to try it, though.

59:49.760 --> 59:51.800
Tell you what, it has made me think about doing a live disk

59:51.800 --> 59:52.560
and just seeing, does this?

59:52.560 --> 59:53.320
You probably should.

59:53.320 --> 59:55.040
I mean, that way is just fine.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.000
I'm not switching.

59:56.000 --> 59:56.680
And then what do I do?

59:56.680 --> 59:57.320
Get frustrated?

59:57.320 --> 59:58.880
We can tweak it from there.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.120
I mean, for science's sake.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.080
I got to know.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:30.800
All right, thanks, Wes.
