WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
I got a rumor you guys ready for a little for a little hardware rumor

00:04.440 --> 00:08.120
Totally I bet Pope he's not here because he knows and he doesn't want to get cornered on it

00:08.120 --> 00:14.420
But rumor has it that you may the you know, the big guy Chinese phone manufacturers plan to release a svelte

00:14.960 --> 00:16.960
laptop that runs Linux

00:17.520 --> 00:24.640
Manifest manufacturing sources speaking to the tiny site DigiTimes which has by the way a horrible track record just in my personal opinion

00:24.640 --> 00:31.920
says that the company is developing a 15-inch notebook with partners in the tech who also makes notebooks for HP Acer and Toshiba and

00:32.400 --> 00:36.920
Foxconn where the manufacturing happens for Apple's iPhones iPads and the PlayStation and

00:37.400 --> 00:43.780
Xbox and Nintendo the I'm a laptop or probably feature a high price performance ratio and the target retail price of around

00:44.240 --> 00:46.240
470 US greenbacks

00:47.320 --> 00:51.800
Yeah, I may make some good stuff. They're often known as an Apple ripoff. Are you familiar with their stuff?

00:51.800 --> 00:57.680
Yes, I've enviously looked at some of theirs. Yeah, I might achieve Android phone. That looks pretty this would be running not Android

00:57.680 --> 01:00.160
This would be running Linux. Yes, this would be even better

01:00.160 --> 01:03.280
Yeah, this would this would be full-on and you wouldn't have to worry about installing Linux

01:03.280 --> 01:08.000
I've never installed you know slash Linux because it would come pre-installed with it. That's awesome

01:08.000 --> 01:09.480
Yeah, now it could be a hoax though

01:09.480 --> 01:11.480
They have had it they have had a hoax in the past

01:11.680 --> 01:18.360
But I don't know anybody the mumbo-jumbo you guys would anybody check this out if you had a sub $500 nice looking laptop from Yao

01:18.360 --> 01:20.800
May now it's not gonna be like a super freedom respecting

01:20.800 --> 01:23.600
It's probably gonna be something that's more similar to a Chromebook

01:24.440 --> 01:29.320
Anybody in the mobile room jumping on it? I might give it a thought what distro is it going to be running?

01:29.320 --> 01:32.400
Well, the rumor is a custom version of Linux

01:35.040 --> 01:42.120
Yeah, exactly, but they say DigiTimes is not always as they point out on OMG Ubuntu not always that reliable I agree I

01:42.120 --> 01:50.560
Agree, but it could make sense. It could go into a nice lineup of products. So actually I

01:50.840 --> 01:52.920
Could see it. I could see this really happening

01:52.920 --> 01:53.520
You know

01:53.520 --> 01:59.360
It doesn't seem like a big jump if you're making cell phones to go into a portable laptop market that maybe includes a data chip

01:59.360 --> 02:04.720
A decent CPU you can install, you know, maybe your own version of Linux on there. This could be kind of a neat thing

02:04.720 --> 02:10.760
Exciting to see a new hardware manufacturer at least. Yeah, or you know what? Here's a way. I got another tip for you

02:10.760 --> 02:14.160
This is this is your pro tip. You ready for this? I got pro tips

02:15.360 --> 02:20.520
Actually, let me think about this. Maybe we should save this for the show because this is good. This is really good

02:20.520 --> 02:22.520
Maybe we'll save it in the show

02:22.520 --> 02:27.800
Now let's talk about it. Now. Let's talk about it right now. So did you guys see did you guys see that the Linux foundation?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.800
Is a giving away Chromebooks?

02:29.800 --> 02:35.560
The Linux foundation is giving away Chromebooks when you sign up for some classes. So here I'm gonna here

02:35.560 --> 02:41.080
Here's the detail. This is from from our buddy over at IT world a swamp swamp Lee. How do you how do you say his name?

02:41.080 --> 02:46.360
I met him at Linux con nice guy nice guy. He took a selfie with his huge nexus 6 and

02:46.920 --> 02:50.800
Now he's using an iPhone 5s as it to test Android where so Linux foundation is giving away

02:51.400 --> 02:54.840
Chromebooks when you enroll in a training course in the month of September

02:54.840 --> 02:59.720
What do you think about this the Linux foundation giving away Chromebooks? Interesting

03:00.520 --> 03:05.000
Well, that's a bummer. I've only just enrolled for a course in like the 30th of August

03:05.000 --> 03:09.320
Well, I wouldn't be does it make you uncomfortable to give me away Chromebooks as I seem perfectly fine

03:11.120 --> 03:13.120
Well, I'm not surprised because

03:13.680 --> 03:20.800
The course that I've enrolled for says that in order to do the course where you have to be running chromium or Google Chrome

03:20.800 --> 03:26.440
Oh, really? Oh, really? Huh? I at first my first gut reaction was like

03:26.440 --> 03:29.000
I wasn't super comfortable because this doesn't feel like real Linux

03:29.280 --> 03:33.800
But here's here's what made me sort of change my tune. I feel a little bit better when I read this

03:34.440 --> 03:38.360
Jim the Jim Zimlin. He's the executive director of the Linux foundation

03:38.360 --> 03:44.080
He said we want students of Linux to experience a Linux desktop and Chromebooks are a great way to do that

03:44.080 --> 03:48.560
Either through Google's Linux based OS or by investing in a Linux based OS

03:48.560 --> 03:53.240
Either through Google's Linux based OS or by installing one of the many Linux distros available

03:53.720 --> 03:58.360
Alright, that's not bad. He says we hope this offer can provide freedom

03:59.120 --> 04:06.040
The freedom Linux developers and IT professionals value and spark new ideas and discoveries as they embark on our Linux training program

04:06.040 --> 04:08.720
So he's right there saying in the announcement that they're pretty much

04:08.720 --> 04:13.240
Okay, if you'd wipe Chrome OS off there and put any Linux distro on there and that I'm all about and by the way

04:13.240 --> 04:18.040
They're not bad Chromebooks. They look like they're these these Dell Chromebooks that we've talked about in the past

04:18.040 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, the I don't the Dell Chromebook 11 the 299 Chromebook features one or probably an 11.6 inch display

04:25.640 --> 04:29.480
1.4 gigahertz processor and 4 gigabytes 4 gigabytes of RAM

04:30.120 --> 04:32.520
So there you go. That's not a bad giveaway

04:32.800 --> 04:36.560
No, it could be pretty fun for people get it to play with as they're learning Linux

04:36.560 --> 04:36.960
Yeah, absolutely

04:36.960 --> 04:42.240
That could be a great way for people to get their start and it's not a big investment for them to see that's actually really

04:42.240 --> 04:44.200
Clever because if it's not a huge expense

04:44.200 --> 04:48.280
Then maybe you're not so worried about trying out and seeing how things go and if things don't go well well

04:48.440 --> 04:50.000
It was a Chromebook you got for free

04:50.000 --> 04:52.860
You don't mind if you erase your hard drive a couple times while you're installing it

04:53.720 --> 04:57.400
This is Linux unplugged episode 108 for September 1st

04:58.480 --> 05:00.480
2015

05:00.480 --> 05:04.480
You

05:10.680 --> 05:15.600
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's learning how to dump its black tank. Oh

05:16.200 --> 05:21.480
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey Wes. Hey, guess what big show today, Wes

05:21.480 --> 05:27.240
I know I know surprise surprise surprise that so I had I had been I've been pondering this question

05:27.240 --> 05:31.920
I realized maybe I actually have the best group to possibly ask it to because I need to get an international

05:32.280 --> 05:35.600
perspective on this one, so we're gonna bring in our virtual lug on one of our

05:36.320 --> 05:43.160
Quandaries top law for enforcement officials in the US want backdoors into all types of encryption technology

05:43.160 --> 05:47.280
This is something that's been they've been debating since early in the year and it's picking up a lot of steam

05:48.080 --> 05:50.560
What would the ramifications be for open source?

05:50.560 --> 05:54.540
Especially code that's developed outside the US if the US were to make this the land of the law

05:54.540 --> 05:58.380
What responsibilities does open source have distro makers and things like that?

05:58.580 --> 06:03.780
So I want to talk about that and just pontificate on the subject also some details on the upcoming roadshow

06:04.220 --> 06:06.220
Kubuntu's new look and saying goodbye

06:06.860 --> 06:13.600
To an old friend plus we have some really awesome go powered retro feedback coming up in today's episode

06:14.420 --> 06:18.040
So since that's so much to get into no more delaying is is allowed

06:18.040 --> 06:25.360
I say we bring in that virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

06:26.460 --> 06:32.580
Hello, it's good. It's good to have you all here. Yes. Good evening. Hello all so let's start with a little follow-up

06:32.580 --> 06:35.680
I I know some of us may have seen that Kubuntu

06:36.260 --> 06:41.980
Has a brand new look they have a brand new look for a brand new well for a brand new season

06:41.980 --> 06:46.620
I guess it's fall after all it's becoming fall and I want West your first takes on Kubuntu

06:46.620 --> 06:52.020
Dot orgs brand new look one of the big stories today going around. What do you think nice and clean? Yeah?

06:52.020 --> 06:54.820
I don't like it. No. I like I think it represents plasma 5 pretty well

06:54.820 --> 07:00.020
Oh, yeah, it does actually front and center represents some really nice aspects of the haven't used it too much

07:00.020 --> 07:02.980
So the usability that's a separate question, but it's at least visually appealing

07:02.980 --> 07:09.260
Yeah, it really does kind of highlight some of the nice things like here's the productivity suite and the multimedia playback good point

07:09.260 --> 07:11.380
Yeah, it does draw a lot of us make me want to use Kubuntu

07:11.380 --> 07:14.900
And it does yeah, you know it's really nice

07:15.940 --> 07:21.180
Not in your face and like a yeah like a big windows way and like if you're wondering like how do I do media playback?

07:21.180 --> 07:23.220
They have a button right there that we show you that

07:24.060 --> 07:27.300
I've actually heard some grumbling about it, but when I look at it myself

07:28.020 --> 07:31.260
I'm pretty impressed. I like how they've broken out long-term

07:31.260 --> 07:35.620
They also make it really clear of here on which one is the latest instead of release on their download page

07:35.620 --> 07:39.580
And then the the page I haven't looked at yet is their community one. Oh, yeah, there we go

07:39.580 --> 07:42.620
They got a way they got a web chat set up right here. I don't know

07:42.620 --> 07:46.500
I think it's pretty nice anybody in the mumble room have any reactions the new kabuntu org

07:47.940 --> 07:49.940
It's okay. It's

07:50.300 --> 07:55.180
Like I'm on the full desktop, so I don't have windows full screen all the time

07:55.180 --> 08:00.300
So when it's not you got the when your browser like half the screen

08:00.300 --> 08:06.460
It's pretty much hamburger menu and icons are fairly large even on the 1080p desktop

08:06.460 --> 08:09.700
So I still think it needs some work

08:11.820 --> 08:17.740
Chai room thinks it should be kde.org. I kind of agree. This would be a great kde.org site. Yeah, definitely

08:18.340 --> 08:21.220
Should help out. Well, I just props to those guys

08:21.220 --> 08:24.940
It looks like a lot of work and effort went into that if anybody else has comments going once

08:24.940 --> 08:28.100
Oh, did you just shrink it down and see what he's saying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's not great

08:28.100 --> 08:31.540
They should work on their mobile design, but it does work though when you shrink it down at least

08:31.540 --> 08:34.120
I mean definitely I can grab the download right here. Yeah

08:34.120 --> 08:38.940
Well, it does look like they just bought a theme. So I mean looks like they'll need some tweaking after that

08:39.000 --> 08:41.280
Yeah, maybe that's the case. Maybe that's the case

08:41.280 --> 08:41.600
All right

08:41.600 --> 08:47.120
I I wanted to just note because we've been following this story and unplugged now for a little while another death in

08:47.520 --> 08:52.520
Flash is caught another nail and thought flashes death coffin. Is that is that the right turn of phrase?

08:52.520 --> 08:57.520
He'll in the coffin. Yep. Yeah, something like that. Something like is dying. That's important. Yeah, that is the important

08:57.520 --> 09:01.960
That is the thing to pull from that and I think this is a big one because Chrome is gonna block like those obnoxious

09:01.960 --> 09:06.320
Like flashing ads and then one of them in one of the next updates

09:06.320 --> 09:10.560
This is huge for us Linux users because this begins to finally die off

09:10.560 --> 09:16.760
And then what I'm looking forward to is eventually somebody's gonna have to come up with a really good solution for live streaming in HTML 5

09:17.200 --> 09:19.880
Hopefully this will put more pressure in that wouldn't be are you skeptical?

09:21.600 --> 09:28.480
Well, it was just that it was last week or the week before that there was this big brouhaha about Hulu

09:28.480 --> 09:33.480
Not that I can use it, but Hulu has switched to flash. Is that right?

09:35.800 --> 09:38.520
So Hulu switch to flash what were they before

09:40.880 --> 09:44.600
Did they switch or have they always been flashed but they were I saw a load

09:46.080 --> 09:48.080
Maybe from Silverlight or something, huh?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
Maybe maybe pardon there

09:51.720 --> 09:53.640
Yeah, and then

09:53.640 --> 09:55.640
over here

09:55.640 --> 09:58.320
I've got Amazon Prime

09:58.840 --> 10:04.720
Yeah, so prime I've now got access to prime music because that's just arrived a couple of weeks ago

10:05.000 --> 10:12.160
and prime instant video and the only way I can access those services on Linux is with with flash so

10:12.680 --> 10:15.480
There's still some sort of premium content

10:16.200 --> 10:21.960
Providers out there using flash. So I'm bring it where heralded heralding in flashes death

10:23.160 --> 10:24.720
prematurely

10:24.720 --> 10:29.840
To me, it's like the slow end of a distribution, right? We're getting there. I think eventually I

10:30.800 --> 10:32.800
Don't know about right now. I mean

10:34.600 --> 10:38.360
Yeah, you're right wimpy I think it's it's years off isn't it because

10:39.400 --> 10:40.520
hmm

10:40.520 --> 10:43.440
Yeah, cuz Google itself distributes quite a bit of ads over flash. I

10:44.120 --> 10:46.880
Flash is gonna end up dying the death of XP

10:48.840 --> 10:54.600
Yeah, is that is that we in the in the sense that like it gets relegated to like a whole bunch of people are still using

10:54.600 --> 10:56.480
It kind of thing or what do you mean there?

10:56.480 --> 11:00.720
Like just it drags on forever before it actually gets, you know put away

11:02.200 --> 11:06.440
The same sort of things where you need XP for that one piece of hardware. Yeah, but your business can't upgrade

11:06.440 --> 11:10.720
That's what happens to flash. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I could see it. Yeah, I don't actually I know I

11:11.400 --> 11:13.200
People you guys are such a bunch of pessimists

11:13.200 --> 11:17.640
I think this is actually starting to happen though to a degree and you guys are every charm is like, come on

11:17.640 --> 11:22.120
No, come on. This is act when you have auto pause happening you have I don't know

11:22.120 --> 11:26.120
I think this is actually people are starting to finally turn the tide. I think this is really happening plus

11:26.120 --> 11:31.160
I think at the same time this is happening where I think it's gonna be a big deal that well, maybe not

11:31.160 --> 11:37.400
We'll see but a lot of iOS devices starting in the fall are gonna automatically start blocking ads Safari on iOS 9 is coming

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
with a built-in ad blocker

11:39.620 --> 11:45.480
You combine that with the auto pausing of flash ads and online advertising is about to take a big hit. I

11:46.060 --> 11:48.480
Mean display ads. Yeah, definitely. That'll be interesting

11:48.480 --> 11:52.160
Do we know anything about how Google decides what the main content is versus?

11:52.520 --> 11:58.120
Well, yeah a little bit. So, you know what Google is doing is they're looking at ads that loop fast

11:58.120 --> 12:01.080
So if you have like a very short video play loop loop loop loop loop loop

12:01.080 --> 12:05.820
It'll it'll count that after a certain amount and then it will detect that and then pause it

12:06.360 --> 12:11.440
and you can go to advanced settings and select the content settings for privacy and then you can deselect and

12:12.080 --> 12:17.040
Say deselect and run important plug-in content or something like that is the wording. I can't quite remember it

12:17.040 --> 12:21.440
But yeah, got it. Oh here. I think they specified actually here's the link. I have it in the show notes

12:22.320 --> 12:29.160
Here it is from Google and they have some of the details and they also talk about how to convert your each year

12:29.160 --> 12:34.000
Oh, this is interesting. This is okay. So this here's the back end now and this is gonna work

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
So starting on September 1st, that's today

12:36.360 --> 12:38.480
Most flash ads uploaded to AdWords

12:38.480 --> 12:47.240
That's Google's ad platform are automatically going to be converted to HTML 5 to ensure your ads continue to show up on Google's display network very

12:47.240 --> 12:47.760
nice

12:47.760 --> 12:52.880
So that's so that's how Google's getting around the fact that so many of their ads are in flash is they're converting them to HTML

12:52.880 --> 12:55.680
I wonder they must just be breaking them out and then

12:56.640 --> 12:58.640
And then transcoding them if necessary

12:59.120 --> 13:00.960
Yeah, that's kind of interesting technology. Yeah

13:00.960 --> 13:06.720
Yeah, and then they give people instructions like to me perhaps it's not perfect though because they say you need to identify flash ads in

13:06.720 --> 13:11.320
Your content that aren't eligible for automatic conversion and then convert these and they give you steps to do that

13:12.160 --> 13:14.160
Yeah, so

13:14.880 --> 13:18.180
I think online advertising is about to

13:19.160 --> 13:23.280
For display ads is about to get a big shakeup. Yeah, what are they gonna do about that? I don't know

13:23.280 --> 13:26.420
That's a huge market. I think they ought to convert to podcast advertisers personally

13:30.640 --> 13:32.560
Yeah

13:32.560 --> 13:39.880
Yeah, well, yes, apparently there are HTML 5 to I mean so flash video for the most part is really just an h264 video

13:39.880 --> 13:44.280
And sometimes an mp3 audio stream wrapped up in an FLV container

13:44.280 --> 13:51.000
And then the flash player is simply just playing it like our live stream right now is an h264 stream and an mp3

13:51.000 --> 13:56.720
Audio stream that is then wrapped up in FLV and sent to the player that just happens to be a very good container for delivering

13:56.720 --> 13:58.080
live content

13:58.080 --> 14:03.880
If you have the technology you could have like for example, there is an open source tool out there called live streamer and live streamer

14:04.000 --> 14:08.920
Will break h264 and the audio stream out of the FLV container

14:08.920 --> 14:12.480
I'm probably butchering the real technicals of how this works, but this is layman understanding

14:12.480 --> 14:14.800
it'll break it out of the FLV container and

14:15.320 --> 14:21.120
Then repackage it up for you and display it on your Linux box without any need for flash and so you could take something like the live

14:21.120 --> 14:27.640
Streamer app and point it at the Jupiter broadcasting backup stream on ustream and it will pull it will break the stream out of

14:27.640 --> 14:31.280
It'll break the h264 video out and the mp3 video out and repackage it for you

14:31.840 --> 14:37.400
Automatically right now, so it's obviously possible because really all flash video is is h264 video with a flash container

14:37.580 --> 14:40.160
so that's why it's that's why it's not that hard, but it's it's

14:40.880 --> 14:44.720
Fascinating and this is on the verge of we were just kind of talking about in the pre-show

14:44.720 --> 14:50.440
But there's a bunch of industry people coming together to hopefully work on a non patent-encumbered video codec

14:50.440 --> 14:53.920
Oh, and I'm my hopes up, but that's happening at least we'll see yeah

14:53.920 --> 14:57.200
All right, so let's move on to something else and something

14:57.200 --> 14:59.400
I've been thinking a lot about right now is mobile data

14:59.400 --> 15:03.320
And I'm gonna tell you why in a little bit coming up on the show and so of course that gets me thinking about our

15:03.320 --> 15:07.640
Friends over at ting I'd like you to think about them to go to linux.ting.com and check them out

15:07.640 --> 15:13.080
It's mobile that makes sense ting is on a mission to change up mobile I say

15:13.960 --> 15:15.480
People follow ting for a while

15:15.480 --> 15:20.040
You've known that some of the things they've been pioneering have now been showing up in other ways and sort of a watered-down

15:20.160 --> 15:22.160
Fashion in the industry. It's kind of a

15:22.160 --> 15:24.460
A little disappointing that can't ever quite get it right

15:24.460 --> 15:28.480
But I guess that's kind of how it goes when you're an imitator ting is great because it's no contracts

15:28.480 --> 15:31.400
No early termination fees, and you only pay for what you use

15:31.400 --> 15:33.820
They just take your minutes your messages in your megabytes, and they add them up

15:33.820 --> 15:37.600
It's six dollars for the line, and then it's just your usage on top of that

15:37.600 --> 15:41.020
It's a really slick system and in fact if you go over to linux.ting.com

15:41.360 --> 15:46.800
You're gonna save fifty dollars off your first ting device or fifty dollars in ting service credit

15:46.800 --> 15:52.800
We have a special promo for the month of September to give you fifty dollars of service credit or off your first device and so

15:52.800 --> 15:54.920
You think about that you only paying for what you use well

15:54.920 --> 15:58.060
I my first month of ting service was less than twenty five dollars

15:58.060 --> 16:02.040
So you might be able to get a couple of months in there or do what I'm doing

16:02.040 --> 16:08.200
I'm picking up the ting netgear zing at least I think this is the one I'm gonna get my hands on this is a nice

16:08.760 --> 16:15.520
Wi-Fi hotspot that connects to the ting network has a nice LCD or I think it's OLED screen on it touchscreen

16:15.520 --> 16:18.960
So you can see your signal how many users you have connected your battery life

16:18.960 --> 16:22.440
And then you only pay for what you use so once you buy this and it's unlocked

16:23.160 --> 16:24.000
You own it

16:24.000 --> 16:28.960
It's just six dollars a month for the line and then your data usage and you can turn it on and off and and with a

16:28.960 --> 16:30.660
fifty dollar service credit

16:30.660 --> 16:34.520
Well, I mean you might be able to use this for a few months and not have to pay a dime

16:34.520 --> 16:38.680
And there's no contract after you're done. It's just a six dollar hotspot in your pocket go to a

16:38.680 --> 16:45.160
Linux dot ting comm get that discount also check out their savings calculator. See why ting is really really great

16:45.160 --> 16:48.120
They have a CDMA and GSM network. So I'm gonna be using it

16:48.120 --> 16:51.880
I'm gonna actually I'm hoping to end up with a CDMA and GSM ting device

16:52.040 --> 16:55.700
So that way wherever the signals the best that's the one I'll use for broadcasting on the road

16:55.720 --> 16:56.280
That's slick

16:56.280 --> 17:00.640
I'm still looking into all of that still but I think it's gonna be really great and if I ever have any troubles or if you

17:00.640 --> 17:02.680
Ever have any troubles ting has no hold customer service

17:02.680 --> 17:09.040
You can call them at 1 8 5 5 ting FTW anytime between 8 a.m. Or 8 p.m. East Coast and a real human answers the phone

17:09.040 --> 17:12.440
And they can actually solve your problems and if you're a small business

17:12.680 --> 17:17.600
Definitely definitely definitely look into ting because it is an incredible way to save money

17:18.400 --> 17:22.060
essentially, this has been verified by there's a couple of third parties if you have

17:23.000 --> 17:26.520
Guaranteed if you have between like 11 and 20 employees, you're probably gonna save on ting. It's almost guaranteed

17:26.520 --> 17:29.840
It's it's impossible not to and it goes from there too. It's because it's six dollars

17:29.840 --> 17:33.440
There's no early termination for you can move the phones around. It's easy to manage the lines

17:33.440 --> 17:36.320
You can turn them on and off you can add and remove devices with no penalties

17:36.320 --> 17:42.200
It's so slick and then all the features you'd expect like hotspot and tethering and caller ID and all that stuff with no crazy

17:42.520 --> 17:46.040
Mysterious line items it's and and a really easy to manage dashboard

17:46.040 --> 17:53.040
Go to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting ago get that $50 credit or $50 off a ting device and they have a they

17:53.040 --> 18:00.480
Have the whole range of devices GSM and CDMA linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged you guys rock

18:00.480 --> 18:03.380
That $50 promo is awesome

18:04.200 --> 18:08.120
Wanted to do a little follow-up from this Sunday's a Linux action show

18:08.120 --> 18:12.240
we talked about go TTY a way to share your your terminal as a web page and

18:13.360 --> 18:19.180
Halifax submitted his use of go TTY after that episode of Linux action. I thought that was so cool

18:19.180 --> 18:23.140
Because he said there's a there's you know a lot of different things you use with go TTY

18:23.140 --> 18:25.620
So I was delighted to see you guys covered it in the last episode

18:25.620 --> 18:31.040
I recently it's just about a week ago started experimenting with go TTY as a bridge between my telnet

18:31.580 --> 18:33.580
SSH BBS and the web and

18:34.020 --> 18:38.860
It's been pretty sweet the author was very responsive on his github page and walking me through a handful of issues

18:38.860 --> 18:44.480
I was having getting the font set up correctly so he has connected his freaking BBS to the web

18:44.480 --> 18:50.800
Using go TTY and if you're watching the video version right now. I'm I'm I'm amazed look at that. That's amazing

18:50.800 --> 18:54.940
It's awesome. That is that is incredible. We have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out

18:54.940 --> 18:57.920
But I love this as this is a super solid follow-up

18:57.920 --> 19:01.720
I thought to look at that so I'm gonna type in let's type in Chris LAS

19:02.060 --> 19:04.280
Chris LAS or maybe I should put new in there

19:05.480 --> 19:11.240
Create an account yes, okay, my username is gonna be Chris LAS my origin is Jupiter that seems like that should be good, right?

19:11.240 --> 19:18.160
Only my email. This is Chris at Jupiter broadcasting calm. That's a secret. Don't tell anybody that okay West and my password

19:18.880 --> 19:21.640
I better not I better not say what my password is

19:22.200 --> 19:30.000
Super secret JB password. Yeah, it's super super secret create account. Yes create account boom now. I I'm done now

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm in his BBS

19:32.360 --> 19:38.800
Using cheese, this is a really nice system look at this. Here's here's the bulletins. Here's rumors. Who's online who else is online right now?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.320
Let's take a look

19:40.320 --> 19:44.400
Just me just Chris LAS. Yeah, I'm a little lonely hmm. That's too bad

19:44.400 --> 19:48.280
This is slick though odd network org slash BBS if anybody else wants to get online

19:48.720 --> 19:53.440
Yeah, I I agree and so spacebar. Yeah, so everybody go go there. We go now

19:53.440 --> 19:55.880
We got somebody else on line. We got anonymous is logging in cool

19:56.240 --> 20:01.000
We're rocking his BBS and look it's moving around my screen because it's you know cuz I don't you cuz you had a CRT monitor

20:01.000 --> 20:04.320
Back in BBS that you see wouldn't want to burn in so every time you refresh. It's awesome

20:04.320 --> 20:06.800
I guess or maybe it's I'm not sure why it's moving around, but

20:06.800 --> 20:13.240
That is really cool. That is that is really great. Thank you Halifax for submitting that into the subreddit

20:13.240 --> 20:18.760
That is some awesome feedback and that going from flash. That's it. That's not flash at all right, so that's yeah

20:18.760 --> 20:20.760
That's a great. That's such a great use of

20:21.360 --> 20:23.440
HTML 5 I guess what you call it I suppose

20:24.040 --> 20:25.720
Okay, I want to talk about this story

20:25.720 --> 20:33.920
Just because I've been trying to contemplate in my head like how exactly would open source a deal if this actually happened

20:33.920 --> 20:39.000
so a couple of different really important people James Comey the director of the FBI and

20:39.160 --> 20:41.720
Admiral Mike Rogers the director of the NSA

20:42.760 --> 20:49.720
and are are both petitioning industry the technology industry specifically Silicon Valley and Congress as well and

20:50.200 --> 20:55.400
They've remained adamant that companies need to install government-friendly backdoors into their encryption products

20:55.400 --> 21:00.000
And I've played some clips quite a few clips actually on our own filter show about this

21:00.000 --> 21:04.560
But this continues to be a trend that legislators are actively considering

21:05.680 --> 21:07.440
because of threat of terrorism and

21:07.440 --> 21:12.240
They're worried that terrorists are using what's happened what not to communicate and so they want to have backdoors

21:12.240 --> 21:17.160
and I I could really care less if they work with Skype or what's apt or

21:17.320 --> 21:20.240
Instagram or Facebook to build in the backdoor that almost seems like a given

21:20.320 --> 21:25.360
But when I start thinking about what if it became a requirement that if this is a communications piece

21:25.360 --> 21:27.840
This is how the legislation is currently sort of being proposed

21:27.840 --> 21:31.580
Communications enabling technology has to have backdoors

21:31.640 --> 21:39.080
Well, there's a lot of things that fall under that category a lot of open source products and projects fall under communications enabling technology

21:39.080 --> 21:45.640
And so I'm I I don't really understand how if law is passed in the US that mandates this

21:46.040 --> 21:49.240
But software is created outside the US by open source developers

21:50.360 --> 21:52.360
how do we reconcile that difference and

21:52.360 --> 21:59.040
Does that software have to comply with the US law to be used in the US West

21:59.040 --> 22:00.640
Do you have any thoughts on the insights on this?

22:00.640 --> 22:02.720
I don't know, but it sounds very negative for I mean

22:02.720 --> 22:07.400
We've seen how much open source is important to business interest these sure and already you see

22:07.400 --> 22:14.440
You know some programs developed outside of the US open BSD comes to mind almost explicitly because they don't want things like this meddling with software

22:14.440 --> 22:18.600
So I don't think would be in our interest to have this. Yeah, I agree and of course

22:18.600 --> 22:23.740
Building and back doors by design is not as a silly as we've seen import restrictions exactly

22:23.740 --> 22:26.780
I wonder if it's to come across as import restrictions anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts as

22:27.340 --> 22:29.340
As we start to talk about this

22:31.340 --> 22:35.700
My first thought is no this should not exist in any way shape or form

22:36.260 --> 22:40.900
In the entire world because it's just gonna compromise everybody in the end

22:41.380 --> 22:44.460
Yeah building in basically making the product insecure by design

22:44.460 --> 22:51.020
My biggest beef on this one from an economic standpoint is don't they realize that this is going to kill

22:51.020 --> 22:53.780
US businesses. Yeah, exactly. I

22:54.580 --> 22:57.100
Also wonder how they think I mean it depends on if it's at the service level

22:57.100 --> 23:02.460
But if the NSA can use a back door into something owner why they're so you know if they're arrogant enough to think that the Chinese

23:02.460 --> 23:09.420
Intelligent service wouldn't be able to find such a back door. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, especially as we've seen that, you know

23:09.420 --> 23:14.620
Documentation and information can leak secrets get stolen and source code can be stolen

23:14.620 --> 23:18.620
And then once that gets out there then that then that any anybody that's implemented that product is compromised

23:19.340 --> 23:20.860
that's so that's a

23:20.860 --> 23:25.300
and it seems it seems like extremely dangerous seems like an extremely slippery slope because

23:25.860 --> 23:28.500
What I would worry about is it would force

23:29.340 --> 23:30.860
large

23:30.860 --> 23:38.060
Large companies that work with the government as contractors or the government itself to buy proprietary software and and not

23:38.060 --> 23:45.060
Longer be able to include an open-source option because they don't have these mandated requirements and they would just look at it as they are

23:45.060 --> 23:51.060
Not up to whatever the spec requirements are and they would just simply be disqualified on those grounds

23:51.060 --> 23:55.220
And so they would have to go to vendors like Oracle and Microsoft and Apple or whoever

23:55.740 --> 24:00.660
Cisco whoever instead of implementing an open-source solution because those open boards open-source solutions

24:00.660 --> 24:06.060
Can't be guaranteed to have that and they're not going to be bothered to patch it themselves or whatever. It's probably impractical, right?

24:06.060 --> 24:11.100
It's probably impractical right? They'll just get a bid from one of those companies and that'll be that. Yeah

24:11.100 --> 24:17.140
Oh, yeah, it just makes me really uncomfortable. I think about it and I was specifically I was specifically wimpy outside the US

24:17.140 --> 24:21.660
I'd be really curious what your thoughts are when we make changes like this and how we can mess with people outside the US

24:21.660 --> 24:23.660
Any insight there?

24:25.060 --> 24:27.340
The UK so in bed with the US that

24:28.220 --> 24:31.340
it's pretty much the same or similar legislation and

24:32.500 --> 24:34.300
activities end up being

24:34.300 --> 24:41.160
Adopted over here. So in fact Cameron himself has been making a lot of rumblings about about this very same issue at the same time

24:41.160 --> 24:45.740
Yes, yeah, it's very interesting that both sides of the pond are talking about the same thing at the same time

24:45.740 --> 24:47.920
There's obviously a push behind the scenes here for this

24:48.780 --> 24:51.900
And I mean not to say here and fry conspiracy bacon in a linux show

24:51.900 --> 24:55.700
But it seems pretty obvious on the face of it that they're all talking about at the same time

24:55.700 --> 24:58.620
and it seems like we're surrounded it really does and

24:58.620 --> 25:03.620
And and in the case where open source might be our salvation as users

25:03.620 --> 25:09.660
I feel like it could also that any companies that have to follow these standards and requirements any private companies or any government

25:11.140 --> 25:14.500
Departments they can't use open source. Just I don't like the way it's going

25:14.500 --> 25:15.780
So it's a good thing

25:15.780 --> 25:17.540
The good thing is is the battle isn't over yet

25:17.540 --> 25:21.500
And there's actually a lot of agencies in the government that are also taking opposite stances

25:21.740 --> 25:24.980
the I think the FCC just published something actually today saying that

25:24.980 --> 25:31.340
Solid encryption is is fundamental to protecting us commerce. Yeah, definitely so

25:32.500 --> 25:35.780
Obviously, there's a lot of different angles on this if you are curious about this topic at all

25:35.780 --> 25:39.220
It's something we've been following for for since about April

25:39.740 --> 25:45.540
Pretty pretty consistently in the unfiltered show and you can check out some of our episodes on that

25:47.100 --> 25:48.380
I've played some clips

25:48.380 --> 25:53.660
I think I oh I did actually in the show notes to if you really actually are really concerned about this and I kind of

25:53.660 --> 25:59.460
Would I like to believe that some of you out there actually are even if I even if it's just a fantasy if not us

25:59.460 --> 26:03.700
Then yeah, I linked in the show notes a hearing back in

26:04.300 --> 26:08.420
Jeez, where was it? I'm looking for it right now. It was a hearing back in April

26:08.420 --> 26:14.780
I think about about this topic and about about all of this and it's a very long boring C-Span capture

26:15.180 --> 26:20.060
but it covers the reasons why they want this and how they want it done and it's

26:20.060 --> 26:26.660
They're really working on it. And I just I always I always curious when one when one major nation makes a big decision like that

26:26.660 --> 26:31.700
How it impacts Linux and open source, maybe the audience has some insights on this to Linux action show dot reddit.com and look for episode

26:31.940 --> 26:33.540
108

26:33.540 --> 26:35.540
Raymond in there a ramen in general

26:35.540 --> 26:40.820
Hammons in the chat room says if it went through wouldn't that mean that fedora and Debbie et cetera would stop shipping security software as

26:40.820 --> 26:45.660
Non-free on the same grounds as things like patent encumbered codecs. That's exactly what I was thinking, too. Is

26:46.700 --> 26:49.580
It all of a sudden. Yeah, I mean, yeah

26:49.580 --> 26:55.540
Cuz the fedora projects and Debian project isn't gonna want to ship stuff that's compromised by design, right? No, it doesn't protect the user. Oh

26:56.500 --> 26:58.620
Boy, you see what a slippery slope this could be

26:58.860 --> 27:01.780
This is something I've been thinking about it just don't I don't quite have an answer to it

27:01.780 --> 27:06.660
And maybe we're overthinking it, but I don't think so. I think it's something that the kids and what are your thoughts? I

27:08.100 --> 27:11.800
Think that the rest of world is smarter. I don't think they'll go along with it

27:11.800 --> 27:15.460
I mean the US could only go so far with with bullying and with

27:15.460 --> 27:20.780
Legislation before the rest of world just says stop it. You're only 5% of the population

27:20.780 --> 27:25.300
You don't get to dictate what they rest in 95% of the world does. Oh

27:26.780 --> 27:28.340
Maybe

27:28.340 --> 27:33.580
Yeah, maybe but a lot of the industry and influences is where they where they're making those decisions right now

27:33.580 --> 27:37.540
So this is probably for their point of time the time to do it. Well, they still have that position

27:38.980 --> 27:42.700
Well, I don't know this is let's let's move on let's this kind of got us down, isn't it?

27:42.700 --> 27:46.060
I'm a little depressing. I'm sorry. I don't want to be I don't yeah, I agree

27:46.060 --> 27:50.580
It is it is very and the value of this is negative. No more with that. So no more with this

27:50.580 --> 27:54.500
Let's actually move on to something. I'm really crazy super excited about I want to talk about

27:54.980 --> 27:58.140
The the road show that we're gonna be doing here in just a little bit

27:58.540 --> 28:02.780
But first, why don't we pick it up? Let's pick up the pace. Let's talk about something that makes me excited

28:02.780 --> 28:04.240
Let's talk about digital ocean

28:04.240 --> 28:08.560
Let's talk about our friends at digital ocean just for a second because you could go over there and create something that makes you feel

28:08.560 --> 28:13.100
Good doesn't make me think about James Comey or Admiral Rogers or whatever

28:13.100 --> 28:17.860
It makes me think about creating Linux servers on-demand because digital ocean is dedicated to offering the most

28:18.060 --> 28:20.300
Simple and intuitive way for you to do that

28:20.300 --> 28:24.980
If you use the promo code do unplugged you get a $10 credit you can get started in less than 55 seconds

28:24.980 --> 28:31.700
You get a machine with 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer for $5 a month

28:31.700 --> 28:35.820
And if you use our promo code do unplugged you get the $10 credit try that $5 rig for two months

28:35.820 --> 28:41.660
It's pretty nice and digital ocean is data some locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam London and a nice one

28:41.660 --> 28:44.420
I mean a really they're all nice, but a really brand new one in Germany

28:44.420 --> 28:49.440
I say that because I drool a drool at the pictures they post online and I love digital oceans interface

28:49.440 --> 28:53.140
It's simple. It's intuitive and you can replicate it on a larger scale with their API

28:53.820 --> 28:56.860
Go over digital ocean just play around with them a little bit create some machines

28:57.060 --> 29:02.540
Destroy some machines update some software feel like a boss and use the promo code you unplugged you can do it all for free

29:02.540 --> 29:06.620
And while you're there, why not follow one of their great tutorials? They're posting new ones all the time

29:06.620 --> 29:11.780
Like here's one that just went up how to automate installing WordPress on Ubuntu 1404 using ansible

29:12.420 --> 29:16.080
how to set up Apache virtual hosts on Ubuntu 1404 now that is

29:16.700 --> 29:19.420
You know every time you do it you get better and better at it

29:19.420 --> 29:22.180
But if you only done it a couple of times boy, this is a really great guy

29:22.180 --> 29:25.740
first of all, a 1404 LTS is a great machine to deploy Apache on and

29:26.260 --> 29:31.540
This is super super nice. It's all the steps you need and it's been gone. It's gone through by technical editor

29:31.540 --> 29:37.700
Look at this. I mean, I'm sorry Arch wiki, but this is this they're quickly becoming like, you know

29:37.700 --> 29:40.860
Go to place. Look at this. This is I mean, you know what?

29:40.860 --> 29:43.860
The thing is is this is just like scratching the surface. They have tons of them

29:44.260 --> 29:47.020
So not only do they have all of these great tutorials

29:47.020 --> 29:52.820
But they also have one click deployment of many many applications that you might want to install ghost WordPress Ruby on rails

29:53.220 --> 29:56.700
Git lab, I mean the list goes on and on in fact, there's we have wave way more now

29:56.740 --> 30:01.500
So just use the promo code do you unplug it a $10 credit and you know speaking of the road trip when I'm on the road?

30:01.500 --> 30:06.100
You know, you know, I'm gonna be using digital ocean and move stuff around bounce our live signal off of it

30:06.260 --> 30:09.020
Did you lotion calm you can get started right now do unplug?

30:09.020 --> 30:12.740
They also have core OS and go check that shenanigans out. It's a pretty cool system

30:12.740 --> 30:18.200
They get updates right from the upstream distro digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplugged big

30:18.200 --> 30:21.200
Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

30:21.460 --> 30:25.680
So I've been trying to come up with a name for the road show. So Wes Eubanks current on the shows

30:25.860 --> 30:29.580
I'm impressed. I just watched the latest last this morning

30:29.580 --> 30:31.580
Look at you. I doing your homework for you

30:32.340 --> 30:35.420
You were you weren't we honeymooning or moving last week?

30:35.420 --> 30:38.780
I can't remember is I get them all mixed up kind of both got back from my honeymoon and

30:38.940 --> 30:40.940
Then I had to move out of my previous house

30:43.500 --> 30:49.460
So you get married then and then you and then you go on a honeymoon and then you move like all like back to back

30:49.460 --> 30:54.980
To back. Oh, yeah, why didn't you I mean, I mean, I'm not why didn't you either schedule the move or the marriage?

30:54.980 --> 31:01.860
Further apart probably should have there was some yeah, let's just say operational constraints. Okay. I'm very familiar with that

31:01.860 --> 31:06.580
No, I'll be more stable. I understand. I'm very familiar with operational constraints. Let me tell you

31:07.300 --> 31:12.660
Yeah, yeah, that's my world these days. So this road show so I guess I don't have to fully update you

31:12.660 --> 31:15.740
You're pretty current. I'd like to hear it from okay. Oh, well, all right

31:15.740 --> 31:19.180
So well, I'll give you I'll give that I'll get everybody super up-to-date on where we're at

31:19.180 --> 31:22.980
So right now I am planning to go on the road and this is all

31:22.980 --> 31:30.500
Semi lockdown but also as anything that's production-oriented could change at the last minute. So I make that disclaimer, but right now

31:31.380 --> 31:33.820
tentatively planning to get on the road September 19th and

31:35.020 --> 31:38.100
and and and and make the drive from

31:38.580 --> 31:41.220
Everett Washington to Grand Forks, North Dakota

31:41.820 --> 31:47.860
Taking us to know it tells me that we can leave from Everett Washington and make it to his house without taking more than like

31:47.860 --> 31:52.340
Four or five turns off of us to now we're going to but wow, that's a pretty cool concept

31:52.340 --> 31:57.580
So we're gonna see if it's we're gonna that was the basic core concept we get there and then we've committed to doing a last

31:57.580 --> 32:00.980
Cribs edition where I want to go through and tour Noah's house

32:00.980 --> 32:03.940
No, that's a Google glass and take some video of how he automates his house

32:04.700 --> 32:07.700
See if I can find it where he's snuck in some windows or max

32:08.220 --> 32:10.220
Wouldn't that be something? Yes

32:11.180 --> 32:16.620
Scandal exactly and then but the idea is the journey between Everett and Grand Forks, North Dakota

32:18.020 --> 32:21.940
That itself is going to be content. We're going to be recording along the way

32:21.940 --> 32:26.020
We're gonna be trying to produce shows along the way doing meetups along us, too

32:26.620 --> 32:32.300
Between Everett and Grand Forks and starting in Spokane with I'm a con and crew if anybody wants to meet up at that

32:32.300 --> 32:36.620
I'm a come put the brewery in there again, if you would add the roaming penguin. Yeah, that's oh, that's a good name

32:36.620 --> 32:40.260
Yeah, so we're kind of we're trying to come up with a name for the road trip because I should back up

32:40.820 --> 32:42.820
I'm very excited. I'm very excited

32:43.260 --> 32:45.980
So that was the core concept. We started with

32:46.700 --> 32:50.060
months ago when I mean months and months ago when we had a goal on patreon and

32:50.060 --> 32:51.980
And

32:51.980 --> 32:55.580
So we've been trying to figure out how to really do this in a way that's sustainable and

32:55.820 --> 33:02.300
My initial thought was in order to continue to do shows so the shows can continue. I should rent an RV

33:02.940 --> 33:05.860
Because it would be madness to buy an RV just crazy

33:05.860 --> 33:08.380
That would be what the hell am I gonna do with an RV?

33:08.380 --> 33:13.300
So I will rent an RV and it turns out that's like a lot of money

33:13.300 --> 33:16.420
Like I don't normally really sit there and budget and plan things out

33:16.420 --> 33:22.100
It's not my style, but in this one particular case like Noah was here and we had the crew we had the whole crew here

33:22.100 --> 33:26.460
We all we were going down or broke down all the numbers and we looked at it. It's like it's gonna cost us

33:27.180 --> 33:31.620
Over six thousand dollars just to rent an RV to do this road trip Wow. Yeah

33:32.260 --> 33:37.860
and so because they also have to pay for like like 38 cents a mile for gas and stuff like that, so it's very expensive and

33:38.700 --> 33:41.580
that was like, oh, I totally took the wind out of the sails and

33:41.580 --> 33:48.540
Then I started the search process just to see what it would cost to just get a lightweight trailer to pull with my truck

33:48.540 --> 33:50.300
that I have already and

33:50.300 --> 33:52.220
Like I looked at like teardrop

33:52.220 --> 33:56.420
units and because you know, I'm telling you price range is low here because we don't have a lot to work with and

33:56.820 --> 33:59.020
I found a unit that

33:59.860 --> 34:04.140
Folks were selling because the owner was having some health issues and he only taken on three trips

34:04.140 --> 34:08.300
he did twice down to California once to the Oregon coast and they live here in Washington and

34:08.300 --> 34:09.980
I

34:09.980 --> 34:14.340
Go through it's a 25-foot trailer and it was just about right, you know, it's not quite like

34:14.860 --> 34:19.140
like like an Airstream or something like that, but it's still it's a it's a fine trailer and

34:20.260 --> 34:25.060
The deal was all getting finalized and I was about ready to like I thought maybe we could even do a show out of it

34:25.060 --> 34:29.700
But the gentleman selling to me had a heart attack last week. Oh, that's terrible. Yeah, it's awful

34:29.700 --> 34:35.020
It's awful. And so it completely derailed the deal for a couple of days, but more important things on their mind

34:35.020 --> 34:39.180
Yeah, sure. So we managed but things are picking back up this week. So that's good

34:39.660 --> 34:44.100
So I managed to get a fantastic deal because they needed to get rid of this RV pretty bad

34:44.100 --> 34:49.300
And so I got a fantastic deal on a trailer that I'm gonna load up on September 19th

34:49.420 --> 34:53.940
ideally and hit the road and then meet up with people along the way do broadcasts and

34:54.860 --> 35:00.300
We'll see where I have connectivity and I don't yeah, and I'm gonna take it over the Stevens Pass

35:00.580 --> 35:04.020
I've never pulled a trailer over Stevens Pass. I don't have an engine break

35:04.020 --> 35:07.940
But I'm gonna take it over the pass. It should be fine

35:07.940 --> 35:09.380
And yeah

35:09.380 --> 35:13.740
And and meet up with people and I on the other side and I'm really really looking forward to it

35:13.740 --> 35:18.380
And so this so a zero con 34 had a couple ideas to name the road show

35:18.380 --> 35:20.340
I'm trying to come up with a good name for this road

35:20.340 --> 35:25.580
So we're gonna be doing you know many of the shows from the road including last and unplugged and so he wrote says Chris mentioned

35:25.580 --> 35:27.940
He was looking for a silly name for the new mobile studio in his RV

35:27.940 --> 35:31.420
And he says here was an idea for the show name the whole enchilada show

35:31.420 --> 35:35.700
a whole enchilada show I don't know about that one the other suggestions that

35:36.220 --> 35:42.580
Other suggestions came in the mobile oriented broadcast and Linux entertainment, which the acronym without for that would be mobile

35:42.900 --> 35:46.740
That's pretty clever good JB tube was is not is also available

35:47.300 --> 35:53.700
The the free bird I like that that's not bad actually at the free bird the roaming penguin again comes up

35:54.220 --> 35:59.820
So anyways that mummer if you guys have any ideas from what we should name the road trip the Linux action show road show

35:59.820 --> 36:02.420
That's not bad Chatham's throwing some at us right now shuttle pod 5. I

36:03.540 --> 36:05.540
Don't know why I like that what I do

36:05.700 --> 36:09.020
That's pretty good too free birds not bad, and it's a JCO trailer, too

36:09.020 --> 36:12.820
So it has birds on it already, and we could put a penguin on there. Oh, yeah, I get the J

36:12.820 --> 36:14.940
I like the free bird. I'm gonna write that one down. I'm writing that down

36:15.540 --> 36:21.180
We've got a couple of votes for free bird. That's not bad. He's actually writing it on paper guys. Yeah, I stressingly old-school

36:21.180 --> 36:25.120
Yeah, that's actually how I commit things to memory. I find if I actually write them down

36:25.120 --> 36:31.220
So I don't know exactly how we're gonna do this. We're gonna try to power the broadcast from the rig using Linux

36:31.220 --> 36:35.060
Oh, this is exciting. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna try to actually make everything DC powered, too

36:35.060 --> 36:39.940
Which should be an interesting challenge, so we'll have a couple a couple of Linux laptops

36:40.500 --> 36:43.780
Probably one of them running nice cast or ice cast or whatever

36:44.380 --> 36:47.460
But there's actually a problem called, but I mean there's a lot of different ones we could use

36:47.980 --> 36:48.940
That well, I don't know

36:48.940 --> 36:54.500
We're gonna use something to send a signal back and Skype and and then we're gonna do local recording so with audio quality should be pretty

36:54.500 --> 36:58.260
Good, so it shouldn't shouldn't be that bad unless there's a bunch of background noise or something like that

36:58.260 --> 37:04.780
And I wonder if I wonder if it's this real stretch goal of mine would be to be actually able to broadcast

37:05.140 --> 37:07.020
While the rig is moving. Oh, that would be amazing

37:07.020 --> 37:09.700
I don't know where that'd be possible that I have to make sure I have really good signal

37:09.700 --> 37:13.260
But I think it'd be amazing to a show while the moosh while the rigs actually going down the road live stream

37:13.260 --> 37:18.100
You just quietly drive for hours. No, I wouldn't be driving doing show at the same time. That's way too distracting

37:18.100 --> 37:25.420
so if you would like to help out with our effort, I would more than appreciate that because I'm the the wish list is

37:25.620 --> 37:29.900
Posted and the list is long right now the big thing the big thing that I'm really thinking

37:29.900 --> 37:33.540
I'm probably not gonna be able to purchase and so if somebody out there is in a position to be able to afford it is

37:33.540 --> 37:34.580
the

37:34.580 --> 37:38.580
Cell phone booster kit which boosts all 4g LTE signals

37:38.580 --> 37:43.300
Oh really from all the networks you press you put an antenna up on a metal plate on top of the

37:43.300 --> 37:49.940
Traylor and then it has a plate that it connects to inside the rig and then it rebroadcast all LTE signals

37:49.940 --> 37:52.900
So some people in the reviews I've read say maybe if you have one bar

37:53.020 --> 37:55.020
This thing will transform it into four bars

37:55.220 --> 37:58.380
And I'm thinking that's the difference between doing a show and not doing a show

37:58.460 --> 37:59.140
however

37:59.140 --> 38:01.140
the problem is it's 380 bucks and

38:01.500 --> 38:03.820
The installation is probably gonna be another 400 bucks

38:03.820 --> 38:09.340
Which just paying for the installation loans about all I can afford right plus I'm getting other things installed on the rig as well and getting

38:09.340 --> 38:10.780
some things removed

38:10.780 --> 38:15.460
That would be one that it could make the difference between being able to do show and not be able to do a show and it's

38:15.460 --> 38:17.020
One that I don't think I can buy

38:17.020 --> 38:21.020
So that would be high on my list if somebody could afford that we have the wish list linked in the show notes

38:21.020 --> 38:22.900
There's also other things on there like

38:22.900 --> 38:27.300
Everything like toilet paper. I mean anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated because tomorrow

38:27.300 --> 38:29.580
I'm taking the truck in and I'm getting it sort of ready

38:29.700 --> 38:32.860
You know there's a lot of small things on your vehicle when you drive five ten miles a day

38:32.860 --> 38:36.060
You don't really care that it's out of alignment or the tires need rotation

38:36.060 --> 38:43.460
or that you're a 1500 miles over on your oil or that your mirror is shaking or that your e-brake hasn't worked for three years or

38:43.940 --> 38:47.420
The niceties you know or that you've never had your cooling system flush

38:47.420 --> 38:52.260
You don't care about these things when you're just driving five ten miles a day, but then we're gonna be towing a

38:52.980 --> 38:54.660
25-foot trailer

38:54.660 --> 38:56.020
3,000 miles

38:56.020 --> 38:58.860
Plus then these are things you need to look into so tomorrow

38:58.860 --> 39:01.260
I'm taking the truck in and getting all that work done on it

39:01.260 --> 39:05.700
Which pretty much soaks up pretty much any all the free spending yeah, yeah, so if anybody does want to help out

39:05.700 --> 39:08.980
We have the wish link linked in the show notes and as I go along

39:08.980 --> 39:11.140
I'll be posting videos and things like that, too

39:11.140 --> 39:14.020
So hopefully it's gonna be a ton of fun, and if something blows up in my face

39:14.020 --> 39:16.620
I plan to record that too. I'm not just gonna repost the good stuff. Oh

39:17.020 --> 39:19.860
Yeah, yeah, if I end up with a flat on the side of the road

39:20.220 --> 39:24.060
I'm gonna turn it into content. I am bound to determine to make the best out of it

39:24.060 --> 39:27.180
It's all you'll be doing while you wait for the tow truck. Yeah, yeah, and so I don't know

39:27.180 --> 39:31.060
I'll have the mumble room with me or Wes potentially you could be here in studio

39:31.060 --> 39:32.520
And I could be you know you'd be here

39:32.520 --> 39:36.660
Maybe jumping and getting them pulling the mumble room in because the show's got to go on I'd love to help that'd be great

39:36.660 --> 39:40.780
So you so and then we'll still have somebody local in studio when I'm out on the road

39:41.540 --> 39:45.260
Somebody says get triple-a. That's probably not a bad idea there. I should look into the cost triple-a

39:45.700 --> 39:47.860
Yeah, maybe you can do it for just a month or whatever yeah

39:47.860 --> 39:52.060
I'm like I wonder if they have like a limited thing and I'm getting insurance too for the trailer

39:52.060 --> 39:57.360
They're these business things you have to do for a road trip anybody in the mumble room have an RV

39:57.360 --> 40:03.440
I'm screwed. I got nobody get advice from I'm all out on my own on this

40:03.440 --> 40:08.600
I've been watching YouTube videos and reading how to's and I think I actually might have made a good move not ending up with an

40:08.600 --> 40:12.680
Airstream, maybe I was reading about wireless signals and getting wireless in and out of oh

40:12.680 --> 40:15.640
it looks like those airstreams sometimes are a little difficult on that and

40:16.480 --> 40:17.960
Also also

40:17.960 --> 40:22.960
I'm like pre marking down like areas along us to where I think I can might be able to get Wi-Fi if there's no cellular

40:22.960 --> 40:26.300
Signal and I got an email from somebody's like hey Chris. Why don't we meet up here?

40:26.300 --> 40:28.600
This is probably your last best place to get good internet in Montana

40:28.600 --> 40:33.520
And I'm looking at the map, and it's like way way way way way way way east

40:34.600 --> 40:37.320
All right way west on Montana, so it's way early in the trip

40:37.320 --> 40:40.280
And I'm looking at going you mean I don't have good internet for like the rest of Montana

40:40.280 --> 40:42.280
I'm gonna go crazy space. I'm gonna go crazy

40:42.840 --> 40:49.560
So I probably download those coverage maps before you leave yeah, yeah, yeah, I wouldn't picture any Wi-Fi signal either coming out of there

40:49.560 --> 40:52.800
So yeah there you go. I'm pretty excited. That's the latest try to think there's any other up

40:52.800 --> 40:56.680
Yeah, so I'm gonna be posting more videos to our patrons to that for people to check that out

40:56.680 --> 41:01.320
But it doesn't be an interesting challenge a live mobile Linux power broadcast

41:02.320 --> 41:05.520
And I don't know there's anybody else done that. I don't know of anyone

41:06.320 --> 41:11.160
Is this first is this first? I don't know it could be a first. You should probably just start calling it

41:16.040 --> 41:20.520
Actually that's what I was thinking token rings is in the chat room said it might do me some good to disconnect from time to

41:20.520 --> 41:21.880
time

41:21.880 --> 41:23.880
Yeah, especially in the mountains and

41:23.960 --> 41:29.640
Yeah, like a glacier National Park and stuff. Yeah, I know Darren. I know I'm not saying it's the first mobile Roadshow

41:29.640 --> 41:31.280
I'm saying I think it's the first

41:31.280 --> 41:36.320
Linux powered Linux powered mobile Roadshow that's the important part. I think so

41:36.320 --> 41:41.120
I think that's it's the first Linux powered mobile Roadshow. Oh, and you know what speaking of the wish list I

41:41.800 --> 41:47.280
Almost moved on and completely forgot to mention this the first item off the wish list did arrive because I mentioned it on last

41:47.280 --> 41:54.360
On Sunday and it came from Noah and it is the black tank empty kit, which is the poop hose

41:54.360 --> 41:58.480
so this is the poop hose I'll be using on the road trip to empty the

41:58.960 --> 42:03.120
Piss and poo from the RV and Noah got it from me off the wish list. Isn't that great?

42:03.200 --> 42:09.120
So that was his special contribution right there to the road trip. No, I'm that's not his only contribution, but he got me a nice 15 foot

42:10.960 --> 42:15.380
Was it rhino flex sewer kit rhino flex sewer kit and

42:15.380 --> 42:19.820
Do you know why you want a clear swivel connector right there?

42:19.820 --> 42:22.980
I do not so that way when you flush out your black tank

42:22.980 --> 42:27.940
You can see the water turn from brown to clear. Oh, so, you know, you know, it's clear, you know, it's clean

42:27.940 --> 42:31.060
I think this means you might not be welcome to use Noah's bathroom when you get there

42:32.340 --> 42:38.660
You think that's some subtle? Yeah, maybe you're probably right. Yeah. Well, you know, it's funny is I liked it

42:38.660 --> 42:42.500
Cuz this was Noah's real nice way of saying you're not welcome to stay at the house as you said to me

42:42.500 --> 42:44.500
He's like have all the facilities. He's like hey, man

42:44.500 --> 42:49.140
So would you just prefer that I just arrange a hotel for you and when you get here and I'm like, right?

42:49.140 --> 42:51.620
They're like I was planning to stay in the RV. He's like, oh, okay

42:51.620 --> 42:53.940
I think he was just trying to make sure I wasn't planning to stay in the house

42:53.940 --> 42:57.100
Right, like you can come in and do the last Cribs tour, but you can't stay in the house

42:57.100 --> 43:02.500
That's what I please mark a mile away from the property. Yeah, give us a good 15 minutes notice before you come over

43:02.860 --> 43:07.700
yeah, we'll see I and and then if something really dramatically goes wrong and

43:08.420 --> 43:11.420
Like I don't I can't do any I can't get any connectivity

43:11.420 --> 43:17.980
So like like I can't show up for unplugged or something like that Noah's offered to stand in and do the broadcast from his studio

43:18.380 --> 43:20.620
using OBS and Linux and

43:21.140 --> 43:27.300
Probably Skype to do the shows so he can stand in as an emergency host if for some reason on the road trip

43:27.300 --> 43:31.180
I'm completely unavailable which means I'll allow myself also to just if that happens

43:31.180 --> 43:33.900
I'll just take the day off and let Noah handle it which is

43:34.300 --> 43:36.300
which I think would be really nice and then like

43:36.300 --> 43:43.420
For tech snap we're pre-recording because Alan's going to be traveling of course so we're not even gonna be doing tech snap on the weeks

43:43.420 --> 43:47.740
That I'm gonna be gone anyways, so that shows taken care of so it's really a perfect time. It's just all working out

43:47.740 --> 43:48.780
I'm looking forward to it

43:48.780 --> 43:52.900
I'm really looking forward to it, but we could use your help if anybody does want to help us out

43:52.900 --> 43:56.620
I'll have a link in the show notes, so I have I

43:57.260 --> 43:59.260
Want to say goodbye to an old friend?

43:59.260 --> 44:06.780
I maybe I don't know. I don't know if software has a has a sex or a gender, but oh just pot

44:07.460 --> 44:11.180
pot-kettle I just suggested the fecal matters of Chris lass as as

44:12.100 --> 44:14.100
No, no that is not a title suggestion

44:14.420 --> 44:19.900
Okay, so we have an old friend to say goodbye to somebody who's brought us through good times and bad times somebody who's really brought

44:19.900 --> 44:21.460
us up

It's because there's smart people out there smart people. I love you guys. Alright, so let's talk about our old friend

46:41.220 --> 46:43.220
You guys probably saw the news

46:43.260 --> 46:44.740
Lilo is

46:44.740 --> 46:46.100
going to

46:46.100 --> 46:48.100
cease development on

46:48.540 --> 46:49.740
December

46:49.740 --> 46:54.540
Lilo comes to an end the old Linux loader the development of Lido Lilo as a classic bootloader

46:55.340 --> 46:56.900
was restarted in

46:56.900 --> 47:01.820
2010 Lilo has some advantages because it's super simple and a lot of people liked it over grub and grub 2

47:02.020 --> 47:08.260
But the developer says that because of limitations with butter fs GPT partition tables and even rate itself

47:08.260 --> 47:11.700
He's kind of done. If someone wants to develop this further

47:12.620 --> 47:14.620
He's willing to take submissions

47:15.380 --> 47:20.740
Bye bye Lilo. What do you think Wes? What's uh, are you sad when things like this happen, you know?

47:20.740 --> 47:22.740
It definitely had its place in history

47:22.860 --> 47:28.780
Personally, I've never relied on it, you know between grub and sis Linux and now you know EFI does it itself?

47:28.780 --> 47:32.820
I actually think it's good thing. Yeah, I think so too. I mean we only need so many solutions

47:32.820 --> 47:36.480
It's good to have more than one. Yeah, and this is the natural cycle of software something gets created

47:36.480 --> 47:41.940
It's useful for a long time something new comes along and we make room for the for the new stuff and this service purpose

47:41.940 --> 47:46.340
So well and because the codes open it never goes fully away. Yeah, you want to use it for your own custom solution

47:46.340 --> 47:51.500
Go ahead. I actually think Lilo is a perfect example of how open source code started

47:51.500 --> 47:54.620
It was created to solve a problem people thought it was no longer useful

47:54.620 --> 47:56.980
It was kind of put away and then in 2010

47:57.020 --> 48:02.300
They came back out and he said actually we can take this code that already exists and we can make it relevant again and people

48:02.300 --> 48:04.300
it got a whole new resurgence and

48:04.300 --> 48:09.260
I don't think you'd ever have seen that with a commercial product because you can't do it because the light stuck

48:09.260 --> 48:13.420
Yeah, I actually think it's a great example of the open source life cycle

48:13.580 --> 48:16.820
I'm trying to think of other projects that I'm familiar with in mobile room

48:16.820 --> 48:22.020
If you guys have any suggestions of projects that have been really big and then just so sort of faded away over time

48:22.020 --> 48:24.380
You know, obviously there's been distros like mandrake and mandriva

48:24.980 --> 48:30.780
But individual projects I was trying to think of besides Lilo that have been so important to us at one point

48:30.780 --> 48:32.780
And now have sort of faded away

48:32.780 --> 48:34.780
Doom

48:35.900 --> 48:40.780
Doom no cork, you know not doom. Yeah, I don't know. I think that's it's an interesting

48:40.780 --> 48:45.820
It's it makes me appreciate the contribution that they do make while they're here and you kind of make me realize not everything's gonna

48:45.820 --> 48:52.100
Last forever and it is a lot of work to keep up with the you know changing file systems and XMMS not maybe XM

48:52.140 --> 48:58.700
Yeah, you know some old old old X desktop applications sis Linux sis Linux open office

48:58.700 --> 49:01.780
I don't I think open office is still around for the most part. Yeah

49:01.780 --> 49:04.980
It's an it's an interesting way to look at those kinds of kind of projects in that

49:05.740 --> 49:07.740
DOS

49:07.980 --> 49:15.580
No, no, I can't I look at this to the history of this thing version 23.0 came out in 2010 and then version

49:15.860 --> 49:23.220
24 was released in 21 in 2013. So it's three years between major major releases. So it's not like it was super rapid rapid

49:24.700 --> 49:28.060
Rekha says gnome to star office. Yeah

49:28.060 --> 49:32.580
Yeah, star office is yes still sis Linux is still used broadly. Yes

49:33.100 --> 49:38.220
Star office was was a big one mumble room. Do you guys have any projects that have faded away that you used to?

49:39.580 --> 49:42.760
No, okay. Nobody's very talkative in there today

49:47.420 --> 49:52.980
Yeah, don't even get me started on BOS that yeah, oh boy, yeah, I my BOS experience was really solid

49:52.980 --> 49:55.180
I've talked about we've talked about it before we did

49:55.180 --> 50:01.620
Heroku, is that what replaced it? Is that what came along there open-source? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yeah

50:01.620 --> 50:03.780
Yeah, we did a haiku episode years ago. You guys remember that

50:04.500 --> 50:06.500
Thank you action show

50:06.940 --> 50:09.600
That's what people call it. Yeah, the haiku action show

50:09.600 --> 50:13.140
We didn't actually we didn't I don't think I don't think we actually named it that but yeah

50:13.140 --> 50:16.500
At the haiku is a pretty fun operating system to check out you guys too. Anyways

50:17.700 --> 50:21.540
Lilo coming to an end you guys can see the announcement in the show in December

50:21.540 --> 50:25.060
Maybe we'll throw a little party for it. Maybe maybe I'll give it a try before it goes

50:25.060 --> 50:28.100
Wait forever, give it one more boot up a couple things. Yeah, I

50:28.660 --> 50:33.540
Like that West that's nice. Good way to send it out. We should do like a boy. That would be really interesting

50:33.540 --> 50:40.620
It's just like a classic Linux distro. That's old kernel using Lilo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah system D. What? No, no

50:41.120 --> 50:42.020
Hey guys

50:42.020 --> 50:46.820
If you have any any projects any submissions for that kind of thing Linux action show dot reddit dot com go find episode 100

50:46.820 --> 50:49.660
Nate and submit it there or any stories or submissions for this year show

50:49.660 --> 50:52.340
you can go over there Linux action show dot reddit dot com and

50:52.340 --> 50:56.260
Submit that to us. I'd really like to hear your thoughts on the whole NSA stuff, too

50:56.540 --> 50:57.400
Kind of you know

50:57.400 --> 51:00.940
What's going on there with the how would open source respond to that if backdoor encryption?

51:01.220 --> 51:06.500
Was like mandated having backdoors in the interesting to hear from some people from other countries. Yes, exactly

51:06.500 --> 51:07.820
Yes, exactly

51:07.820 --> 51:15.780
And then also with the the debate continues on over over at the Linux action show if Richard Stallman ever needs to have actually installed

51:15.780 --> 51:23.660
I've never installed Gnu slash Linux that debate continues to to rant to age on as well as the combo to site revamp and

51:24.140 --> 51:26.460
A thread about diehard keystroke

51:27.020 --> 51:32.580
Keystroke launcher folks and I have a quick I have a quick one that I'd like to throw to the audience and he runs down

51:32.580 --> 51:37.060
By the way, gnome do and synapse and others I at some point, you know in gnome 3

51:37.340 --> 51:40.380
When you hit the meta key or the super key or the Windows key

51:40.380 --> 51:46.460
Whatever you want to call it it brings over the activities overview and then you can start searching immediately. I love that me too

51:46.460 --> 51:48.460
That's that's pretty much how I use it as a launcher

51:48.660 --> 51:52.540
Some point sometime my main machine upstairs. I accidentally remapped that super key

51:52.540 --> 51:52.980
Yeah

51:52.980 --> 51:57.060
And I have no idea how to undo that like I cannot I cannot use super key anymore

51:57.060 --> 52:02.300
And I've gone in I've gone into gnome settings and keyboard and shortcuts and I don't see anything wrong there

52:02.300 --> 52:05.260
I just can't set it anymore and it's driving me crazy

52:05.260 --> 52:10.780
If anybody knows how to revert that back like if there's some G comp file like and I don't know what I could do

52:10.780 --> 52:15.180
I I missed be able to hit the meta key and launch my oh, that's confusing. Yeah, and because it's upstairs

52:15.180 --> 52:18.540
I can't ever troubleshoot on there. Otherwise, I would try that a little bit go TT wine

52:18.540 --> 52:21.340
We can get the mobile room right on your machine. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, right?

52:21.340 --> 52:23.660
I actually I was thinking if I if I can't figure it out

52:23.660 --> 52:25.660
I might just switch over to one of these

52:26.100 --> 52:28.500
To one of these other ones that were just linked to the subreddit

52:28.980 --> 52:32.660
Cooper is one looks like it's QT. You have gnome do synapse Albert

52:32.660 --> 52:37.260
Albert how about that mutate? Let me look at that one, too

52:37.700 --> 52:42.180
This is a really pretty solid lineup including the built-in krunner unity and gnome shell launchers

52:42.460 --> 52:49.020
I'm looking at mutate the award-winning productivity application. Hmm. Okay, it's in the AUR that meant that meets my requirements

52:49.700 --> 52:55.840
Albert's looking good though. Look at Albert Wes. Look at this Albert an amazing desktop environment agnostic omni launcher

52:55.840 --> 52:58.620
The back end will be written at the end of February. Oh, well, okay, it's after February

52:58.620 --> 53:04.020
So these launchers are super look he's doing math in the launcher. He's doing Google searches in there, huh?

53:04.020 --> 53:07.260
I think that's I might Albert might be want to check out

53:08.180 --> 53:12.860
That might be one to look at. I don't know. I see it looks like it has looks like 27 days ago

53:12.860 --> 53:16.220
It was last ice pretty active looks like it's using qt5

53:16.660 --> 53:23.100
So you need to have qt5 installed on your system. That's Albert. So he has I'll link to this in the in the show notes

53:23.620 --> 53:25.660
He's gone through and done a really good job

53:25.660 --> 53:30.020
SB 5 6 6 3 7 in the subreddit and really summarize the current state

53:30.540 --> 53:34.020
Like one of the things I like here is like he when he's separating out the different launchers

53:34.020 --> 53:38.380
He mentions that gnome do had his last released in January 22nd 2014. Yeah

53:39.100 --> 53:43.780
Yeah, so that's that is the issue with gnome do is that it doesn't have a lot of active elements

53:43.780 --> 53:46.060
So he's done a really really superb job. In fact, that's

53:47.020 --> 53:50.800
That is really great work that he took he spent some serious time writing this up

53:51.020 --> 53:54.600
So I'll link to that if you guys are curious about this if you haven't tried to have you ever tried to launch your West

53:54.600 --> 53:59.640
Yeah, I used to use gnome do pretty heavily. Yeah, why'd you stop? I just launched everything from the terminal now. Yeah

53:59.640 --> 54:04.800
Oh, really? Yeah, mostly really well, I use fish like you do a lot of things on my machine anyway

54:04.800 --> 54:07.160
Yeah, and and and what's your main desktop environment?

54:07.740 --> 54:11.960
No, no, I use awesome. Okay, so that makes sense. Yeah, so they have a yeah that

54:14.760 --> 54:19.600
Oh boy, well then we should have you do a segment on here one day one week about why you use awesome

54:19.600 --> 54:21.760
Oh, yeah, that'd be fun. Yeah, and what did you switch from?

54:21.760 --> 54:27.240
Well, would you use before awesome? Oh, no three, how we certainly did you make this transition? Uh, it's been

54:28.120 --> 54:32.920
No, probably better part of a year. Really? Yeah, really and so you went from gnome

54:32.920 --> 54:37.760
What that would have been what gnome 312 ish timeline 360 now 312 ish timeline 312

54:37.760 --> 54:42.400
Yeah, and you and you went to awesome. Yeah, and I still I mean I still love no, you know

54:42.400 --> 54:48.960
I put it on friends. You're blowing my mind. I use cinnamon at work, which not the Italian window managers are so so crazy. It's just

54:48.960 --> 54:54.200
For some reason I pegged you as a gnome 3 gun. I can't remember what we had said. Well, I do I do really like it

54:54.200 --> 54:58.520
Yeah, yeah for you know when I want to show off Linux and make it look really feel violated now

55:02.360 --> 55:07.040
Everybody tells me I should try it and we did do one episode on awesome at one point

55:07.040 --> 55:11.720
And it just for me it and I wonder why if you don't feel it feel it feels for me like going back in time

55:11.920 --> 55:14.120
You know, I do understand that from time to time I do

55:14.120 --> 55:21.260
You know like integros has a beautifully configured gnome 3. Yeah. So like yeah, I use that as my go-to live CD for a lot of things

55:21.260 --> 55:25.540
Yeah, so I really appreciate it or if I want to just like show off slick shiny Linux. Mm-hmm

55:26.660 --> 55:32.020
Mostly I just don't need I prefer to mount things myself and you know a lot of the little things where I yeah

55:32.020 --> 55:34.740
I'd rather I have my own set up for it already and

55:36.020 --> 55:40.740
You crazy you crazy. Yeah, we should okay. We should do an unplugged episode on tiling window managers

55:40.740 --> 55:44.340
Anybody in the mumble room on a tiling window manager? I three is pretty great, too

55:44.340 --> 55:46.800
Yeah, that's the one I was thinking about trying actually was I three

55:47.460 --> 55:51.400
No, I'm so playing with plasma five. Yeah, how's that been going?

55:52.580 --> 55:56.660
Well, I'm on the beta one now and it's it's getting there. It's getting better

55:56.700 --> 56:03.460
So I'm hoping looking forward to 1510 maybe even put all my new desktop finally. Hmm

56:04.300 --> 56:08.060
Fascinating. Well if you guys want to see us do a tiling window manager episode in love

56:08.060 --> 56:11.020
I'm not quite sure how I think we would need people in the mumble room that

56:11.580 --> 56:15.140
Are involved or that are running it? That's how I would like to do it. I think

56:21.340 --> 56:25.220
Yeah, sounds like okay that sounds like that might be a good idea I suppose I could try it I

56:25.700 --> 56:28.260
Just don't want to waste a week of productivity doing something

56:28.260 --> 56:30.740
I don't love but if people if we had a few people in the mumble room

56:30.740 --> 56:32.740
So because I mean maybe it'd be okay

56:32.740 --> 56:35.380
But if we had a few other people maybe long timers plus you'd be here that might

56:35.380 --> 56:38.940
There might be a decent product could be a good segment. It could be a good segment

56:39.220 --> 56:39.820
All right

56:39.820 --> 56:44.760
I had to I wanted to answer one question before we left the show today because we've talked on and off about running

56:45.500 --> 56:51.860
Linux on Macbooks on unplugged from we tried it with Angela's laptop and some other folks went out and pop MacBooks and try it

56:51.860 --> 56:53.540
Well Jose writes in with a question

56:53.540 --> 56:58.140
That I think a lot of you are probably gonna run into if you have if you've ever tried Linux on a MacBook or you know

56:58.140 --> 57:00.700
Anybody out there who is and he says a year back

57:00.700 --> 57:02.700
I wrote an asking for help getting links on my HP notebook

57:02.700 --> 57:07.940
After a lot of research, I finally got arch running flawlessly. However, I need some help again about six six months ago

57:07.940 --> 57:11.220
I really wanted a new laptop and I was looking at getting the Dell XPS 13

57:11.220 --> 57:14.180
But my mother and girlfriend got me a MacBook Pro retina

57:15.220 --> 57:17.480
with with the iris pro graphics

57:18.220 --> 57:24.980
2014 edition as a gift for finishing my PhD. Well, congratulations Jose says I won't lie. I really like the build quality or it's Josie

57:24.980 --> 57:26.140
I'm not sure

57:26.140 --> 57:28.860
But all but not all that crazy about OS 10, right?

57:28.860 --> 57:33.540
About a month ago. I installed anti-gross, but I have two huge problems

57:34.220 --> 57:41.220
Number one the battery life drops from seven hours to three hours and number two the temperature on the laptop goes way up just by

57:41.220 --> 57:44.900
Watching a simple video and the fan goes crazy. I wonder if you guys have any ideas

57:44.900 --> 57:47.380
I've tried to browse the arch wiki, but it hasn't been all that helpful

57:47.380 --> 57:53.860
I really like to run Linux full-time, but I can't solve these issues if I can't solve these issues. I'm going back to OS 10

57:54.400 --> 57:56.340
So the first issue

57:56.340 --> 58:01.680
Seven hours or three hours. I think partially might be which graphics card you're using. So if you're using say the built-in

58:02.580 --> 58:05.380
Dedicated graphics versus the iris graphics that's going to use way more power

58:05.660 --> 58:12.180
But the major problem you have in my opinion with Linux on MacBooks is that SMC controller you familiar with this only broadly

58:12.340 --> 58:17.620
Yeah, the SMC controller is really responsible for a lot of the thermal management and probably I don't know a lot of other

58:17.860 --> 58:24.640
Regulative things towards power and whatnot in the MacBook. It's custom. It's a custom Mac thing. There's no driver for Linux available. So

58:24.640 --> 58:29.720
The fans and temperature management are all done proactively under OS 10

58:29.720 --> 58:36.040
In fact OS 10 even is aware of CPU load and GPU load and how that relates to potential heat increase and will preemptively

58:36.280 --> 58:38.400
increase the fans to cool the machine and

58:38.800 --> 58:41.800
All of that is done in software inside the OS 10 operating system

58:41.800 --> 58:45.600
And the reality is that what you get when you don't run OS 10 on a MacBook is

58:46.200 --> 58:51.720
You get essentially the hard limit thermal controls that keeps the hardware alive. So you get these weird

58:52.720 --> 58:54.360
swings from

58:54.360 --> 58:59.960
Low thermal management to extreme thermal management where the fans kick up and he says I'm watching a video and my fans go crazy

58:59.960 --> 59:05.020
I don't have a great fix for this and I'm wondering if people in the subreddit or in the mumble room or in the IRC do

59:05.120 --> 59:11.040
But here's uh, oh look here is the air is saying there's a thermal daemon on github. You might build a search for

59:11.880 --> 59:15.480
Not specifically for max thermal D is not specifically for max

59:15.480 --> 59:18.800
But so so the thermal D I'll put a link to that in the show notes

59:18.800 --> 59:20.800
I don't know about that specifically but

59:20.800 --> 59:27.080
What I do know has worked and it's a little hokey and it does require that you have a little OS 10 install on the

59:27.080 --> 59:31.080
Machine and itsy bitsy in OS 10 install which I actually do recommend anyways

59:31.080 --> 59:36.080
Because it's the only way you can do important you if I and other firmware updates that would help protect you against things like Thunder

59:36.080 --> 59:36.940
Strike

59:36.940 --> 59:42.920
So I recommend you do keep a little OS 10 on there despite the hard drive space that comes at a premium on those Mac SSDs

59:44.200 --> 59:49.320
If you boot into OS 10 before you boot into Linux and don't shut off

59:49.320 --> 59:51.160
But just reboot don't power the machine off

59:51.160 --> 59:56.520
But just reboot boot into OS 10 first and install an app called SMC fan controller now

59:56.880 --> 01:00:02.320
SMC fan controller has been around for a really really long time. And what it does is it controls?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.740
Statically the fans under OS 10 so you can go in there and what you can do is build different fan controller profiles

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.960
medium high sound low sound and

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.600
If you're going to be gaming you would set it to the higher profile

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.560
If you're not going to be gaming you would set it to the lower profile and if you're gonna be watching videos

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.200
Maybe you set to a medium profile and then you boot into Linux now

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:23.960
It's not ideal

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.040
But what it does is it sets a new baseline for the fan RPMs

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.280
So you could say instead of having them spin at 800 rpm

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.100
You could have a baseline of 15 or 2,000 rpm with the max about 6,000 where you actually start to hear them

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.080
So you could go in and say set your baseline level RPMs at a thousand RPMs or 2,000 RPMs

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.620
It's slightly louder than it would be under OS 10 just slightly

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:48.460
But it can run much longer that way before it has to kick into the crazy thermal management

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.620
This is a really hokey workaround. There's got to be a better way to do this

01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.680
But if you do have a mini OS 10 install, that's one way to do it. This is Nate says

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:01.560
There is some Mac fan CTL D. I use it with Ubuntu. No, we never have any problems

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.760
So check out Mac fan CTL D. That could be another very nice. Yeah

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:07.340
That's really cool. Thank you Nate Mac

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:14.460
See Mac fan CTL D. I have not I don't I don't I don't have any any more Mac books with Linux on them at the moment

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:18.020
So it's like one of those things to you where it's so specific to you know, the different models and versions

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:22.220
Yeah, it does change right and then Apple can just get it just right and then the next version when you go buy a Mac

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.540
Book with one port and it has completely different stuff. So

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.680
Yeah, that's a rough way to go. But I know the people like those Mac books. We get a lot of emails about it

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.900
So if somebody has some solid solid links like Nate there

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:37.760
I would love it if you'd add it to episode 108 over at the subreddit Linux action show

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:42.260
Dot-reddit dot-com and then other people could benefit from that as well

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:47.620
So Linux unplugged is live on Tuesdays 2 p.m. Pacific can go to jblive.tv to join us

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:52.180
We have the chat room there. We also have a mumble room info so you can hang out in our virtual lug

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.740
If you're not quite sure what 2 p.m

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:59.980
Pacific is I don't blame you because I realize now I'm gonna have to try to figure out time zones as I go across the US

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:05.240
I'm like, ah crap. What am I gonna do? And then it was pointed out to me Chris. Just go to do a broadcasting comm

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.500
So that's calendar. I'm smart guy already set that up. Yeah, I too will be using the calendar on the road trip

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.860
I will be feeling your pain audience. So no judgment

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.420
also

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:16.380
we love feedback Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact choose unplugged from the drop-down and

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:22.060
Send in your emails Linux actually reddit comm West. Thanks for joining me. My pleasure. Thanks for having me

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:34.060
All right, buddy. See you right back here next Tuesday

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.560
All

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:11.460
Right now we both JB titles calm JB titles calm only grab this one second. There you go. All right. There we go

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:16.020
Hello coming on the possibility of unfiltered Colorado high note

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:21.660
Haha, if I'm gonna be in car, I don't think I'm gonna be in Colorado. I'm taking us to I

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:27.500
Don't think I'll be there a high note from Colorado. Although I Colorado could happen on the return trip

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:32.380
We're gonna break from us to on the road on the return trip and take in more of an indulgent route home

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:37.440
So it's always possible. Oh that new Google logo. Oh, look at that. Look at that. Oh

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.200
I kind of missed the serifs honestly, really

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.120
Backdoors for the clueless. Do you have a lot a list of plan stops on us to know Billy?

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.680
I'm hoping people want to do meetups and contact me. I need I need meet it

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.200
I can if you do meetups, is there a way to do like meetup suggestions on meetup calm?

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.200
I don't I don't know. That's I don't know

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.960
Yeah

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.520
What highly window manager should we force Chris to use for a week?

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:06.240
I do remember that now that we do this see the results were i3 by 54 percent. So apparently we've discussed this

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240
Yes, I do recall discussing this now

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.120
Oh boy, see I I was I was see Matt Matt was Matt had my back on the anti

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:20.460
He was an anti Tyler too. So it was easier for me to avoid having to deal with the tiling issue on the show

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:25.600
However now that you're here and you've got tiling preferences now and now got the mumbo-mumbo. Look at this

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:32.640
I 380 votes on it. I look at this. Look at this at a 148 votes. This is no good. This is I

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.960
I think you should wait till after the road trip that way you don't get too many things going on

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:41.320
That's probably a good point or maybe we do it on the road trip

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:47.200
Really everything up. Yeah, just like uphaul everything in my life

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:53.560
Why not back doors for the Calusa isn't bad the fecal matters of Chris last while in security by design back door complaint

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.220
Lilo bought a boom luxury furry road open source back doors

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:04.840
Hmm smoky on the penguin. That's not bad either. Man. These are some good ones JB titles calm

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:13.100
Dude you're getting shot by a machine gun. Watch out you're getting shot by a machine gun. You better be careful

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:19.940
Keep the bummer room safe everyone. Yeah, it kind of reminds me of how like the original Phil Zimmer

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:27.500
Like the 90s with PGP encryption how that was like you can't export this encryption and stuff like that

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.460
And they were fighting for that back then

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:34.580
Yeah, yeah, I know right use Windows for a week. I

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.700
Actually wouldn't do that. I

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.900
Have some pride

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.540
We just drive me crazy the fecal matters of Chris last cannot be our title

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:48.860
I don't think that's a very good title for Linux unplugged. I don't really think that's not accurate

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:54.580
I mean if that's what the episode was about. Yeah, that's true. I mean I could I could definitely do an episode about that. Trust me

01:05:54.580 --> 01:06:01.460
Trust me. I was surprised nobody had any nice parting words in the mumble room to say about Lilo, you know is solid

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:06.700
Let's really be ready for death. I guess it's just we've all moved on right? We have all moved on it is time

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:11.340
And jalapeno ale. Yeah, I do need to do that. You're right. I'm a con you're right

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.940
So I'm a con I'm gonna have a camera when we're at our meetup

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:18.840
So I should probably get this I kind of get this figured out. I need a meetup on demand

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.580
So so basically I'll be I'll just be spawning meetups as I go

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:26.940
So sign up at meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting spawning them was spawning them coming out everywhere

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.180
just I'll just awash in meetups, I don't actually know if that's true or not because

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:38.020
Us too has long spots where there's nobody around we got to like share your location to you like a where's Chris?

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:41.320
Hmm like a beacon. Yeah, exactly like a JB Road beacon. Yeah

01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.260
Get up at 2 in the morning and check where Chris is

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:47.700
I wonder how I would actually practically do that in a way that would actually be doable

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:51.780
I saw something that used open street maps and like you could set it up that would be amazing

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.420
You could plot where you were going if there's a way to do that and it doesn't cost a bunch of money

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.260
I'll see oh totes do it. That'd be fun. I'm a room you see too

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.100
Yeah

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:04.260
Don't find out and then you can wallow you can follow me as I go and then if I get stuck on the side of the road

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:08.260
You can alert somebody cuz I might be somewhere. There's no cell so cuz how's that gonna work if it doesn't have Celsius?

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:12.300
Yeah, I assume there'll be some big hole. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah car tracker thing

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:18.460
Hmm Lila was two letters ago. That's funny Rick guy. That's good way to put it. Yeah, low jack Chris last low jack
