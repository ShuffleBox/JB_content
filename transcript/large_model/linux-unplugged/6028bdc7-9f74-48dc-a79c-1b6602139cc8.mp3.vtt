WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
Wes found something that I'm gonna be using the heck out of, but potentially, it's YouTube DL

00:05.520 --> 00:11.920
web server. It's a web server for downloading YouTube videos. You fire up a Docker container,

00:11.920 --> 00:17.520
you give it a YouTube URL, and it's pretty much off to the races. You then are re-hosting your own

00:17.520 --> 00:22.640
downloaded instances of the YouTube videos. And I think right now one of the things it does is

00:23.280 --> 00:28.320
it re- or transcodes, I guess would be the way to put it. Not re-encode, but it transcodes

00:28.320 --> 00:33.680
them to mp3. So then you can download them from a web UI as mp3 files, which kind of be a cool way

00:33.680 --> 00:37.760
to convert long videos into like a podcast. You know, and there are things to do this,

00:37.760 --> 00:43.200
various sites out there or bookmarklets or just the command line. But if you're like me,

00:43.200 --> 00:47.360
you have others in your life who frequently have sources that are YouTube videos. I can't be

00:47.360 --> 00:53.280
bothered to ffmpeg them mp3s all the darn time. So here you go. Pop it in that web UI and you're

00:53.280 --> 00:57.120
off to the races. Now, of course, right now you can't really choose, you know, does it give you

00:57.120 --> 01:01.440
the full video? And there's a ton of options. There's dash videos, there's, you know, YouTube

01:01.440 --> 01:05.840
has a lot of downloading options. So hopefully those features show up in a later release. I've

01:05.840 --> 01:11.680
got a very, oh, so shameful bash version of this that I have been using. So maybe after the show,

01:11.680 --> 01:15.840
I can replace it. Yeah, I love YouTube DL. And this just makes it even better and more

01:15.840 --> 01:21.520
accessible to friends and family and lazy Chris, which lazy Chris always appreciates making things

01:21.520 --> 01:37.440
a little easier. This is Linux Unplugged, episode 268 for September 25th, 2018.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.920
Ooh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's got a studio full of brown bears.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.280
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. We have a packed show today, multiple guests

01:49.280 --> 01:54.800
stopping by the show, some community news, and something that we don't get to enough,

01:55.680 --> 02:00.000
the audience's feedback and emails and questions. We'll do a little bit of that too, do some follow

02:00.000 --> 02:06.080
up on some recent topics. And I'll tell you about a new rig that just showed up in the studio.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.560
It's a monster. I haven't told you about it yet. So I'm excited. I'll tell you in the show,

02:10.560 --> 02:16.640
you'll get to find out. So, and maybe the most important thing at all, on top of all this,

02:16.640 --> 02:21.680
is after the show, we're going to do an unplugged barbecue. Noah's in town. He's hanging out at the

02:21.680 --> 02:26.880
studio. Wes is here. He's brought his pups. We're going to go get Levi, go get some food.

02:26.880 --> 02:31.040
There's some meat in the cooker right now. This is prep for the big public barbecue we

02:31.040 --> 02:35.840
want to do once I'm back up on my feet, feeling better. Got to get it right in before the holidays.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.840
So the timing is going to be tricky. So this will be our test run at a big barbecue,

02:39.840 --> 02:43.440
a big community barbecue. We'll do a trial. I mean, you got to rehearse if you want to get it right.

02:43.440 --> 02:47.600
You already got the sous vide going. Yeah, that's right. All right. Well, before we get any farther

02:47.600 --> 02:51.760
into the show, you know what we got to do. We got to bring in that virtual lug. Time,

02:51.760 --> 03:02.640
appropriate greetings, mumble room. Amazing. We have a great turnout in there. Mr. Dahr is back.

03:02.640 --> 03:09.040
Brent's there, of course. Cassidy from Elementary OS. Longtime contributor Eric is there. Hayden is

03:09.040 --> 03:12.320
here from an interesting project we'll be talking about in just a little bit. Mr.

03:12.320 --> 03:18.800
Minimac, true contributor to the, I mean, needs no introduction. Just here all the time. And

03:18.800 --> 03:23.680
returning to the show, Mr. Ryan Sipes. Ryan, welcome back to the show. It's good to be back.

03:23.680 --> 03:29.120
We got Sean in there and TechMav as well. So we got a big crew today. We're really looking

03:29.120 --> 03:33.920
forward to today's episode. So let's start with the thing that people are sort of the most on edge

03:33.920 --> 03:39.280
about this week. We'll just get this out of the way. People are pretty upset that Google seems to

03:39.280 --> 03:45.280
be, quote, secretly logging users into Chrome whenever they log into a Google property. So you

03:45.280 --> 03:49.920
go into Docs, you go to Gmail. I do that all the time. You go to YouTube. Yeah, right. I mean,

03:49.920 --> 03:55.120
what don't they own? Starting with Chrome 69, whenever a Chrome user would access a Google

03:55.120 --> 04:00.720
own site, the browser would take that user's Google identity and log the user into the Chrome

04:00.720 --> 04:06.480
browser account system. Now with this revelation, obviously there's a large number of users who are

04:06.480 --> 04:11.600
just kind of angry. It feels like a sneaky behind the back modification. And you worry that it could

04:11.600 --> 04:16.400
allow Google to link your traffic to a specific browser and then to a specific account. And as

04:16.400 --> 04:20.240
someone with multiple Google accounts, there's some things I searched that, well, maybe not

04:20.240 --> 04:25.680
necessarily bad. I don't need on my work account. Right. Well, and Dar in the mumble room today was

04:25.680 --> 04:30.240
just talking about on the pre show about how he's on a machine that shared by multiple people. So

04:30.240 --> 04:35.120
how does that work now when multiple people sit down? Is it bouncing between Google accounts every

04:35.120 --> 04:38.960
time you change a Google sign? Somebody else sits down, logs into Gmail and now it's a different

04:38.960 --> 04:42.480
account signed into the browser. That's a very good question. Now there is something we should

04:42.480 --> 04:48.000
be clear about here. Google engineers have clarified that this auto login operation does not

04:48.000 --> 04:52.560
start the process of synchronizing local data to Google servers. That still requires you to

04:52.560 --> 04:58.400
explicitly click something. Right. Exactly. That's a big difference. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I forgot to

04:58.400 --> 05:03.120
call out Alex. Mr. Ironic Badger is also sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to skip you. I just don't read

05:03.120 --> 05:06.880
the screen very well from that far away. I know, you know, and I, we and I were just, we're just

05:06.880 --> 05:11.360
having a nice chat too. So, well, I'm very glad you're here. It's nice to see you. Alex, of course,

05:11.360 --> 05:16.560
was, he was joining us for quite a while after Texas Linux Fest, but then took some time off to

05:16.560 --> 05:22.800
travel to the States and move to the States, uh, down in a Raleigh area. So, and I'm now dealing

05:22.800 --> 05:30.800
with establishing a us credit history, which is unbelievably pain in the ass territory. Welcome.

05:30.800 --> 05:37.840
Our sympathies, sir. Um, then there's another thing that's now brewing today. Uh, Christoph

05:37.840 --> 05:43.120
Tavin tweeted out that when you clear all cookies in the new version of Google Chrome,

05:43.120 --> 05:50.240
it clears out all cookies except for the Google cookies. Um, and to be clear, what it actually

05:50.240 --> 05:56.000
seems to do is it wipes out all of the cookies on your file system and then immediately recreates

05:56.000 --> 06:01.120
the cookies for Google's properties and repopulates them. Interesting. Now I did see some defense out

06:01.120 --> 06:04.960
there. There's clearly some, some privacy implications here that people are rightfully

06:04.960 --> 06:08.800
concerned about. I did see some people trying to justify it from the developer side of you,

06:08.800 --> 06:12.240
you know, making the argument that, well, users are confused that they're logged into Chrome,

06:12.240 --> 06:16.880
but they're not logged into our Google sites and vice versa. And then, well, once you,

06:16.880 --> 06:20.560
if you are logged into the browser and you do clear your cookies on the very next request,

06:20.560 --> 06:24.000
it's pretty much going to go check and be like, Hey, am I signed in? It's going to agree to grab

06:24.000 --> 06:28.080
those cookies. So you can see them being like, well, it's simpler if we just warm them up front

06:28.080 --> 06:32.560
that maybe those cookies aren't, are always going to be there. Yeah. It's, it's sort of like, uh,

06:32.560 --> 06:38.720
in iOS when you turn on airplane mode now, it, it leaves Bluetooth on to connect to your watch or

06:38.720 --> 06:43.600
your AirPods. There's not like true airplane mode anymore. And what that feels like to me

06:43.600 --> 06:52.160
is design and product overruling engineering. I think the most accurate and cutting criticism

06:52.160 --> 06:58.000
about both of these changes is that when asked, Google engineers could not articulate a very clear

06:58.000 --> 07:03.440
reason why this change has happened and why it was kind of snuck in, which causes people to lose

07:03.440 --> 07:09.280
trust. I think they cannot say what it is because Google hasn't made this public statement about it

07:09.280 --> 07:14.640
and generally contracts for them to do so. So they were limited in what they could legitimately say.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.880
I mean, they are making some suggestions, but they all don't really pass the sniff test. Yeah.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.640
And do you think you're right? I mean, at this point, Chrome feels a bit more of like a Google

07:22.640 --> 07:27.120
product that happens to have a browser inside of it and less of like a browser first sort of thing.

07:27.120 --> 07:32.080
And it was the good engineering of a lot of Google's products that, you know, made me switch

07:32.080 --> 07:36.080
to Chrome for a long time is it was a great browser initially. And that was because of great

07:36.080 --> 07:40.720
engineering. Does anyone know is Chromium also affected by that or only the Chrome

07:40.720 --> 07:46.000
proprietary version? Most likely it will be. Looks like it is on Chromium now.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.520
Now, but I've also heard a lot of people saying they're using a version of Chromium that avoids

07:49.520 --> 07:53.120
all of this. I think there's some patches out there to remove that. Yeah.

07:53.120 --> 07:58.480
Know that Debian's version actually disables the Google services unless you go there manually

07:58.480 --> 08:03.680
and enable them. So. Okay. Only the Debian version or also the Ubuntu version?

08:03.680 --> 08:08.480
I can't talk for other stuff. I haven't tested it. Okay. Okay. So I have to check that.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.800
Now, Cassidy, you point out that this behavior isn't necessarily new for some group of users.

08:12.800 --> 08:18.640
Yeah. As far as I know, this is how it's been from day one on Chrome for Android. Like, and it

08:18.640 --> 08:22.480
maybe it was a little more forthcoming on Android when you sign in. It says, Hey, we're also going

08:22.480 --> 08:26.960
to sign you into the Chrome browser to sync your bookmarks and everything. So I don't know if

08:26.960 --> 08:30.640
people are freaking out about it here on the desktop, why that's very different from freaking

08:30.640 --> 08:35.360
out about it on Android. Yeah. I guess it does make it more in line with the Android version.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.680
That's an interesting point. It's kind of a weird one. Yeah. We have different conceptions on our

08:39.680 --> 08:44.640
different devices, I guess. You know, practically speaking, the very first thing I do is I log into

08:44.640 --> 08:50.400
the Chrome browser. So this is not necessarily a move that I find personally offensive. I am

08:51.360 --> 08:55.360
dumb enough, I guess. I don't know what people would label me who think Google is spying on them

08:55.360 --> 09:01.040
constantly, but I am willing to risk it. And I use the sync service. I sync my history and my

09:01.040 --> 09:07.360
bookmarks because I find that to be a very useful feature of the browser. And it's a good sync

09:07.360 --> 09:15.040
system, too. So I just have been all in from day one when they turned that on. So I don't really

09:15.040 --> 09:18.480
find this to be offensive, but I do understand people that are concerned about it. And it's just

09:18.480 --> 09:22.640
good to know, you know, and assess when you do have options out there, which is nice. So when

09:22.640 --> 09:27.120
you're looking when you're weighing Firefox versus Chrome, this is another data point. And I think

09:27.120 --> 09:32.080
it's an important one. Something else that I found really handy in the past has been play on Linux.

09:32.080 --> 09:37.520
Play on Linux is a wrapper around a series of scripts to make it really easy to install a lot of

09:37.520 --> 09:44.480
different Windows applications and use Wine. I've been wondering where does Play on Linux go now

09:44.480 --> 09:51.120
in a post-proton world? How about that, Wes? As a saying, a post-proton world. I like it.

09:52.640 --> 09:57.920
So where does Play on Linux go? And it appears that they're making some massive changes. Alpha

09:57.920 --> 10:05.280
One is out this week, along with a Play on Mac build as well. And there has been some big changes.

10:05.280 --> 10:11.200
Play on Linux version 5.0 Alpha has been completely redesigned, a new user interface,

10:11.920 --> 10:17.680
and a new platform they're calling, I guess, Phoenix? Am I saying that right? Phonics? I'm the

10:17.680 --> 10:22.480
worst. I'm just the worst. I shouldn't be allowed to speak. The new platform is, quote, decentralized,

10:22.480 --> 10:28.960
Git-based, and improves their script engine greatly. The new Alpha has support for about 135

10:28.960 --> 10:33.760
different games right now. They're also investigating using virtualization or container

10:33.760 --> 10:38.480
technologies to improve the gaming experience. So, hey. That could be interesting if you want

10:38.480 --> 10:43.760
to isolate a series of libraries or a specific version of Wine. There's a bottle system now,

10:43.760 --> 10:48.000
but that's more at the software layer. So this would be more at the systems layer. Yeah, so

10:48.000 --> 10:53.200
something to keep an eye on, playonlinux.com for more. I've used it on and off over the years. I've

10:53.200 --> 10:58.400
also used Crossover quite a bit over the years. And now it's like, well, how can these projects,

10:58.400 --> 11:03.200
Proton, how can these projects, Play on Linux, and Crossover Office, integrate Proton?

11:03.200 --> 11:07.120
Yeah, right. Can they further the value add and make it even easier to get some great games on

11:07.120 --> 11:10.400
Linux? I suspect there might be a way, at least, to take some of the upstream improvements that

11:10.400 --> 11:14.880
have been in Wine, and we'll probably start seeing those benefits. I'm curious to see where

11:14.880 --> 11:20.080
that goes. There's another thing I'm also watching to see where this goes. It sort of seems to me

11:20.080 --> 11:25.920
like elementary OS is positioning themselves as a family-safe, family-first distribution.

11:25.920 --> 11:32.160
And I started thinking that after I read a post by Cassidy on their Medium blog about

11:32.160 --> 11:36.960
App Center and content ratings that are coming in Juneau. They say, starting with Juneau,

11:36.960 --> 11:41.920
Cassidy writes, will display a content warning when a user goes to download an app that meets

11:41.920 --> 11:48.320
or exceeds a certain level of the OARS data. Think of that as like nudity, violence, and language

11:48.320 --> 11:53.280
content. In addition, these apps will not be featured on the App Center homepage as recommended

11:53.280 --> 11:58.480
installs. They will remain in the search results and category pages, so if you really want to find

11:58.480 --> 12:02.640
them, they're definitely still there. And we should note here that they want to be clear that

12:02.640 --> 12:06.720
elementary is not intending to be the content police. They could never make as informed of a

12:06.720 --> 12:10.560
decision about what's acceptable as, you know, yourself or a parent of a child.

12:10.560 --> 12:15.760
This is just a small step toward more robust content controls and informed consent, as they put it,

12:15.760 --> 12:19.600
for their users. So Cassidy, this seems like an interesting differentiating feature of the

12:19.600 --> 12:25.680
distribution, sort of making it safe for parents to deploy elementary OS for their kids. And it

12:25.680 --> 12:29.920
seems like this could go much deeper than just the App Center too. Yeah, exactly, and that's the

12:29.920 --> 12:36.880
plan. We've had parental controls in Loki now for a couple years, and it's, you know, it's kind of a

12:36.880 --> 12:44.160
first take on the concept where you can set up certain restrictions for apps for a managed account.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.600
But I think we're looking at these digital wellness features that we've talked about that are coming

12:49.600 --> 12:54.640
to like Android and iOS, and we're kind of reconsidering how we could build this feature into

12:54.640 --> 13:00.880
the OS itself for both child accounts, but also for people to be able to control what they're

13:00.880 --> 13:06.640
comfortable installing or seeing in the OS. I was talking to somebody recently, and they said that

13:06.640 --> 13:12.640
their friend has PTSD from like combat-related trauma. And so that's an example I gave here of,

13:12.640 --> 13:18.880
you know, if you want to prevent yourself from seeing very violent content, you should have the

13:18.880 --> 13:23.680
control over your OS to do that. And it's always in your hands to be able to do that.

13:23.680 --> 13:28.320
And Ryan, you also are making the case it's not just for kids. Yeah, I just wanted to pair what

13:28.320 --> 13:35.440
Cass said. We actually had a conversation about this the other day. My girlfriend is really

13:35.440 --> 13:42.560
careful about this stuff, because she was over in Lebanon assisting Syrian refugees and was exposed

13:42.560 --> 13:49.520
to a lot of, you know, violence. And so it really triggers her to see, you know, really graphic

13:49.520 --> 13:55.600
violence. And so I think a lot of people benefit from being able to set what they're comfortable

13:55.600 --> 14:02.080
with seeing and appearing in front of them on their own machine when they're using it.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.200
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that, but that does make that makes a ton of sense.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.080
It's not an angle we usually think of, right? Like, control usually means like,

14:08.080 --> 14:12.480
I want unrestricted things, but restrictions for yourself, well, that's still control.

14:12.480 --> 14:17.840
It's a new idea that we've played with a lot recently, mostly in the mobile context. Like,

14:17.840 --> 14:21.520
should I start using the built-in OS features to limit screen time in the evening?

14:21.520 --> 14:26.320
In some way, things like secure boot are almost analogous.

14:26.320 --> 14:31.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right. We have sort of been building this, it's like, I don't mind

14:31.200 --> 14:35.200
optional controls that I have total authority over that I can choose to put in place or not.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.280
Like, that's totally fine in my book.

14:37.280 --> 14:41.200
It points out problems in human social structures, right? We get a little nervous when we know those

14:41.200 --> 14:45.840
controls are there and easy to use, especially when we're not in a situation where we have total

14:45.840 --> 14:46.400
control.

14:46.400 --> 14:51.760
I also think it's really important that we build these tools to put the control in the hands of

14:51.760 --> 14:56.960
the users because if we don't build it in that way, I think there's too much of a temptation

14:56.960 --> 15:01.280
for people to control it at the service level. For example, if, you know, we thought, oh,

15:01.280 --> 15:05.680
we shouldn't have explicit content in the store, we might restrict all explicit content from the

15:05.680 --> 15:08.800
whole app center. And I don't think that's the right way to go.

15:08.800 --> 15:13.360
Ah, I see what you're saying is it also makes room for the other way. So there can be

15:13.360 --> 15:16.880
content that is explicit, but there is an easy way for people to opt out of it.

15:17.600 --> 15:23.600
Right. So that's a great point. So Cassidy, I guess this is one of many new things that are

15:23.600 --> 15:26.960
coming to Juno and we're kind of going to see this in the early stages, it sounds like with Juno.

15:26.960 --> 15:32.080
It'll be specific to the app center in Juno, but then future releases expanding from there?

15:32.080 --> 15:36.160
Yeah, the idea is kind of this tiered progression. At first, we're doing this kind of minimum

15:36.160 --> 15:41.200
viable. It's just a warning that says, hey, here's a heads up, according to the data in the app,

15:41.200 --> 15:45.840
that it has some explicit content. But after that, I think, yeah, we're going to look at

15:45.840 --> 15:52.240
really building in both in app center itself, listing out what actual ors tags are there.

15:52.240 --> 15:56.480
And so what, you know, whether it's explicit due to violence or nudity or language.

15:57.840 --> 16:02.080
And then after that, yeah, in the future is more system-wide controls. So you can,

16:02.080 --> 16:06.560
you know, this could theoretically apply to your video player or your music app as well.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.240
That's an interesting idea. And I think, like I said at the beginning,

16:10.240 --> 16:16.000
it's a good differentiator. I have found elementary OS to be a fantastic OS for my son.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.200
It's been on his laptop now for a couple of years, at least. Just super solid. So I really

16:21.200 --> 16:25.040
like this. And I plan to, you know, just keep them on elementary OS because it just

16:25.040 --> 16:28.720
worked out perfectly. So great, Cassie. Well, thanks for coming on and explaining that.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Man, am I looking forward to seeing Juno land. It's got to be getting close. You guys must be

16:34.000 --> 16:40.640
in like the big final push, right? Yeah, it's coming. It's sure coming. I will say I've been

16:40.640 --> 16:45.200
working on the big release announcement post, you know, because there are certain things we know

16:45.200 --> 16:49.680
are obviously in this release and we can start taking some screenshots and things. But you are

16:49.680 --> 16:55.920
in that phase. You're in that phase. It's like a 20 minute read right now. Wow. So it's intense.

16:55.920 --> 17:00.080
There's a lot of new stuff, a lot of great stuff. Wow. Congratulations. Looking forward to it.

17:00.080 --> 17:05.760
Thanks. Speaking of other new stuff, we've been covering the development of PipeWire,

17:05.760 --> 17:11.920
which has recently had a couple of large growth spurts when it was adopted to provide remote

17:11.920 --> 17:19.120
desktop access to GnomeShell and now to also the Plasma desktop for Wayland. This was always the

17:19.120 --> 17:24.240
big question is, you know, I love X11's network capabilities. Wayland has nothing. How are we

17:24.240 --> 17:32.640
going to achieve this? And PipeWire is a back end plumbing system, I guess, for video right now.

17:33.760 --> 17:41.200
But that's about to change. PipeWire is going to also provide audio support. And that work has

17:41.760 --> 17:46.960
started to be formed. There is pretty much everything in place they need for video,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.880
including patches for Firefox and Chromium, which are in the development stages right now.

17:52.880 --> 18:00.480
So the video part being pretty well solved, and at least at a near 1.0, the PipeWire creator

18:00.480 --> 18:06.800
himself, Wim Tamus, and the pulse audio developer, core pulse audio developer, and a few others

18:07.680 --> 18:13.360
are getting together at a hack fest this fall to start the core work on building what they're

18:13.360 --> 18:20.320
calling a production audio pipeline for Linux. That's what that work is going to start at the

18:20.320 --> 18:26.400
end of October. And they're traveling to Edinburgh, and they're all going to get together. And I think

18:26.400 --> 18:33.360
this is a massive, massive moment, because macOS has a very competitive audio subsystem,

18:33.360 --> 18:37.920
like core audio is what they call it. And Linux has gotten pretty good with pulse audio in Jack.

18:37.920 --> 18:43.280
In fact, we use it extensively in production and are pretty happy with it these days. But I wouldn't

18:43.280 --> 18:48.800
say it's a cohesive API that you can easily write to like core audio is. Right. I mean, you have

18:48.800 --> 18:52.720
different use cases that are segregated, and a lot of your users will end up having to install

18:52.720 --> 18:57.680
different software and learn how to configure it if they have a new use case. So Christian here is

18:57.680 --> 19:01.840
blogging on one of the known blogs that I got off the known planet feed. And he writes that he's

19:01.840 --> 19:06.240
feeling very optimistic that we can come out of this event with both a plan for what we want to do,

19:06.240 --> 19:10.640
and the right people involved to make it happen. The idea is we can have a shared infrastructure

19:10.640 --> 19:16.800
for consumer level audio and pro level audio. Under Linux, it really excites me he writes,

19:16.800 --> 19:22.160
and I do believe that if we do this right, Linux will take a huge step forward as a natural home

19:22.160 --> 19:27.200
for pro audio desktop users. Amazing. I'm that is really exciting. Now, of course,

19:27.200 --> 19:31.200
it's really it's it's just early days. That's that's where it's at. We do have good audio

19:31.200 --> 19:36.640
solutions. But this is what we need that we have had missing abstractions. And I think that's what

19:36.640 --> 19:43.360
this is showing. And something to keep in mind is this solves the issue of a proper way of providing

19:43.360 --> 19:49.280
audio and video hardware access for for sandboxed applications, which we're going to start seeing

19:49.280 --> 19:55.040
more and more with flat packs and snaps and Wayland applications. This is going to be pretty

19:55.040 --> 20:00.640
nice. Secondarily, it provides a unified solution for user space and pro audio, which means pro audio

20:00.640 --> 20:05.280
users will no longer have to read all these crazy how tos and guides to get jack going on their

20:05.280 --> 20:11.360
system, which is what Wes and I are doing right now. It will just be all be programmatically

20:11.360 --> 20:16.480
achievable. And third, it provides a video equivalent of pulse audio, which makes dealing

20:16.480 --> 20:21.840
with different cameras, screen capture and a lot of other things, including doing all that under

20:21.840 --> 20:26.960
Wayland possible. So that's what pipeline is bringing is a unified audio and video subsystem

20:26.960 --> 20:32.400
that works across sandbox applications, works with Wayland and gives an API for developers to

20:32.400 --> 20:37.280
build towards. It's a pretty big deal. I don't want to crap on the initiative, but it sounds like,

20:37.280 --> 20:43.600
hey, we have too many standards. Let's make a standard to fix. And lay it on top of all the

20:43.600 --> 20:48.160
other existing things. Yeah, there is that definite potential. But the thing that seems

20:48.160 --> 20:54.880
encouraging to me is this is involving people from the KDE project. This is involving the core

20:54.880 --> 20:59.440
pulse audio developer, which I always mess up his name, but I came I became a patron of him.

20:59.440 --> 21:07.040
No, no, no. No, it's now run by Arun. I can't, I can't even I don't know, I can't even take a

21:07.040 --> 21:12.400
stab at his last name, but he's on Patreon. And he's now the core developer of pulse audio.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.800
And they're coming in together. If it's going to work, this is the right group of people.

21:16.800 --> 21:21.040
Yeah, they have the right heads in the room trying to build a coalition here,

21:21.040 --> 21:25.280
lay good foundations. It'll probably be a long time just like just like Wayland was before we

21:25.280 --> 21:30.000
really see it in a desktop OS or us. But yeah, it may be a long time before it's totally feature

21:30.000 --> 21:34.560
rich too, right? It's going to be probably a minimum viable product for a while. And then

21:34.560 --> 21:39.360
they'll build on top of it. So you and I will probably be writing out pulse audio and Jack for

21:39.360 --> 21:46.560
probably another year or two. Well, we'll be early testers. I guarantee that guarantee that I still

21:46.560 --> 21:51.360
am just I don't know, Jack is the vernacular is rough. It's just different. It's different.

21:51.360 --> 21:55.200
But in a year or two, Microsoft will finally have a Linux distro. Come on.

21:57.920 --> 22:02.240
Dar, you just never let it go. Hey, it's three years have passed. Two are missing.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.360
I said five years. Come on. That's true. I know. I know. I mean,

22:05.360 --> 22:09.280
we can't fault you there. It still could happen. I give you that. In the meantime,

22:10.320 --> 22:15.280
I can't believe this new rig that has come into the studio shipped to us by Dell for review.

22:15.280 --> 22:25.360
It is the Dell Precision 5530. And it is a 15 inch screen infinity edge to edge screen in a 14 inch

22:25.360 --> 22:31.920
chassis. Oh, and you can get it with Xeon processors if you want. You can get it with 32 gigs of RAM.

22:31.920 --> 22:37.200
I'll save the spec of ours for the review next week. But it just arrived in the studio today.

22:37.200 --> 22:41.040
So I'm going to be loading it up. It has a boon to 1604 installed from the factory.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.360
That looks like an XPS. It does. It looks exactly like an XPS 13,

22:45.360 --> 22:50.960
only a little bit bigger. Well, because it's a 14 inch chassis and a little bit thicker.

22:50.960 --> 22:58.480
But for that, you get a competent cooling system, which I'll be testing, and way more horsepower.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.360
The desktop replacement version of the XPS you've always wanted.

23:01.360 --> 23:06.560
Yeah. And you can get crazy fast processors in this thing.

23:06.560 --> 23:12.800
It's got the infamous i9 as an option, I see. Can that thing really dissipate the heat?

23:12.800 --> 23:14.240
Is it really capable of that?

23:14.240 --> 23:17.520
I've got the... I'll give you a little spoiler. I've got the i9 version that

23:17.520 --> 23:20.800
turbos up to 4.8 gigahertz, and I'm going to be testing that very thing.

23:21.840 --> 23:26.160
Don't take it across the border to that crazy Canadian that drops iMacs all the time though.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.640
Yeah, I know, right? I know. I'm pretty excited.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.720
Which Dell are you referring to?

23:30.720 --> 23:35.680
Well, hello, Mr. Wimpress. The Precision 5530, their 15 inch mobile workstation,

23:35.680 --> 23:37.040
just arrived here at the studio.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.720
Oh, really? Very interesting. Can you hurry up on that? Because

23:41.280 --> 23:46.800
I've got Bitcoin burning a hole in my wallet, and I'm about to slam down on a new laptop,

23:46.800 --> 23:55.280
and it's either going to be that, or the 7350, the new one, or the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Extreme.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.120
Oh, man. You really are running...

23:57.120 --> 23:59.440
Get the ThinkPad. I love ThinkPads.

23:59.440 --> 24:05.120
So I'm seriously considering a return to ThinkPads, having been a ThinkPad user

24:05.120 --> 24:08.960
for many, many years prior to the whole Dell XPS thing.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.280
So yeah, I'll be really interested to hear what you have to say, Chris,

24:13.280 --> 24:16.720
because literally I've got them in a spreadsheet side by side,

24:16.720 --> 24:19.840
and there's only a few things that are splitting hairs between them.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.040
Wow, you've even assembled a spreadsheet for this, you're telling me?

24:23.040 --> 24:27.520
Oh, yeah. I need to work out exactly how many one Bitcoin

24:27.520 --> 24:29.680
I'm going to spend on each of these laptops.

24:29.680 --> 24:33.360
Oh, that's... You know, I completely understand where you're at,

24:33.360 --> 24:36.960
because you feel like you've got a limited amount of time right now with the Bitcoin, too.

24:36.960 --> 24:39.520
Now's the time to pull the trigger.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.640
This time last year, it could have bought all of those laptops

24:42.640 --> 24:44.720
and had change out of one Bitcoin,

24:44.720 --> 24:48.960
and this time this year, it's like spec those to the max for one Bitcoin.

24:48.960 --> 24:52.320
Yeah. Well, I'll be trying it out starting now.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.440
Even though I just got a brand new laptop, this would be like...

24:55.440 --> 24:58.480
This could have been me in the future if I'd stayed into editing,

24:58.480 --> 25:02.720
and I was doing video editing, or I was doing a lot of audio editing under Linux.

25:02.720 --> 25:05.600
Yeah, and it's like demanding Linux workload. Perfect.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.600
This could have been in my future, so I'll give it a review.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.440
I'll load it up. I'll put it through its paces.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.600
It's got a brilliant 4K display, so I'll get a good taste of that,

25:13.600 --> 25:16.720
and I'll give you my full report in the next episode of Unplugged.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.960
So hopefully then, Mr. Wimpy, you could make your choice.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.520
I will wait for one week and one week only.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.720
All right. Well, I had a great chance to chat with Nate Graham,

25:26.720 --> 25:28.480
and if that name rings a bell,

25:28.480 --> 25:31.360
it's because he's pretty involved with the Plasma project,

25:31.360 --> 25:37.360
and he is the individual who's been posting weekly usability updates about Plasma

25:37.360 --> 25:42.400
that really showcases all of the goodies that are coming to the Plasma desktop.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.600
And it's the kind of things that have gotten me really hyped about Plasma

25:45.600 --> 25:50.000
and make me want to keep using it and keep trying out the next version,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.920
the next version, which actually ultimately maybe end up choosing Neon again.

25:53.920 --> 25:59.440
And so I had a chance to chat with Nate about the history of his mission

25:59.440 --> 26:04.320
to make Plasma more usable and also funding of that type of work.

26:04.320 --> 26:06.960
I've been wanting to get Nate Graham on the show for a while,

26:06.960 --> 26:10.080
and this week we had an opening and I emailed him late last night,

26:10.080 --> 26:12.560
and he took me up on the chance to come on the show

26:12.560 --> 26:15.520
and talk about some of the work that he's been doing with Plasma.

26:15.520 --> 26:20.080
And I love this, Nate, your self-described mission to make KDE Plasma

26:20.080 --> 26:26.720
the best and most widely used computer operating system interface on the planet Earth.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.560
That's a great mission.

26:28.560 --> 26:29.680
Nate, welcome to the show.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.440
Thanks so much. It's great to be here.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.720
So how are you accomplishing this mission?

26:34.720 --> 26:37.840
I've noticed what really caught my attention

26:37.840 --> 26:43.920
was you seem to have a big focus on polishing the usability rough edges of Plasma.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.240
In fact, it seems like this is something

26:46.240 --> 26:50.480
that's been kicking around in your head since 2017 at least.

26:50.480 --> 26:55.680
I saw a post where you're proposing improving usability,

26:55.680 --> 27:00.960
and then in September of 2017, there was a post of KDE's goals for 2018,

27:00.960 --> 27:04.960
and in there was a piece from you advocating for usability improvements.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.960
What's behind this mission?

27:07.520 --> 27:08.240
That's right.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.360
So it looks like you did a pretty good job of summarizing the history.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.960
I'll just fill in a couple of details.

27:12.960 --> 27:13.760
Please do.

27:13.760 --> 27:20.800
So back in late 2017, the KDE leadership basically asked the community,

27:20.800 --> 27:25.040
hey, what do you think we should focus on for the next couple of years?

27:25.040 --> 27:27.120
And I was a relatively new member at the time.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.720
I had done really hardly anything, but I thought, why not?

27:30.720 --> 27:33.760
Here's what I think we need, and I'm just going to put it out there.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.800
So I proposed my usability and productivity goal,

27:36.800 --> 27:40.320
and to my pleasant surprise, it seemed to have resonated,

27:40.320 --> 27:42.640
and people liked that, and it was chosen as a formal goal.

27:43.760 --> 27:48.800
So after that, a month or two passed, and not much really happened.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.480
And I realized if this was actually going to get done,

27:52.480 --> 27:56.240
I had to take the initiative on it because I was the one who proposed it.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.200
Nobody else was really going to do it before me,

27:59.200 --> 28:01.120
and I'd never really done anything like this before.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.320
But I said, you know what?

28:02.320 --> 28:03.440
Let's give it a try.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.560
I'm going to see what happens.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.720
And I decided to just start making lists.

28:08.720 --> 28:11.920
I made a list of things that I thought we needed,

28:11.920 --> 28:14.960
and I decided to start kind of poking people

28:14.960 --> 28:18.080
to see if I could get other people interested in it,

28:18.080 --> 28:20.160
and I started submitting some patches myself.

28:20.160 --> 28:23.840
And then as this went on, and things actually started to happen,

28:23.840 --> 28:26.160
I thought, hey, maybe people out there in the community

28:26.160 --> 28:27.840
might want to know what's going on.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.080
So I decided to start a blog about it

28:30.080 --> 28:32.080
after several other people urged me to.

28:32.080 --> 28:36.480
And well, we've pretty much been going from there for about,

28:36.480 --> 28:38.720
I would say, since like January of this year.

28:38.720 --> 28:39.200
Right.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.720
And there's no stopping me.

28:40.720 --> 28:41.920
I'm going to keep going forever.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.960
Good.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.200
And now you're 37 additions in.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.160
I know.

28:46.160 --> 28:50.720
And each one wets my appetite for the next release of Plasma.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.160
That's really like the net effect it's having here is this.

28:54.160 --> 28:54.640
I know.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.760
Isn't it amazing stuff?

28:55.760 --> 28:56.240
Me too.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.720
When I'm putting this together, I'm always thinking,

28:58.720 --> 29:01.040
holy crap, this is amazing stuff.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.800
I just cannot believe how amazing KDE contributors are.

29:04.800 --> 29:10.400
I mean, for example, right before we started doing this interview,

29:10.400 --> 29:12.720
I got an email notification about a patch

29:12.720 --> 29:16.000
that somebody submitted to fix a bug that was filed yesterday.

29:16.000 --> 29:16.500
Oh.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.520
So that kind of thing is amazing.

29:19.520 --> 29:22.080
And I feel like I'm seeing more and more of this

29:22.080 --> 29:24.880
as more people get interested and excited.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.560
And it's just an awesome thing to see.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.080
Now, are you still pretty heavily involved

29:28.080 --> 29:29.600
with the Kubuntu project as well?

29:30.320 --> 29:30.960
Yes, I am.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.800
Kubuntu is actually my home distro.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.040
It's the one that I'm talking to you on right now.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.920
And I personally feel that Kubuntu is a really great choice

29:39.920 --> 29:46.160
for KDE made sort of accessible for the average person.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.840
Rolling release distros are fantastic.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.160
And rolling release distros are, in many ways,

29:50.160 --> 29:53.840
the best way to get all of these usability and productivity upgrades

29:53.840 --> 29:55.040
that I blog about all the time.

29:55.040 --> 29:59.680
But for ordinary regular people who just kind of want to get stuff done,

29:59.680 --> 30:03.440
I think nothing beats the stability of a discrete release distro.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.240
And I think it's really important that Kubuntu provide that experience

30:06.240 --> 30:09.120
with a really high level of polish and integration

30:09.120 --> 30:13.760
so that it can kind of become the de facto KDE distro, in my opinion.

30:13.760 --> 30:14.800
I think that's fantastic.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.920
You know, when I think about deploying Plasma

30:17.920 --> 30:20.160
at like a workplace and office environment,

30:20.160 --> 30:23.440
I think here in our studio, for example,

30:23.440 --> 30:26.160
all of our production machines are on Kubuntu 18.04.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.600
Oh, that's wonderful.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.800
That's fantastic news.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.240
Rock solid, rock solid.

30:30.240 --> 30:33.680
Best, really, it's the best distro I think we've ever used in production.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.840
Now, on my personal machine, I got to admit, I roll KDE neon.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.760
But that's just because, really, it's your fault, Nate,

30:39.760 --> 30:40.560
because you get me excited.

30:41.760 --> 30:42.880
That's actually totally on you.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.320
Sometimes I actually tempt myself to use it.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.960
There are many times when I feel like,

30:50.960 --> 30:54.320
oh, man, I want to actually use some of these improvements myself,

30:54.320 --> 30:57.200
particularly to the input stack,

30:57.200 --> 31:05.200
which has gotten a lot of improvements in Plasma 5.13 and 5.14.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.320
And I'm stuck on 5.12 and I'm kind of chomping at the bit to do it.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.920
I kind of feel like if I don't eat my own dog food,

31:11.920 --> 31:13.360
it's a pretty shameful thing.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.360
So I'm going to definitely keep doing it.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.880
Yeah, yeah, there's always ways,

31:16.880 --> 31:19.280
like VMs and Docker containers and whatnot.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.240
In fact, that's what I do.

31:20.240 --> 31:23.520
I actually do all my development inside a KDE neon VM

31:23.520 --> 31:26.160
with everything built from source.

31:26.160 --> 31:33.120
And I think KDE neon is basically a near perfect development tool in that respect.

31:33.120 --> 31:37.840
It gives you great isolation from your host system

31:37.840 --> 31:39.600
and it lets you make all kinds of changes

31:39.600 --> 31:41.520
without worrying about blowing stuff up.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.040
You get everything that's KDE related pretty much rolling.

31:45.040 --> 31:45.840
So I mean, it's just great.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.280
I love developing in KDE neon.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.080
That's fantastic.

31:48.080 --> 31:48.880
I love hearing that.

31:48.880 --> 31:49.680
That's so great.

31:49.680 --> 31:55.120
And that means there's room for all types of KDE Plasma-powered distros

31:55.120 --> 31:57.280
or metadistros, don't call it a distro.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.280
Now, I noticed too in the bio,

31:59.280 --> 32:00.480
I was reading your Patreon page,

32:00.480 --> 32:02.000
which I want to talk about in a moment,

32:02.000 --> 32:03.200
a former Apple engineer.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.240
Does that change, you think, the look you have

32:06.240 --> 32:08.000
when you come in and look at the Plasma desktop?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.600
Did that influence the way you view visibility as a former Apple engineer?

32:12.240 --> 32:13.760
In fact, that was the core reason.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.320
In addition to being a former Apple engineer,

32:16.320 --> 32:20.880
I had been an Apple fan for pretty much my entire life starting at age six.

32:22.240 --> 32:26.800
And I think that the work that I did at Apple

32:26.800 --> 32:28.640
gave me a really great opportunity

32:28.640 --> 32:32.240
to see how really focused development teams work

32:32.240 --> 32:35.120
to produce software that's of high technical quality,

32:35.120 --> 32:37.680
but also exceptionally high usability.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.280
Apple has that reputation in the world.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.200
And I feel like for the most part, it's justified.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.920
And when I left Apple in late 2016,

32:45.920 --> 32:50.960
I decided that I just wanted to start working on Linux full time.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.320
And I kind of bounced around for a little bit.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.520
I started with Gnome and-

32:53.520 --> 32:54.560
What was that draw?

32:54.560 --> 32:56.080
What was the draw to Linux there?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.720
I mean, especially coming from a long history with Apple,

32:58.720 --> 33:00.720
what drew you to Linux there, do you think?

33:00.720 --> 33:02.480
Well, that's a really good question.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.000
There were a number of things.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.920
I started to feel like open source, just as a movement,

33:09.920 --> 33:11.280
made a lot of sense for me.

33:11.920 --> 33:16.880
And I started to feel like the inherent problem

33:16.880 --> 33:20.400
with closed source software is that regular people

33:20.400 --> 33:23.600
don't have much of an impact on it unless they're on the inside.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.480
And a lot of my friends and family had gotten in the habit

33:26.480 --> 33:28.720
of telling me their favorite Apple bugs

33:28.720 --> 33:31.280
and file this bug for me, see if you can get this fixed.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.360
And for a while I was actually doing that

33:33.360 --> 33:34.640
and I felt like that was really good.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.200
But after a while, I started to take a longer view

33:37.200 --> 33:39.760
and it was like, well, what is this like for people

33:39.760 --> 33:41.440
who don't have a person on the inside?

33:42.480 --> 33:45.280
How are they going to get their pet issues resolved?

33:45.280 --> 33:47.760
Because despite the fact that Apple products offer

33:47.760 --> 33:50.480
exceptionally high usability, nothing's perfect, right?

33:50.480 --> 33:52.480
And people are going to find bugs in any software.

33:52.480 --> 33:55.040
And if you don't happen to have somebody on the inside,

33:55.040 --> 33:56.560
you don't really have that many options

33:56.560 --> 33:58.160
when it comes to closed source software.

33:58.160 --> 34:02.160
And I just, the more I learned about the open source movement,

34:02.160 --> 34:03.920
the more I just sort of liked the idea

34:03.920 --> 34:07.040
of participatory software development

34:07.040 --> 34:10.080
and an open attitude and the opportunity

34:10.080 --> 34:11.600
for anybody to contribute.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.560
And not only to contribute, but to go through a pipeline

34:14.560 --> 34:19.760
of starting as a user and then becoming a connected user

34:19.760 --> 34:22.880
who's engaging with developers and then eventually morphing

34:22.880 --> 34:24.240
into a developer themselves.

34:24.240 --> 34:25.760
And that was exactly my path.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.840
When I started with all this stuff,

34:27.840 --> 34:30.800
I mean, I'll be the first to tell you I was not a programmer

34:30.800 --> 34:33.440
and I'm still not that much of a programmer today.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.680
I'm a build and release engineer by trade

34:35.680 --> 34:36.960
so I can do some scripting,

34:36.960 --> 34:41.520
but being able to learn how to do software development

34:41.520 --> 34:44.240
from the KDE community has been absolutely tremendous.

34:44.240 --> 34:47.520
And I feel like if somebody as dumb as I can do it,

34:47.520 --> 34:48.720
anybody can do it really.

34:48.720 --> 34:52.560
Well, I mean, it seems like you have gotten your hands

34:52.560 --> 34:53.600
on all kinds of different apps.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.240
It looks like, I mean, just reading over some of your profile,

34:56.240 --> 34:58.960
there's a lot of areas you've touched now recently.

34:58.960 --> 35:03.360
And I think that's where the Patreon thing

35:03.360 --> 35:05.680
is sort of a fascinating opportunity

35:05.680 --> 35:06.880
for open source developers.

35:06.880 --> 35:09.680
I'd like to get your thoughts on this because it seems to me,

35:09.680 --> 35:13.040
so right now you've got, as we record, 81 patrons.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.120
Proudly, I'm saying I'm one of them.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.720
And I think it's a great idea

35:16.720 --> 35:19.360
because if that were to grow,

35:20.000 --> 35:22.560
you could proportionately dedicate more of your time

35:22.560 --> 35:25.360
to learning what you need to learn to help more,

35:25.360 --> 35:28.240
to triage more bugs, to touch more projects.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.520
So what are your thoughts on using Patreon as a funding platform?

35:31.520 --> 35:35.360
Even in 2018, where there seems to be some Patreon fatigue,

35:35.360 --> 35:38.000
people are not as willing as they might have been

35:38.000 --> 35:40.240
back in 2017 or 2016,

35:40.240 --> 35:42.160
but it still seems like a great opportunity.

35:42.160 --> 35:45.040
I don't have a lot of experience with the cultural side.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.320
So it's news to me that people have Patreon fatigue.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.920
So if that's the case, that's a little bit unfortunate.

35:51.920 --> 35:55.680
But I feel like this can be a really great supplement.

35:55.680 --> 36:00.160
But ultimately, that's all it really can be is as a supplement.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.600
Software development is an incredibly challenging

36:03.600 --> 36:04.560
and difficult field.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.320
And out there in the private sector,

36:06.320 --> 36:09.280
people routinely make six figures doing this.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.640
And I mean, I think with some private sector experience,

36:12.640 --> 36:15.280
we've all known people who bring home fat paychecks

36:15.280 --> 36:16.800
without actually doing all that much.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.120
And you compare and contrast that with so many people

36:19.120 --> 36:22.480
in the open source community who are just being absolute rock stars

36:22.480 --> 36:25.360
and getting paid nothing or very little for it.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.280
So I think Patreon is fantastic.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.600
And I also have several other ones set up.

36:29.600 --> 36:33.440
I've got LiberoPay, I've got PayPal as well.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.720
But I think the best funding model is for

36:36.720 --> 36:38.640
is what essentially the Krita people are doing.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.120
They have a foundation, the Krita Foundation,

36:41.120 --> 36:42.560
and they aggregate donations.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.280
And they actually use this to formally pay developers

36:45.280 --> 36:46.960
with actual real salaries.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.000
I believe the Linux Mint people have done this too.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.600
And in my personal opinion,

36:51.600 --> 36:55.280
this is really the only payment and funding model

36:55.280 --> 36:57.280
that makes sustainable long-term sense,

36:57.280 --> 37:02.160
which is that if you want developers,

37:02.160 --> 37:04.320
you're pretty much going to need to pay developers.

37:04.320 --> 37:05.760
And if you're not going to pay developers,

37:05.760 --> 37:08.080
what you're going to get are interested,

37:08.080 --> 37:10.400
passionate volunteers, which are fantastic,

37:10.400 --> 37:12.240
but it's a hit and miss proposition.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.960
And even the most interested volunteer

37:14.960 --> 37:16.960
will eventually go through stages of their life

37:16.960 --> 37:18.560
where they're not going to have time for it anymore

37:18.560 --> 37:19.280
if they're not paid.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.000
I mean, now that I've been doing this for a little while,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.600
not anywhere near as long as many people in the KDE community,

37:25.600 --> 37:28.400
I've noticed that people who are really passionate at first

37:28.400 --> 37:30.240
often just drop out after a couple of months,

37:30.240 --> 37:31.360
not because they're bored of it

37:31.360 --> 37:32.480
or they don't want to do it anymore,

37:32.480 --> 37:36.320
but because they got married, they started having kids,

37:36.320 --> 37:38.720
they got a new job that requires them to commute

37:38.720 --> 37:40.560
and they can't be in front of a computer all day,

37:40.560 --> 37:41.280
that sort of thing.

37:41.280 --> 37:42.640
And those are the generous scenarios.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.680
There can be other reasons too.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.320
That's right.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.160
Exactly, many other reasons.

37:46.160 --> 37:50.640
And so relying on volunteers is an inherently fragile proposition

37:50.640 --> 37:53.200
and it relies on having existing members

37:53.200 --> 37:56.640
being willing to constantly train and retrain new people

37:56.640 --> 37:59.200
as they come in and leave and come in and leave.

37:59.200 --> 38:03.600
I think if there was a dedicated core of paid developers,

38:03.600 --> 38:06.000
you could see that they develop a real culture

38:06.000 --> 38:08.640
of a sort of self-sustaining culture

38:08.640 --> 38:11.360
where other people help out as well

38:11.360 --> 38:13.200
and the knowledge becomes distributed

38:13.200 --> 38:14.560
and you don't see so much churn.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.160
That sort of happens right now in the KDE community

38:18.160 --> 38:19.600
with Blue Systems.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.360
Blue Systems sponsors a whole bunch of Plasma developers.

38:23.360 --> 38:26.080
They're all paid, they work, they do it all the time.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.240
And that's one of the reasons why the quality of Plasma

38:28.240 --> 38:31.600
is now so high and constantly getting better.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.360
And these guys aren't just working on Plasma,

38:33.360 --> 38:35.440
they're working on frameworks, they're working on apps,

38:35.440 --> 38:36.560
they're doing all kinds of stuff.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.480
So I think that's the sort of payment paid development model

38:40.480 --> 38:43.520
that we need to try to make happen everywhere else.

38:44.720 --> 38:45.920
It does take some admin,

38:45.920 --> 38:47.920
but I could completely see what you're saying,

38:47.920 --> 38:51.120
how it's more sustainable and it's more like a real job

38:51.120 --> 38:52.720
to the developers involved.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.480
It takes a large funding initiative

38:54.480 --> 38:57.040
and a foundation to admin all of that.

38:57.040 --> 39:01.440
But if major projects like KDE seem like a good sized project

39:01.440 --> 39:03.280
for something like that and others as well,

39:03.280 --> 39:04.480
that's a fascinating idea.

39:04.480 --> 39:08.240
So Patreon in a way is sort of not a stopgap,

39:08.240 --> 39:11.120
but it's an intermediary solution

39:11.120 --> 39:13.120
where direct consumers of the product

39:13.120 --> 39:15.840
can still try to help fund the development

39:15.840 --> 39:18.800
until a larger solution comes along perhaps.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.240
That's exactly how I see it.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.760
You just phrased it perfectly

39:21.760 --> 39:24.480
with about a thousand times fewer words than I did.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.080
Well, Nate, I really appreciate

39:28.080 --> 39:29.280
all of the work you've been doing.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.400
I will link to your blog if folks haven't seen that yet,

39:32.400 --> 39:35.200
linuxunplug.com slash 268.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.840
We'll have a link in there to Nate's usability posts.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.480
Also, you can go to planet.kde.org

39:40.480 --> 39:42.800
if you want to see some of the other developers posts

39:42.800 --> 39:43.440
to their blogs.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.600
It's a great aggregator of all of that stuff.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.240
And we will have a link to Nate's Patreon,

39:48.240 --> 39:51.200
which is ngram, right?

39:51.200 --> 39:52.880
It's ngram, patreon.com slash ngram.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.400
Yeah, if you want to just go there directly,

39:54.400 --> 39:56.080
but we'll have a link in the show notes.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.600
Nate, thanks so much for coming on the show

39:57.600 --> 39:58.560
and stay in touch.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.240
I'd love to chat again in the future.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.200
Thanks so much, Chris.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.080
It was fantastic.

40:02.080 --> 40:03.040
I had a great time.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.560
He had some really interesting ideas

40:04.560 --> 40:07.520
around how to fund long-term sustainably

40:07.520 --> 40:09.360
large open source projects.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.560
And I thought that was a particularly new and good

40:12.560 --> 40:16.240
insight on a potential solution there.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.880
And it's sort of interesting timing, too,

40:18.880 --> 40:22.400
because it's lining up right with a new venture that's

40:22.400 --> 40:24.640
launching that I want to tell you about in just a moment.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.160
But I just want to say thank you to Nate.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.640
He also is stopped by the live show.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.320
So he's chatting away with folks in the chat room,

40:30.320 --> 40:31.120
which is awesome.

40:31.120 --> 40:31.840
Just so great.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.960
It's incredibly exciting to have someone like that

40:34.960 --> 40:37.840
with the commercial experience he's got with Apple

40:37.840 --> 40:39.360
coming into the open source community

40:39.360 --> 40:41.040
and bashing on something like KDE.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.040
That's fantastic.

40:43.040 --> 40:43.440
Yeah.

40:43.440 --> 40:48.720
And I think the posts do a lot for encouraging people

40:48.720 --> 40:52.960
to check out and stay tuned into what Plasma Desktop is doing.

40:52.960 --> 40:57.360
Just in a sort of, I don't know, it's not like a tease,

40:57.360 --> 41:00.160
but it's a bit of you get, you're

41:00.160 --> 41:02.880
able to appreciate all of the work that's going into it.

41:02.880 --> 41:03.920
That's probably what I'm trying to say.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.800
Like we were just talking with Cassidy about how so much stuff

41:06.800 --> 41:08.880
is going into Juno that he's struggling to even

41:08.880 --> 41:10.960
write up to outline it all.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.960
But this way, this weekly approach that Nate's taken

41:15.680 --> 41:19.120
gives you the space to sort of enjoy

41:19.120 --> 41:20.880
some of the finer, smaller little things,

41:20.880 --> 41:23.840
like new icons and when you right click in the menu

41:23.840 --> 41:25.920
and things that are nice to know about

41:25.920 --> 41:28.560
but would otherwise get lost in a much larger noise

41:28.560 --> 41:29.600
around a new release.

41:29.600 --> 41:34.240
And so it helps build appreciation for all of the work

41:34.240 --> 41:36.560
that these people are contributing to a project.

41:36.560 --> 41:37.840
And it creates hype.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.160
And I think it's in part responsible for,

41:40.160 --> 41:42.480
as Wimpy puts it, the ascendancy we're seeing

41:42.480 --> 41:44.160
of the Plasma Desktop right now.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.880
And it's got people like us going on a podcast

41:46.880 --> 41:49.920
and talking about it, which amplifies the hype a bit.

41:50.560 --> 41:51.760
And we're using it in production.

41:51.760 --> 41:52.720
We're using it in real life.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.560
Yeah, it seems like it's a good position, right?

41:54.560 --> 41:55.680
They've got a great community going.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.720
They've got active users and their software these days

41:58.720 --> 41:59.440
is just great.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.320
I keep getting a steady stream of one or two,

42:04.320 --> 42:05.600
at least a week.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.800
And this is months after we did our Plasma episode

42:08.800 --> 42:10.080
of people saying, all right, I'm trying it.

42:10.080 --> 42:11.840
I'm taking the Plasma challenge and I'm really liking it.

42:11.840 --> 42:13.120
I'm still getting that.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.320
I'm still using it over here.

42:15.840 --> 42:17.840
I've been using it for about three months every day.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.520
I have my first lockup today.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.080
But other than that, it's been fantastic.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.200
Really, really fantastic.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.320
It could have made it one more day

42:24.320 --> 42:25.680
and then that wouldn't have gone on out there.

42:25.680 --> 42:28.720
Yeah, that's how it always works.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.000
Well, it's better than no.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.440
Yeah, well, I suppose so.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.120
It does last a little bit longer.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.760
So the conversation there at the end was kind of about funding

42:35.760 --> 42:37.600
and what's a sustainable approach for somebody

42:37.600 --> 42:40.080
who's making a nice contribution,

42:40.080 --> 42:42.080
doesn't even need to be their primary revenue source.

42:42.080 --> 42:42.800
Of course, that'd be great.

42:42.800 --> 42:48.800
But just as like a secondary to really justify the time investment.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.400
Well, a new startup called Tidelift hopes to help

42:53.200 --> 42:55.360
these developers achieve just that

42:55.360 --> 42:59.680
and get paid with a business model the company compares to Netflix.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.360
So Tidelift is a startup right now.

43:01.360 --> 43:04.960
It just got 30 million in funding, at least I think.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.960
And the idea is that a company pays a subscription to Tidelift,

43:08.960 --> 43:10.320
which then takes a cut

43:10.320 --> 43:12.800
and then distributes the remainder to open source projects

43:13.600 --> 43:18.160
and the subscribers will in exchange get assurances

43:18.160 --> 43:21.200
that the software will be properly maintained, quote unquote.

43:21.200 --> 43:25.040
So customers pay Tidelift and then their pitch here

43:25.040 --> 43:28.000
is developers can focus on code instead of sales and marketing,

43:28.000 --> 43:29.760
getting their income from Tidelift.

43:30.560 --> 43:33.200
And then when a customer signs up for Tidelift,

43:33.200 --> 43:34.720
they go analyze your code base,

43:34.720 --> 43:37.280
go see all the neat open source projects you're using

43:37.280 --> 43:40.320
and then bill you based on funding each of those projects.

43:40.320 --> 43:40.880
Right.

43:40.880 --> 43:43.520
Do they contribute any of that work back upstream

43:43.520 --> 43:46.160
or is it, you know, you pay for it, you get to keep all that work?

43:46.160 --> 43:50.240
No, the idea is you're paying an open source developer's time.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.800
So they look at how many open source projects

43:52.800 --> 43:55.440
your company is dependent on, Tidelift then says,

43:55.440 --> 43:59.280
all right, your fee is X because of the amount of projects that you use.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.760
You cut that check to Tidelift.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.800
They then go engage with the open source developer and say,

44:04.800 --> 44:08.560
we can pay you X a month if you will then commit

44:08.560 --> 44:11.600
to maintaining the software for X period of time

44:11.600 --> 44:15.680
and to also keep Tidelift and our customers informed of major changes.

44:15.680 --> 44:19.520
And then Tidelift goes back to the subscriber, the customer and says,

44:19.520 --> 44:21.680
all right, here's the pledge by the open source developer

44:21.680 --> 44:24.400
to maintain these super important projects that you depend on.

44:24.400 --> 44:25.840
That's kind of the idea, right?

44:25.840 --> 44:30.080
Have they got any track history in how much they're paying developers

44:30.640 --> 44:32.880
for their commitment to these projects?

44:32.880 --> 44:36.720
Yeah, that has been the very thing that Wired tried to get from them

44:36.720 --> 44:40.640
and they didn't really have much to offer there.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.520
They've made a couple of blog posts about developers

44:43.520 --> 44:45.200
that they've got brought in on the team,

44:45.200 --> 44:48.720
but they haven't really been clear on the amount of money the developers get.

44:48.720 --> 44:52.320
They say, so, okay, here's the numbers, they got 15 million in venture capital.

44:52.320 --> 44:53.520
Sorry, it's not 30.

44:53.520 --> 44:58.560
And they announced last week that they set aside a million of that 15 million

44:58.560 --> 45:00.640
for new developers that join the program

45:00.640 --> 45:06.000
and the developers will be paid at least $10,000 over a two-year period at least.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.480
That's all they've said publicly in terms of funding.

45:08.480 --> 45:10.160
$5,000 a year.

45:10.160 --> 45:10.720
Yeah.

45:10.720 --> 45:11.200
I'm spying.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.640
Between hundreds of people.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.920
It's not even a cup of tea.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.760
Here's the other big problem with this.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.760
That's just called a consultancy company.

45:17.760 --> 45:21.680
And of course, I can see why investors would put money into it.

45:21.680 --> 45:24.320
If they acquired the developer base,

45:24.880 --> 45:27.760
of course, they will be a powerful consulting company

45:27.760 --> 45:32.000
because there is a brain shortage of skilled developers.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.320
So eventually they would be able.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.760
And what are the conditions for the developers to be tied into them?

45:37.760 --> 45:40.800
Because otherwise I don't see them making money long-term anyways.

45:40.800 --> 45:45.680
It seems to me this is a middleman in a business negotiation

45:45.680 --> 45:48.720
with open source developers that doesn't need to be there.

45:48.720 --> 45:54.480
And companies are serious about engaging with a project that they're dependent on.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.720
Just go and contact.

45:56.720 --> 46:04.240
It's very easy to find the key people behind a project or a foundation or whatever.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.800
Just find those people, approach them directly,

46:06.800 --> 46:09.920
and that's probably the best way to invest your money

46:09.920 --> 46:12.240
behind a technology that you're dependent upon.

46:12.240 --> 46:15.120
And more foundations on the open source side would help, I think.

46:15.120 --> 46:17.120
I think the other thing to consider here is the pitch.

46:17.760 --> 46:19.280
This is what raises a red flag for me.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.680
Netflix for open source, that just makes my skin crawl.

46:23.680 --> 46:24.640
What does that even mean?

46:25.200 --> 46:26.560
Well, that's a pitch for investors.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.320
That's not for the developer side of things.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.120
Come on.

46:29.120 --> 46:33.120
I wonder how Netflix feel about their brand being associated with this as well.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.600
We shall see.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.880
I thought that was interesting though.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.080
It's another crack at this.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.520
And I don't know, I think Nate's idea is a better one.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.040
And then Wimpy's right.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.600
Then companies could just interface with that foundation

46:45.600 --> 46:47.920
and there would be an established process for that.

46:47.920 --> 46:50.000
It does seem like the better solution.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.840
So let's talk about something new that's getting some attention.

46:53.840 --> 46:58.720
A Linux distro that's optimized for the Windows subsystem for Linux.

46:58.720 --> 47:04.400
It's based on Debian and the core developer Hayden is joining us today.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.000
Hayden, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.200
Hi, thanks for having me.

47:07.200 --> 47:07.840
Hello, Hayden.

47:07.840 --> 47:08.800
It's good to have you here.

47:08.800 --> 47:13.040
So you had a chance to chat with Joe Resington, my co-host and Wes's co-host,

47:13.040 --> 47:15.040
who's been filming for me on Linux Action News,

47:15.600 --> 47:19.680
to answer a few questions so that way Joe could accurately cover the story in LAN.

47:19.680 --> 47:23.760
And he recorded that chat so we could refer to it for notes.

47:23.760 --> 47:26.160
And I thought it was so great that I would just play it here.

47:26.160 --> 47:32.080
It's a bit rough, but it was a great deep dive into why WLinux has been created

47:32.080 --> 47:35.120
and why the Windows subsystem for Linux

47:35.120 --> 47:38.000
might need a distro that's built specifically for it.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.360
Thanks for joining me, Hayden.

47:39.360 --> 47:40.320
Thanks for having me, Joe.

47:40.880 --> 47:43.040
So you're here to talk about WLinux.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.800
What exactly is that then?

47:44.800 --> 47:50.240
WLinux is a Debian derivative that is designed to function on Windows subsystem for Linux.

47:50.880 --> 47:55.120
It is a distro that is customized for that environment.

47:55.120 --> 47:57.040
And so this is based on Debian then?

47:57.040 --> 48:04.080
Yes, this is a derivative of Debian Stretch with a handful of packages

48:04.080 --> 48:10.640
from the Debian testing branch that have been brought down, mostly Python and other dev tools

48:10.640 --> 48:14.880
that have a more updated version in the testing branch that are fairly stable.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.160
And so what makes this different from the version of Debian

48:18.160 --> 48:20.960
that's already available in the subsystem?

48:20.960 --> 48:23.840
So a free distro Debian is already available.

48:24.560 --> 48:30.560
And if you're first getting into WSL, which is short for Windows subsystem for Linux,

48:30.560 --> 48:31.680
you might want to give it a shot.

48:31.680 --> 48:37.600
But WLinux has a lot of customizations and additional packages that make working

48:38.480 --> 48:42.080
in this kind of hybrid environment a little bit easier

48:42.080 --> 48:45.440
between Windows and between Linux at the same time.

48:45.440 --> 48:48.160
So one of the big differences is no system D then.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.360
Why is that?

48:49.360 --> 48:55.040
Well, part of that is because system D doesn't work well on Windows subsystem for Linux.

48:56.080 --> 48:59.440
So it was kind of a no brainer to pull out.

48:59.440 --> 49:09.040
I'm a big fan of the dev win project and appreciate in it freedom from Unix philosophy standpoint.

49:10.080 --> 49:14.560
But mostly it was just taking up space on WLinux.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.680
So we took it out.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.640
SysV is there.

49:17.680 --> 49:23.280
If you install some programs that have a hard system D dependency,

49:23.280 --> 49:26.000
the lib system D will come in.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.320
But it was mostly just a matter of size.

49:28.320 --> 49:28.800
Okay.

49:28.800 --> 49:31.200
But why didn't you just go with dev one then?

49:31.200 --> 49:34.000
Because it isn't that just Debian with no system D.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.760
I did do testing with dev one.

49:36.480 --> 49:47.280
It added some more complexity to the build process with no apparent improvement to the user.

49:48.560 --> 49:52.720
And kind of being a Unix-y guy believing in Unix principles,

49:52.720 --> 50:00.400
I didn't see needlessly interjecting complexity for something that we can actually just do

50:00.400 --> 50:04.640
on the Debian from the Debian sources ourselves.

50:05.680 --> 50:15.760
Also, we do know that people might want to bring in packages from upstream GNOME and KDE

50:15.760 --> 50:17.840
to run those apps on Windows.

50:17.840 --> 50:24.960
And if we had a hard block on system D, they wouldn't be able to run the most recent version of those.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.480
Okay, that makes sense.

50:26.480 --> 50:31.280
So talking of GUI stuff, I mean, the subsystem is not supposed to be for GUI applications,

50:31.280 --> 50:36.880
but you've made it easy to run Google Chrome and Visual Studio and other GUI stuff.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.080
What's all that about?

50:38.080 --> 50:43.280
So this isn't an officially supported feature of WSL, but it is available.

50:43.280 --> 50:48.400
And there's a few tweaks we do to make that work with an external X client.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.280
There's a few, there's a couple of free ones available.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.280
My favorite is X410.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.840
It's available in the Microsoft Store for $5.

50:56.560 --> 51:04.640
And we just made some tweaks so that the, for example, the libGL is rendered on the Windows side,

51:04.640 --> 51:08.800
where you can get some more acceleration out of those apps.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.480
And it's very functional.

51:10.480 --> 51:20.560
In fact, there are people, although I don't recommend it, who do boot WSL into a full-fledged Xfce, KDE, or GNOME desktop.

51:21.920 --> 51:25.440
You know, sometimes in a separate window, like you would a virtual machine,

51:25.440 --> 51:30.560
and sometimes right next to their Windows apps on the same screen.

51:30.560 --> 51:32.560
People are doing interesting things with this.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.560
I heard about Flatpaks.

51:34.560 --> 51:39.680
Up and running on WSL this week, presumably they work reasonably well.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.440
And what about Snaps as well?

51:41.440 --> 51:45.280
So far, Snaps, you know, are a little bit of a challenge.

51:45.280 --> 51:51.360
Flatpaks are working better, so we'll see where that goes.

51:52.160 --> 51:56.640
Snap has some dependencies that we have to work through to see if we can't make those work.

51:56.640 --> 51:59.440
I thought the chat that Joe and Hayden had was fantastic.

51:59.440 --> 52:00.960
In fact, it was a really good one.

52:00.960 --> 52:05.760
It went on for quite a bit, but I wanted to take a moment and bring Hayden in live, since he's here,

52:05.760 --> 52:08.800
and chat about WLinux a bit with him.

52:08.800 --> 52:13.760
And I wanted to maybe double down before we've gone too far on some of the issues with SystemD

52:13.760 --> 52:15.760
under the Windows subsystem for Linux.

52:15.760 --> 52:20.160
I have never really spent much time with the Windows subsystem for Linux, Hayden,

52:20.160 --> 52:27.040
but looking at bug reports, it seems that the WSL has its own process that it wants to run at PID 1.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.040
Is that one of those things that you want to do?

52:29.040 --> 52:33.360
That it wants to run at PID 1, is that one of the issues with SystemD on WSL?

52:33.360 --> 52:40.000
The issue with SystemD on WSL is that it's not meant at this point to run servers.

52:40.000 --> 52:45.360
It's not meant to run ongoing processes that you access from the background.

52:45.360 --> 52:53.600
That may change in the future as Microsoft just announced Windows Server 2019 with WSL as a feature.

52:53.600 --> 53:03.200
So that may change, and we may see more growth on that use of WSL to run Linux processes.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.200
We'll see where it goes.

53:05.200 --> 53:12.000
I found it really interesting, some of the work you've put into running the graphical applications like Chrome.

53:12.000 --> 53:17.200
I recently saw, I can't remember where, you were talking about fixing an issue with Chromium

53:17.200 --> 53:22.800
from running it from WLinux, which I think is great, because that's been an area

53:22.800 --> 53:26.640
I've been really curious, like if I was ever to play around with WSL, I would love to do that.

53:26.640 --> 53:32.480
In regards to the SNAP issue you ran into, I invite you to chat with Mr. Martin Wimpress here

53:32.480 --> 53:37.600
in our virtual log, he could probably help with any issues there, because he's working on that canonical.

53:37.600 --> 53:42.080
I guess probably SNAP must be dependent on something that's not in WLinux now?

53:42.080 --> 53:48.480
Yeah, well the main thing is the dependency on SystemD support, but we do have a shim that can work around that,

53:48.480 --> 53:55.200
which is how we delivered SNAP support in 14.04, which was built upon Upstart.

53:55.200 --> 54:03.440
So Hayden, I'm Martin Wimpress, I work on the SNAPcraft team.

54:03.440 --> 54:09.600
Find me on Twitter at m underscore Wimpress and I'll be happy to help.

54:09.600 --> 54:14.800
Absolutely, I will do that because I want to work with you on that, Flatpaks as well.

54:14.800 --> 54:19.840
Yeah, we're testing an issue right now with Google Chrome, the latest version 69.

54:19.840 --> 54:23.440
We're working through some libgl acceleration issues.

54:23.440 --> 54:27.680
We have an open issue on the GitHub and we're troubleshooting that.

54:27.680 --> 54:34.400
As far as we know, it affects most of the WSL distros available,

54:34.400 --> 54:38.640
but we're the ones actually doing the investigation,

54:38.640 --> 54:44.800
pulling logs, seeing how we can fix this for WSL users.

54:44.800 --> 54:49.440
Yeah, it seems like that could be an interesting impact that your distribution could have,

54:49.440 --> 54:53.040
is by really focusing in on this like no other distribution is,

54:53.040 --> 54:58.640
you're going to push up against these edge cases that could drive future improvements to the subsystem.

54:58.640 --> 55:03.840
So I think that's great, and I wonder if it's also going to be revenue sustainable potentially,

55:03.840 --> 55:11.200
because I noticed you're selling it for $19.99, it's on sale right now for $9.99,

55:11.200 --> 55:16.160
and that's in the Microsoft Store, which is of course the way you get it into the subsystem for Linux.

55:16.160 --> 55:20.240
Do you think this might be at some point revenue sustainable?

55:20.240 --> 55:24.560
So that's our long-term goal, and we've talked a lot about different sustainability models

55:24.560 --> 55:27.760
for open source projects in this episode,

55:27.760 --> 55:31.760
and I think what we need to realize is that people have been paying for Linux

55:31.760 --> 55:34.400
on a commercial and enterprise level for a long time,

55:34.400 --> 55:40.080
and that's been sponsoring a lot of the innovations we all enjoy in community distros.

55:40.080 --> 55:47.920
So what I see is a democratization of that process with Krita, with elementary OS,

55:47.920 --> 55:52.160
with other projects, not so much the one you mentioned in the interim,

55:52.160 --> 55:59.920
but where the users, the open source users themselves are being entrepreneurial,

55:59.920 --> 56:04.000
taking ownership of these, pushing them along, and commercializing them

56:04.000 --> 56:09.520
so that you can push these developments out to other people.

56:09.520 --> 56:14.080
Another good example of this is CodeWeavers, who's worked on crossover

56:14.080 --> 56:18.320
and have worked with Valve on Proton.

56:18.320 --> 56:25.200
So there's always an angle sometimes to commercialize these, and we give back.

56:25.200 --> 56:30.720
One of the examples is we already identified a package that's just not available anywhere

56:30.720 --> 56:34.960
as an app, in an app repo, and we're hosting it.

56:34.960 --> 56:43.040
So you're welcome to use our app repo in any existing Debian or Ubuntu distro

56:43.040 --> 56:45.360
to install that package.

56:45.360 --> 56:49.760
I noticed also that you mentioned one of the features is faster patching

56:49.760 --> 56:54.320
than other upstream distributions for subsystem-specific bugs,

56:54.320 --> 56:58.320
and that you're specifically monitoring subsystem-related CVEs.

56:58.320 --> 57:01.200
Is that delivered through that repo as well, those fixes?

57:01.200 --> 57:03.200
So the fixes aren't delivered through the repo.

57:03.200 --> 57:09.600
The repo is currently simply delivering packages and package updates to our custom packages.

57:09.600 --> 57:17.520
We are in the process of rolling out a new onboarding experience for users.

57:17.520 --> 57:22.400
We had so many requests for packages, it simply was not possible

57:22.400 --> 57:27.920
to ship everyone's editor and everyone's tools in one.

57:27.920 --> 57:31.840
So we're going to create a front-end where you can go through

57:31.840 --> 57:35.840
when you launch WLinux the first time and specify,

57:35.840 --> 57:38.400
I'm a Python developer, install all my Python.

57:39.520 --> 57:46.560
I want to use NeoVim or code, and we will take care of that for you.

57:46.560 --> 57:50.560
And then we're going to build auto-updating into that going forward

57:50.560 --> 57:55.360
so that everyone, regardless of whether you're building it off the GitHub

57:55.360 --> 57:57.200
or downloading it from the store,

57:57.200 --> 58:03.360
will always have the latest availability to the features, so there won't be a gap there.

58:03.360 --> 58:07.840
So one example of this was a problem in a relatively...

58:07.840 --> 58:13.280
So WSL doesn't implement IP tables yet, or very well at all.

58:14.400 --> 58:19.840
And there was a package in Ubuntu that broke called EBTables.

58:19.840 --> 58:24.560
And it's an obscure package, and it did something in the install script

58:25.840 --> 58:31.520
that broke apt and basically prevented everyone on Ubuntu 18.04

58:31.520 --> 58:34.320
on WSL from updating for a few weeks.

58:34.320 --> 58:40.160
Well, we worked, and I give credit to Ubuntu for helping us get that fixed,

58:40.160 --> 58:45.200
but it took a few weeks, and we could have pushed that out in a day or two.

58:45.200 --> 58:49.280
Yeah, and again, I think that's going to be one of the great side contributions

58:49.280 --> 58:53.440
or direct contributions, really, of the project existing, is pushing on those edges.

58:53.440 --> 58:56.160
Well, Hayden, thank you for taking the time to chat with me

58:56.160 --> 59:00.720
and for chatting with Joe to get the coverage right on Linux Action News.

59:00.720 --> 59:04.400
I'll put links to a bunch of information about the project

59:04.400 --> 59:07.200
as well as the Microsoft Store link, because like I mentioned,

59:07.200 --> 59:09.920
it is on sale for 50% off right now if you want to play around with it.

59:09.920 --> 59:12.560
I know we have Windows users out there in that audience, Wes.

59:12.560 --> 59:15.760
Yeah, you're stuck. Maybe you don't want to run a VM, you don't need a VM.

59:15.760 --> 59:18.240
Hey, now you've got a custom-tailored distribution.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.320
Yeah, so good work, Hayden. I hope it keeps up.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.320
I know some people have been a little like, what is this?

59:22.320 --> 59:23.920
But I say good on you,

59:23.920 --> 59:26.720
and I'm curious to see where the project goes in the future.

59:26.720 --> 59:29.440
Any hints where we're going after this? What's next?

59:29.440 --> 59:33.440
So we're looking right now after we get the onboarding experience done,

59:33.440 --> 59:34.960
we're looking at internationalization.

59:35.600 --> 59:40.080
WLinux is unexpectedly popular in China and Japan.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.920
You know, it took me completely by surprise,

59:43.920 --> 59:47.200
so we're adding in foreign language support as quickly as possible.

59:47.200 --> 59:51.440
And then we're going to be adding Arm64 support to support Windows on ARM devices.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.960
I love it. That's interesting.

59:54.960 --> 59:57.760
Well, do keep us informed on how it goes. Keep us up to date.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.360
I'd love to follow the progress of things,

59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.320
and you're welcome back any time to update us on any major developments.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.760
Thank you so much. I do appreciate it.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:07.920
You bet. Well, let's do something that we should do a lot more of,

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.640
to be honest with you, and that's read folks' emails and follow-ups

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.920
and all those kinds of things.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.080
How about I take this first one here, Wes?

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.880
Because John writes in to address you.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.840
So I'll read this one here.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.480
He says, I took note of Wes mentioning

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:23.920
a possible root on ZFS setup for his new ThinkPad.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.800
I would definitely recommend giving this a shot.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.720
I don't know what distro you plan on using,

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.720
but in the past few years, I've been using nothing but root on ZFS

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.720
on Arch with binary updates.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.080
And he points you out to, there's an Arch ZFS GitHub page.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.560
But he says, I also wasn't quite happy

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.640
with the way Linux supported boot environments,

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.920
which is a nice feature when you use ZFS.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.960
It really is, yeah.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.400
And you could really dig this, I think.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.920
So he wrote his own.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.560
He calls it ZD environment and or Zed environment.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.280
Zed environment.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.040
And he links to it in the email.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.920
And he says, it removes the worry of kernel updates

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.080
or system changes causing issues

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.080
since you can create a new boot environment

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.080
and you make your changes there.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.120
If you happen to give root on ZFS a shot

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.800
and you're looking for a boot environment client,

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.440
please take a look at it and best of luck with your new computer.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.760
John, that is awesome.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.440
I'm also really just thinking,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.120
I'm going to double down on this root on ZFS.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.720
Maybe also encrypted.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.360
So we'll have more to talk about in that arena soon.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:22.560
That could be fun.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.960
So Omkar writes in and he says he loves the show.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.280
In fact, he also seems to be a TechSnap fan

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.360
because he says, I find Wes knowledgeable

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.440
and the way he explains stuff on TechSnap

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.880
and Linux Unplugged is fascinating.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:33.600
Well, thanks.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.160
That's really nice.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:34.800
Much appreciated.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.560
He says he's got a few questions for us.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.640
What kind of hardware setup have you configured

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.920
for Proxmox VE and which version of Proxmox?

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.040
Oh, man.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.320
That's a you question, Chris.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.120
It's a three-year-old install

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.720
or maybe even four years old now.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.640
So that would be, well, I couldn't tell you

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.080
what version that is.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.000
That's a pretty old install.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.440
Maybe I could bring in our IT guy.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.720
Maybe he could tell me.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.200
Hey, Brown Bear, could you come in here for a second?

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.400
I got a question for you.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:03.680
Hello.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.920
Hey, Brown Bear, do you remember what version of Proxmox

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.320
we're running on that i7 rig in the garage?

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.160
Well, I've got good and bad news for you.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.520
Which would you like first?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:14.080
Well, okay, let's start with the bad news

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.440
because I think I know where you're going.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.280
Bad news is you're no longer running Proxmox

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.560
on the i7 in the garage.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.080
Yeah, I know.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.400
It's running now CentOS, isn't it?

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.040
It is, yeah.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.120
Alan and I set up CentOS and then we put,

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.800
actually, we installed libvirtd and set it up

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.880
just like Red Hat would as a, you know,

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.480
it's kind of like a KVM hypervisor kind of a deal.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.920
And that's actually been working really good.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.360
I can tell you the truth.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.400
It's been really solid.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.080
Proxmox was great, though.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.080
But times have really changed.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:42.960
The options have changed.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.520
I don't know if you've ever been a Proxmox user or no,

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.480
but I know that you're big on the CentOS virtualization stuff.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:48.960
Yeah, I have.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.280
In fact, I've gotten crap on the Ask Noah show

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.680
for not giving enough good juju to Proxmox

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.920
because it really is a fantastic project.

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:59.280
They really do some really great work.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.680
And if you want an enterprise grade virtualization system

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.200
that has a really fantastic UI,

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.880
man, Proxmox is really the way to go.

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.040
It's just when you start looking into things

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:11.200
like I want the ability to have a BSD server that's on here.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.040
And then when I go back to Grand Forks,

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.800
I want that BSD server to fall over

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.880
to my virtualized host in Grand Forks.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.960
And if I come back here, I want it to go back over here.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.240
And those kinds of things.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.680
It's really nice to have something a little bit meatier.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.960
That does sound really cool.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:27.520
OK, so Omkar's next question was,

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.760
what droplet specs do you guys recommend

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.640
for a GitLab and a PeerTube instance?

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.840
Well, those are two tough questions.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.280
So GitLab, you'd probably be OK with the $20 a month

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.000
or less droplets.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:38.800
GitLab's not going to be.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.600
It just depends on how busy you are.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:40.960
It depends on what you do with that, I guess.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.240
There's a lot of extended features.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.400
But if you're just dumping some commits to it,

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.680
it's probably doable.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.600
Now PeerTube, here's what's tricky about PeerTube is,

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.760
if you think about it, you're kind of re-implementing

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.880
what YouTube does.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.120
And there is a transcoding process

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.160
that PeerTube goes through when you upload a video.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.600
And the speed of your droplet is going to directly impact

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.200
how long it takes for those videos

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.480
to be available on PeerTube.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.560
If you don't care, if you just want someplace

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.840
to throw up videos and you don't care

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.160
if it takes an hour for the video to be available,

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.800
then you really could get away with a $5 a month droplet

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.320
because you're not using much CPU because the decoding's

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.080
happening on client side for the video.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.400
And the bandwidth is still fast regardless

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.760
of which machine you get.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.320
And then he asked a question that I'm going to punt to you,

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:24.560
Wes.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:27.040
He asked if either of us have ever tried out traffic,

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.640
which I think is how you pronounce it.

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.800
It's spelled T-R-A-E-F-I-K.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.520
And for those of you that don't know, I didn't.

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.000
It is what they call Cloud Native Edge Router.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.760
It's a reverse proxy in a load balancer

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.680
that's easy, dynamic, automatic, and open source.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.200
So it seems like it's pretty cool.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.440
Have you ever heard of Trafic or Traffic, Wes?

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:45.680
Yeah.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.800
So you can front, basically, if you're running a bunch of stuff

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.120
on your fancy Kubernetes clusters,

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.400
you can put this in front of it.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.440
And it will auto discover.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.640
It'll talk to Kubernetes or Swarm or some other technologies.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.440
Oh, cool.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.440
Find what services you're running,

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.760
connect to them, and integrate with metrics.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.520
It can do HTTPS at the front.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.760
Also ties in with some of those open tracing systems.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.880
You can get logs and sort of analyze how a request flows

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.160
through all of your services.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.640
Yeah, it's a nice looking web UI to manage this.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.160
This is, I see.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:14.480
I see.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.520
So it ties in, basically, with the different orchestration APIs

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.320
and then automatically configures the reverse proxy,

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.560
attaches statistics using open source projects,

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.440
and you're good to go.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:23.600
Yeah.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.040
So there's a lot to like there.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.360
But if you're not using some sort of orchestration software,

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.120
it's probably not necessarily what you use.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.440
Maybe something just like, well, Envoy might work,

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.040
or just NGINX even.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.560
There's a lot of solutions that won't

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.680
have all those fancy features.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.440
But if you don't need them, if you just

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.680
have two apps that are running on two different droplets,

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.960
well, you're probably fine.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.280
Yeah.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:43.520
Yeah.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.080
So there you go.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.200
Thanks for the emails.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.000
We got a bunch of others, some of them which were eight

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.760
or nine paragraphs long, read them all,

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.040
but can't cover them all on the show.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.160
They've got to be a certain length.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.320
And we would love to get your feedback, your questions,

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.000
your suggestions for the show, linuxunplug.com contact.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.240
And links for anything we talked about today, linuxunplug268.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:05.280
So Mr. Noah Chalaya, what are you doing

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.560
in this part of the woods?

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.320
Are you just coming out here to hang out for the barbecue?

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.240
Dude, I am always here for just the food.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.040
I mean, I say nice things like I came here

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.720
for your stunning personality and I wanted to hang out

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.120
and stuff, but really, it's the barbecue.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.920
How many minutes was it that you walked into the door?

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:21.680
I think it couldn't have been more than five minutes.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.760
We were already packing up to go to lunch when you got here.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.920
Yeah, you know, I really had a suspect.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.600
I mean, here's the thing.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.560
We can talk about food.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.000
I'm not saying that we can't.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.480
But I feel like you had an agenda before I ever came here.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.840
Before I ever set foot in the door,

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.280
I just felt like it was your premise to take me

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.440
to Indian food and that decision process had been made

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:45.040
before I ever entered the premises.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.000
Yeah, you're welcome.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.960
Is that your way of saying thank you?

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.680
That's a long-winded way of saying thank you.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.480
So what are you doing over there?

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.840
Getting ready for the Ask Noah program?

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.800
I am, yeah.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.040
I'm sure you guys have heard, Google has been making

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:57.200
some weird decisions, forcing people to log in,

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.720
and we're going to ask the audience

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.600
if they think this enhances their experience using Chrome

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.840
or if this time Google has gone too far,

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:06.240
if they've taken privacy and thrown it out the windows,

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.360
Google tends to do.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.280
We got a number of other exciting stories

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.240
that we're going to get to.

01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.440
Project Triton has adopted a code of conduct.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.400
We're going to talk about that.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.480
A little bit of follow-up to last week's episode.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.440
Chrome OS 71 has launched.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.080
Now Linux apps are available on non-Pixel devices.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.720
Also the ability to share files with Linux.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:26.400
Yeah, it's absolutely fantastic.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.160
So we're going to talk about all those things.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.240
And then towards the end of the show, if we have time,

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.080
because this is like the least important thing in the world,

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.400
but Microsoft has launched the ability

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.440
to have multi-user virtualization on Windows.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.680
We're going to explain how that can be leveraged

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.480
in an all Linux environment.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.680
If you're just virtualizing Windows,

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.680
if you want to be Linux on the hardware,

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.080
Windows in a virtual environment,

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.480
how this is actually going to benefit your Linux environment.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.400
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.200
That's right, Leo.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.920
Well, I look forward to it.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:59.280
Yeah, I just was making this joke earlier in the show.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.600
I look at the stats and I'd say there's 30%.

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.200
Well, yeah, it might be around 30%-ish.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.640
Somewhere in that ballpark of the people

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.400
that download the show are on Windows.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.240
It's somewhere in that area.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.280
And we love you too.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.560
Yeah, so we appreciate it.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.640
Maybe they're just checking us out

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.680
before they make the big switch.

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.080
They're looking for all the guides and the know-how.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.280
Yeah, I look at myself as Jesus Christ.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.000
Jesus, you know, he wouldn't go into the places

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
where everybody had become a follower

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.240
because there's not a lot to be done there.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.720
So I need to be in the homes of the sinners

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.560
so that I can bring them to the wonderful world.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.720
This is really just falling apart as you keep going.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.240
My Lord and Savior, Linux Torvalds.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:43.440
This really explains a few things, actually.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.200
This worldview now explains a few things.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.320
I understand you a little better now.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.400
There are memes going on.

01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.320
Apparently, I said one time on an episode,

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.040
I said that Linux was a religion I was just going to give in.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.560
And so I just started calling myself the Pope.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.360
And now it's become memes.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.240
Well, yeah, Pope might not be too far off the mark.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.440
I've been meme-ified.

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.920
Well, now that I'm sure we've enraged somebody,

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.680
we should probably wrap this thing up.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.280
Go get more of Martin Wimpress over at the Ubuntu podcast.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.600
Go get more of them. Great show.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.760
Not just me, but also Mark.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:18.960
Everyone remember, Mark is not Martin or Alan or Popey or Wimpy.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.520
He's Mark.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:23.360
Mark is one third of the Ubuntu podcast.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.000
Yeah.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.440
Yeah, he visits on occasion.

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.200
So that's why he doesn't get probably the mention as often

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.640
because you're right here front and center.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.240
But it is a great trio at that.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.880
And also, go check out Cassidy James's work.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.120
The Medium post that we chatted about earlier

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.280
will be linked in the show notes.

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.240
And stick around.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.360
We got the post-show coming up.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.520
And then right after that on the live stream

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.040
is the Ask Nowhere program,

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.800
which will be live, taking your calls.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.640
We might talk about some of the same topics,

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.720
but you actually get to chime in via the phone.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.720
You don't even have to bother installing Mumble.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.040
Wes Payne's available all the time online.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:57.840
You can just hunt him down.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.960
He's at Wes Payne.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.520
That's right.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.360
And then he's on the TechSnap program.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.160
New show, just launched.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.200
Actually, I kid.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.320
It's not a new show.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.040
It's been around for a while.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.320
But it's coming out, dude, all the time.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:06.880
It's pretty great.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.000
And we just had John the Nice Guy on the show last week.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.720
You should go check it out.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.400
He's got some hot tips.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:12.960
Yeah.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.400
Especially if you want to dive a little deeper

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.320
into interplanetary file system,

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.000
all of that is over at TechSnap.systems.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.560
All right.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:18.960
That's all.

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:19.440
Hey.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:19.760
Yeah.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.000
What?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.720
What?

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:22.800
You had John Spriggs on.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.040
Yeah.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:24.400
Yeah.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:25.760
It's nice, right?

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:26.400
Wow.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.680
I've been away too long.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.920
John is not just John the Nice Guy Spriggs.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.080
John is a super nice guy.

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:34.400
He is.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.200
He really is.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:35.520
Yeah.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:35.680
Yeah.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.280
He's the organizer of OpCamp.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:37.840
I know.

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.080
I know.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.240
I've been wanting to have him on the show forever.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.040
So go check it out.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:42.640
TechSnap.systems.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.080
All our links, LinuxUnplugged.com.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.040
I'm Matt Chris, L-E-S.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:45.760
Thanks for joining us.

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:50.320
See you next Tuesday.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:23.200
I wanted to pick Wimpy's brain.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.320
I don't know exactly what the right way to ask this question is, Wimpy,

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.240
but is there a way to tell what the difference would be

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:39.040
in terms of patches or additions to Ubuntu's 1810 gnome versus, say, stock gnome?

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:45.440
So is there a way to actually detail patch sets that might be better for performance?

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.880
I'm trying to think about how to review the new distro releases,

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.040
and performance of the gnome desktop is something I think I kind of want to take a look at,

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.760
but I'm not quite sure how to tell differences in terms of patch sets that have been applied

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.800
for performance.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.360
Yes.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:07.840
So if you want to see what patches are being applied to what is the upstream version of

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.160
gnome shell and the patches that are being carried in Ubuntu, what will become 1810,

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:19.520
then yes, you can see all of that in Launchpad because all of that Debian packaging that

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:24.880
happens happens in Launchpad, and you can see those patches directly.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:32.320
What I would say is that I know that Daniel Van Voet, who's part of the Ubuntu desktop

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:39.360
team, all of the patches that we're carrying as vendor patches right now have been submitted

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:49.600
upstream and are in various stages of review and will eventually percolate into the upstream

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.640
gnome project.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.560
But whilst they're being negotiated, we're carrying the patches that he's been working

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:10.160
on.
