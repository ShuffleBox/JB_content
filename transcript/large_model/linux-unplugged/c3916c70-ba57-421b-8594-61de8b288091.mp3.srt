1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
Someone here at the barbecue though, he asked like, so do you guys submit bug reports during

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,140
your reviews?

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,580
Like if you come across a problem, do you submit a bug report?

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,020
And I said, you know, often no, that's not always the case.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,660
We sometimes do submit bug reports, but most of the time when we review it, we're reviewing

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:21,460
something that's been officially released and so we review it as if it's a finished

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,240
product and then give our thoughts.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,620
But we do submit a ton of bugs and work with the communities that build a lot of the projects

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,180
that we use internally to make the shows.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,740
So what's happened with this video, so it's a Python, if you search for Python audio visualizer

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,900
in Google, you'll come across the project.

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,420
It is amazing what's happened in the last couple of months because of the Jupiter broadcasting

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
community.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,460
They have taken this thing from a pretty decent application that sits on top of FFmpeg.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,380
And I mean it, it almost chokes me up looking at it because they have taken this into something

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,100
that is more competitive than anything that's available commercially, including some products

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,500
I have looked at that require a monthly charge.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
And this thing is more competitive.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
That's crazy.

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,780
And just because the community just got involved and it's going to make our shows better and

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,940
it's going to make late night Linux better.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,400
It's one of those great examples, right, where clearly this was a need.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
People wanted this.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,700
Maybe not everyone had that clear conception yet, but once it was there, once it was started,

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,780
there's just this natural momentum that's fascinating to watch.

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,980
Yeah, I love open source.

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:32,860
You could see how media production on Linux can be more successful in this paradigm.

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,700
I don't know if it's going to be the truth.

29
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,240
Maybe it's not the same for video editing.

30
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,820
But this is something you can't do on a Mac or Windows.

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:57,220
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 203 for July 4th, 2017.

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's feeling the patriotic spirit

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,680
or the bourbon.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
My name is Chris.

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
My name is Wes.

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Hello, Wes.

37
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Quite a show for us today.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
That's amazing.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,980
Obviously we have the big barbecue going on right now as we record this, but we have some

40
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,180
breaking news applicable to us Linux users, and apparently it is the season of stupid.

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,660
We'll be talking about some developments in the community that really have your host quite

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,660
ponderous.

43
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,360
Then we'll give you a few updates on some stories we've talked about, discuss something

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,280
big and bold the XDA developer forums is doing that us Linux users are going to like quite

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,900
a bit, and then package kit.

46
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,900
You know it.

47
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
You love it.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,340
We'll give you the platform package management possible.

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,060
Turns out a little crashy, a little crashy, a little unstable on Fedora.

50
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,180
We'll give you the reasons why you might want to avoid package kit on Fedora, at least for

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,740
this release, and something might change in the future, and then we'll discuss System

52
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:58,300
76's new operating system as well as a way for you to hide your Steam... Well, I won't

53
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,300
call... I won't quote RMS.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,980
We'll just say it's semi-negative in the Freedom Dimension games.

55
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,460
We'll tell you how you can hide those and isolate them from your system.

56
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,460
You found that one.

57
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
Oh yeah, I did.

58
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
You found a good one.

59
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,940
Plus, it seems that Rust is taking over as the language of choice for the Linux desktop.

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,540
I think we're officially Rust fanboys on this show.

61
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,540
I don't even know how that happened.

62
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
I agree.

63
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,540
Well, I think because we both listen to Koda Radio.

64
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,740
It's because you like Firefox so much and you're excited about Servo.

65
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,740
That's totally what it is, dude.

66
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,900
No, you know, it's like Apple's got their Swift and we've got Rust.

67
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
You know what I mean?

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,060
The branding is traditionally an open source.

69
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,820
We're not quite on their game with that, but it is fun to say.

70
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,780
And Rust looks like a really, really serious, really good technology.

71
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,140
And we'll tell you about how it's making... Potentially.

72
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,900
I guess it hasn't actually come yet.

73
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,860
How it could potentially make GNOME much better, a little more crash-proof, thanks to a Google

74
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,300
Summer of Code project.

75
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,380
But Mr. West, I hope that the audience out in the living room... We have a small group

76
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,060
out in the audience in the living room, as I just said.

77
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,140
You say small, but those are some heavy hitters out there.

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
Geez.

79
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
And boy, was it some good food.

80
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,940
So we're doing the barbecue right now, the 4th of July episode 200 barbecue.

81
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,700
And all-star, Wes Payne right here.

82
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Thank you.

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,640
I mean, knocked it out of the park with the bratwurst.

84
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,220
Unbelievably good.

85
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,980
And rumor has it you are up till 2 AM working on those Sons of Guns.

86
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
Oh, maybe.

87
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
Just a little bit.

88
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,580
Soaked in butter, beer, and onions.

89
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,580
Mmm.

90
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Nature's finest.

91
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,580
Super good, Wes.

92
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,580
Super good.

93
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
And everybody ate those things up.

94
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
The food here has been amazing today.

95
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,860
We're cooking rib-eyes, we're cooking burgers, we're cooking the bratwurst, and we've also

96
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,300
got some great veggie skewers, and...

97
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,740
Don't forget that... Oh, you got it.

98
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,740
What?

99
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,740
No, go ahead.

100
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,740
I was going to say that avocado.

101
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,780
The fried avocado.

102
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,540
Just really a game changer.

103
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,340
But I'm hoping that those people out in the living room... I'm talking directly to them.

104
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,100
I hope right now that they will keep an ear out for a knock, knock, knock at the door,

105
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,060
because UPS is supposed to deliver my brewery today, which is a Linux-powered, one-touch

106
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,500
Linux brewing machine of the beer.

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
No way.

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Of the beer, Wes.

109
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,300
And that should be delivered as we do this show today.

110
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,860
It was something that Blaster and I went into.

111
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,940
So buddy, I think it's almost here.

112
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,040
If you hit me up on Telegram, we should definitely do a vlog or two about this thing.

113
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,740
You put all the ingredients in there, you push a button, and then you come back in a

114
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
couple of weeks and you've got beer.

115
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,940
So you're saying in a couple weeks, I can come back.

116
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,940
I don't think so.

117
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,940
You can drink beer.

118
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,940
You'll have beer.

119
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
I think that could be the case.

120
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,140
In the meantime, I've got something better for you, though.

121
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,140
You ready for this?

122
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Surprise me.

123
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
It's our virtual log.

124
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Time appropriate.

125
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
Greetings, Mumble Room.

126
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
Greetings.

127
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Hello.

128
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,180
Hello, gentlemen.

129
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
It is good to see you.

130
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,400
I hope everyone is well in there.

131
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,940
We have a really good show for you this week, so I'm glad you're here.

132
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Thank you very much.

133
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,740
Now, Wes, before we go any further, we've got to stop and just mention something really

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,500
quickly, because I know not everyone listening to this show listens to user air, although

135
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,660
they should be.

136
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,660
I know they're not.

137
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,660
They should be.

138
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,660
I understand.

139
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,660
And I just want to give them a heads up that we have a bit of a giveaway going on, a sweepstakes,

140
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,660
if you will.

141
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Don't call it a giveaway, Wes.

142
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,660
It's a sweepstakes.

143
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,660
It is a sweepstakes.

144
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
100% sweep.

145
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,660
That's right.

146
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,420
User Air is doing a sweepstakes for the Dell XPS 13.

147
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
13.

148
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,420
Yeah, that's right.

149
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,420
You have one of those, buddy.

150
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
Oh, yeah, I do.

151
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Yeah, you do.

152
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,420
You have the original.

153
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
And we're going to give one away.

154
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,900
We're going to give a brand new one away.

155
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Give it to me.

156
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Give it to me.

157
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
It's for me, guys.

158
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Sorry.

159
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,900
You already have one.

160
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Yeah.

161
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,900
It's for me.

162
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
It's a sweepstakes.

163
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Don't call it a giveaway, Dylan.

164
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
It is for me.

165
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,900
Sweepstakes.

166
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Now, here's the thing.

167
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,900
It's for U.S. residents.

168
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
It's a sweepstakes, by the way.

169
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Yeah.

170
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
And it's for U.S. residents only.

171
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
You have to be 18 years or older.

172
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm 19.

173
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
No, you are not.

174
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,660
You go to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click on shows, and go to User Air.

175
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,820
It's in the User Air description, right at the top of the User Air show.

176
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,660
We're going to be giving away the laptop... Oh, I'm sorry.

177
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
It's not a giveaway.

178
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
It's a... Sweepstakes.

179
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,020
Yeah, we'll be doing the sweepstakes in User Air to give away... I'm sorry.

180
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,900
It's a... Sweepstakes.

181
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,320
To stake an XPS 13 to a listener of the User Air show, and we want you to have a chance

182
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
to get in there.

183
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Just go to jupiterbroadcasting.

184
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
So we sweep the stakes?

185
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,320
Yeah.

186
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah, we're going to sweep them.

187
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,820
So go to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click on shows, and then go down to User Air.

188
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,400
Right there in the description where we have what the show's about and our contact information,

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,900
we have a temporary link for the sweepstakes.

190
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,700
I want you to get an XPS 13.

191
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,800
If you're over in the EU, just come over and live in the U.S. for just a little while.

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
It's worth it.

193
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,020
These XPSs are great.

194
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Get the Dell XPS 13.

195
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
We hear that the ear needs a roommate.

196
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
That's true.

197
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,900
Yeah, you could just crash here in the garage for a little bit.

198
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Yeah.

199
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,900
There you go.

200
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Sorry, you have to be 18 years.

201
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Sorry about the 18 years or older, Dylan.

202
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Sorry about that.

203
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,300
Sorry about that.

204
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,260
Let's start with that rust thing I was just talking about, because this is neat, and it's

205
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
summertime.

206
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,980
The Googles has the summer of codes, and I don't really need to explain this, do I?

207
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
Because everybody knows what this is at this point.

208
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,500
People throw some money around during the summer to employ some students to build things,

209
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,020
and often they build open-source things that we all use and love, and sometimes have actually

210
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,180
turned into long-term projects that we use today.

211
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,020
Philip is one of these blokes who is going to be working on the – I think it's the

212
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,660
GNOME JavaScript server.

213
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,620
I think it's – it's GJS, so I'm kind of guessing at the acronym, and he's worked

214
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,620
on it for quite a long time.

215
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,660
He's going to be mentoring someone that's paid by Google to essentially rewrite this

216
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:20,540
JavaScript binding for GNOME and rewrite it using Rust to make it stable, essentially

217
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
more craft-proof.

218
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,740
It's not just GNOME Shell that uses this.

219
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,700
GNOME Documents, GNOME Maps, Polari, Sushi, GNOME Photos, a lot of things that are modern

220
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,020
GTK applications use this backend, this GJS backend.

221
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,180
JavaScript really is everywhere, even not the hip places.

222
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:44,380
I think right now – I think right now the current version uses Mozilla's SpiderMonkey

223
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,220
for the engine, and so this is going to be a rewrite of that in Rust.

224
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,820
And the reason why I mention this, so this was actually a highly-submitted story to the

225
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,620
show this week because a lot on JB, we've been talking about some of the GNOME crashing

226
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,620
issues we've had recently, and so somebody submitted this as a possible, like, hey, look,

227
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
things are improving.

228
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:06,260
I've also heard some – it's not rumors because they're blog posts, but I have heard

229
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,980
some implication that there has been some work at Canonical on Mudder, and I'm not

230
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,020
clear on what that work has been, but you combine different people working on this stuff,

231
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,060
and it could start shoring up some of these problems that we've experienced with GNOME

232
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
pretty quick.

233
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,580
And this is just the kind of thing that you need.

234
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,780
It won't be the be-all, end-all.

235
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,100
It's not going to be the next thing maybe that you run on your system even, but this

236
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,020
can lower that barrier to entry suddenly if Rust becomes a thing that, like, oh, yeah,

237
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
you already have build support.

238
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,740
If you want to add a module that's in Rust and not in C or C++, you can.

239
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,900
I think that really opens the door.

240
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,100
So if this works out, hey, that would be great.

241
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,900
And you can find out more in the link in the show notes.

242
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,500
Let's talk about the new kernel that came out.

243
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,540
So I just want to do a couple of pieces of breaking news right now.

244
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,020
Let's talk about the new kernel release, and let's talk about the WikiLeaks document

245
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,340
dump that shows the CIA was targeting Linux users because this is probably the one that's

246
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,260
getting the most attention as we record the show right now.

247
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,460
It's named Outlaw Country.

248
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,460
You may have heard that name floating around, and it's a Linux kernel module that gets

249
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,940
loaded into the system and creates a new entry in IP tables, and then once it does that,

250
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,660
it forwards all the traffic to whoever they want it forwarded to, and the attacker, in

251
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,880
this case the CIA or whoever has this code, could then reroute to whatever mining system

252
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
they have or whatever.

253
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,060
Now, what I'm not clear about from this exploit is it seems like you could just do

254
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,900
an IP tables list and you would see this entry, so not only would it be pretty easy to detect

255
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,460
if you were looking for it, but you also would have to have executed this exploit with root

256
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,680
privileges.

257
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,780
I think some of the issues there are that, one, it adds a new table, and so unless you

258
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,020
actually specify that table, by default you won't know, right?

259
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,540
You'll be like, oh, well, it's not in my NAT rules and it's not in the default

260
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
table.

261
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,860
Right, so it's not like you're going to look at your config and see it.

262
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,420
Plus, it's most likely on, you know, here we're relying on admins in the middle because

263
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,700
it's not like they're going to be infecting you most likely with this kind of thing.

264
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,260
It's going to be at some router or some NAT or some web server that wants to know who's

265
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,820
visiting that website and it's been running on a VPS for six months and you're not checking

266
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
the logs.

267
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,580
What's interesting, though, is this doesn't give itself access to the system, so you have

268
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:20,660
to take advantage of another existing vulnerability in the Linux system to get access to run this.

269
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,260
So this doesn't give you the access.

270
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,300
You know, it does also say to me maybe that, hey, this is one of those things people who

271
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,180
are pushing UEFI maybe were thinking about, right?

272
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,780
Otherwise, if this module has to be signed, hey, that'd be nice.

273
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,100
Can I tell you the honest truth, though?

274
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,020
After the Snowden leaks, I was feeling pretty cocky because they had stuff on there about

275
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,300
exploiting Macs through Thunderbolt and they had stuff in there about going after Windows

276
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,820
and Windows servers, but Linux desktop users, if you go by the Snowden leaks, were just

277
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
totally off the radar.

278
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Like, they weren't even worried about Linux users and I'm like, hey, hey, hey, look at

279
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
me.

280
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,540
I'm like James Bond just by running Linux.

281
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,020
And then I see this WikiLeaks dump here from the CIA and they're going after Linux users.

282
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,860
And here I thought Linux users were upstanding moral citizens.

283
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,860
I guess I was wrong.

285
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,460
Yeah, of course they're going after the servers.

286
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,460
That's the problem.

287
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,180
So yeah, if you hear the story going around and you hear them talking about outlaw country,

288
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,540
just keep in mind that it's just, all it is, it's a kernel module that maybe it does some

289
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,140
other nefarious things, but mostly just injects rules into IP tables, which is just, the reason

290
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,660
why it's a kernel module is because like Wes just said, it doesn't check your config and

291
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,840
so it has to be able to apply it to your config after it's been loaded.

292
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,460
And that's why it's a module.

293
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,380
And really the worst part is that it makes you have to go look at IP tables.

294
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
So sorry, everyone.

295
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,020
You know how you bring down the entire spying industrial complex?

296
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,660
You sue them for GPL violations, right?

297
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,540
I bet you that's not GPL compliant.

298
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,540
You follow up on that.

299
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,540
Mm-hmm.

300
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,540
And then just before we get into the good stuff, I mean the stuff I really – I got

301
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,340
a couple of more things I want to talk about with you guys.

302
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,940
kernel 4.12 came out today, that's the other big breaking news.

303
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,660
That might have been yesterday.

304
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,060
But it just came out.

305
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,900
And the big thing in here is BFQ, the BFQ scheduler and USB type C manager that I talked

306
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,420
about in a recent episode has been integrated into the kernel.

307
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,460
Also actually I should say Vegas support too, which is going to matter to a lot of you.

308
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,540
Vegas support has been added as well.

309
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,900
And the thing that I'm very excited about, although I've gotten mixed feedback on this

310
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,160
and I would like to get more, and maybe if anybody in the Mumble Room knows, please feel

311
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,300
free to interrupt me, BFQ, which is the better, faster, quicker scheduler, the scheduler that

312
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,260
sets the priority for like all the things going on and access to IO.

313
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,260
If you've ever had a Linux box, I can replicate this on Linux every Wednesday night.

314
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,260
I replicate – I have this scenario.

315
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,380
I open up Chrome and then I go to pinboard and I load up all of the links I have for

316
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,980
that night's unfilter and I go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and I'm using my middle

317
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,220
click and I click, click, click, click, click along my pinboard list and I open tab after

318
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,840
tab after tab after tab after tab and some of them have flash.

319
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,900
Most of them actually have flash because I'm linking to news sites and the whole system,

320
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,940
the entire system locks up for about 10 seconds, 15 seconds.

321
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,780
Just long enough you can't do anything else.

322
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,780
You can't get up.

323
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
No.

324
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,780
No.

325
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,040
And BFQ promises to solve that problem.

326
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,820
Now a lot of people say there's ways that you can fix this without BFQ but in a nutshell

327
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,920
it's an IO scheduler that balances how the system accesses data on a drive and supposedly

328
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,140
it has improvements for SSDs.

329
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,860
BFQ targets desktop users by ensuring that at no point a single application is using

330
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,860
all of the bandwidth.

331
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,900
Sometimes when copying large files in Linux a user sees systems slow down or freeze completely.

332
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,260
This will now be a thing of the past.

333
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,260
I like the way the Arch Wiki as always describes it.

334
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,740
Budget fair queuing is a disk scheduler which allows each process slash thread to be assigned

335
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,420
a portion of the disk throughput.

336
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,140
So that kind of explains how you're – again, this may be the case where you wouldn't want

337
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,980
it on a server but you might minimize your maximum throughput but it should give better

338
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,660
latencies for desktop users or at least that's what people say.

339
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Yeah.

340
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,960
And by the way the USB type C stuff is like the stuff that figures out charging based

341
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
on what has –

342
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
Oh my God.

343
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
The future is here now.

344
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Yeah.

345
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,700
If you're living the USB lifestyle that's a good kernel for you to get.

346
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,940
You're not mandatory USB – your USB-C devices will still work fine.

347
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,980
But if you upgrade to that kernel you'll get the smart intelligence where it decides

348
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,380
oh, that's a phone, I should charge it and not charge from the phone which could happen

349
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,380
right now under Linux.

350
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
We'll see.

351
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,620
It's kind of adorable.

352
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,940
We had the first USB-C support so I'll give us credit for that.

353
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,940
We were there first.

354
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
We just do it our own way.

355
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Yeah.

356
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
Okay.

357
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,980
And then the last kind of newsy thing before we get into the nuts and bolts of the community

358
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:42,440
stuff this week, Wes found this and I just found it awesome because when you stopped

359
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,620
by UserAir a few weeks ago you were talking about playing around with SystemD's Nspawn

360
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,620
and container support.

361
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
Yeah.

362
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,620
That's right.

363
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,620
And so here's somebody who self-admittedly is not a Linux expert – his name is Drew

364
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
I guess.

365
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
I'm not sure.

366
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,340
I don't know what his name is.

367
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,600
And he's been messing around with confining Steam into a SystemD Nspawn container.

368
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,940
And I don't – I've never set one of these up yet but if I'm understanding correctly

369
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,500
– well, he did it to play around with too but it was a great way to sort of solve the

370
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,060
32-bit library problem because instead of spewing 32-bit libraries all over your system,

371
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:23,060
you contain it all to this container and you don't have to like – if none of your other

372
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,780
applications need it, you don't have to bother with it.

373
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Yeah, exactly.

374
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,780
It's this crossover now.

375
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,860
Finally like containers are big on that in the development side of things because exactly

376
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,860
that.

377
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,380
You don't want all of these – I have six different projects.

378
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,500
I don't want the dependencies or the libraries from all of these different things on my

379
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
system.

380
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I don't want to mess in this.

381
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,740
I don't want to cause dependency hell or have some weird app thing go on.

382
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,740
Containers are perfect for that.

383
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,380
And now it's like yeah, I don't want 32-bit libraries.

384
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,340
I don't want to have to deal with that.

385
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,520
And yeah, he points out some of the things like FireJail or other alternatives which

386
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,020
can work for some of the – getting more control over the process.

387
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,140
But he's using SystemD Nspawn it seems like – mostly just because it's built in.

388
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Yeah, it's built in.

389
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
It's right there.

390
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,340
It's really easy to go.

391
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,300
And it makes it super simple to be – you can pretend maybe you don't want to use a

392
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,620
cloud provider or something that you would need something local like for Steam, boom,

393
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
perfect.

394
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,860
Throw away Linux distribution.

395
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,580
Yeah, exactly.

396
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,700
And the thing that would have tripped me up, and this is why I like his post and we'll

397
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,380
have it linked in the show notes, is he talks about getting the X applications out of that

398
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
container.

399
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,920
And actually at first this was a bit major hurdle.

400
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,140
But these days between Docker and SystemD Nspawn there's like a thousand guides out

401
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,140
there for how to do that.

402
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,940
It's really pretty easy.

403
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,940
X needs some stuff that's under slash temp.

404
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,100
You can also do other things like you can share special devices.

405
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
You can mount stuff.

406
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,020
SystemD Nspawn makes it super simple to just bind mount stuff.

407
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,140
Networking is really easy.

408
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,180
If you use SystemD NetworkD they have a lot of primitive setup to just, boom, NAT's already

409
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,180
there.

410
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,740
Your containers automatically get set up behind the NAT.

411
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,020
They've got their own private IP address.

412
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,400
Super simple.

413
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,420
And SystemD Nspawn can run Docker containers.

414
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,660
So you can use all the Docker build stuff.

415
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,660
You can use – yeah, exactly.

416
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,280
Oh, I did not know that.

417
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
But it makes sense.

418
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,420
Because it's just a file system that you start a process on.

419
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
Right.

420
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,420
I'm going to chew on that.

421
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
So I don't know.

422
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,940
In the background you might be able to hear some of the barbecue going on.

423
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,940
The barbecue continues while we do the show which is awesome.

424
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,980
And not only do we have a crowd out there but we have a big crowd in the Mumble Room

425
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,340
which is pretty exciting.

426
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,220
And Mr. Popey is back after a little bit of a stay.

427
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,760
Mr. Popey, did you happen to go to the recent Snap Sprint held by Canonical?

428
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
I did.

429
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,940
I was there Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and then I had a conference to get you on Thursday,

430
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,820
Friday to go and give a talk about Snaps.

431
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,500
So yeah, it was great.

432
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,780
It was nice to see a bunch of people from different projects, people from KDE, from

433
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,460
elementary, from Nome, from Flora.

434
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,660
It was really nice to have everyone in the Canonical office and all working together

435
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,660
to make Snaps better.

436
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
It was good fun.

437
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Yeah.

438
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,620
And I've seen some recent news about Nome software.

439
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,220
Is that as a result of some of the work that came out of that Sprint?

440
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,740
Yeah, definitely.

441
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,460
Robert Ansell who maintains software from the Ubuntu side was there.

442
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,940
But also Richard Hughes who works on, who's the upstream maintainer for Nome software

443
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
was there as well.

444
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,380
And so there are lots of conversations they can have about improving the experience for

445
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:16,340
installing Snaps on any distro, not just on Ubuntu and improving things like how options

446
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,620
are presented to users and there was lots of discussion about how to improve that kind

447
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,620
of stuff.

448
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,780
So it was really, really nice to see all these working together in the office.

449
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
Yeah.

450
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,780
That is really cool.

451
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,460
All the different walks of Linux.

452
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,540
You know, I was listening to the Ubuntu podcast today and I noticed that you sort of built

453
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,900
a better, improved Mycroft and I was wondering are you going to launch an Indiegogo for that

454
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,220
anytime soon because I might be willing to back that.

455
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,580
You mean launch an Indiegogo and then not deliver for two years?

456
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
Yeah.

457
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
I think I can do that.

458
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
That's what Chris prefers actually.

459
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,580
Yeah.

460
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
You got a long time.

461
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,580
That's what I'm used to at least.

462
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,180
You could have a stretch goal for Palmer Violets included.

463
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,180
Yeah.

464
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
Okay.

465
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Hello Mr. Wimpy.

466
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,180
How are you?

467
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
I'm very well.

468
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,180
We've had a great, I mean we've had unbelievable food here at the studio.

469
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,340
It turned out it was so, so, so good.

470
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,420
Were you at the Sprint yourself?

471
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I was.

472
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
Yes.

473
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Well, welcome.

474
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
Welcome.

475
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Now I'm jealous.

476
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,420
It's nice both of you guys here.

477
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
Now if rumor has it, are you going to be AFK soon?

478
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
Are you going to be traveling?

479
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,860
Are you going to be on staycation?

480
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,860
Like what's happening soon?

481
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,620
Because I think if I'm not mistaken, I didn't expect you to be here today.

482
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,820
Yeah.

483
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,680
So our schedule is a little bit off by one at the moment on the Ubuntu podcast.

484
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,460
We just recorded one episode of Ubuntu podcast this evening.

485
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,020
So we were let out of school early.

486
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Very good one.

487
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,500
I'm glad you made it here.

488
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,420
Now we have some good stuff to get into today including, I'm really excited.

489
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,540
I know Pharaonix gets a lot of crap.

490
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,540
Some of it from you.

491
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Yeah.

492
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
Okay.

493
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Fair enough.

494
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
It does.

495
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
I mean what?

496
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
No, you're right.

497
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
I mean I will own that.

498
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
I have.

499
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:59,100
But at the same time, I do respect Michael Arboul's hustle to put it in sort of …

500
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,700
Whatever you think of the output, there is a lot of output.

501
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
There is a lot of output.

502
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,140
There is a lot of hustle.

503
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,560
But actually where a lot of my respect comes from for Michael is what he has done with

504
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
OpenBenchmark.

505
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,180
It's just the Pharaonix test suit, if I were him, I would rename it and I know that's

506
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,180
really a hard thing to hear.

507
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,520
But if I were him, I would honestly rename it to the OpenBenchmark test suite because

508
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,260
it uploads to OpenBenchmark.org and I have found it to be such a useful tool not because

509
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,660
I'm all into benchmarks and numbers but because it gives me baselines to see how machines

510
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,260
compare to each other that I'm testing up against each other.

511
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,740
Some heuristics you can use later when you're trying to evaluate them really quickly.

512
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
Yeah, absolutely.

513
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,500
And then as a reviewer, I can publish links to that and say now run it against your own

514
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,460
system and just see the delta.

515
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,860
It's not about what – it's about the gap in the numbers, not what the numbers are.

516
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
Right.

517
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
There's no absolute measure here.

518
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
It doesn't matter.

519
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,020
It's an amazing resource and that database is growing and growing and growing.

520
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:58,460
So Pharaonix has been – I think actually in total, a pretty good resource and when

521
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,860
anybody is working that hard and publishing that often, you're going to get a couple

522
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,980
of things wrong here or there, especially if you don't have an editor, if it's a

523
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,980
one-person team.

524
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,740
So I can understand some of the mistakes that people have criticized in the past.

525
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,840
They're somewhat unfortunate and I think it's been a good resource but I think what

526
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,780
we could really use in this space is some competition.

527
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:30,260
This week, XDA, the ones that have traditionally exceedingly well-covered, ROMs and that whole

528
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,180
development community, announced that they were going to cover PC hardware with a specific

529
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:41,220
focus on Linux and open source and they've got some really good things that they're

530
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,540
thinking about and they capture and cover some of the feedback from their readers and

531
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,740
I've been talking to the author.

532
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,180
I don't think he's going to make it.

533
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,940
He was going to meet us up today in the show but you know, mumble, hashtag mumble problems.

534
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,700
Wow, did you hear that?

535
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,700
That's America.

536
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,420
Did you guys hear that in the mumble room?

537
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
Did you hear that in the background?

538
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
Yup.

539
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,940
Yeah, that's fireworks that are going off already right there.

540
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,700
We're having a small war with the neighbors.

541
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,020
I think we're going to win though.

542
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,540
The charge is happening as we speak.

543
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,840
We do have a larger group here.

544
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,020
We do have a larger group.

545
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,340
So I want to talk about what they're all doing and why I think it's a big deal and how they're

546
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,460
doing it differently and honestly, the brilliant point they made about why they're starting

547
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,460
it.

548
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,380
So we're going to talk about that next but first I want to talk about Ting.

549
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,680
Go to linux.ting.com.

550
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,700
That supports the show but it also gives you $25 in service credit if you bring a device

551
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,420
or $25 off your first device.

552
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,580
Mobile plans used to drive me crazy.

553
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,780
It's obviously a scam.

554
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
You can sense it.

555
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
You can suss that out.

556
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,780
You're smart enough.

557
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,780
You know that they're scamming you.

558
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,300
They're really only capable of doing this because they have a duopoly.

559
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,280
It's AT&T and Verizon and they have a duopoly and so they're able to do all these kinds

560
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,200
of crazy things and then the competitors have to wear crazy leather jackets and pink shirts

561
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,540
and make all kinds of crazy claims and completely destroy net neutrality to sell phones.

562
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,140
It's a horrible competitive environment.

563
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,100
If you go to linux.ting.com, you can make a difference.

564
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,560
Linux.ting.com is mobile the way it would have been done.

565
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,180
If you hit the reset button on wireless, this is how you would do mobile, right?

566
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,700
It's pay for what you use.

567
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,640
It's $6 a month for your line.

568
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,940
Think about that for a second.

569
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,020
So you want a cell phone line?

570
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
It's $6 a month.

571
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,300
Okay, now your kid gets a little bit older, you want to get them a cell phone, $6 a month.

572
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,820
You got a small business, you're growing, you want to give a couple employees some phones,

573
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,820
$6 a month.

574
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,020
$6 a month for a phone and then your usage on top of that.

575
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,580
Ting just takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, you add them up and that's

576
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
what you pay.

577
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
It's simple.

578
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
It's straightforward.

579
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
There's no contract.

580
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,580
It's easy.

581
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,580
And the best part?

582
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,100
CDMA and GSM networks to work with.

583
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,020
So whatever you got, you're likely going to bring over to Ting.

584
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,900
Just check their BYOD page.

585
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,940
It'll give you all the details you need.

586
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,840
You bring it over to Ting, you get a $25 service credit.

587
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,780
The reason why that's great, average Ting line, $23 a month once you include the line

588
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
cost and the minutes.

589
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,300
So if you get a $25 service credit, it pays for more than the first month.

590
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,060
Maybe you don't have a phone that you're going to bring, like you need a new phone.

591
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,060
What?

592
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Then you get $25 off your first device, Wes.

593
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Whoa.

594
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,060
That's right.

595
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Linux.Ting.com.

596
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,460
Big thank you to Ting for not only making wireless not suck so bad, but also for supporting

597
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,460
the show for so damn long.

598
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
Yeah.

599
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,300
But really the first thing is even more important, honestly, because wireless is the worst.

600
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,460
Also happy America birthday up to our friends in Canada.

601
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
Linux.Ting.com.

602
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,460
You hear that party out there?

603
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,460
Oh, yeah.

604
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
They're having a party out there.

605
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,460
Well, we left, so they're now kicking it.

606
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
Well, and there's booze and there's food.

607
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
I mean, there is a party.

608
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Yeah.

609
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Let's hurry up and finish.

610
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
XDA has announced they're beginning regular PC hardware coverage, designed for quote-unquote

611
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:39,300
their audience, which I think means the Jupiter Broadcasting audience, and they go through

612
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,740
some recent comments they've had about some of their articles that they were kind of preemptively

613
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,860
planning this, and they're like, let's test out this material and see how it works here.

614
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,260
And so they published a few articles, and the comments are like, do more of this.

615
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,700
Yes, please get more into computer hardware.

616
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,540
And they say at the time, we didn't mention that we were kind of considering this, and

617
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,220
we were monitoring the feedback.

618
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,540
And I love what they say they're going to cover, because they're so brilliant about

619
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,980
it, because they say XDA has traditionally covered mobile devices, but how do you make

620
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,980
all these apps and OSes for these mobile devices?

621
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,780
You have to use great PC hardware.

622
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Exactly.

623
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,780
And there's that link, right, between – I mean, I think there's a lot of people who

624
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,540
get into Linux because they want to mess with Android ROMs whenever it turns out, hey, Linux

625
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,620
and open source is the best way to get started with that.

626
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

627
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,940
Well, and so they say like – so here's the logic.

628
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,900
They say after two months of working behind the scenes, we're ready to say it, XDA will

629
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,180
start covering PC hardware on a regular basis.

630
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:37,160
And if you dig down a little bit, they talk about the type of hardware they're going

631
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,220
to be covering.

632
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,540
They say reviews will largely focus on the Linux operating system and continue to have

633
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,900
a developer focus in them.

634
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,460
We decided to keep our reviews on Linux for two primary reasons.

635
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,980
Oh, I love it.

636
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,300
Okay, number one.

637
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,900
First up was the lack of dedicated Linux coverage for new PC hardware in the global market.

638
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,500
We hope that this will help introduce – what's that word right there, Wes?

639
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Cooperation?

640
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
I don't know that.

641
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
I don't know what that is.

642
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
What's that?

643
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
I don't think that's something we do down here in the States.

644
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Is that – no.

645
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
No, I'm not familiar with that.

646
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,380
Is that something where you fight other people and then whoever wins –

647
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,740
It's just another word for argument.

648
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
Okay, okay.

649
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
Okay.

650
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,620
They're going to – anyways, they're going to take that and they're going to work with

651
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,260
other people and do Linux reviews.

652
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,660
I don't understand that part of it.

653
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,840
But what they go on to say is there's not really many competitors and they address this

654
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,500
directly beyond Ferronix.

655
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,260
That caught my attention there.

656
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,620
The other half, by the way, is one that we have had – here's what they say.

657
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,260
A lack of information on how to get most PC hardware working on the day of release.

658
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,180
As part of our reviews, we'll be including notes on any issues using hardware with Linux

659
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,220
as well as any solutions and workarounds available.

660
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,840
You know, I hadn't really thought of it until this article but you're right, there kind

661
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,060
of is that gap.

662
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,900
We talk a lot about software, releases, those kind of things, but you're on – by and

663
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,980
large, I mean, yeah, you might have some Ferronix articles, maybe there's an ArchWiki entry

664
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,620
for your laptop, but hardware is kind of neglected.

665
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,060
It's like, well, just go to the regular PC hardware news.

666
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
You'll be fine for that.

667
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,060
Yeah.

668
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,180
Yeah, so I've been talking with Daniel Moran and he'll – I think that's how you say

669
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,180
his last name.

670
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,180
He'll be doing the writing over there and he's available on Twitter.

671
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,900
I have him linked in the show notes and he's pretty excited about it.

672
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,620
I think he's got a good vision about what he wants to do with it and it's not going

673
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,180
to be exactly what Ferronix does.

674
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,980
It will be somewhat competition in that space but I think it's going to be also more like

675
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,260
here's first day release of this new piece of hardware that everybody is talking about

676
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,780
and here's how it actually works today on Linux and if you really got to use it, here's

677
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,860
the couple of things you have to modify or tweak to make it work.

678
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,860
Awesome.

679
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Yeah.

680
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,860
Yeah.

681
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,900
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that Windows users typically get to enjoy and they talk

682
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
about that too.

683
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,620
They say, well, look, there's tons of other people that are doing Windows coverage.

684
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,620
Right.

685
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,640
And like before, we've been kind of left waiting like, OK, well, I hope someone buys

686
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,220
that laptop and writes a blog post sometime in the next six months because otherwise how

687
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,220
will I know?

688
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,220
Yeah.

689
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:59,100
I hope that somebody who's on like Planet Gnome or something, the blogs, writes about

690
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,980
buying this thing and they fix it.

691
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,340
Yeah, that's exactly it.

692
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:10,180
So I'm actually super glad that Wimpy is here because I hadn't even planned on having the

693
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,340
expertise of Mr. Martin Wimpers for this next story.

694
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,980
But Joey over at OMG Ubuntu has an article on the new software boutique app that's going

695
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,740
to ship in Ubuntu Mate 17.10.

696
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,500
Couple of things I noticed that jump out at me, Wimpy, is it looks like some of the Mate

697
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,620
branding has been stripped from this.

698
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,620
More theming support has been added and snap support.

699
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,260
It kind of feels like this is starting to be positioned as any distro could use this

700
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,260
thing.

701
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Hopefully.

702
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,260
Yeah.

703
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,620
We're using all the right technologies for that to become a thing.

704
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:49,020
We're obviously going to be developing it to hit the 17.10 release deadlines and it

705
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,100
will be squarely aimed at doing what Ubuntu Mate needs.

706
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,660
But because we're going to be using a snapdglib, which is the library to do all of the snap

707
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:05,340
stuff and then package kit now for the traditional repository installs, it could potentially

708
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,940
work anywhere.

709
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,940
So decoupling software boutique has several advantages.

710
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,900
It can be installed and used in other distros.

711
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,980
Software boutique and Ubuntu Mate welcome use and use fewer system resources and software

712
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,060
boutique will dynamically adapt to the currently selected theme to better fit in with your

713
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
preferred look and feel.

714
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,340
So I didn't realize this before, Wimpy, because I've always used it after immediate

715
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,780
installation but did the software boutique not follow my desktop theme in the past?

716
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:37,060
Well, it did in the usual places but then within the application itself, it has its

717
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:43,340
own CSS to style it and it didn't take any cues from, or it didn't take many cues from

718
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:50,620
the theme that you actually had running to, you know, blend in and it will do that now.

719
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,400
Oh, I see.

720
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,020
So can you give me a little peek behind the curtain?

721
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,460
Like are you doing the work on this?

722
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,200
Are you paying somebody to do the work on this?

723
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,820
How are they getting paid and that kind of stuff?

724
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:09,580
So most of this work is – well, all the front-end work is being done by Luke Corwell

725
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
who is a contributor to Ubuntu Mate.

726
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Yeah.

727
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,580
We've talked about him before.

728
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
Definitely.

729
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
Yeah.

730
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,700
He's responsible for all the cool stuff you see in Ubuntu Mate welcome and the software

731
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:26,860
boutique and if you use Razer peripherals, you are probably using his other project which

732
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,940
is called Polychromatic which is the tool to do all of the RGB configuration.

733
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
Cool.

734
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Okay.

735
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:39,740
Well, what a gentleman because this is one of my favorite, favorite experiences on Ubuntu

736
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
Mate.

737
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:46,140
Like I honestly would – for internal uses, it has tipped the scale in the past to know

738
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,620
that I could – you log in after your first log in.

739
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:55,180
You run this thing and now with the cued installations, you just go through and all of the great applications

740
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,380
for Linux are in here.

741
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,660
It's one of those things that makes me actually think, okay, I could install this on someone.

742
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,100
I was setting them up on Linux for the first time and I wouldn't have to be there and

743
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
walk them through.

744
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,060
I could just give them this and be like, call me when you have problems.

745
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,060
Yeah.

746
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,460
Even on systems where I've run the Unity desktop, I've still got out of my way to

747
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
install it.

748
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
Yeah, right?

749
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,460
Why not?

750
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
Boom.

751
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
We hear that a lot from people.

752
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,100
We hear a lot that people install welcome on other Ubuntu flavors just to get the boutique.

753
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,260
So there are other advantages for us.

754
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,540
It's easier to maintain the boutique when it's decoupled from welcome.

755
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,660
So I don't know how much you can say but I – if a great software –

756
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,660
Well, it's open source.

757
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,660
I can tell you whatever you want to know.

758
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:38,620
Well, so if a great software project like this comes along that happens to hit things

759
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:46,420
like snap packages, happens to have an apt, get back in, happens to use PPAs, what could

760
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,420
I as a user do to let Canonical know that I would be interested in actually having that

761
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,140
ship in mainline Ubuntu GNOME like the standard Ubuntu desktop starting with 1710 and beyond?

762
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,740
What could I do as a user to voice that opinion?

763
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,400
That's a very good question and I don't know the answer to that.

764
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,060
It seems like – I mean I know maybe 1710, that's too soon.

765
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,060
But in the LTS, what a piece of software.

766
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,500
You give folks an entirely new desktop environment but you give them this guide to get their

767
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,780
whereabouts, to get their bearings and get to the applications that they use and know.

768
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,380
It seems like it's that perfect kind of – I know this is new but this will help

769
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,060
and even just ironing out – I mean GNOME software is great and actually that is getting

770
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
pretty good.

771
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
It is getting better, yeah.

772
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,900
But just ironing out that extra little bit of friction would be really nice and a totally

773
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
new desktop environment.

774
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,660
I'd like to see we set the same person down in front of clean Windows laptop, clean Linux

775
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
laptop.

776
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,660
You got this.

777
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
You got the Windows Store.

778
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,660
Have at it.

779
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
Where are you going to be in a day?

780
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
We should bring Will on.

781
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
I'm going to try to get Will Cook.

782
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,940
I'm going to ask him because I really want this.

783
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,660
It's so great that I install it even on mainline Ubuntu desktop.

784
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Oh, yeah.

785
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
Why not?

786
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,660
Yeah.

787
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,380
So we did a lot of this work at the Snap Sprint last week and Will Cook was there as were

788
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:07,260
as Popey said earlier people from KDE and Fedora and elementary and there were a couple

789
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,820
of breakout sessions in the week where we have coffee and we all sat around and showed

790
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,180
each other our wares.

791
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:18,500
The KDE guys have added – well, they had Snap support in their store but they had written

792
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,780
their own interface for Snaps and they've now used Snap DGLib and it's cute wrappers

793
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,780
and they were showing us all of the new stuff that they'd added as a result of making

794
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
that transition.

795
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,660
So we're all doing a little bit of show and tell and everyone was looking at what

796
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,460
the new stuff in GNOME software is, what's new in KDE and they were all looking over

797
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,820
our shoulder at what is a very embryonic software boutique to see what we were up to.

798
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,140
It's kind of fun comparing notes and seeing how we're going about stuff.

799
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
I love it.

800
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:52,180
I didn't realize – has Canonical always ran this many sprints or is this something

801
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,660
that's picked up in the last year?

802
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:59,580
Well you might remember about this time last year, I was at a Snappy Sprint in Germany

803
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:04,900
and that was quite a big – and this was like the continuation of that effort but it

804
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,900
was a much smaller focus group.

805
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,960
I think there was about 30 people in total at this one and this one was more about doing

806
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,520
rather than making decisions and drawing up plans.

807
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,720
So these were – not that we've already decided we're going to do these things,

808
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,160
now how do we go about doing it?

809
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,420
And for some of us we spent the week kicking out a lot of code.

810
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,980
The great unblocking festival.

811
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Yeah, right?

812
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,500
Doesn't it just sort of kick everything through and you make serious progress?

813
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
It's fascinating.

814
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Yeah.

815
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,020
I mean for Luke and I, this was something that we wanted to work on for ages and it

816
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,760
gave us a week to actually – and it's the first time we've met in person.

817
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,060
So it actually gave us a week to like work on this stuff and actually make the progress

818
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,520
we needed to do to sort of kick this in a new direction because Luke has decoupled

819
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,300
Boutique months ago.

820
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,220
We just haven't had the time to work on it.

821
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,820
Oh, I didn't realize that.

822
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,740
I did not – I thought that was a recent thing.

823
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,340
Well, we announced it recently but Luke started this work maybe six months ago.

824
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,340
Sure.

825
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,340
Wow.

826
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
Wow.

827
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
So this is something you've been thinking about for a while.

828
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
Yeah.

829
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Smart.

830
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:18,340
I hope it takes off because it's such a great user experience and I really – I don't

831
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,340
know how much emphasis and underscore and exclamation marks I can put on this.

832
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:27,020
But as somebody who is feeling back through his years of trying to use Linux in the corporate

833
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:31,580
space and trying to use Linux as a creator and trying to use Linux as a small business

834
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:37,100
owner and trying to use Linux as a father with photos, like all of these things, I come

835
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,460
with the weight of saying this makes a difference.

836
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,540
And it seems – it's like one of those things that's so obvious but I want to – so

837
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,940
I want to go to the rooftops and I want to shout it around and say make everything better

838
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
with this.

839
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
Yeah.

840
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,740
Well, and it's like we – it seems like the time is ripe in many ways with the Windows

841
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,060
Store and everything that Apple has been doing.

842
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,060
Right?

843
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,460
Like consumers are now expecting this sort of model but the traditional workflows we

844
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,420
have for – we have the package management and those systems and all of that.

845
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,540
But something that says this is really the best of the best that you can hit one button

846
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,940
and have it installed at links and icons are here and it's just great.

847
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,840
And it does all the PPA math for you.

848
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,080
It does all of the snap math for you.

849
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,100
It just handles all of that and gives it to you in a cute interface where you can go check,

850
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,820
check, check, check, check, check, check, boom, go, make my system usable.

851
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:31,780
And one new feature is we're going to retain that curated list of the hundred or so applications

852
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:37,460
and we've had a search facility in the boutique for a while but it's only ever searched its

853
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,460
contents.

854
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,620
Now when you run a search it will query the entire archive and the Snap Store.

855
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,900
So what you see in the boutique is just the stuff we're recommending but when you search

856
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,980
for stuff it will interrogate everything it's got access to.

857
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Smart.

858
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,220
So any Snap package that's been submitted since that thing's been released will be

859
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,700
available in the search.

860
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Yep.

861
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Wow.

862
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,540
So that's like the critical momentum pieces for Snaps and the whole ecosystem it feels

863
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,940
like that suddenly it's cohesive now, it's thought out, it's well rounded.

864
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,260
So let's talk about kind of related to this is package kit.

865
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,780
Now if I say package kit, you probably think that thing I think Fedora uses, well it turns

866
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,660
out a lot more than just Fedora uses it.

867
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:25,740
Pretty much all Linux that I use it, it is – think of it as an API that sits on top

868
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,320
of your package manager.

869
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,740
So at some point in time people came together and said, I want to write something like Gnome

870
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:37,420
Software or Neon Discover or whatever and I don't want to – or KD Discover.

871
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:44,180
And I don't want to have to write a version for DNF – I'm sorry YUM then DNF for Pacman,

872
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
for APT.

873
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,020
You want one API that you can write to.

874
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
Yeah.

875
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
And so that was the idea of package kit.

876
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,100
You can actually use it as a command line tool as well which is kind of nice because

877
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,020
you can bounce around distros and use the same package kit commands to install software.

878
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,020
Hey oh.

879
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,020
Yeah.

880
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,660
So there is some real like worthwhile investment here in package kit.

881
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:07,500
However, right now – and these things always change but right now package kit on Fedora

882
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,340
is not in a great space.

883
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,660
And so – and I think this isn't a big deal.

884
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:16,340
DNF is great and Fedora users aren't like married to Gnome Software.

885
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:25,940
But it relies right now on a library libdnf, pretty sexy name really, that is pretty new.

886
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,780
And they've just recently ported it from Python to C. So like when I say it's new,

887
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,900
it's like not only is it kind of new but they've also just ported it to C kind of

888
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,900
new.

889
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,740
So it's all kinds of new.

890
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,740
And they actually say in the read me they say libdnf is not currently – I'm sorry

891
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,380
is currently being reworked and is considered unstable.

892
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,780
Once major users like package kit and DNF are fully ported, a new stable release will

893
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
be considered.

894
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,340
In other words, Gnome Software and Plasma Discover, two front end center applications

895
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:00,140
for end users of Fedora workstations, especially Gnome Software, rely on unfinished work in

896
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,500
progress in Fedora.

897
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:09,180
It's worth noting that both Pacman and the app backends like the one for Ubuntu are in

898
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,980
a much better shape.

899
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,460
I think that highlights the whole thing here, right?

900
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,100
Like the value proposition is that you're pushing this off to some middle layer and

901
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,460
you – what you can do is only as good as the binding between you and what the end system

902
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
is.

903
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
Well, and you know what?

904
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,380
DNF is newer than app or Pacman.

905
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,460
And so they just – that middleman layer hasn't been finished yet and that's really

906
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,740
the problem.

907
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,780
And you wonder like, OK, well, how bad is it?

908
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Because that was my consideration.

909
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,100
Like how bad is it?

910
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,940
Well, actually it's pretty shit actually to tell you the truth.

911
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
I was pretty surprised.

912
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,420
Like I wasn't going to cover it on the show but then I realized how shit it was.

913
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,900
I was about to say, is there a story here?

914
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
No, yeah.

915
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Yeah, there is.

916
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,680
So libdnf doesn't support delta RPMs.

917
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,820
So if you're on a mobile connection, go screw yourself.

918
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,820
So libdnf just totally ignores etcdnf.conf – etcdnf slash dnf slash –

919
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,020
That's where I put the conf I don't want to use, Chris.

920
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,020
Right.

921
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,340
So like where you maybe turn on automatic fast mirror selection, package exclusions,

922
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
controlling network utilization.

923
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,340
Nope, sorry.

924
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,740
Libdnf ignores all of that.

925
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,460
Also, it doesn't uninstall things properly and it can leave orphan packages behind.

926
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,620
When you uninstall software, it won't necessarily clean things up.

927
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,900
Oh, that's less than desirable.

928
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,700
Yeah, it also lacks safeguards to prevent users from uninstalling crucial software such

929
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:30,420
as glibc, dnf itself, also libdnf itself can be uninstalled via package kit, and other

930
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,940
things that can cause complete devastation on your system.

931
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:40,540
Now these are not total likely scenarios but it's a bit of a shit show right now.

932
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,880
It's kind of amateur hour and, you know, full disclosure, they say that in the readme

933
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
for libdnf.

934
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
They say it's not ready yet.

935
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,060
So it's not like this is a surprise here.

936
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,060
But if you're using gnome software or other graphical managers, you may like you might

937
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,980
just not have any expectation, right?

938
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,860
If it works so well, works just fine on apt or sure.

939
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,620
Well, here's what I Yeah, especially if you're coming from Ubuntu and you're trying out fedora,

940
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,900
you don't even consider the fact that it might be talking a totally different language.

941
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,540
Here's Chris's recommendation, and this is really gonna, this is gonna be fine.

942
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,180
If you want to discover software via gnome software, if you want to discover something

943
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,580
new and install it, you're gonna you're gonna be fine.

944
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,020
Maybe just do your updates from the command line or using the fedora.

945
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,020
That's not available anymore.

946
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,980
Just use your just use just do dnf update and upgrade.

947
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:28,860
Just do that because dnf will do on the command line, it will do delta packages, it'll also

948
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,360
under and when you uninstall software, just use dnf from the command line.

949
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,740
The command line syntax for dnf is exceptionally simple.

950
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,300
So I normally wouldn't say like, go to the terminal, but dnf is like simple human readable

951
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,300
commands.

952
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,300
Here's the problem with dnf though, when you tell someone to use it, they're gonna ask

953
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,380
you what it stands for.

954
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,560
What does I don't remember anymore.

955
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,560
What does it stand for?

956
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
Do you remember?

957
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,740
Does anybody in the mumble room remember what dnf stands for?

958
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,380
I thought it was something kind of womp womp.

959
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,460
Kind of meh.

960
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,660
Like does not stand for much.

961
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,660
Dandified yum.

962
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
Oh, it's down.

963
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,660
Oh, okay.

964
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,660
That's what Yeah, of course.

965
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,660
Yum.

966
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
Right.

967
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,660
Right.

968
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,660
Of course.

969
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,660
Of course.

970
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,660
Were you gonna say that w w?

971
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:11,820
It's usually do did not finish in other Oh, yeah, that's no dude.

972
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,820
That's lib dnf.

973
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:18,660
Yeah, which is back Yeah, yeah, you know, it's just something to know about.

974
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,820
I don't think anybody listening to this shows using package kit in the command line.

975
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,020
If you're just adding new applications from either goo either plasma discover like an

976
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,300
API type, you know, yeah.

977
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,260
And probably by fedora 28.

978
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,300
This isn't going to be an issue anymore.

979
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,820
This blog post over at control dot blog, wow, what a great frickin domain name, control

980
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,660
dot blog, which I have linked in the show notes.

981
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,420
It talks about how 26 and 27 are gonna have a problem, but by 28, this should be this

982
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,340
should not really be a problem anymore.

983
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,620
But it is interesting.

984
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,420
Like you said, it is interesting because we kind of think we talk a lot about there's

985
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,140
a common there's a common conception and this is gonna actually come into what we're about

986
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:01,020
to talk about that Linux is all kind of the same.

987
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,220
You know, you can use different distros, you can use pop OS, you can use Ubuntu, no, but

988
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,820
it's all kind of the same thing.

989
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,660
You can use Ubuntu Mate, you can use Ubuntu XFCE, you could use Ubuntu Studio, all kind

990
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,060
of the same.

991
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,980
And then when you switch over to something else, you know, you get the gnome desktop

992
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,580
on fedora, you're like, Oh, this is kind of the same.

993
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:25,180
And there actually can be huge, really, really like screw your disrupt differences in things

994
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,060
like package kit and what and other things.

995
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,700
And I actually think that's a that's an interesting topic to consider as we're about to go into

996
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,260
our next thing.

997
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,080
Yeah, you're absolutely right about that.

998
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:42,300
So this week, I don't know, I almost feel like I almost feel like a sec if you need

999
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,300
do you think?

1000
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,300
Yeah, that's fine.

1001
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,300
Do you think so?

1002
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,780
Because I almost feel like I almost feel like I can start to see if I can, my heart rate

1003
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
just jumped up.

1004
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,340
Like I'm starting to get a little upset.

1005
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
Could you see that?

1006
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
Scoot back?

1007
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,780
Because there's no video but you like the Westpane like theater of the mind.

1008
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,380
Do you see me starting to get a little better right now?

1009
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:57,380
Yeah, I'll get a little upset.

1010
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,380
All right.

1011
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,380
Okay.

1012
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,380
Let's take a second here.

1013
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,820
Let's take a deep breath.

1014
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
Let's talk about digital ocean.

1015
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,820
That's that's a good idea.

1016
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,820
You're right, Wes.

1017
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,820
Thank you.

1018
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
You're right.

1019
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
Because this is gonna help me.

1020
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
This is just something that makes us all happy.

1021
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,260
Focus on something that makes us happy.

1022
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,940
Digital Ocean is so great.

1023
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:13,940
DigitalOcean.com.

1024
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,500
Go over there, create an account and then apply our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1025
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,780
One word after you create the account.

1026
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,880
That's all you got to do.

1027
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,500
And then you get a $10 credit.

1028
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,500
You can spin up a rig.

1029
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,500
They have my favorite.

1030
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,100
It's not even the most expensive or the cheapest.

1031
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,700
But they have a three cents an hour rig.

1032
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,500
It's kind of like right there in the middle.

1033
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,260
And the things you can do for three cents an hour, it's crazy.

1034
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,620
DigitalOcean is the simple, easiest way to spin up some great Linux machines on their

1035
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,060
amazing infrastructure.

1036
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,620
They have data centers all over the world.

1037
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,660
New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, India.

1038
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,020
And I do prefer San Francisco, but if I'm going to spin up another droplet, I like to

1039
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,100
get close to Allen Jude as close as possible.

1040
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,100
Oh yeah.

1041
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,100
Yeah, so I go to Toronto.

1042
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,100
That Toronto data center.

1043
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,100
Plus.

1044
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,100
Speak and span.

1045
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,100
You know what else turns out?

1046
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,100
No NSA in Toronto.

1047
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,100
No.

1048
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,100
Turns out.

1049
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,740
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, create a machine on their great infrastructure

1050
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,740
in seconds.

1051
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,660
It's simple, easy to spin up infrastructure.

1052
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,860
FreeBSD is also available, tons of great Linux distributions, and a dashboard that makes

1053
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,380
it easy to use.

1054
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,220
It's like butter on top of corn on the cob at a barbecue.

1055
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,180
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1056
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,180
And they have a new feature too.

1057
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,500
Block, or I'm sorry, they have block storage, but object storage is a new feature.

1058
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,740
Oh my gosh, I'm really excited.

1059
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,740
And I'm just waiting.

1060
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,740
I signed up for the beta.

1061
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,740
I haven't heard back yet.

1062
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,740
Yeah.

1063
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,740
Literally every day I check my email.

1064
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,940
See, when you switch over to using something like object storage, it means that you're

1065
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,220
even a small application, you're building it in a way that you're going to be able to

1066
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,500
use that code base for 10 years.

1067
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,980
And the storage aspect of it too is the biggest bet when you're writing something that could

1068
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:51,020
have images or media or anything with rich content.

1069
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,100
Object storage is such a game changer.

1070
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,100
And it feels like one of the last things to drop here in like, they made a ton of improvements

1071
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,100
this year, last year.

1072
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,100
Lots, yeah.

1073
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:04,540
One of the last ones that seems to me like they're suddenly, not only is it simple, intuitive,

1074
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,420
super easy to use, but they now have basically all the features you could get from any of

1075
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,140
the major cloud providers whatsoever.

1076
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,800
I mean, they've done the same thing.

1077
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,660
With an interface and an API that none of them can even touch.

1078
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,660
And it makes such a difference.

1079
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,660
Clear upfront prices.

1080
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,700
And it's fast and easy to use.

1081
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,700
It means that in a moment before a show, before we go live, if we need a little additional

1082
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,700
infrastructure.

1083
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,700
No problem.

1084
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,700
How many times have we done that?

1085
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,700
A lot.

1086
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,700
A lot.

1087
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,780
We've even done on the live stream is like a bit.

1088
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,780
Like how long?

1089
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,420
How many seconds can we get up new infrastructure?

1090
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,460
We spun up like a game server one time.

1091
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,460
Yeah.

1092
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,460
Whatever you need.

1093
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,460
It's so awesome.

1094
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,540
So digitalocean.com, go there, create something, and use our promo code DOUNPLUG to get the

1095
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,540
credit.

1096
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,940
Thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged Program.

1097
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,940
I love it.

1098
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,420
I love that they're in the background because there's no other show where we've ever had

1099
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,420
that.

1100
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,420
We could do this more and go, like we've talked about going to a bar.

1101
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,500
Yes, a bar would be awesome.

1102
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
This is fun.

1103
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,300
You know, we have a ton of viewers in Utah.

1104
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,300
I'll go to Utah.

1105
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,300
I know.

1106
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,300
No problem.

1107
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,660
I'm like, well, if we're going to, we should go to Utah, we're going to do it.

1108
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,420
So okay, so there's a lot, there's a lot to cover here.

1109
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:16,260
Let's start with, let's start with Tuxedo.

1110
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:22,220
Tuxedo is a manufacturer of Linux notebooks in, I believe they're based in Germany.

1111
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:24,220
I've never had an opportunity to be a customer.

1112
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,500
I've never had an opportunity to interview because there's a bit of a language barrier

1113
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,740
and they have a different market.

1114
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:37,420
And today they have announced Tuxedo XFCE, which is their own version of Linux, a distro

1115
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,140
respin, if you will.

1116
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,780
And they've worked on something like this in the past, but now they're getting really,

1117
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,300
really serious about it.

1118
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,180
And they say it makes a big difference.

1119
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:50,260
Tuxedo Computers has announced the release of their own highly customized version of

1120
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,260
Linux.

1121
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:57,380
Tuxedo's Ubuntu will be its own distribution based on Linux kernel 4.1.1, even though it

1122
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,220
is based on Ubuntu 16.04, which does not ship with that kernel.

1123
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:07,140
The kernel is expected to significantly increase battery life compared to Linux Mint, while

1124
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:13,100
the Infinity Book 13 will go from six and a half hours of battery life with their new

1125
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:20,660
magic sauce, special sauce distribution to 12 hours, 12 and a half hours of battery life.

1126
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,660
Say that again for me.

1127
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,100
12 and a half hours of battery life just by installing their distribution.

1128
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,640
You install their distribution of Linux, not that piece of shit Ubuntu, but you install

1129
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:38,420
their special curated spin of XFCE's Ubuntu, and you'll go from a measly, pathetic six

1130
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,700
hours to 12 and a half hours of battery life.

1131
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,020
Now that's something to brag about.

1132
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,020
Yeah.

1133
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:46,740
Also, by the way, XFCE, they say, uses less memory than Unity.

1134
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,920
And the most important advantage for Linux beginners, all the necessary drivers and the

1135
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:58,420
latest firmware are already installed, and adjustments have been implemented, quote-unquote.

1136
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,740
Tuxedo's Ubuntu now available when you buy a Tuxedo notebook.

1137
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,220
Well, I'm looking at them right now.

1138
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,220
Are you?

1139
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,220
Yeah.

1140
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,220
How do they look to you, Wes?

1141
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,220
Hey, I mean, not too bad.

1142
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,060
Here's one that looks kind of...

1143
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:14,580
I've never tried the Infinity Book, but Wimpy, you had a chance to review it on the Ubuntu

1144
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,380
podcast, didn't you?

1145
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,460
Yeah, we did.

1146
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:24,220
We reviewed the Infinity Book Pro 13 a few weeks ago, and Marius, who's in the mumble

1147
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:30,700
room from Ubuntu Fun podcast, has also recently reviewed the same unit.

1148
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,700
Oh, really?

1149
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,700
Oh, great.

1150
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,700
This is awesome.

1151
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,700
Awesome.

1152
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,700
So what were your thoughts?

1153
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,700
If you don't mind just sort of the elevator pitch.

1154
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,380
And I remember that episode, but I wouldn't mind just a quick recap.

1155
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:44,260
Well, I'm going to skip anything to do with the hardware, because obviously this announcement

1156
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,220
is about them making their own distro.

1157
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,220
Sure.

1158
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:53,300
And I think this is probably where Marius and I have most opinion.

1159
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:59,580
This is a brave move that they're making, creating their own distribution based on Ubuntu,

1160
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:05,780
because when you receive an Infinity Book or any one of their computers pre-installed

1161
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:12,420
with Ubuntu or one of the Ubuntu flavors, it comes already with the customizations that

1162
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,420
they allude to in this announcement.

1163
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,420
Okay.

1164
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,900
That was my impression, like they've been kind of doing this.

1165
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,900
Yeah.

1166
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,460
And the problem is, is that, well, one, I can't stand by their claims for the battery

1167
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:31,420
improvements because I didn't see anywhere near that kind of battery endurance.

1168
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:36,220
And my understanding is talking to them, the modifications that they make, specifically

1169
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:44,700
the kernel changes, are to try and improve battery endurance, but that comes at a cost

1170
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,180
in that it's effectively a mainline kernel.

1171
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:54,860
So Docker doesn't run properly, LexD doesn't run properly, there's no live kernel patch

1172
00:51:54,860 --> 00:52:01,500
for you, and snaps don't work, and a whole lot of other stuff.

1173
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,620
So it's kind of, you know, not a very useful Ubuntu experience at that point.

1174
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,340
That's something I really hadn't thought of before, but that totally makes sense, is

1175
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,860
that, hey, suddenly you've disconnected this kernel.

1176
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,140
Normally I think of having a kernel with more features that I'm adding onto from the base,

1177
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,820
you know, config profile for a kernel, but here you have something where you have this

1178
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,580
user land that expects things in the kernel that you just won't have all of a sudden.

1179
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,580
Right.

1180
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,580
Right.

1181
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,580
Yeah.

1182
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,580
Like ZFS modules, for example.

1183
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,580
User namespaces, probably.

1184
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Oh, geez.

1185
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,620
So Marius, does my summary sound familiar?

1186
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,660
Pretty much, yeah.

1187
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:40,260
I've been using the Infinity Book Pro for a review for like two months, and even back

1188
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,460
then when I was in the show to talk about Magic Device, I was actually using the Infinity

1189
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:50,820
Book Pro, and halfway through the show, the screen went off and I couldn't get it to turn

1190
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,820
back on.

1191
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,820
I basically did the whole show blind, and I didn't know what to do, and it's basically

1192
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:01,100
one of the aforementioned kernel problems, or problem because they were using the mainline

1193
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,340
kernel.

1194
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,900
Okay.

1195
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,980
So this is not encouraging, then.

1196
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,820
Kernel 4.1.1, that must be a typo, right?

1197
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,820
Is that a typo?

1198
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,820
It's 4.11.

1199
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,820
It's what it's referring to.

1200
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
Okay.

1201
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,820
Okay.

1202
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,820
Thank you.

1203
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,820
Thank you.

1204
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,980
So are we just talking about some mindshare here that doesn't really matter?

1205
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,620
Is this the market that we're going to?

1206
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:26,420
Would a developer be comfortable enough adding in a different kernel or making some of these

1207
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,420
changes?

1208
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,420
I mean, okay.

1209
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:32,940
So what if we take a second here and we use the announcement of Pop OS as a lens to look

1210
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:38,060
in this, because so Tuxedo has been doing this now for a little while, as Wimpy just

1211
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,060
implied there.

1212
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,900
So Tuxedo has been doing – this isn't their first time.

1213
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,280
But now they're like serious about it and they're calling it a name and all that.

1214
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:49,820
But does it change your opinion, Wes, when you – specifically because I've talked

1215
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,280
about it on UserAir, I've talked about it on Linux Action News, but I have not heard

1216
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,140
your thoughts about Pop OS.

1217
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,940
Does it change your opinion of their announcement if you think of Pop OS or are we talking about

1218
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,740
sort of one and the same here?

1219
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:09,460
You know, there are a lot of similarities there.

1220
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,500
Everything – it just makes me think about what the – what's the maintenance burden

1221
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,920
going to be and how much is this really the special sauce?

1222
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,220
And that's what I've been trying to think about for Pop OS as well.

1223
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,220
Is this really – is this the kind of investments that I want to see?

1224
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:30,100
I think System76 has a kind of clear idea as to what they're doing.

1225
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,180
I'm not sure yet.

1226
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,460
I haven't seen – I haven't really played with it or anything like that.

1227
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,580
And so I don't know that much here about Tuxedo comparably.

1228
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:43,540
I can see why a consumer vendor would want that level of control.

1229
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:48,100
But from the Linux advocate side, the Linux power user side, it does – there's a lot

1230
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,120
of compromises and there's a lot of this isn't what I want you to focus on for me.

1231
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,060
I just want the hardware and that part of the experience to be the priority.

1232
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,060
I'll tell you what I see similar here.

1233
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,420
And I don't think they are the same thing.

1234
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:02,980
But what I do see similar here is we want to provide something for our customers that

1235
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,980
is competitive.

1236
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:09,820
And I believe that is what this is rooted in.

1237
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,220
Battery life being an example of that.

1238
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,220
I kind of want to run through the Mumble Room really quick and see what everybody thinks.

1239
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,700
I have definitely had my opportunity to share my thoughts.

1240
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,500
Benton, would you mind sharing what do you think about things like Tuxedo, Zubuntu or

1241
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Pop OS?

1242
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:29,460
Are they one and the same and do you – do you have any strong feelings about their announcements?

1243
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,060
I haven't really tested them at all.

1244
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,060
No, not tested.

1245
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,060
But what is your impression just aside from that?

1246
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,940
Just new distros coming in.

1247
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,620
So here's an idea that I've heard floated around is maybe every OEM should be making

1248
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,400
their own distribution.

1249
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,140
Perhaps every OEM should be focused on the end user experience and Benton, they think

1250
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,620
– here's the theory, Benton.

1251
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:58,400
If every OEM wants to satisfy their customer, they should focus on the experience and ship

1252
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,500
their own distribution that enables their hardware.

1253
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,500
What do you think of that?

1254
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:07,100
Well, it sounds good if it doesn't break any stuff.

1255
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:14,140
I haven't read about the German distro thing but I heard some stuff about the Pop OS and

1256
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,620
for now it's only been to GNOME, it's another teams and stuff.

1257
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,620
Yeah.

1258
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,620
Yeah, I agree.

1259
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,620
From what I've heard.

1260
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,620
Yeah.

1261
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,620
Yeah.

1262
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,620
What about you, Mariusz?

1263
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,620
What do you think?

1264
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,540
I think it's a great thing if more of companies like Tuxedo or System76 focus on getting their

1265
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,900
hardware out of the box, working with the drivers and all this stuff.

1266
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:41,220
But if the experience is like it was for Martin and me with the Tuxedo and Fintech Pro, when

1267
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:45,460
the experience is actually worse than if you put a vanilla Ubuntu on it, then I don't

1268
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,460
think you see the point.

1269
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:47,460
Right.

1270
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:48,460
Right.

1271
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,060
So what you – I mean, I think to boil down what you said is you just – if that's what

1272
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,820
they have to do to make sure that out of the box, when the customer opens the machine,

1273
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:59,860
the Wi-Fi works, the sleep works, the resume works, the video works, that's probably

1274
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,860
understandable.

1275
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:01,860
Yeah, definitely.

1276
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:02,860
Yeah.

1277
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:08,220
Well, I can see that they want to ship it out of the box with their logo on the wallpaper

1278
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,220
and that's totally fine.

1279
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,220
Sure.

1280
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,220
But that's not worth a whole OS.

1281
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,220
Yeah.

1282
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,220
Okay.

1283
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,220
Okay.

1284
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,220
So it's not worth like a whole OS.

1285
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,220
Okay.

1286
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,220
Yeah.

1287
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,220
Okay.

1288
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,220
So JM, did you want to chime in?

1289
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,220
Did you have a thought on this?

1290
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,220
Yeah.

1291
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:27,700
I had an interview with Ryan Sipes from System76 and he talked a lot about making those last

1292
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,700
mile improvements.

1293
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,700
Sure.

1294
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:36,060
Which they had a hard time doing while waiting for Canonical to ship new versions of Unity.

1295
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:40,940
I believe his words were, we waited three years for features for our operating system,

1296
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:41,940
right?

1297
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,940
Yeah.

1298
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:49,620
And it makes sense for them to do the software and the hardware.

1299
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:54,220
So what do you think, so if I said to you that people were not buying System76 hardware

1300
00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:00,900
to get their OS, but they were buying System76 hardware to get the Ubuntu OS, then I think

1301
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:07,500
Ryan's comment in that context doesn't reflect the motivations of their customers and far

1302
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,780
be it for me to say what their customers prefer.

1303
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,780
But if I was buying a System76 machine, I mean, the point I always made sure to emphasize

1304
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:18,860
for 10 years in the Linux Action Show was System76 machines were born to run Linux or

1305
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,660
I'm sorry, born to run Ubuntu.

1306
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:26,660
They run Linux, but they're born to run Ubuntu, i.e. this company has made it their

1307
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,780
mission to make sure this thing runs Ubuntu.

1308
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,180
And that is why I thought they were a great vendor to sponsor because if you want an out-of-the-box

1309
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:40,420
great Ubuntu experience, then wouldn't it be wonderful if there's this one company

1310
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:44,980
and their sole purpose is making sure that these systems run Ubuntu really well.

1311
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,940
They're born to run Ubuntu.

1312
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,000
I'm not waiting for System76's features.

1313
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,500
I'm not buying a Bonobo.

1314
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,740
I'm not buying two Bonobos and a Retel.

1315
00:58:54,740 --> 00:59:00,340
I don't buy Oryx because I want System76's features to Ubuntu.

1316
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:05,220
I buy them because I want them to run Ubuntu and mostly, actually, if I'm being honest,

1317
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,940
I want them to run the Linux kernel very well.

1318
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,300
That's what I want from them and that's why I'm buying them and I really couldn't, to

1319
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,740
be honest with you, could not give two shits what features they want to add to the desktop

1320
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,380
if they want to put a great theme on it, God bless.

1321
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:20,380
And you know what?

1322
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,380
Papa Bless have at it.

1323
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,060
I really, I think that's a great idea, but myself, I'm going to format that shit and

1324
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:28,420
I'm going to put Solace or Anagros on it and then I'm going to make it work for me

1325
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:32,740
as a workstation that gets actual work done and I'm not going to care about any pop theme.

1326
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,540
I'm not going to care about anything that's a special distribution.

1327
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,580
I just want to make sure that this thing runs Linux really well and if I know it runs mainline

1328
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:46,300
good old fashioned Ubuntu, then I know I can get my Arch Kakamani or Fedora shenanigans

1329
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,740
working on this thing.

1330
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:58,100
What does it mean to go from changes, maybe even a large amount of changes on top of an

1331
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,140
OS or distribution, whatever verbiage you want, to do that, to make it your own?

1332
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,140
You know what I mean?

1333
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:05,140
It seems like we're okay.

1334
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,580
We want, we recognize that the mainline won't be enough.

1335
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:08,580
What is it?

1336
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,260
A distro versus a fork versus an OS?

1337
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:11,260
Right.

1338
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,260
Clearly there needs to be some customization.

1339
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,100
There needs to be driver customization or whatever, but what does it mean to change that

1340
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,100
branding?

1341
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,100
What does it mean?

1342
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,460
What is that line?

1343
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:25,740
I had a really interesting realization when I visited Dell because I hadn't really ever

1344
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,380
gotten inside a company that was selling Linux at a massive scale.

1345
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:35,780
What I realized is at a certain scale, and it's actually less than you would expect,

1346
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,660
but at a certain scale, what was explained to me was you are working with Canonical on

1347
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,660
a contractual level.

1348
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:48,940
You get a partnership at some level where there's an agreement to work together.

1349
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,940
This is official.

1350
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,340
It's between two companies and there's money exchanged.

1351
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:57,380
In that process, get ready for this one.

1352
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:00,780
Because I think if you watched our Dell coverage, I think you would have the opinion and the

1353
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,940
impression that Dell did all of the modifications to Linux.

1354
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,820
Dell made the changes to make high DPI work on Linux.

1355
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,540
Dell made the changes to standardize the Ubuntu installer.

1356
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,940
Dell made the changes to do an after first boot splash screen.

1357
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:16,300
You might walk away with the impression that Dell contributed all of that code upstream

1358
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,700
and Canonical just fell backwards into adopting it.

1359
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,980
While Dell did write some of that code, the reality is, and this is explained to me, and

1360
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,580
if anyone from our friends at Canonical wants to correct me, please, because this is just

1361
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,420
third hand that I got from Dell.

1362
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:36,100
My understanding is if you sell a certain amount of computers, you become an OEM partner.

1363
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,740
By doing so, Canonical does all the heavy lifting for you.

1364
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,380
If you want to have high DPI support, if you want to have special branding, or if you want

1365
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,580
to have a special theme, or if you want to have something that works with your wireless

1366
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:52,780
chip that isn't upstream yet, Canonical actually does all of the grunt work to make that code

1367
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,140
actually work.

1368
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,860
Then they turn it over to you and say, here's your repo, here's your repos, here's your

1369
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,380
image, deploy this on the systems.

1370
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,620
What Dell has to do is they just have to figure out what hardware they want to ship.

1371
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:09,700
Then they go to a company that their entire job is to make sure that their operating system

1372
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,660
works on your hardware.

1373
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:16,260
Their entire staff is intimately familiar with Ubuntu, and then they make all of the

1374
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,460
modifications necessary, and they deliver that end result to their business partner.

1375
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,260
In this case, in my experience, it was Dell, and then Dell ships that.

1376
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:28,440
What's beautiful about that is instead of having Dell write software like they used

1377
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,500
to for Windows, you actually have the manufacturer of the operating system writing the modifications

1378
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,420
necessary to make it work on the OEM hardware.

1379
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:43,180
The concept that every OEM, every Dick and Harry OEM that gets the idea of shipping an

1380
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:49,140
ISO on an x86 box needs to write their own distribution is completely negated when you

1381
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:53,980
realize that if you work at a certain scale and you create a business opportunity with

1382
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:58,460
Canonical, they'll do the work for you, and you can call it Ubuntu legally.

1383
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,460
Problem solved.

1384
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:04,060
Then your customers that want Ubuntu can buy Ubuntu, it's called Ubuntu, and the software

1385
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:06,340
is developed by Canonical.

1386
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:12,980
And it is much more straightforward than Tuxedo as Ubuntu, or whatever it's going to be called.

1387
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,980
What is that?

1388
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,560
What are the small scale people do?

1389
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:21,340
So I'll just chip in and say, yes, there is an OEM team, and you know, that's how that

1390
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,820
arrangement works.

1391
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:29,100
My understanding is Ubuntu are not the only distro manufacturer that offers services like

1392
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,100
that.

1393
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:36,700
And, you know, I would suggest that the likes of Tuxedo and maybe System76 as well, consider

1394
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:41,220
what they're going to spend on engineering resources in terms of dollars to actually

1395
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:47,180
pull this off, and whether they do better to actually partner with insert name of distribution

1396
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:53,620
here who can offer those professional services.

1397
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:58,460
So I've not spoken, I think Chris needs to take a breather for a moment.

1398
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:02,000
I do, I appreciate you guys filling in because yeah, I will calm down because this is really

1399
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
upsetting me.

1400
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'm not kidding.

1401
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,660
I've, I've not spoken to System76, anyone from System76 since the announcement of BobOS.

1402
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:14,720
I don't doubt that I will at some point soon.

1403
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:21,620
It feels to me like they, when Canonical made the announcement back in April that we were

1404
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:26,820
downsizing slightly, and refocusing our attention on different things.

1405
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,380
And as a result, the desktop was changing.

1406
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:36,620
I think perhaps from an outsider's point of view, it looked like System76 utterly freaked

1407
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:43,540
out and did what they thought was best for them and their customers.

1408
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:51,140
Now, to be fair, System76 know better what their customers need than anyone else, right?

1409
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:55,940
Because they talk to them every day and their customers give them dollars to make this stuff

1410
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:56,940
work.

1411
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:57,940
And they're super connected too.

1412
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,460
Like they are, they're not like a company that just sort of sells a piece of hardware

1413
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,980
and then they just, like they really are good faith.

1414
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,460
Like they have employees who talk to their customers all day every day and they get good

1415
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:09,260
feedback from their customers about what they like and what they don't like.

1416
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:12,100
And they're getting support calls and they're telling, you know, they're working with these

1417
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,180
people and okay, yeah, this is always something we get a call about.

1418
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:16,900
Yeah, here's all you have to do to fix that.

1419
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,660
I cannot totally understand that.

1420
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,660
Right.

1421
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:26,700
But this is reminding me of something in the IT world that's been happening for years.

1422
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:33,680
Have we learned nothing from Android where every single manufacturer has their own strange

1423
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:40,020
quirky version of Android that's bastardized from the original and is slightly different

1424
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:47,300
and not well maintained, doesn't get updates and isn't as consistent as all the others.

1425
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,380
It's a perfect thing.

1426
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,420
It sells iPhones.

1427
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,900
It's a road that sells iPhones.

1428
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:58,780
It's a road that leads to the damn Apple store.

1429
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:03,940
What I see is that I just don't want like, are these upstream chains?

1430
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,860
Are these going to go upstream?

1431
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,860
Any of these gestures?

1432
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,300
Are they going to be updating us?

1433
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,780
I suppose.

1434
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:15,280
But you know, so upstream is something that gets tossed around a lot.

1435
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,260
But let's take a second and talk seriously.

1436
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,140
Let's like, let's be real about it.

1437
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:24,420
So if you're going to make a modification that works with your limited range of hardware

1438
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:28,340
and then you submit it upstream, there is not a guaranteed chance that's going to

1439
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:29,340
be accepted.

1440
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:33,540
There's no – no one knows what the quality of that code is going to be.

1441
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:40,140
There's no saying how the impact on the overall ecosystem is.

1442
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:45,540
Saying you're going to create something and toss it upstream is not the same as actually

1443
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:50,860
having upstream stuff you send upstream getting accepted and integrated into the wider ecosystem.

1444
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:51,860
Right.

1445
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:52,860
And it raises the question too, right?

1446
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:57,180
It's upstream's job to guard against modifications or changes that are only, you know, make sense

1447
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,140
for your base but may not make sense for the broader community.

1448
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:01,140
Right.

1449
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:12,580
So say Tuxedo decides to, in a year from now, let's say that after 1804 ships, Tuxedo,

1450
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,620
they're going to – let's just – I'm just theory here.

1451
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:22,980
Tuxedo launches Unity 7 Legacy Edition because their customers have heard – they've heard

1452
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,180
from their customers.

1453
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,520
They got support tickets.

1454
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,920
They got phone calls.

1455
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,580
They got emails and they have tweets that all of these customers miss Unity 7.

1456
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:39,700
So Tuxedo launches the Unity 7 Tuxedo Linux and it's great, Wes, because you log right

1457
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,300
in and you just get the great traditional Unity 7 desktop.

1458
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,300
My favorite.

1459
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:45,300
It just knocks it out of the park.

1460
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:47,180
It's really nice and standard and it's easy.

1461
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:51,180
And so they, you know, but a couple of users have noticed that the online accounts don't

1462
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,960
really support any of the modern services anymore because it's been a couple of years

1463
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,100
and, you know, it'd be nice to sort of maybe get those updated.

1464
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:02,260
So Tuxedo writes a patch to add support to the online accounts to make sure that you

1465
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:06,340
can log into you name it service, Mastodon, so you can get your fucking Mastodon account

1466
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:10,460
logged into Unity 7 and they submit that upstream and then guess what?

1467
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,300
The canonical team looks at that and goes, yeah, well, that's great.

1468
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:17,180
That's code for a desktop we don't maintain anymore for a social platform that's dominated

1469
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,560
by social justice warriors that we don't support anymore.

1470
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,560
So thanks, but no thanks.

1471
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,520
We're not going to integrate that upstream, but thank you for writing the code.

1472
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,340
And then Tuxedo writes a blog post about how they've written upstream code and they

1473
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,580
submitted it, but nobody accepted it.

1474
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,660
You see, there's no winning here.

1475
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,380
No, there's not.

1476
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,820
I suppose there's not.

1477
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,780
That's the world of distributions.

1478
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:43,060
I guess that's what's been frustrating here and what I was trying to get at earlier is

1479
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:53,100
I just don't see the kind of tenants or axioms or clear thoughts behind what does it mean

1480
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,100
for this to be a distribution?

1481
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,900
What does it mean for it to be an OS?

1482
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,900
Why are we doing this?

1483
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,180
What are our changes actually be?

1484
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:02,420
Because when it was just like modifications that include drivers or new firmware or some

1485
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:05,060
customizations that are the boot screen or whatever, okay, those all make sense.

1486
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:10,440
Those seem like a reasonable level of customization to be applied to a base operating system.

1487
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:14,760
But when I compared things, like when we've talked so much about Solace recently, et cetera,

1488
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:19,260
that feels much more like something that has goals, it has process, it has a philosophy

1489
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:21,180
behind it.

1490
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:25,980
I don't see these in that same light and it doesn't feel like an organic space for a Linux

1491
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:27,780
distribution to really thrive.

1492
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:34,660
I think the other thing that I find slightly irritating is seeing a company who's in a

1493
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:40,520
difficult position like System76 or Tuxedo who clearly have customer demand or their

1494
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:47,460
own internal brainstorming that's decided they need to do this and then tell us that

1495
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,740
they've waited for us to do something for three years.

1496
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:56,220
They could have contributed to Unity over those last three years.

1497
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:00,260
It's the same argument that I keep seeing when a project gets shut down, a lot of people

1498
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,940
pop up out of the woodwork and then fork it.

1499
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,620
It's like, well, the reason this died is because for the last three years you didn't contribute

1500
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:12,340
but suddenly you want to contribute after the death of the thing has already been announced.

1501
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,620
If you wanted the thing to be better three years ago, you should have contributed three

1502
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,500
years ago, not now.

1503
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,500
Okay.

1504
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:23,980
I want to play devil's advocate because I watched Ryan's interview on the Lunduke Hour

1505
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:30,840
and at the end of it, I felt like he didn't mention anything new.

1506
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,220
There was nothing that hasn't been in a blog post or replies to comments that we didn't

1507
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,220
already know.

1508
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,220
I was a little disappointed.

1509
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,580
I was hoping to hear something new because what he did toss out there was something about

1510
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,220
flat packs and snaps that didn't make any sense to me.

1511
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:49,300
I actually did kind of understand a bit where they're coming from because he said something

1512
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,460
that really resonated with me.

1513
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,540
He said, we just want to make great things.

1514
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:58,020
We just want to do great work and fuck if I don't understand that, man.

1515
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,220
I really understood – like when he said that, I was like, yeah, okay.

1516
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:06,100
I can see where they're coming from to some degree and I can almost actually understand

1517
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,980
why they had no other choice.

1518
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:15,020
I feel like they legitimately had no other choice than to do this and so I'm sitting

1519
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:20,100
here like really super skeptical and at the same time, like I'm going like, yeah, I

1520
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,980
kind of understand guys, why you had to do this.

1521
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,540
So I kind of want to share some of that with you.

1522
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,900
So let's talk first about Linux Academy, our last sponsor this week and we got to give

1523
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,300
this in before I forget.

1524
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:34,620
There's a lot of barbecue stuff going on and the summer is here and Linux Academy is

1525
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:35,980
a great use of your time.

1526
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:38,220
You're sitting around wasting time right now.

1527
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,220
Use Linux Academy.

1528
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:42,620
If you're sitting around in your car driving to work right now and you're thinking, man,

1529
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:47,180
I wish I had a lifestyle that enabled me to live a little bit differently, Linux Academy,

1530
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,500
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1531
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:54,380
I say this because before they ever became a sponsor, I had a lot of conversations.

1532
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,140
In fact, I had conversations about producing content for them.

1533
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:03,220
I had conversations about running shows on the JB network from them.

1534
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:08,420
We really kind of came eye to eye on one thing and that was spreading the adoption of Linux.

1535
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:12,020
Now this was several years ago now, which almost sounds like a stupid thing to say because

1536
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:13,540
it's like so crazy.

1537
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:16,180
How do you say it?

1538
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:17,180
I'm not sure.

1539
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:18,180
I can't say it post-Berman.

1540
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,180
You are not that.

1541
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:20,540
That's not your name.

1542
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,940
Please, just talk about Linux Academy.

1543
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,080
Oh, okay.

1544
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,080
Linux Academy.

1545
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,080
Please, I need to know.

1546
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,080
Linux Academy.

1547
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,080
Okay.

1548
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,080
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1549
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,480
And when we were first talking and then later on a couple months later we were talking about

1550
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,540
how they were building out their virtualization system so that you could do these labs where

1551
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:45,680
Where you SSH into a server and you're working on a real server.

1552
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:49,020
It's such a difference because that's exactly how I learn.

1553
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:52,220
It means when I go to – not only does it mean I'm going to test better, which is

1554
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:56,160
obviously a benefit, but I think the thing that matters a lot more than that is when

1555
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:01,000
I actually go to do the work, I have the confidence that I've done this before because I actually

1556
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,980
did it in one of their hands-on labs and they have instructor mentoring too, like real human

1557
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:05,980
beings to help you.

1558
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:10,420
They have CERTs – if you want to go for CERTs, they have courses for that, like just

1559
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,420
HyperCard.

1560
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,220
Are you familiar with that?

1561
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,540
They don't have courses on that.

1562
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:15,540
No.

1563
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:21,300
They also don't have courses on barbecue because they're focused.

1564
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:27,260
They don't have courses on Windows Command Line Essentials or working with the IPX protocol.

1565
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:28,740
They don't have courses on that.

1566
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:31,920
But they do have flashcards that are forked by the community and made better and better

1567
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,980
to help you study.

1568
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:36,020
They have nuggets when you have just a little bit of time you want to do a deep dive.

1569
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:38,900
They have a course scheduler when you've got a time frame and you need to just stick

1570
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:44,840
to it, kind of like an exercise for your mind – linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1571
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,100
So I was looking at both Pop!

1572
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,100
OS.

1573
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:53,300
I kind of ironically – I have it installed on a Dell Precision laptop.

1574
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,300
I have Pop!

1575
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,300
OS right now out there.

1576
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,300
Yes, you do.

1577
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,300
I've invited everybody here to the barbecue, which is – how many people do you think

1578
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,300
we have here?

1579
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,300
I couldn't even –

1580
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,620
That's a great question.

1581
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:03,620
Yeah.

1582
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:04,620
We have a lot of people here.

1583
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,620
We have a good amount.

1584
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:06,620
They're the best people.

1585
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:10,300
And more than a dozen, not including us.

1586
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:13,700
And I've asked them all to kind of take a look at it, like, hey, here is the Dell Precision

1587
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:14,700
running Pop!

1588
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,700
OS.

1589
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,700
And I always snicker.

1590
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:21,620
And one of the things I was really impressed with – and I'm showing the Tuxedo Zubuntu

1591
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,620
screencast right here.

1592
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:26,180
That's the – let me just mute that because that music is distracting me.

1593
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:29,300
I think I would like XFCE more if it came with that music.

1594
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,300
Yeah, right?

1595
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:36,820
And looking at both Pop! OS and Tuxedo Zubuntu, I get it.

1596
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:37,820
I do get it.

1597
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:42,500
They – and I'll talk more about System76 because I get it more than Tuxedo.

1598
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:47,660
Tuxedo is a joke because it looks like a house of cards.

1599
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:53,060
In fact, if I'm not mistaken, their previous attempts have been pretty, pretty bad.

1600
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:59,020
I'm sure you must have had some experience from their Ubuntu Mate attempt in the past.

1601
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:04,380
So the review unit that I received had an Ubuntu Mate image on it, but they made a number

1602
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:09,040
of customizations beyond the kernel stuff I referenced earlier.

1603
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:15,040
So they'd replaced the Greeter – they replaced the GTK Greeter with the Unity Greeter, which

1604
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:20,580
as a distro maintainer, as soon as I saw that when the thing booted up, I knew it was going

1605
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:25,740
to be bad because I know full well that that breaks things in Mate because it pulls in

1606
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:32,620
different input managers, so IBUS for example, and it means that the keyboard layout is completely

1607
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,900
un-configurable.

1608
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:40,660
So that was one example, but also because of that change and the way that Ubuntu Mate

1609
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:44,440
16.04 is put together, they have this – this is something that they've created.

1610
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,940
They have a script that runs on first login.

1611
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:51,180
Now it's in German language, so I didn't know what it said, but I had it translated

1612
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,180
since.

1613
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:58,300
So it basically says welcome, and you click okay, but behind the scenes that does an apt-get

1614
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:04,980
auto – apt-get minus y auto remove, and that actually removed most of the Ubuntu Mate

1615
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,780
meta packages and software.

1616
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,780
No.

1617
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,780
No.

1618
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,380
Yeah, so that was the out-of-box experience.

1619
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:17,240
Now these are considerations, so you know when – you can hear the full gruesome story

1620
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,240
on Ubuntu podcast.

1621
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,500
There's a full review of the laptop.

1622
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,220
Yeah, it was good too.

1623
01:16:23,220 --> 01:16:25,900
You were actually pretty polite, if I'm going to say.

1624
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,380
You were actually fairly polite.

1625
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,380
Yeah.

1626
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:33,420
I mean it's disappointing from my point of view because I obviously make Ubuntu Mate

1627
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:37,840
and I've put a lot of effort into it over the years for it to work hopefully the right

1628
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,960
way when people install it for the first time, so to think that people might be buying computers

1629
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:48,460
and this is what they expect, that reflects badly on my work, and it also reflects badly

1630
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,000
on Tuxedo.

1631
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:59,060
But it's an illustration of the kind of naivety that someone who isn't a distro maintainer

1632
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,980
has about how easy it is to maintain a distro.

1633
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:07,940
You know, all I'm doing is changing the greeter and changing the theme with not a full appreciation

1634
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:11,060
of what the knock-on effects of doing that might be.

1635
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:17,220
A cynical person, Martin, might think that the negative feedback that you gave to the

1636
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:25,820
people at Tux, whatever they call Tuxedo, that negative feedback might reflect badly

1637
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:32,020
on the recent blog post where they talk about how their XFCE edition is better memory footprint

1638
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,020
even Ubuntu Mate.

1639
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,020
Yeah.

1640
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,020
I don't care what they write.

1641
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:40,740
They also took a couple of shots at System76 in that post, it's in German so it's a little

1642
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,140
hard to translate, but yeah they did.

1643
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:46,220
Yeah, you know, that's fine.

1644
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:51,940
I mean they're welcome to make the comparisons that they want to make, that's fine by me.

1645
01:17:51,940 --> 01:18:02,100
So here's where I could kind of see no other choice than doing this and I have to make

1646
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,900
some assumptions and I'm not saying these assumptions are correct, but I'm going to

1647
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,460
make some assumptions to just try to share what I perceive to be their side based on

1648
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:17,540
what I've read, talking in years of conversations with Carl and recently with Ryan.

1649
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:21,020
I know every person in the System76 office except for the couple of new people they've

1650
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:26,160
hired since I've been there last, but I actually met one of them at Linux Fest, two of them.

1651
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:27,160
So actually I think I know everybody there.

1652
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,700
And that third one, he's coming for you, watch out.

1653
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:33,380
So I'm not saying this is not officially their position and I'm not saying this is the position,

1654
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:37,260
I'm saying this is my insight, maybe it's an 11 year customer too.

1655
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:43,540
I think that they have reached a point where they have maximized the leverage that they

1656
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:49,260
can apply against the ODMs and the ODMs being Clevo perhaps and others.

1657
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,660
And so they are trying to be competitive, they want to create a workstation, mobile

1658
01:18:53,660 --> 01:19:00,980
and desktops, that address creators, developers, engineers, specifically people who are most

1659
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,420
likely to buy Linux machines.

1660
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:06,660
People we've talked about on this very show and said, let's be real, new users aren't

1661
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,140
coming to Linux automatically.

1662
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,620
You have to introduce them to Linux.

1663
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:13,660
Otherwise the people that are seeking out Linux are Windows and Mac OS refugees that

1664
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,140
just want to get their damn job done.

1665
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,740
And a lot of times they're writing software, they're in the engineering, scientific or

1666
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:22,860
creative field.

1667
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:28,540
And on top of that, System76 makes machines that are exceedingly more powerful than most

1668
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:31,140
other hardware manufacturers.

1669
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:35,660
Like we have Doug out there in the living room right now who has the Bonobo workstation

1670
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:41,100
and he pulls that thing out of his bag man and it is the size of a skyscraper.

1671
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:46,780
But sure enough, if it's not a powerhouse with ports for days and power for centuries.

1672
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,580
And the Oryx Pro is the same, right?

1673
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,540
It's nothing like Apple makes, it's nothing like HP makes.

1674
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:55,820
It's similar to stuff Dell makes but it's still in its own category and its own league

1675
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,140
with certain things plus it's Ubuntu.

1676
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:03,300
Now if you're making this hardware and you've got these customers that are coming to you

1677
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:11,540
looking for something other than a laptop that has four USB-C ports, you want to be

1678
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:17,020
able to provide an experience that's similar to the competition, a complete hardware and

1679
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,020
software experience.

1680
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,020
And …

1681
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,540
Matthew Feeney Dare I say, synergy?

1682
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,580
Jason Kuznicki There gets to be a point when you start considering

1683
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:30,100
things like super high resolution screens, LTE modems, dual batteries, other things we

1684
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,300
haven't even considered that you might just …

1685
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:36,980
You're just going to have to start making more and more fricking modifications to Ubuntu

1686
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:41,460
that it's almost a joke to call it Ubuntu anymore because you've got a PPA in there

1687
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:45,860
that makes kernel module stuff, it puts stuff all over the file system, it changes the way

1688
01:20:45,860 --> 01:20:49,980
things operate and now you're maybe preloading software like a blender, maybe you're going

1689
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,860
to preload a text editor that people really like.

1690
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:57,380
You're going to make this thing more readily available and just out of the box great workstation

1691
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,380
for developers.

1692
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:02,460
So you're going to maybe put something crazy on there like visual studio code or maybe

1693
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,860
for strategic reasons you want to just totally integrate flat packs throughout the entire

1694
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:06,860
operating system.

1695
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:10,820
So there are these things that you're considering and then there are these back in the mind

1696
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:12,660
problems you've had with support over the years.

1697
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:17,180
Like a lot of times we've had to fix problems by just shipping people newer drivers that

1698
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:20,820
aren't in mainline Ubuntu so that's often the fix.

1699
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:24,940
So it'd be kind of better if we could just release maybe every three months, if we could

1700
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:29,200
just push out a release every three months with the latest drivers that fix microcode

1701
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:34,260
issues that make hyper-threading unstable and fix problems with your Thunderbolt controller

1702
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:38,820
and enable the webcam or the fingerprint reader and we're just going to push this stuff every

1703
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,100
single month and including that we'd like to update the theme and make it look good

1704
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:44,860
and keep polishing the brand because we've got a person over here working on it all the

1705
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,460
time and they're always making modifications.

1706
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:51,260
Jesus, you really can't call this Ubuntu anymore.

1707
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,700
And now all of a sudden you're at a position where what do you do?

1708
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,700
Do you keep calling it Ubuntu because that starts pretty much getting you in, I would

1709
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:04,900
think, in the sights of trademark issues or did you say, you know what, fuck it.

1710
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,140
We can maintain this, we can do the Q&A before we ship these machines, if it's not ready

1711
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:13,380
we won't ship it, we're going to base it on Ubuntu anyways, we'll be able to take advantage

1712
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:16,940
of their repos and we won't have to host all that stuff so we'll save a ton of money and

1713
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:20,860
we'll ship it on our machines and we'll put it out there and you know when people complain

1714
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:27,100
we'll say it's Ubuntu but it's our own spin and honestly how could you not do that, seriously,

1715
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,560
how could you not do that?

1716
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,560
How could you not do that?

1717
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,980
I mean it's pretty tempting right now, yeah.

1718
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:32,980
I kind of want to do it myself.

1719
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:35,420
I actually started an Ubuntu spin while you were talking.

1720
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:39,140
Yeah, I mean if I didn't have the scale to participate in the OEM program where I could

1721
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:45,900
just make Canonical do the work for me, this is the route I would go.

1722
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,340
And that's why you see Tuxedo doing it, Purism actually did it early on, we didn't realize

1723
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:54,780
it, but these guys are really copying what Purism did months ago.

1724
01:22:54,780 --> 01:23:02,260
Purism did this initially and I have talked to several sources inside Purism that have

1725
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:06,180
told me that one of the reasons that they shipped their own desktop instead of Ubuntu

1726
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:14,660
Vanilla and I've heard this from multiple sources that System76 was already shipping

1727
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:19,660
Vanilla Ubuntu so they had to differentiate so that's why they didn't ship Vanilla Ubuntu

1728
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:21,540
with the Librems.

1729
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,060
Interesting.

1730
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:29,540
So it's almost like System76 is going to open themselves up to more market competition

1731
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:33,780
because there is a market for people that really want real Ubuntu because this is what

1732
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:38,540
they need for their job and they want their machine, their laptop, their dev environment

1733
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,420
to mere production.

1734
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:44,980
So as I understand it System76 have said that although they're going to debut Pop!

1735
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:49,980
OS for 17.10, they will continue to offer Ubuntu as an install option at the point of

1736
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:50,980
purchase.

1737
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,620
Oh very good, I think that's smart.

1738
01:23:52,620 --> 01:24:03,300
I don't think it's going away at all but it isn't clear to me what customer Pop OS is

1739
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,020
looking to serve.

1740
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:09,180
I've not seen anything in the discussions to fully understand that.

1741
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:14,500
Well what if it is just somebody who wants a really great GNOME desktop on Ubuntu?

1742
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:20,940
Like if Ubuntu is going to go all in on GNOME and Ubuntu is my jive, then why not run something

1743
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:25,740
that's like the Mint of Ubuntu for GNOME?

1744
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:29,340
I don't think you want to start labelling Pop OS as the Mint of Ubuntu.

1745
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:32,020
I think that would be an unfortunate.

1746
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,460
But you follow my drift though right?

1747
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:36,940
There has been a market demand there.

1748
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:43,100
Yeah so I mean the thing about Linux Mint, and this is another concern I have about these

1749
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:50,300
OEMs going their own way as opposed to working with distros, is that there are all manner

1750
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,160
of considerations that get made.

1751
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:57,580
So you were talking earlier about the GNOME JavaScript backend, GJS.

1752
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:03,540
That was recently added to the main repository for Ubuntu 17.10 as part of the migration

1753
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,220
to the GNOME desktop.

1754
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:11,780
But that came under quite a lot of security scrutiny by the security team at Canonical

1755
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,420
because that has a short maintenance window.

1756
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:20,020
So their questions were how do we maintain this thing that is fundamental to the desktop

1757
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:29,580
that has such a short lifespan and is able to pull down code from arbitrary online sources?

1758
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:33,200
So that was something that was thought about long and hard at Canonical.

1759
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:38,980
Now I'm not saying that System76 are about to do this or Tuxedo are about to do this,

1760
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:44,780
but somewhere along the line Linux Mint started making decisions about the governance and

1761
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:49,880
the direction of their projects and they ended up with a decision which is you will never

1762
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:55,060
get critical security updates by default.

1763
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:59,860
It's those kinds of decisions that you can work with a wider group of people with security

1764
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:05,100
teams with people with experience of putting distros together to help overcome those tough

1765
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:08,660
decisions and present some insight that you may not have on your own.

1766
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:12,420
So it also strikes me as a position of comfort.

1767
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:18,220
So these are decisions that are being made both by Tuxedo and System76 that strike me

1768
01:26:18,220 --> 01:26:23,580
as short term decisions that don't reflect what we have coming over the horizon.

1769
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:28,820
Linux has got a lot of really big things and because we're talking about System76 and

1770
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:32,200
Tuxedo I want to keep it focused on the desktop here for a second but there's so many things

1771
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,420
I could go into that are server related.

1772
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:38,900
But just specifically on the desktop you've got Wayland coming down the pipe but it's

1773
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:43,900
not I mean it won't be that many more episodes until we're talking about GTK4 and wouldn't

1774
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:52,180
it if we were talking about the transition to Wayland and GTK4 right now imagine System76

1775
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:59,460
and Tuxedo now having to take and Mint and Mint who just got to GTK3 with like a dozen

1776
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:08,500
episodes ago now imagine witnessing them make the painful transition to GTK4.

1777
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:13,860
It's a position of luxury in which there has been some refinement and stagnation for the

1778
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:18,500
last few years and it is with that mindset that it seems like well this shit's going

1779
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,500
to be easy.

1780
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,740
You know what I just do this I just do that and I just put it up here on this and I got

1781
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:26,020
the GitHub community and what's the problem?

1782
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:30,380
And it's not until you have to really start doing some significantly heavy lifting where

1783
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,700
these things are going to change and then all of a sudden we're right just like the

1784
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:38,140
point was made earlier we're right back in the Android system where Samsung's delaying

1785
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:42,780
their latest OS by six months because they got to make sure that the new Samsung UI works

1786
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:46,420
with the latest version of Android.

1787
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:52,780
Now as far as I know the transition to GTK4 isn't going to introduce the kind of theming

1788
01:27:52,780 --> 01:28:00,180
complexities that the not so distant past with GTK3 did but like you say just adding

1789
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:05,260
a theme is easy but then maintaining that theme through new releases of the toolkit

1790
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:11,340
can be a massive undertaking and we've seen this in the Linux community.

1791
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:18,060
Just look at how many independent theme creators there were six years ago and now look at how

1792
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:23,820
many are actively making new themes today because they have drifted away because they

1793
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:29,420
got screwed over every six months every time they had to rework their themes and it just

1794
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:32,460
became too much effort for a lot of people.

1795
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:35,740
Yeah that is actually really true that is something I've watched personally some of

1796
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:40,180
my favorite themes have died off.

1797
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:45,300
Wow but at the same time I don't deviate from the from the position like I totally understand

1798
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,540
why they've done it and I almost don't think they had any other option.

1799
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:50,540
Even when you feel maybe that they're you know that a bunch of you is less focused on

1800
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,580
the desktop or on what they're doing.

1801
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:58,020
Well I if I could have if I could have like gotten a Doctor Who time machine or a Bill

1802
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,020
Sh- It's in the garage.

1803
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:00,020
Oh yeah?

1804
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:01,020
Uh-huh.

1805
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,020
Oh what about the Bill- I think Dylan's playing with it.

1806
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:04,860
What about the Bill Shatner Bird of Prey that I can fly around the sun can I because that's

1807
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,580
my preferred method of transportation.

1808
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:07,660
It's cloaked I'm sorry.

1809
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:12,340
If I could go back just six months and I could if I could have a if I can have a little closed

1810
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:16,700
room conversation with Carl I go into his office where he's got his he's got his system

1811
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:21,780
set up there and I would sit down and I'd say Carl I would say stay tuned three to five

1812
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:26,140
months after this Unity 7 announcement that's coming and he'd say what Unity 7 announcement?

1813
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:29,620
I'd say don't worry about it but there's gonna be something important it's gonna in fact

1814
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:33,700
it's gonna also impact Unity 8 and that phone you've been working on for three years and

1815
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:36,940
you're gonna be super upset about it but if I could just give you one piece of advice

1816
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:41,100
and I'm like I'm like biff right now I'm giving biff like the sportsbook you know I'm saying

1817
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:48,500
just give it six months and see where they go because I'll tell you I have subscribed

1818
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:52,880
to the mailing list for the Ubuntu desktop because Will Cook is submitting stuff every

1819
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,580
single week about what they are working on and sure enough if not every single week it

1820
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:02,460
has it hasn't made something useful for the Linux action news about what they're doing

1821
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:08,060
to make the transition to Unity from Unity I should say to Gnome easier and the things

1822
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:13,580
that they're tweaking to make it a they're adding features that I wish the Unity 7 desktop

1823
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:18,540
had then they're adding to the Gnome desktop so it just you know if you just hang tight

1824
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:23,380
for a few months and see where things go hang tight till the LTS you know hang tight ship

1825
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:27,740
it ship it and just wait till the LTS and see what happens and then by the LTS if you

1826
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:32,460
don't like what you're seeing rebase off of that 1804 would be the thing to base off

1827
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,340
if you're gonna create a distribution at that point I'm sorry don't call it distribution

1828
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:40,620
if you're gonna create an operating system this is an OS man base it off the LTS and

1829
01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:44,900
give yourself a buffer to figure this shit out to figure out transitions to Wayland to

1830
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,980
figure out transitions to GTK 4 to wonder if maybe you should have gone with the plasma

1831
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:54,380
desktop to really differentiate yourself give yourself that buffer with the LTS but to go

1832
01:30:54,380 --> 01:31:00,820
with 1710 to go with 1710 they know better than that I mean I know they want to ship

1833
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:03,660
the latest hardwares and they want to ship the latest kernels and they want to ship the

1834
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:10,620
latest enablements but my god go with the 8 go with the 1804 you have watched Ubuntu

1835
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:18,240
for 11 years you know that they roll this shit out in the in between releases and they

1836
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,620
bang things around to see how it works and then they nail it down for the LTS you know

1837
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:29,980
that you know that you know that you know that so why would you base your OS off of

1838
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:38,300
a 1710 which is mid transition mid effing transition mid transition it is the most awkward

1839
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:43,260
stage of what Ubuntu is going to be for the last 11 years that you have been shipping

1840
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:48,340
Ubuntu quite literally not even the transition to unity was this awkward because you nailed

1841
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:55,060
that you got it but this is it this is the most awkward moment in the last 11 years of

1842
01:31:55,060 --> 01:32:00,820
the Ubuntu desktop it's 1710 and it looks good I mean I'm really impressed but you based

1843
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:06,160
it off 1710 I know right now I know right now it's 1704 I understand that I have it

1844
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:11,580
installed I'm running it but you're going for 1710 and that's crazy that's crazy why

1845
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:15,620
wouldn't you wait for the LTS why wouldn't you give them a few months to figure out what

1846
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:20,260
they're doing because you know what it looks pretty good they're working with upstream

1847
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:24,420
they're getting snap support built in to gnome software so it's not some weird canonical

1848
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:29,520
patch set to the gnome desktop they're making sensible choices with extensions they're asking

1849
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:35,060
the community for their feedback it's it is a clear transition already in its early beta

1850
01:32:35,060 --> 01:32:39,760
state it is a clear transition from the unity 7 desktop to the gnome desktop it's exactly

1851
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:45,100
what I would think the system 76 customers would want would be stable simple transition

1852
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:53,140
to know and what's pop OS shipping no it should be no it should be known three pop OS is shipping

1853
01:32:53,140 --> 01:33:00,860
known three what is Ubuntu 1710 shipping no no three it's the same thing so all of the

1854
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:05,740
heavy lifting of a transition all of the awkward stuff all of the stuff that's weird and different

1855
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:13,580
it's it's happening regardless and they're making it an easy transition pop OS is not

1856
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:17,940
bad I mean the theme is not bad I kind of like it you did the whole show notes and everything

1857
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:24,660
on it today right not bad not bad however it is nothing like unity and the thing is

1858
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:29,180
the gnome 3 implementation that Ubuntu 1710 is going to ship with is a lot like unity

1859
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:36,460
it looks like unity it's familiar it is an obvious transition path what pop OS is is

1860
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:43,420
more like XP to Windows 8 I see what you're saying I mean it does kind of feel like unfortunate

1861
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:47,500
timing you know when they when they previously talked about like the pop theme etc that felt

1862
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:50,460
a little more natural like an immediate reaction something like okay well we don't know what's

1863
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:55,300
coming coming now I think I think you're entirely right that there is going to be a

1864
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:01,180
lot of changes and while system 76 does need to keep abreast of those what they have right

1865
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:06,420
now I think is stable enough they're not in a huge rush to present this whole new operating

1866
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:09,540
system that they suddenly have to support that they have it's like an entirely change

1867
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:17,700
of lifestyle and supports cycle and all of that I I guess I guess it really doesn't it

1868
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:24,460
doesn't matter as long as they offer the Ubuntu 1710 vanilla like if you have that as an option

1869
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:28,580
install and that's what makes your corporate purchaser happy then have at it and then if

1870
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:33,660
enthusiasts they like think it's a good idea can use pop OS and choose that it by by time

1871
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:37,380
or build time that's true that seems like that's actually a pretty good way to go about

1872
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:41,820
it and then system 76 will have the numbers they'll have that and they can see what's

1873
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:46,340
successful but myself if I was going to launch Jupiter broadcasting OS don't call it a distro

1874
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:51,340
if I was going to launch Jupiter broadcasting OS no way in hell would I base it on 1710

1875
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:59,500
I might go 1604 to be honest with you but I would probably wait for 1804 really so I

1876
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:04,020
if so what I here's where I feel like I'm at is I would probably wait a couple of years

1877
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:07,780
to see how this thing plays out and I would probably buy it with Ubuntu for now and then

1878
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:12,700
I would just you know see where pop OS goes see if they get a good community you know

1879
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:15,460
and see if they start shipping some stuff I'm like damn that's a good idea and you

1880
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,260
know like you'll know because like some of their modifications will start showing

1881
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:22,580
up in the AUR right and you'll see Fedora users that are posting guides on how to get

1882
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:26,460
that and Ubuntu users will have guides on how to convert their existing Ubuntu install

1883
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:30,660
into more pop like if you start seeing that kind of stuff that'll be a sign that they

1884
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:34,060
have a they have some they have some good momentum they have some success here and I'm

1885
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:38,340
all for that like go for it and and then I'll just kind of sit back and wait and look at

1886
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:42,340
and go okay all right I'll wait for it and I'll wait till 1804 version ships and then

1887
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:46,220
that might be when I try it I mean I have a running now but I don't think I would run

1888
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:50,780
on anything in production until 1804 right I was gonna say that you know this in the

1889
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:55,540
same way it feels very much right it's like they're just like it's 1710 it's their 1710

1890
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:59,080
except even more so right it's like the the beta beta where they're they're kind of playing

1891
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:04,380
with this now it's just hard to have that kind of announcement and to have you know

1892
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:08,340
the interpretation is is always going to be like this is the future no matter what this

1893
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:14,260
is what you'll see when really there's a lot to come on both sides yeah to actually find

1894
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:17,300
out what we're gonna see long term you know what gets me fired up about it and like like

1895
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:20,860
a reason why I'm like so passionate still this is like the third show I've recorded

1896
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:27,700
about it I'm still like super fired up about it is it seems like they are they are just

1897
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:31,020
like they're just saying here Dell here's all the customers that just want a really

1898
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:35,540
good Ubuntu integrated machine you want an Ubuntu desktop that has firmware updates that

1899
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:40,980
come through gnome software and they just ship Ubuntu yeah and then you just want something

1900
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:45,240
that has Ubuntu proper with a couple of modifications to make high DPI look right or to make wireless

1901
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:50,460
work and canonicals done that development work like it's like the most proper Ubuntu

1902
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:55,420
you could possibly get on your workstation that's now Dell yeah and if you would have

1903
01:36:55,420 --> 01:37:03,020
asked me I would have a year ago I would have said it's system 76 but it's not full stop

1904
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:08,140
end of sentence that's a huge game changer right there that's a huge game changer right

1905
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:17,420
now and that is a massive conscious decision that system 76 is made and if the pop OS is

1906
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:22,280
successful then it was a wise choice and if they can really provide something valuable

1907
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:26,460
there it's going to pay off but if people are buying their hardware because they want

1908
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:33,780
a really good machine that runs Ubuntu they've really marginalized themselves a bit and that's

1909
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:38,320
why it gets me fired up because I've been a customer for 11 years and I am I'm so passionate

1910
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:41,300
about that and I'm so passionate about an idea about a hardware vendor that's pushing

1911
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:46,620
this forward and it's oh man it seems like the riskiest time of because also at the same

1912
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:51,980
time they're launching manufacturing that's everything right that's the whole thing who

1913
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:59,620
man I guess we'll see yeah yeah I think if unless he changes his mind now Ryan's going

1914
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:03,740
to be joining Joe soon on Linux action news oh is that yeah because I'm going to go to

1915
01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:07,900
Montana with Noah soon and I think the beard is going to fill in for me here on this show

1916
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:12,040
how about that yeah is that good with you yeah he offered I'm like yeah man although

1917
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:14,540
you might have to sit here and you might have to sit there yeah because I don't want to

1918
01:38:14,540 --> 01:38:17,660
mess with we'll be staring into each other so yeah yeah you'll be staring into his beard

1919
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:22,860
don't kid yourself yeah that's true yeah and look away and then we've asked Ryan to fill

1920
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:27,620
in for me on Linux action news for one episode you know and I don't think they're gonna talk

1921
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:31,500
a lot about it but it probably come up so that could be that could be in Linux action

1922
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:35,940
news is like I think we just we're close to 10 episodes yeah you are if you haven't heard

1923
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:41,180
it yet it's like it is like a direct dose to your brain of Linux news and what I'm really

1924
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:45,460
proud of and I wouldn't have I wouldn't have it's funny because I wouldn't have thought

1925
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:48,540
of this ahead of time but there's a couple of things secret sauce wise that Joe and I

1926
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:52,460
are doing for the show that I think are really paying dividends right now and you if you

1927
01:38:52,460 --> 01:38:56,900
listen to the episode half ketchup that's what it actually no it's not Mayo can you

1928
01:38:56,900 --> 01:39:04,500
guess what else it is miracle web dude no there's just some secret sauce in there that

1929
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,980
we're doing that I think is is paying dividends and I think we do it I think we do an exceptionally

1930
01:39:08,980 --> 01:39:15,860
good job of busting through the news and and taking hours and hours and hours of research

1931
01:39:15,860 --> 01:39:20,500
and giving it to you in five minutes so it's like we do hours and like talking to people

1932
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:25,680
behind the projects emailing people to get follow-ups running the system running it on

1933
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:30,540
our systems and then we consolidate it down and and sometimes we even nail it under 30

1934
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:34,980
minutes and it's Linux action news calm and hell of hell of a show I'm really proud of

1935
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:38,900
the way it's coming together and so Ryan will be joining on that soon it's like those you

1936
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:42,780
know like the you know like NPR or other things it's like the five-minute news update it's

1937
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:47,100
like that acceptance instead of depressing world news it's like 30 minutes of awesome

1938
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:52,140
Linux right so it's better in every sense yeah eight episodes mr. bitten that verifies

1939
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:56,420
and if you haven't heard it yet it's I think the show is turning out really good and you

1940
01:39:56,420 --> 01:40:01,620
can get all the feeds and everything at Linux action news calm also you can find mr. Wes

1941
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:05,960
tech snap the text napping over there check out the show it should be out probably right

1942
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:11,000
about now as we're recording the show this one episode and then poppy and mr. wimpy just

1943
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,420
wrapped up their live episode from FOSTOC live and that was a really fun episode so

1944
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:21,660
go check out the Ubuntu podcast gentlemen anything else you want to plug before we run

1945
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:26,340
