WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.800
have you got any feedback from for the Leonard interview to read out on the

00:07.800 --> 00:12.480
show you know not really not to read on the show because I was in one of the

00:12.480 --> 00:17.200
debbie and for I was lurking one of the debbie and fork IRC channels was a guy

00:17.200 --> 00:21.840
in there who was saying who's ranting a little bit about yeah yeah obviously and

00:21.840 --> 00:26.320
wanted to come on and you know I said well you know come on the mumble and if

00:26.320 --> 00:31.120
there's any feedback I'm sure you can you know get involved yeah I mean I I

00:31.120 --> 00:37.000
know that we must have I wonder too if maybe people just kind of given up that

00:37.000 --> 00:41.880
are really anti system D because I'm sure there was a whole there's more than

00:41.880 --> 00:47.280
one debbie and fork yes what you mean it wasn't it doesn't have more than one

00:47.280 --> 00:52.080
debbie that one is more there's another one there's def one in depth to yeah

00:52.080 --> 01:00.360
really I actually didn't really I didn't know that how come I ever heard what's

01:00.360 --> 01:05.760
it called poppy I let me just go and find it to me anything that's derived

01:05.760 --> 01:12.880
from debbie and there's a fork of debbie and to me refactor now we refactor

01:12.880 --> 01:22.920
refractor refactor can you link it in the in that there IRC hang on this is

01:22.920 --> 01:26.480
so this project hasn't been getting as much of attention I wonder why that is

01:26.480 --> 01:30.400
maybe because they didn't use the inflammatory language it's the other one

01:30.400 --> 01:35.920
the Linux that you get oops I just pasted far too much in the IRC that's

01:35.920 --> 01:39.440
actually the topic from the debbie and fork channel where they link to the

01:39.440 --> 01:44.840
other debbie and the various debbie and folks including dead one refractor and

01:44.840 --> 01:51.440
also on XE canoe so this is there's two so there's three three there is three

01:51.440 --> 01:57.320
debbie and forks Wow burnout squared brilliant yeah so how is this gonna play

01:57.320 --> 02:01.240
out I mean how can this can they really do they genuinely mean like the full

02:01.240 --> 02:05.120
debbie and project fork when they say this or they just mean like the x86

02:05.120 --> 02:09.240
derivatives that is there's no way they can for call debbie and there simply is

02:09.240 --> 02:12.680
not enough people out there to go in to do it there's barely enough people to do

02:12.680 --> 02:19.360
debbie it's well and there's three of them people to do one fork it's a three

02:19.360 --> 02:23.960
forks I think it's a bit of overkill guest forking DB and why don't we just

02:23.960 --> 02:27.100
make a diss why don't we guess make something else out even just by

02:27.100 --> 02:35.000
removing system the inputting I guess it's not really they just don't want to

02:35.000 --> 02:39.040
be tied on to a way of doing things that's why they're calling themselves

02:39.040 --> 02:43.440
for for now they're a derived distribution until they get to the point

02:43.440 --> 02:47.640
that okay it seems that Debian is going too far off and we are not tied to it

02:47.640 --> 02:50.960
and so it's better to call it a fork from the beginning not get the flame

02:50.960 --> 02:55.040
later on I yeah I guess it's also a mindset thing but yeah technically right

02:55.040 --> 02:58.960
now what they're gonna copy them they're gonna copy everything and then just

02:58.960 --> 03:03.680
start working to not integrate systems it's okay yeah I mean I mean there's

03:03.680 --> 03:06.740
things like they need to find a replacement for login D and they need to

03:06.740 --> 03:12.200
undo all the packaging that integrates system D into gnome for example and then

03:12.200 --> 03:18.640
and then remove whatever else feature wise that system D does is saying that

03:18.640 --> 03:23.680
they actually will try to maintain compatibility with the main Debian thing

03:23.680 --> 03:28.000
because it not only will facilitate their work but also if Debian once

03:28.000 --> 03:34.680
probably be able to reassess that back no so this now I guess is the time

03:34.680 --> 03:38.160
isn't it because you got to do it now before system D has been so fully

03:38.160 --> 03:41.680
integrated into Debian that it would be a huge chore to work it out so now is

03:41.680 --> 03:49.320
the time to make your move what about a year ago would have been is everybody

03:49.320 --> 03:54.240
totally freaking out about this Linux Trojan it's it's horrible right have you

03:54.240 --> 03:57.380
guys all read about it it's on like every single news website ever right

03:57.380 --> 04:02.720
now yeah until we know what that vector I'm not really caring it's terrifying

04:02.720 --> 04:08.800
it's horrible it's infecting what I guess something it looks like it's

04:08.800 --> 04:11.920
probably it looks like it's probably been around for a few years I mean it

04:11.920 --> 04:15.480
does it it's also they're calling it an advanced persistent threat it looks like

04:15.480 --> 04:20.200
it's targeted at government embassies pharmaceutical companies maybe even even

04:20.200 --> 04:24.440
the code could even be 14 years old as OMG Ubuntu notes infected hundreds of

04:24.440 --> 04:28.760
PCs on the Windows version across 45 countries something yeah yeah I have a

04:28.760 --> 04:32.480
feeling this even though people are going on now it's not safe but it states

04:32.480 --> 04:36.960
something I actually think this time it is actually states a state sponsored

04:36.960 --> 04:44.960
because you have the money and the time to port a virus to nearly every single

04:44.960 --> 04:48.680
major platform yeah yeah ever and the thing you have to realize is like it's

04:48.680 --> 04:52.000
not just the NSA that does this stuff a lot of different divisions of the US

04:52.000 --> 04:55.680
military have a cyber arm to them and they have people that work on this stuff

04:55.680 --> 04:59.980
but in the terms of like the NSA what they have that tailored access division

04:59.980 --> 05:04.920
and their entire purpose is to identify the technology that the target is

05:04.920 --> 05:09.200
employing and adapt malware to compromise that system that is a

05:09.200 --> 05:14.640
tailored malware even you think Stuxnet wasn't specifically tailored to go after

05:14.640 --> 05:19.240
those centrifuges give me a break so if the if the system is running Linux or

05:19.240 --> 05:25.360
free BSD or Mac OS 10 or Windows they're gonna take advantage of every zero-day

05:25.360 --> 05:28.320
exploit they could possibly find and they're gonna tailor write something for

05:28.320 --> 05:32.440
it and even here it sounds like it is from some of the speculation it sounds

05:32.440 --> 05:35.640
like it jumps machines like it actually still comes in on a Windows box and then

05:35.640 --> 05:41.000
jumps to up to the Linux box I think this kind of stuff is gonna be really

05:41.000 --> 05:49.640
common well they're only getting to know it's not like they didn't exist right

05:49.640 --> 05:55.520
not to mention it's like until we know the actual attack factor it doesn't mean

05:55.520 --> 06:00.540
anything like for all that matter you might need a specific software to be

06:00.540 --> 06:03.840
running so you can actually get infected in the first place so it can actually

06:03.840 --> 06:09.360
leverage the permission issue yeah that point yeah and you know there's now see

06:09.360 --> 06:12.200
and the reason why I think we hear about this more is it just makes it makes

06:12.200 --> 06:15.320
better headlines now and the press has learned how to write about it in a way

06:15.320 --> 06:18.540
that generates clicks but also outside of that there's just entire companies

06:18.540 --> 06:22.080
now that were not really so focused on this like a lot of this came from work

06:22.080 --> 06:25.400
from Kaspersky labs right you can find a lot of details on the Kaspersky labs

06:25.400 --> 06:30.220
blog well this has now become a huge huge huge aspect of their business they

06:30.220 --> 06:33.160
spend a lot of time and resources on so they're exposing a lot more of this kind

06:33.160 --> 06:37.080
of stuff kids and kitty you said you had something you wanted to add yeah back in

06:37.080 --> 06:42.420
my day Trojans used to protect you from a virus

06:45.560 --> 06:50.400
welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show from a very windy

06:50.400 --> 06:55.400
Pacific Northwest my name is Chris and my name is Matt hey Matt so is the wind

06:55.400 --> 06:59.440
still blowing up in your area I'm getting some gusts you know I took the

06:59.440 --> 07:03.000
dogs out here earlier they didn't blow away so I think we're doing okay I like

07:03.000 --> 07:06.440
that you go out there and you get blown around a little bit and I thought so you

07:06.440 --> 07:09.040
send me this message you're like hey so we still have power up here I'm like oh

07:09.040 --> 07:12.920
I guess you're like congratulations you paid your bill it's stormy like oh yeah

07:12.920 --> 07:19.400
no I figured you meant it was stormy but then I'm thinking to myself that either means

07:19.400 --> 07:23.440
it's gonna come down here or we could go the other way but no a little bit later

07:23.440 --> 07:27.840
it started blowing down here like crazy it's one of those where it blew over the

07:27.840 --> 07:30.800
trash can so I go out in the front yard I pick up the trash because I don't want

07:30.800 --> 07:34.080
the I don't want the studio to look like we're slumming it right so I got there I

07:34.080 --> 07:37.560
pick up the trash can I come back in the wind trolls me blows the trash can over

07:37.560 --> 07:41.000
again well you don't want the studio to look like it's one of those 24-hour news

07:41.000 --> 07:45.080
networks right you want to have a little class here right looking like CNN up in

07:45.080 --> 07:49.600
this business exactly well coming up in this week's episode fedora 21 ship today

07:49.600 --> 07:53.720
Matthew Miller the fedora project lead joins us he talks about the process they

07:53.720 --> 07:58.520
went to to transition to this new multi spin version of fedora also I asked him

07:58.520 --> 08:01.880
to comment on the rumor that fedora is switching to a tick-tock release cycle

08:01.880 --> 08:06.720
and then we also probing for some details and features coming up in fedora 22 so

08:06.720 --> 08:10.120
that's coming up by a little bit in the show also later in the show

08:10.120 --> 08:16.640
Ubuntu snappy core was released today Ubuntu snapper and I'll tell you right

08:16.640 --> 08:20.440
up front it's not for the desktop but I want it on my desktop we're gonna talk

08:20.440 --> 08:25.720
about what snappy is where you can get it what you need to know about it and

08:25.720 --> 08:29.760
where you can find out more information very soon on your local Jupiter

08:29.760 --> 08:34.520
broadcasting network but Matt yes before we get to all that we got to get to some

08:34.520 --> 08:37.920
of our feedback and get going on some of that good stuff we we have a lot of

08:37.920 --> 08:40.880
stuff to cover we have a really great showing in the mumble room today I'm

08:40.880 --> 08:43.560
gonna bring them in here in just a second but before we do that I think

08:43.560 --> 08:48.120
I'll just give like my last emergency plea we are looking for your best of

08:48.120 --> 08:51.880
submissions for Jupiter broadcasting mace mostly kota radio and Linux

08:51.880 --> 08:56.040
unplugged and tech snap at this point last ones are fine too but we got a

08:56.040 --> 08:59.640
whole bunch of those because we want to give the host of the Christmas week off

08:59.640 --> 09:02.960
so that way they can just sit back and relax but we can still have some new

09:02.960 --> 09:07.520
shows with some new content some extra stuff in there and also you give you

09:07.520 --> 09:10.120
guys something you can hand out to folks and say yeah go check out this episode

09:10.120 --> 09:12.960
sort of cover some of their best of stuff but we need your submissions

09:12.960 --> 09:15.920
because it's a lot to go through when you have a back catalog as much as we

09:15.920 --> 09:19.480
do so I have a link in the show notes and it's our Jupiter broadcasting best

09:19.480 --> 09:23.160
of submission form we just need the episode title a link to the episode the

09:23.160 --> 09:26.360
time about when it happens and why you liked it in description any other info

09:26.360 --> 09:30.000
you want to give us to help out the network we have a whole bunch of

09:30.000 --> 09:33.060
hardware stuff and software changes going on during that week so the

09:33.060 --> 09:36.680
downtime is gonna be used really well too and I'll be putting out more

09:36.680 --> 09:40.200
information about that on the tech talk today patreon feed okay Matt well let's

09:40.200 --> 09:43.200
get into feedback but before we do that we should say hello and time appropriate

09:43.200 --> 09:47.680
greetings to our awesome mumble room time appropriate greetings guys

09:47.680 --> 09:55.280
well we got a great showing today a lot of you I think there's like 300 people

09:55.280 --> 09:59.440
in there not really no I would I think that would crush our server all right

09:59.440 --> 10:05.040
Ubuntu addicted writes in with our first bit of mail and he says my ancient

10:05.040 --> 10:10.840
original Apple TV runs crystal Ubuntu 2.0 crystal Ubuntu was developed by Sam

10:10.840 --> 10:15.960
Nazarocko the same person who brought who brought the world Razz BMC okay

10:15.960 --> 10:20.200
great crystal Ubuntu is based on Ubuntu 12 before which auto launches XBMC

10:20.200 --> 10:23.360
Gotham so I love the show by the way you inspired me to spread Linux and open

10:23.360 --> 10:27.040
source to the masses and he says keep up the great work so Matt he submitted a

10:27.040 --> 10:32.520
photo here boy look at that zoom holy smokes here it is I'm triangulating now

10:32.520 --> 10:37.360
he's got an old old Apple TV like the first gen oh yeah running this crystal

10:37.360 --> 10:44.880
Ubuntu spin that goes right into XBMC this got me thinking though looking at

10:44.880 --> 10:49.120
the setup I remember you and I kind of talking about hacking the Apple TV like

10:49.120 --> 10:51.760
it was something like that you know hey you know you could do this this this is

10:51.760 --> 10:56.200
a decent little device you could put XBMC on that was sort of like at the

10:56.200 --> 11:01.560
beginning of 2014 and I'm curious for you if now here we are at the end of 2014

11:01.560 --> 11:06.680
has the Roku killed the XBMC dream for you have you just gone Roku and and

11:06.680 --> 11:11.640
called it a day well so I guess you gotta back up a little bit and realize

11:11.640 --> 11:14.880
that you know I've others in the house that really don't care about the

11:14.880 --> 11:19.880
geekiness of an XBMC setup so for me you know Roku has just been kind of a

11:19.880 --> 11:24.240
natural fit for us it just does the job that will probably change as we explore

11:24.240 --> 11:30.400
new things coming out but at this time yeah yeah for me it was Roku plus plex

11:30.400 --> 11:35.140
yeah exactly it gave me a couple of gave me like three critical things like you

11:35.140 --> 11:39.520
said it had the spousal approval factor which was very high and that remote is

11:39.520 --> 11:43.840
great it's like it's like on the level of Tivo great it's a really good remote

11:43.840 --> 11:47.320
and if you get the Roku 3 it's got the headphone plug so there was that a

11:47.320 --> 11:50.560
spousal approval factor way high plus the price is good I'm gonna include that

11:50.560 --> 11:54.680
in spousal approval factor the other two things though were that plex integration

11:54.680 --> 11:59.480
which gave me resuming play play out playback and centralized metadata for all

11:59.480 --> 12:05.320
of my content very easily and then the third and very important piece was is my

12:05.320 --> 12:09.400
kids can operate it the Roku and the plex together it's simple enough where

12:09.400 --> 12:12.880
it's very it's just straightforward you get in and they can use it and from three

12:12.880 --> 12:17.340
to five they're able to operate this Roku player with with you know full

12:17.340 --> 12:21.560
fluency whereas I that might be possible it probably would be possible with an

12:21.560 --> 12:25.240
XBMC I feel like the simple nature of the Roku though made it more of a

12:25.240 --> 12:31.360
possibility Popey what are your thoughts um I don't know I I would love to have

12:31.360 --> 12:37.320
an XBMC box but actually I've been using a Chromecast a lot and a bit of popcorn

12:37.320 --> 12:42.640
time now and then and I I can't motivate myself to build an XBMC box out of

12:42.640 --> 12:45.400
anything really yeah that might be part of what it is too is like things like

12:45.400 --> 12:49.640
the Chromecast and Roku just make it so easy to essentially get what you want

12:49.640 --> 12:53.600
and you know Keller 78 in the chat room says yeah I've got three Roku's one for

12:53.600 --> 12:58.640
myself and two for the family wimpy what are your thoughts on this well I went

12:58.640 --> 13:03.800
the Roku route as well after having a couple of XBMC boxes and I had a Roku in

13:03.800 --> 13:09.720
the bedroom and a Roku in the front room and in the last month or so the Roku's

13:09.720 --> 13:13.920
have been replaced by fire TV yeah that's interesting oh I can see myself

13:13.920 --> 13:20.400
going that way too Roku kills XBMC fire TV kills Roku yeah because the the fire

13:20.400 --> 13:25.640
TV does everything the Roku does just faster and a whole lot more besides so

13:25.640 --> 13:31.800
the fire TV has become my gaming in air quotes console in the front room hmm

13:31.800 --> 13:35.720
yeah and this is all happened just in this year all right daredevil and your

13:35.720 --> 13:40.280
final thoughts on this topic unfortunately for me as much as I loved

13:40.280 --> 13:46.640
the projects it's like just my TV cable service provider the box they have

13:46.640 --> 13:51.680
actually just just appears as a network device and I can send it any file to it

13:51.680 --> 13:57.400
and shows me on my TVs and it actually makes me easier to exchange files we

13:57.400 --> 14:02.240
do machines and everything so yeah I end up having that news for it yeah all

14:02.240 --> 14:05.120
right I mean that seems reasonable and you know I was just thinking about it

14:05.120 --> 14:09.040
though here in the studio if I got a really nice high-end display in the

14:09.040 --> 14:12.280
living room that maybe I wanted to showcase content for visitors that visit

14:12.280 --> 14:16.720
the studio and things like that I have a suspicion I'd still probably want to go

14:16.720 --> 14:20.600
XBMC there when I want to really make a showpiece I want to have a you know a

14:20.600 --> 14:25.200
really great Jupiter broadcasting experience you know XBMC has we have a

14:25.200 --> 14:29.120
fantastic app right rotten corpse it's really quite good there's a lot of

14:29.120 --> 14:32.280
really good content on XBMC that's great for showcasing on high resolution

14:32.280 --> 14:35.840
displays same with Roku for sure but I just feel like if it was gonna be a

14:35.840 --> 14:40.160
centerpiece I probably would want to go XBMC still so there's still I think a

14:40.160 --> 14:43.920
pretty reasonable space for it well and I would also touch on that and say while

14:43.920 --> 14:48.560
I love the Roku the UI makes me want to scream yeah it's horrible it's it's

14:48.560 --> 14:51.320
really dated and that's where wimpy is coming in with the fire TV because on

14:51.320 --> 14:56.760
the fire TV you get a you get a great hardware rig but you also get that more

14:56.760 --> 15:02.480
full-featured Plex Android app that is really pretty good so and it's much

15:02.480 --> 15:05.440
better than them but you know the thing is the Roku one is at least functional

15:05.440 --> 15:08.760
this is true well and it definitely feels like we're kind of entering a

15:08.760 --> 15:13.840
rock-paper-spock situation yeah and it feels like fire TV could be the Spock

15:13.840 --> 15:17.320
move would be you agree that it's a on the fire TV it's really really nailed

15:17.320 --> 15:23.440
it yeah the UI is terrific so if you're just using the remote control which is

15:23.440 --> 15:27.480
almost identical with the number of buttons and the layout to the Roku

15:27.480 --> 15:33.400
remote so super simple but the fire TV has this voice search facility and it's

15:33.400 --> 15:37.760
not like an afterthought and it's not hidden away somewhere and the thing you

15:37.760 --> 15:42.840
might use to sort of show off what it can do the voice search is fronts and

15:42.840 --> 15:47.280
front and center and it's a principal way that you interact with the device

15:47.280 --> 15:51.560
and it works really well and and it feels like the future has arrived when

15:51.560 --> 15:56.400
you when you talk into the remote and then your stuff appears you are selling

15:56.400 --> 16:03.160
me on this you know okay so then I think I would be remiss also to 2014 has been

16:03.160 --> 16:06.360
a pretty big year for Netflix and it was even the year we got Netflix on the

16:06.360 --> 16:11.000
Linux desktop and the fact that there's not a really like one-click you know app

16:11.000 --> 16:16.400
install kind of dead simple way to get Netflix integration to XBMC or it's not

16:16.400 --> 16:19.480
even called XBMC anymore but you know what I mean it's it that's also a factor

16:19.480 --> 16:23.180
but rotten corpse I'll let you chime in as the final defender for our beloved

16:23.180 --> 16:29.380
media entertainment UI you love it right I love XBMC but I also my bill I work on

16:29.380 --> 16:34.880
add-ons and stuff like that too but the XBMC runs on anything you want it to and

16:34.880 --> 16:40.280
it has like the UI is great by itself in the default one but you can customize

16:40.280 --> 16:44.880
the UI to like hundreds of different options and like a on Knox for example

16:44.880 --> 16:50.040
is beautiful yeah yeah yeah yeah and you got the Raspberry Pi which is a makes a

16:50.040 --> 16:53.440
great to meet advice like I say there is there's still a great world there's

16:53.440 --> 16:56.800
still a great place for it but for me and I thought maybe for man it sounds

16:56.800 --> 16:59.500
like for quite a few folks in the mumble room this has been a year where we

16:59.500 --> 17:02.280
transition more dedicated devices they've maybe finally got it right

17:02.280 --> 17:06.240
actually you could put XBMC on the on the fire TV so you get back to both

17:06.240 --> 17:10.960
worlds yeah so would that be the Android app then or would that be something else

17:10.960 --> 17:13.920
entirely like a firmware yeah it's an Android the Android app that you

17:13.920 --> 17:18.480
sideload and in the Android app for XBMC is a full XBMC interface and

17:18.480 --> 17:23.040
everything so you can load it in so the fire TV wins that's amazing that's

17:23.040 --> 17:26.920
absolutely amazing well now that fire TV is gonna work in 4k because I swear I

17:26.920 --> 17:30.040
want to get a 4k display one of these days I'm skipping 3d Matt I'm going to

17:30.040 --> 17:34.440
4k one day I don't know how to go fourth dimension yeah I'm just gonna I think I

17:34.440 --> 17:38.640
think they're around that same time I'll also be single and living on the street

17:38.640 --> 17:43.320
and your your living room will look a lot like the original enterprise yes it

17:43.320 --> 17:48.160
will though I at least have that all right Matt well we have some really

17:48.160 --> 17:51.680
great feedback to continue including I need to make a serious correction a

17:51.680 --> 17:56.080
mistake on my part and a couple of you know what we're gonna call even an app

17:56.080 --> 18:00.440
pic in unplugged but first I would be remiss if I didn't stop and thank the

18:00.440 --> 18:04.400
folks over at ting go to linux.ting.com that'll take $25 off your first

18:04.400 --> 18:07.880
ting device or if you got a ting compatible device which stay tuned there

18:07.880 --> 18:12.560
could be a lot more of very soon you get a $25 credit so ting is mobile that

18:12.560 --> 18:16.320
makes sense it's no contract no early termination fee and you only pay for

18:16.320 --> 18:20.000
your usage your minutes your messages your megabytes you want to turn on

18:20.000 --> 18:23.160
hotspot and tethering you don't have to have a special share plan or whatever a

18:23.160 --> 18:27.200
smart plan all the plans are the same you just pay for the data usage the

18:27.200 --> 18:29.920
control panel that you manage it and if you ever have any questions they have a

18:29.920 --> 18:36.040
no hold customer support but something really crazy crazy exciting is going on

18:36.040 --> 18:40.360
so I want to tell you about it because I think it's going to seriously change

18:40.360 --> 18:45.280
everything before I tell you that though I should probably mention now has been a

18:45.280 --> 18:48.840
really good time to switch because ting has a crazy great deal to get you out of

18:48.840 --> 18:53.200
your your contract if you have an early termination fee an ETF as they call it

18:53.200 --> 18:58.800
in the biz they're gonna pay up to $150 per termination and that's on top of our

18:58.800 --> 19:02.840
$25 credit so you could get months of ting service by taking advantage of this

19:02.840 --> 19:07.320
ETF relief but here's the great news they just announced it a couple of hours

19:07.320 --> 19:14.560
ago in 2015 ting is going to start offering GSM network coverage on top of

19:14.560 --> 19:20.840
their existing CDMA coverage it is going to be awesome for users like me who have

19:20.840 --> 19:27.280
a Nexus 5 and I'll be able to have CDMA and GSM in my freaking Nexus 5 there

19:27.280 --> 19:31.080
they made a really great video for you audio listeners imagine a tech spec

19:31.080 --> 19:34.400
video where they break apart the product you know like when Apple introduced the

19:34.400 --> 19:37.520
Apple watch only it's for the ting sim it's just so awesome I got to play a

19:37.520 --> 19:41.640
little bit of it it's perfect for the occasion

19:41.640 --> 19:55.960
the ting sim

20:05.640 --> 20:09.600
and so as you can as you can imagine they're gonna support a lot more devices

20:09.600 --> 20:13.600
and they have the coverage map up now so you can check to see what the coverage

20:13.600 --> 20:17.680
is gonna be like this is gonna be crazy great you're gonna be able to take

20:17.680 --> 20:22.080
advantage of a lot of GSM coverage and a lot of see to make CDMA coverage back to

20:22.080 --> 20:25.160
back you're gonna be able to bring GSM phones over to ting that's gonna open up

20:25.160 --> 20:29.120
a whole new category of devices and right now ting has that early termination

20:29.120 --> 20:31.960
relief program you could go over there you could get yourself a device with

20:31.960 --> 20:35.000
that ETF you could pay you could just grab a feature phone for now if you

20:35.000 --> 20:40.880
wanted to February 2015 ting is gonna be supporting GSM it's a pretty big deal

20:40.880 --> 20:45.040
they really are on a mission to make mobile make sense linux.ting.com go

20:45.040 --> 20:49.320
there to show your support linux.ting.com also give you that $25 credit that's

20:49.320 --> 20:53.800
gonna stack on top of their ETF relief programs it's a great time to switch to

20:53.800 --> 20:59.280
ting linux.ting.com and congratulations to ting on the announcement for GSM in

20:59.280 --> 21:05.240
2015 that's a big deal that is so cool man that is really cool I just it's

21:05.240 --> 21:08.960
gonna be like when I travel now I'm just gonna have the best of both worlds it's

21:08.960 --> 21:13.240
it's really it's really slick okay so I have a make good I got to talk about I

21:13.240 --> 21:17.040
made a I made a mistake when I was talking about Docker last week Philip

21:17.040 --> 21:19.400
wrote in to correct me says hello Chris and crew I just listened to your

21:19.400 --> 21:22.720
reaction upon the announcement of rocket I want to point out that it is actually

21:22.720 --> 21:26.240
possible to host your very own Docker registry where you can host your own

21:26.240 --> 21:30.240
image without having to use the global Docker hub it's not quite as nice as the

21:30.240 --> 21:33.560
global hub since it's essentially only the back end there's no web interface or

21:33.560 --> 21:37.960
search or anything like that and it cannot be hosted in a subdir because the

21:37.960 --> 21:41.480
Docker image name format I currently maintain the AUR package for it I'm

21:41.480 --> 21:45.520
using it every day at my job at a big telco I know it's marked out of date as

21:45.520 --> 21:49.600
soon as I get some time I'll update it and he also has pull requests and he

21:49.600 --> 21:53.240
links to the the AUR Docker registry page that he set up and I wanted to

21:53.240 --> 21:55.600
thank Philip you know because I've actually made the mistake even just as

21:55.600 --> 21:58.560
recently as yesterday in Kota radio I wanted because one of the differences

21:58.560 --> 22:03.040
between rocket is a much more federated approach to the to the namespace for app

22:03.040 --> 22:07.160
containers and where its docker is very much doubling down on the Docker hub

22:07.160 --> 22:11.080
centralizing through the Docker service use the Docker API and that contrast

22:11.080 --> 22:13.960
stuck out to me so dramatically that I didn't really consider the fact that

22:13.960 --> 22:18.840
there is this sort of roll your own not super fancy but would certainly work

22:18.840 --> 22:23.240
Docker hub for you for your own network so Philip thank you very much for

22:23.240 --> 22:28.240
pointing that out to me man I got it I got like a chest thing going so oh no

22:28.240 --> 22:32.600
that's not good and I'm gonna sip on my coffee a little bit all right so Jesse

22:32.600 --> 22:37.120
writes in and this is on ours this is almost our last email then we'll get to

22:37.120 --> 22:41.680
our interview with Matthew Miller from Fedora Jesse says hello Chris and Matt I

22:41.680 --> 22:44.720
was just wondering what you guys think about the new desktop environment called

22:44.720 --> 22:48.640
moonlight you can currently only build it on arch right now and it uses qt5

22:48.640 --> 22:54.080
it's a fork of LX DE or I'm sorry Alex cutie and he links us to the home page

22:54.080 --> 22:56.840
which I have linked to the show notes I was running what you thought of this QT

22:56.840 --> 23:01.320
desktop that's just yet another desktop for the Raspberry Pi or PC in a way this

23:01.320 --> 23:06.560
may be a sign that GTK two or three is dying and it is the rise of QT so which

23:06.560 --> 23:09.760
is cool maybe we'll get some more themes now so here it is it's called the

23:09.760 --> 23:13.080
moonlight desktop a project that aims create a desktop environment mainly for

23:13.080 --> 23:16.840
those who run on low performance devices anybody heard of moonlight have we

23:16.840 --> 23:20.200
talked about moonlight I think we've touched on it a little bit I I'm not

23:20.200 --> 23:23.680
uber familiar with it but then I'm pretty happy with what I got now yeah q5

23:23.680 --> 23:27.360
is our Raspberry Pi guy and he's not in here right now but I wonder if he's

23:27.360 --> 23:30.880
heard of moonlight I'll ask him when we get off air so anyways if you're

23:30.880 --> 23:37.360
curious at no canoe org slash moonlight de but wimpy you have are you familiar

23:37.360 --> 23:42.760
with it yeah yeah I've come across it in circles and I did take a look but I

23:42.760 --> 23:46.600
don't think it's had any commit since sort of the end of September so well I

23:46.600 --> 23:51.600
know I don't know if it was like a summer project or attention is 2013 on

23:51.600 --> 23:54.920
the bottom of their page that jumped out of me when I saw that yeah nine months

23:54.920 --> 23:58.600
ago looks like three months ago here's a here's a more recent commit three months

23:58.600 --> 24:02.840
ago so I don't know maybe they're looking for help could be could be

24:02.840 --> 24:08.200
there's there's been no recent get activity yeah all right Matt Jim wrote

24:08.200 --> 24:11.000
in I think it was on the just on the live stream I don't remember if it was

24:11.000 --> 24:15.620
actually in a show or not but you and I were sort of grousing that we missed some

24:15.620 --> 24:19.560
of the old nice just simple down-to-business interface elements of

24:19.560 --> 24:24.320
Winamp you remember that yes oh my gosh yes so Jay Lim writes in he says I

24:24.320 --> 24:26.800
remember a few weeks ago when you and Matt were wishing for a small Winamp

24:26.800 --> 24:30.040
like player for Linux a few people wrote in but I forgot to mention it's called

24:30.040 --> 24:33.560
audacious it's an awesome music player now at first audacious doesn't look

24:33.560 --> 24:37.800
anything like Winamp but it has everything and more but you can add a

24:37.800 --> 24:41.720
skin with a dockable EQ and playlist manager just like you did back in the

24:41.720 --> 24:45.240
day and Matt's all in the AUR so here for those of you watching the video

24:45.240 --> 24:49.800
version I do have it installed like in if I like if I play I'm playing a little

24:49.800 --> 24:53.080
track right now and it does the visualization and with the timecode with

24:53.080 --> 24:57.600
the scrolling track name this is a theme that I installed from the AUR and it is

24:57.600 --> 25:03.000
exactly like Winamp with no like yeah it's it's fun so audacious is a good one

25:03.000 --> 25:08.100
so thank you to who was it let's see go back up here up to a jail J lim for

25:08.100 --> 25:11.040
sending that in audacious and it's a make good it's something I've been

25:11.040 --> 25:15.000
meaning to pick for a while but I just never get around to it I thought we

25:15.000 --> 25:18.600
might have made mention to audacious before but I wanted to give it an

25:18.600 --> 25:21.640
official plug now that yeah I saw this theme and I installed that thought I'd

25:21.640 --> 25:24.600
give you a chance to check it out so it's very cool see audacious sweet

25:24.600 --> 25:30.360
audacious music player okay just as good yeah audaciously good that's that's good

25:30.360 --> 25:34.040
Matt I like that you should give that to him what's going on over there kids and

25:34.040 --> 25:38.440
kitty what's going on over there alright so why don't we take a quick break and

25:38.440 --> 25:41.320
then we're gonna we're gonna go talk to Matthew let's uh let's mention right

25:41.320 --> 25:45.440

data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London the

26:16.540 --> 26:21.080
interface to let you choose between them is super cool too boy I should just like

26:21.080 --> 26:23.240
go through the process of creating a droplet right now because it's that quick

26:23.240 --> 26:28.120
and easy and Matt we've always talked about using DigitalOcean to easily

26:28.120 --> 26:31.920
deploy a WordPress droplet absolutely I've been getting a lot of

26:31.920 --> 26:36.680
recommendations to check out ghost which is a newer blogging platform yes and

26:36.680 --> 26:42.000
DigitalOcean again one click install you deploy it it's really easy it's really

26:42.000 --> 26:46.120
slick so I think on top of on top of the great interface on top of the

26:46.120 --> 26:49.600
performance on top of the flexibility where you can put the droplets they've

26:49.600 --> 26:54.440
also got an API that lets you get even deeper into that so their interface is

26:54.440 --> 26:57.520
super intuitive their control panel is awesome but there's a lot of tools now

26:57.520 --> 27:01.200
built around the DigitalOcean API like to snap it into puppet to do management

27:01.200 --> 27:05.240
to just write scripts to just restart them remotely from your applet menu bar

27:05.240 --> 27:08.720
a lot of take snapshots before you go do an update like this is really cool like

27:08.720 --> 27:11.840
your SSH 10 you're about to do something crazy just go up to your menu bar

27:11.840 --> 27:16.080
snapshot exactly and I do that all the time because I'm always doing something

27:16.080 --> 27:20.720

it looked really cool and you just one click boom you've got it up on

27:50.320 --> 27:53.520

to congratulations to them this is a big one a lot of stuff but this was the

28:17.200 --> 28:20.960
first release after they've refactored the way the distribution is done in the

28:20.960 --> 28:26.080
multiple spins and so we brought on Matthew on the Linux action show on

28:26.080 --> 28:33.640
Sunday and we pre-recorded this interview with him for today's show okay

28:33.640 --> 28:37.640
yep so it'll be an it'll be not just for a little while all right very good well

28:37.640 --> 28:41.040
here we go and I see two lights we would all right so this is for Linux unplugged

28:41.040 --> 28:46.240
and I'm gonna start in three in two I started by asking him how the team and

28:46.240 --> 28:52.560
how he's doing after such a major release and refactoring yeah first I

28:52.560 --> 28:56.400
want to step back and say thank you to everybody who worked on Fedora and the

28:56.400 --> 29:01.920
computers because it really this is an amazing release and so many people put

29:01.920 --> 29:06.640
work into making it so you know I said it's at the top of the project but it

29:06.640 --> 29:13.400
doesn't it's not quite a project where it's top-down I want to make sure

29:13.400 --> 29:17.960
everybody gets there right of course yeah lots and especially I mean really

29:17.960 --> 29:22.000
for this release too because this is now the release with them different types of

29:22.000 --> 29:26.400
spins I mean the project in between releases went through a pretty dramatic

29:26.400 --> 29:31.060
change in how it does development right yeah absolutely we've done a really good

29:31.060 --> 29:35.240
job I think of spinning up work especially in the cloud and server areas

29:35.240 --> 29:40.760
where we had a little bit lack of direction and focus there so it wasn't

29:40.760 --> 29:43.960
easy for people to plug into it so now we have these new working groups which

29:43.960 --> 29:48.240
kind of sort of an attachment point for people who are interested and those have

29:48.240 --> 29:53.280
really taken off in a positive way yeah so if I'm new to Linux maybe I know we

29:53.280 --> 29:55.960
run some reddit enterprise servers at my work or something like that I'm looking

29:55.960 --> 30:00.400
at Fedora workstation do I need to be a little afraid that it's too complicated

30:00.400 --> 30:06.040
for a new user no you do not so one of the things we are really focusing on

30:06.040 --> 30:11.000
through our workstation is being targeting software developers as the

30:11.000 --> 30:17.720
focus but software developers are generally human beings as well most of

30:17.720 --> 30:25.640
you know I know some they're questionable really they need to have

30:25.640 --> 30:29.760
some access to power user kind of things but the basic desktop needs to be slick

30:29.760 --> 30:34.000
and get out of the way and so we think that the gnome desktop that our

30:34.000 --> 30:38.400
workstation is based on is really great at doing that and it's really easy for

30:38.400 --> 30:44.280
new users as well Fedora as a fast-moving distribution with a lot of

30:44.280 --> 30:50.080
updates and things like that sometimes you have to be a new user who's really

30:50.080 --> 30:56.160
willing to learn and adjust and figure things out so I think that it's not

30:56.160 --> 31:01.320
necessarily something I would put on a new user who's off on an island

31:01.320 --> 31:04.840
somewhere but a new user who's interested in learning and has technical

31:04.840 --> 31:10.280
friends well I when I look at Fedora too I think there's a category of users out

31:10.280 --> 31:12.720
there that I don't think we talked about enough in the Linux community and that

31:12.720 --> 31:17.680
is guys like my friend Chase who have been maybe Windows admins for ten years

31:17.680 --> 31:20.920
there you know they have a totally tricked out Windows install with

31:20.920 --> 31:24.800
customizations and you know special drive like they deep dive into Windows

31:24.800 --> 31:29.080
as far as you can deep dive so when when he was switching to Linux he actually

31:29.080 --> 31:31.920
wanted a Linux he could tinker with because that's one of the things he does

31:31.920 --> 31:35.160
and so I think Fedora for the for the users that are very comfortable with

31:35.160 --> 31:38.400
their computers it's like a slam dunk but the one thing that you mentioned to

31:38.400 --> 31:42.080
us on Sunday's Linux action show which really resonated with me because it's

31:42.080 --> 31:45.200
something we've talked about on Linux unplugged a lot is you're also hoping to

31:45.200 --> 31:49.800
reclaim some of those users who've switched over to MacBooks right

31:49.800 --> 31:53.920
even a Linux conference these days and you've got people who are doing cloud

31:53.920 --> 31:59.480
development and they've got the MacBook on there on their lab basically they're

31:59.480 --> 32:05.080
sitting in the audience not paying attention to the speaker we'd like to

32:05.080 --> 32:09.440
get those people back to running Linux as much as now but here's my here's the

32:09.440 --> 32:14.120
one to punch to that is there anything the Fedora project could do to make

32:14.120 --> 32:18.640
Linux not suck so bad on MacBooks like there I hear there's constant Wi-Fi

32:18.640 --> 32:23.240
issues sometimes there's issues starting the eyesight camera no Thunderbolt

32:23.240 --> 32:26.640
DisplayPort the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter only works if it's connected

32:26.640 --> 32:30.580
when the MacBook boots it's a very clunky experience but it's pretty well

32:30.580 --> 32:34.600
respected hardware is there anything Fedora could do to maybe actually focus

32:34.600 --> 32:39.920
on that so I know that some of our people on our desktop team and and I

32:39.920 --> 32:44.960
know also at Red Hat people who are paid to work on the desktop are have some

32:44.960 --> 32:48.680
contacts they're working on that at Apple and I don't know all the details

32:48.680 --> 32:52.480
on that but we do really try to make that work but you know it's hard when

32:52.480 --> 32:57.040
you're working with no documentation no source for any of that stuff that

32:57.040 --> 33:01.480
manages it I know but it seems like we've overcome larger challenges before

33:01.480 --> 33:05.760
but let's let's talk about another challenge that so while Fedora 21 is in

33:05.760 --> 33:09.760
development this started happening before Fedora 21 went into development

33:09.760 --> 33:14.320
but it seems like the container space went red-hot just super hot during the

33:14.320 --> 33:19.280
Fedora 21 development cycle so not only is the team shifting gears for this new

33:19.280 --> 33:25.440
spin style release cycle and development model but at the same time a big

33:25.440 --> 33:29.880
underlying piece of Linux technology is really changing you have systemd which

33:29.880 --> 33:34.080
is coming in at the same time you've got containers which is there's a lot of

33:34.080 --> 33:38.880
movement there is is that a lot for a project that's in progress like Fedora

33:38.880 --> 33:43.280
right now to address or was that just was that rolled in during the development

33:43.280 --> 33:49.120
cycle was it a challenge talk a little bit about ongoing challenge I think it's

33:49.120 --> 33:54.040
certain it also is it's the future of the operating system sure yeah seems

33:54.040 --> 33:59.920
like yeah and so in Fedora one of the things we're doing is we have in the on

33:59.920 --> 34:03.880
the cloud flavor of the new Fedora you'll see a thing called Fedora atomic

34:03.880 --> 34:09.700
and this is basically a host image in the current incarnation meant to run in

34:09.700 --> 34:14.360
cloud providers like OpenStack or an Amazon EC2 meant to run Docker

34:14.360 --> 34:20.480
containers so it has basically tools for doing that and nothing else it uses a

34:20.480 --> 34:26.680
thing called RPM OS tree so it has a sort of an image based version of the

34:26.680 --> 34:31.360
base OS and then you run your Docker containers on top of that and I think

34:31.360 --> 34:36.880
we're going to be iterating a lot on that over the next release cycles it's

34:36.880 --> 34:41.840
going to be a big thing and so I think that right now we can have that off in

34:41.840 --> 34:46.240
the corner of the cloud space which is where that I think the energy around

34:46.240 --> 34:51.220
that is mostly focused but there's a proposal for Fedora 22 to make it

34:51.220 --> 34:56.160
available on bare hardware bare metal as well and kind of expand that out and I

34:56.160 --> 34:59.160
think we'll see that kind of across all the different flavors of Fedora

34:59.160 --> 35:05.120
increasingly so I guess is so kind of is what your answer is there is project

35:05.120 --> 35:08.540
atomic which is a very which is a really interesting container management

35:08.540 --> 35:13.320
solution is sort of being developed first on Fedora yeah you know it's one

35:13.320 --> 35:16.360
of these things that's moving so fast that it's hard to know where it's all

35:16.360 --> 35:23.120
going yeah especially when we're looking at kind of the more forward-reaching

35:23.120 --> 35:26.840
kind of things in you know how is this really going to impact how we put the

35:26.840 --> 35:31.040
whole operating system together we want to look at Fedora as a space we're

35:31.040 --> 35:35.360
experimenting with that and so we I know we've also have people who are looking

35:35.360 --> 35:42.040
at containerized desktop which is another one so containerized apps are

35:42.040 --> 35:46.160
obviously a really nice thing to have if you're having a desktop especially if

35:46.160 --> 35:50.160
third-party apps that may be questionable or you know even first

35:50.160 --> 35:53.520
party apps that you just don't want to I don't know which party I should count

35:53.520 --> 35:58.480
there but you know you don't you don't want to put so much effort into because

35:58.480 --> 36:02.280
it just takes a lot of time to package these things up so you can if you put it

36:02.280 --> 36:05.800
into a container you can feel a little bit better about doing the worst job for

36:05.800 --> 36:12.240
kind of edge of the operating system and so there's a lot of appeal to doing that

36:12.240 --> 36:16.440
but containerizing desktop apps is a lot harder than containerizing server apps

36:16.440 --> 36:20.240
which are sort of meant usually communicating over a network port and

36:20.240 --> 36:24.360
that's what they do maybe some other in a process communication whereas desktop

36:24.360 --> 36:30.760
apps are kind of used to being able to access you know the hardware access you

36:30.760 --> 36:34.840
dropping files wherever reading files forever and so that's gonna be a lot

36:34.840 --> 36:39.200
more work how how important do you think all of this is the container management

36:39.200 --> 36:43.080
and containers themselves how important do you think that being successful and

36:43.080 --> 36:48.640
will implement it is critical to Fedora being considered a production candidate

36:48.640 --> 36:53.000
ready server OS because I think a lot of people right now don't consider Fedora

36:53.000 --> 36:57.240
a server grade OS they'd probably rather go with CentOS scientific Linux

36:57.240 --> 37:01.360
Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself and not necessarily Fedora but it sounds like

37:01.360 --> 37:04.920
these kinds of changes are maybe an attempt to get people to change their

37:04.920 --> 37:09.640
minds so are these a critical part of that well I think we've actually always

37:09.640 --> 37:14.640
had a lot of people who have been used used Fedora even in production on large

37:14.640 --> 37:21.520
scale server they tend to not talk about it so much I could believe but yeah it's

37:21.520 --> 37:25.720
not on the scale that CentOS and Ural and the big enterprise distributions are

37:25.720 --> 37:29.840
and that that makes sense because it kind of fits into if you look on the

37:29.840 --> 37:33.960
technology adoption curve kind of thing we're you know way over in the

37:33.960 --> 37:37.520
innovators and maybe some the early adopter kind of space and that's just a

37:37.520 --> 37:44.560
much smaller segment and you know with CentOS in the long tail there there's

37:44.560 --> 37:47.720
there's gonna be a lot more there and especially if you want to set up a

37:47.720 --> 37:51.600
server and you know not worry about it for ten years right or it's not your

37:51.600 --> 37:57.120
best choice for that but we want to make sure that we fit into the ecosystem in

37:57.120 --> 38:02.000
places where it makes sense where you have it there's advantages in having the

38:02.000 --> 38:07.080
newest versions of things if you are able if it's no problem to upgrade every

38:07.080 --> 38:13.220
year like okay I want to keep the latest so I'm following that it's there and of

38:13.220 --> 38:18.720
course people who have been following Fedora and making sure that they run it

38:18.720 --> 38:23.880
in some corner of their infrastructure are not surprised when rel7 comes out

38:23.880 --> 38:29.440
yes you know they not everything that goes into Fedora goes into rel it's a

38:29.440 --> 38:33.760
you know downstream relationship that isn't always completely direct like that

38:33.760 --> 38:40.560
but we try to make sure that everything goes into rel right yeah so if we can

38:40.560 --> 38:45.300
get more people who are running rel and CentOS running Fedora it'll be better

38:45.300 --> 38:50.080
for them and it also of course benefits our downstream distributions because

38:50.080 --> 38:56.760
they get the feedback from Fedora users early and I think you know there's as

38:56.760 --> 39:04.600
systemd finally got into rel7 and people were surprised I think that actually you

39:04.600 --> 39:09.120
know we've had it in Fedora for several releases and got a lot of polish and a

39:09.120 --> 39:14.160
lot of things that were it would have been it right made it much smoother oh

39:14.160 --> 39:17.960
yeah yeah so it really really made it go much smoother there I think we kind of

39:17.960 --> 39:21.960
we're gonna have as the container nation and all these things change the

39:21.960 --> 39:25.640
operating system more and more we're gonna have more of that yeah so yeah

39:25.640 --> 39:31.120
well so as I hate to do this to you as we are sitting on the release day I hate

39:31.120 --> 39:35.920
to be the guy to ask what's next but you must be looking forward to Fedora 22 a

39:35.920 --> 39:39.040
little bit and have a few low-hanging fruits that you want to pick and

39:39.040 --> 39:43.400
something that you want to work into Fedora 22 what's what's in front of mind

39:43.400 --> 39:50.080
for you yeah so after having a one-year cycle here of going back to the six

39:50.080 --> 39:54.080
month cycle it's already like wow it's gonna be fast because we're looking at a

39:54.080 --> 39:58.560
May release date which means working back you know from the betas and the

39:58.560 --> 40:03.360
alphas and things like that that means that our feature work basically needs to

40:03.360 --> 40:14.520
be done at the end of January so I think that there are some things that are

40:14.520 --> 40:18.000
gonna be changes but I don't think that there's gonna be a lot of radical change

40:18.000 --> 40:21.760
in order to it's going to be incremental on some of these things we talked about

40:21.760 --> 40:27.240
I've heard some scuttlebutt of maybe refactoring the release cycle to what

40:27.240 --> 40:29.760
people are calling a tick-tock release cycle to do you have any comments on

40:29.760 --> 40:33.480
that yeah we just started kind of talking about that and that's sort of

40:33.480 --> 40:37.100
the idea that we would one release concentrate on sort of the

40:37.100 --> 40:42.240
infrastructure and the QA and release engineering tooling and then the next

40:42.240 --> 40:46.080
release focus on the features that go into it and we're still working out that

40:46.080 --> 40:52.040
conversation some people really like it some people feel like it would hold back

40:52.040 --> 40:55.500
I think one of the concerns I saw is somebody said well would that mean maybe

40:55.500 --> 40:58.720
like the talk release wouldn't see the latest version of gnome brought in it

40:58.720 --> 41:02.080
would still have the release from the tick

41:02.880 --> 41:08.240
the desktop people both gnome and KDE which is one of our other alternate

41:08.240 --> 41:13.200
desktops that we consider very important they don't like that at all they want to

41:13.200 --> 41:16.240
make sure their software gets in the hands of users very quickly so I think

41:16.240 --> 41:20.760
even if we went to this kind of model we would do it in a soft sort of way so

41:20.760 --> 41:25.640
where the releases that focus on the infrastructure would still allow new

41:25.640 --> 41:29.920
things to come in as long as they don't get in the way of that and a lot of

41:29.920 --> 41:34.680
those things like a new gnome release probably don't as much get in the way

41:34.680 --> 41:40.400
okay right so something to watch and it sounded like an interesting idea and I

41:40.400 --> 41:45.720
could see some some serious benefits to it so yeah so that so might that be

41:45.720 --> 41:49.520
introduced during the fedora 22 release cycle or would that be a post 22 thing

41:49.520 --> 41:55.920
I think that the conversation right now it's probably a post 22 thing and one of

41:55.920 --> 41:58.880
the reasons for that actually is that just because as we're seeing running

41:58.880 --> 42:04.960
into the holidays now it would be very advantageous for the feature cycle to be

42:04.960 --> 42:09.520
the spring cycle and the infrastructure cycle to be the fall one

42:09.520 --> 42:13.080
likely to be disruptive so we're kind of on the wrong cadence if that's what we

42:13.080 --> 42:18.200
want to do right so having another release to talk about it is probably a

42:18.200 --> 42:23.960
good idea especially since it's a big decision yeah before fedora 22 expanded

42:23.960 --> 42:29.200
for atomic and more container stuff is going to be a big theme possibly even

42:29.200 --> 42:32.920
some test containerized stuff for workstation although I don't know how

42:32.920 --> 42:39.120
far that's going to go there's some talk of that there's a switch in the

42:39.120 --> 42:45.200
package manager level there's a thing called DNF yes it's likely to become the

42:45.200 --> 42:52.320
default replacing yum okay so it uses the hockey back end different from a

42:52.320 --> 42:57.360
technical level the depth solver is different and it should be a lot faster

42:57.360 --> 43:01.440
as well and more importantly from a development point of view although

43:01.440 --> 43:06.040
users don't necessarily care it has a much cleaner design and a better API so

43:06.040 --> 43:10.720
it will be more maintainable for the future that's exciting awesome yeah all

43:10.720 --> 43:16.080
right well for now everybody can go enjoy fedora 21 it should be out a mirror

43:16.080 --> 43:20.320
near you or a torrent near you as well

43:20.400 --> 43:25.880
fedora org and also we'll have links to some of your social profiles in the

43:25.880 --> 43:30.000
show notes anything else you want to touch on before we run I think that's

43:30.000 --> 43:34.960
it for now this is gonna be a great release so I think you all enjoy it and

43:34.960 --> 43:39.440
again thanks to everybody who worked on it yeah yeah I'll echo that great work

43:39.440 --> 43:42.920
to everybody on the Fedora team this is this is a solid release and a real

43:42.920 --> 43:46.320
screamer too at least on my rig so I'm pretty happy with it well thanks again

43:46.320 --> 43:50.680
Matthew and congratulations thank you

43:50.960 --> 43:55.480
and if everything goes as planned on Sunday's Linux action show we're gonna

43:55.480 --> 43:59.640
break down the different specific spins and really deep dive into each one of

43:59.640 --> 44:02.960
them individually and talk about talk about that and it should be if

44:02.960 --> 44:06.620
everything goes as planned like I say because it's a live production it should

44:06.620 --> 44:09.920
be a live panel of fedora experts that will be helping us with that I don't

44:09.920 --> 44:13.240
want to say anymore just that way nobody's on the hook but it should be a

44:13.240 --> 44:17.400
really great episode so expanded coverage in Sunday's Linux action show

44:17.400 --> 44:23.400
hey mumble room why don't we do a community review of fedora 21 next week

44:23.400 --> 44:27.800
on Linux unplugged so as many of you that are willing give it a spin ideally

44:27.800 --> 44:32.040
on on hardware but a VM if that's what you can do would also be great fedora

44:32.040 --> 44:37.120
21 I mean I'm I already have the gnome version installed I'm actually gonna do

44:37.120 --> 44:40.920
a fresh install just to sort of start over clean cuz I was really having some

44:40.920 --> 44:45.120
fun experimenting with all the different repositories and messing around with how

44:45.120 --> 44:50.200
far I could push the Nuvu driver but so if you would join us next and also I

44:50.200 --> 44:53.400
this is an open invitation to anybody listening that's not in the mumble room

44:53.400 --> 44:57.040
right now you can join us next Tuesday we start at 2 p.m. Pacific go to Jupiter

44:57.040 --> 45:02.160
broadcasting comm slash calendar for the live time in your local area you can

45:02.160 --> 45:04.680
join us in the mumble room it's an open mumble room we'll just do a mic check

45:04.680 --> 45:08.960
make sure you're not crazy or something I don't know and then we'll bring in and

45:08.960 --> 45:11.920
talk about fedora 21 as a group and see what everybody thinks this is this is

45:11.920 --> 45:16.200
supposed to be kind of our bag right fedora workstation that's right supposed

45:16.200 --> 45:20.280
to be kind of be for the power users that's kind of us so let's see what I

45:20.280 --> 45:25.800
think and I hope that is I hope as many of you can give it a go and I'll give

45:25.800 --> 45:28.800
you my I'll give you my thoughts too and then on Sunday join us for even more

45:28.800 --> 45:33.320
coverage alright so guys any thoughts on fedora 21 in the mumble room today it's

45:33.320 --> 45:37.360
release day before we move on change topics sounds interesting and appears

45:37.360 --> 45:42.560
that everyone is I fortunately everyone is now starting to look on making a good

45:42.560 --> 45:46.640
developer experience which may render in good apps yeah isn't that kind of

45:46.640 --> 45:51.120
exciting like the fact that you know he touched on that really made sure like

45:51.120 --> 45:54.440
that we want to make it good for developers we want to make it you know

45:54.440 --> 45:58.320
attractive to those MacBook switchers which that's a topic that kernel Linux

45:58.320 --> 46:01.360
has brought up a few times on this show when we go to these conferences is that

46:01.360 --> 46:05.520
it's a it's a sea of MacBooks and you kind of walk away and you go wow it

46:05.520 --> 46:09.160
feels like everybody's on max what are we all doing am I the only one that's

46:09.160 --> 46:12.480
doing this on the Linux desktop and then you know some of them have it installed

46:12.480 --> 46:15.940
but a lot of them don't if you can make something compelling for them and he

46:15.940 --> 46:18.840
says that they might even be end up talking with Apple that'd be pretty

46:18.840 --> 46:23.920
great kits and what do you think so I'm on their website and I noticed that

46:23.920 --> 46:29.080
under the workstation link it says user friendly but he's also talking about

46:29.080 --> 46:35.160
focusing developers isn't there a little bit of dichotomy between the two I think

46:35.160 --> 46:39.120
he means those are their users so it's friendly to them I think it's I think

46:39.120 --> 46:42.520
what they're actually kind of doing is by saying it's developer focused it's an

46:42.520 --> 46:47.000
acknowledgement in a sense that there is a barrier of entry and we're saying

46:47.000 --> 46:50.320
developer because that is a label that we prescribe to something of a certain

46:50.320 --> 46:54.320
level of knowledge but what it really means is if you're competent in some

46:54.320 --> 46:57.560
level of system administration and configuration and doing a little bit of

46:57.560 --> 47:00.880
research really maybe this is another caveat right what it's another way of

47:00.880 --> 47:03.880
saying is if you're kind of good at googling and you know how to figure out

47:03.880 --> 47:07.320
how to fix stuff on your own and figure out their own solution through googling

47:07.320 --> 47:11.280
then this is a good desktop for you and they're not mutually exclusive either

47:11.280 --> 47:14.780
being user friendly doesn't mean developer hostile and being developer

47:14.780 --> 47:19.920
friendly doesn't mean user hostile it can be friendly to both right yeah yeah

47:19.920 --> 47:23.760
for sure and that's pretty important if you can't get the developer to feel

47:23.760 --> 47:32.400
comfortable it's hard to feel any user yeah that's yes all right so I'll give

47:32.400 --> 47:36.760
you more thoughts on Sunday and on Tuesday 21 is the release I've been

47:36.760 --> 47:40.800
looking forward to for a really long time because I you know I already said

47:40.800 --> 47:42.920
this on Sunday and I know I'm kind of repeating myself I'm sorry but I'm

47:42.920 --> 47:46.040
really excited it is really them trying to address some of the criticism I think

47:46.040 --> 47:48.480
that we've given them over the years not I'm not saying they did it because of us

47:48.480 --> 47:53.280
but I'm just saying it to me it seems to be focusing them more specifically

47:53.280 --> 47:56.280
something we've said they've lacked and they're doing it a really interesting

47:56.280 --> 48:00.560
time and they're going to do it in a really competitive way and I think

48:00.560 --> 48:05.120
Matthew Miller is is also a really good leader I mean he's really good at

48:05.120 --> 48:08.000
communicating he also runs the fedora magazine he's extremely good at

48:08.000 --> 48:12.640
publishing relevant information the new get fedora website is really useful and

48:12.640 --> 48:17.200
he's he's obviously very well at working with the podcasts and the community to

48:17.200 --> 48:21.800
get the word out there it's exactly what the fedora project is needed so they got

48:21.800 --> 48:26.280
the technology aspect of it right and I think they've got the community aspect

48:26.280 --> 48:29.920
of it right too so they're really I think they're firing all cylinders and I

48:29.920 --> 48:33.960
think I think and I would assume 22 is just gonna be even better but I'll save

48:33.960 --> 48:38.680
my thoughts for another show so before we go on to Ubuntu snappy or I guess

48:38.680 --> 48:43.520
maybe the technical term is Ubuntu snappy core which boy this is this has

48:43.520 --> 48:45.920
been an interesting couple of weeks in the space I want to tell you about

48:45.920 --> 48:49.840
Linux Academy though Linux Academy is your resource to go better yourself on

48:49.840 --> 48:53.480
your own time and on your own rules at your own schedule for your own purposes

48:53.480 --> 48:56.680
maybe it's a challenge yourself to see if you still got it like I like to do

48:56.680 --> 49:00.280
from time to time maybe it's to just check another box off on that yearly

49:00.280 --> 49:03.920
review this is yes I went and I took some education or maybe she gets

49:03.920 --> 49:07.960
certified in something new something to make you even more employable Linux

49:07.960 --> 49:13.160
Academy comm slash unplugged go there to get our 33% discount when you get that

49:13.160 --> 49:16.760
discount and I recommend you go there because you're gonna want to keep Linux

49:16.760 --> 49:20.120
Academy service once you get it once you get that discount you get that 33% off

49:20.120 --> 49:24.320
you get all all acts you get access to all of the content all of it and all of

49:24.320 --> 49:27.600
the new stuff that they add I got an email here from Linux Academy they say

49:27.600 --> 49:30.320
they just launched their puppet professional certification preparation

49:30.320 --> 49:36.600
course this course can take you from zero absolutely no puppet knowledge to

49:36.600 --> 49:40.400
a certified ready-to-go puppet technician they've launched two new

49:40.400 --> 49:44.280
courses one on Docker which is talk about great timing for that and one on

49:44.280 --> 49:47.800
vagrant which is an excellent tool in the past 30 days they have added over a

49:47.800 --> 49:52.400
hundred videos a hundred new practice exams tailored practice exams by people

49:52.400 --> 49:56.960
that genuinely know the content that's the huge differentiator here the entire

49:56.960 --> 50:01.240
site is run by Linux enthusiasts they fundamentally have it from that approach

50:01.240 --> 50:05.400
which you know that makes all of the difference they've got video streams

50:05.400 --> 50:08.240
they're doing all the time now too which you can interact and ask questions

50:08.240 --> 50:11.800
directly to the educator step-by-step video courses downloadable comprehensive

50:11.800 --> 50:14.200
study guides you can pick from seven plus Linux distributions and they

50:14.200 --> 50:17.440
automatically adjust the courseware they'll spin up virtual servers for you

50:17.440 --> 50:21.080
on-demand give you access over SSH public boom you can put DNS on there you

50:21.080 --> 50:25.480
can do scenario based deployments of bind or all kinds of services Amazon AWS

50:25.480 --> 50:30.360
it's a fantastic service and it's it's one of these where you can go in there

50:30.360 --> 50:34.480
and say I'm a very busy person I mean I really don't have a lot of time but I I

50:34.480 --> 50:38.200
can take advantage of Linux Academy you can go in there you can say I have this

50:38.200 --> 50:42.760
much time available then the learning plan will create courseware for you

50:42.760 --> 50:46.840
based on that availability and it does a good job keeping you motivated keeping

50:46.840 --> 50:51.240
you involved sending you reminders about quizzes it's it's such a great resource

50:51.240 --> 50:56.080
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go save a little bit of money and I'm not

50:56.080 --> 50:58.720
gonna I'm not gonna use the New Year's resolution line but think about it just

50:58.720 --> 51:03.000
saying it's probably a pretty good idea to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

51:03.000 --> 51:07.680
and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show all

51:07.680 --> 51:11.000
right so a Popey's here but he swears up and down he's gonna he's not going to

51:11.000 --> 51:16.280
talk to me about Ubuntu snappy right Popey not gonna happen

51:16.280 --> 51:21.880
about it then yeah maybe I would understand no I actually and Dustin

51:21.880 --> 51:25.640
Kirkland right is that is that his last name yeah yeah he's a canonicals cloud

51:25.640 --> 51:29.760
storage solutions product manager and he's the leading technical product

51:29.760 --> 51:32.720
strategy roadmap and lifecycle for the Ubuntu cloud commercial offerings he's

51:32.720 --> 51:37.120
gonna join us on Sunday's Linux action show cool so that's the horse's mouth so

51:37.120 --> 51:41.560
what we get to do right now is tell you what what it is and why I think it's

51:41.560 --> 51:45.960
kind of a neat deal assuming I don't lose my voice before the end of the show

51:45.960 --> 51:50.080
so Mark Shuttleworth and a bunch of other people today announced it I

51:50.080 --> 51:54.720
actually have the video you know I'll play it I'll play just a quick just a

51:54.720 --> 51:57.760
quick little bit of it I won't play the whole thing there I'll just jump I'll

51:57.760 --> 52:02.720
jump ahead a little bit where Mark is talking about what it is so he never

52:02.720 --> 52:07.840
break the device so what Mark does your applications that are super fresh today

52:07.840 --> 52:11.920
he compares how they've developed a firmware like approach for the phone OS

52:11.920 --> 52:16.200
where they can deliver updates to the base OS that are don't break and if it

52:16.200 --> 52:19.380
does break there's a built-in recovery mechanism that don't touch the

52:19.380 --> 52:22.200
application space they don't change the state information the application data

52:22.200 --> 52:25.960
just like Android and iOS updates these applications instantly available to

52:25.960 --> 52:30.520
users all over the world and to make sure that updates to the applications

52:30.520 --> 52:35.840
are also transactional and bulletproof and you can try that out today take any

52:35.840 --> 52:40.400
of our supported devices put Ubuntu on that device and then watch how

52:40.400 --> 52:46.920
incredibly easy it is to update that device it feels like you're on rails so

52:46.920 --> 52:50.520
going back okay so this is sort of the basic idea of what they want to deliver

52:50.520 --> 52:55.000
with Ubuntu snappy now you might maybe remember Wimpy what was it called

52:55.000 --> 53:01.640
Ubuntu juice the that's like super small Ubuntu core yeah right for geos geos

53:01.640 --> 53:06.800
yes right now that that was sort of a maybe an early go at this when

53:06.800 --> 53:10.560
virtualization was really you were gonna do all of your scaling through

53:10.560 --> 53:15.760
virtualization which still happens but you really wanted the most base tiny

53:15.760 --> 53:18.800
operating system for the host and then you just put all your stuff in the

53:18.800 --> 53:23.480
virtual machines well now there's kind of a new approach where it's you kind of

53:23.480 --> 53:27.840
the same idea but with containers and the idea here is you keep a really

53:27.840 --> 53:32.080
minimal base operating system that's actually even as maybe could be read

53:32.080 --> 53:36.560
only and then you deliver all of the applications inside Docker containers

53:36.560 --> 53:41.280
and and the developers can publish those Docker container updates directly so

53:41.280 --> 53:45.160
we've talked recently about how the own cloud project is a little miffed that

53:45.160 --> 53:48.020
when you do apt install own cloud on Debbie and stable it's like a two or

53:48.020 --> 53:52.320
three year old version of own cloud and it's not supported as real bad bugs it

53:52.320 --> 53:56.160
makes them look bad they don't like that they would be self-publishing these

53:56.160 --> 54:00.020
Docker containers and these would just slide right on top of a Ubuntu snap you

54:00.020 --> 54:04.920
release that base OS is more like a firmware update where you use snap in a

54:04.920 --> 54:10.040
new version of that base OS and there's a rollback there's a transactional

54:10.040 --> 54:13.240
rollback if it doesn't work and the applications you know your own cloud

54:13.240 --> 54:16.400
instance your WordPress instance your whatever that are all you know your

54:16.400 --> 54:19.240
database all in these different Docker containers just like your smartphone

54:19.240 --> 54:23.000
apps today don't they don't get really affected by the underlying operating

54:23.000 --> 54:28.000
system being updated it's kind of like you know what core OS is going for and

54:28.000 --> 54:33.080
it's not a you know it's it's it's a buntus take on it right guys so far

54:33.080 --> 54:36.360
anybody want to fact check me I'm kind of getting all this right so you so the

54:36.360 --> 54:42.400
the applications can take advantage of new features in updates so the

54:42.400 --> 54:48.720
underlying read-only image that you that updates periodically might have new

54:48.720 --> 54:52.720
features landing in it and that's defined by a framework and so an

54:52.720 --> 54:58.560
application can say I I can use framework 1.0 or framework 2.0 there's

54:58.560 --> 55:03.720
a feature platform aspect exactly that's something that was taken straight from

55:03.720 --> 55:07.760
the phone so the phone has the same concept of framework so an application

55:07.760 --> 55:12.800
that says I can only work on 1504 and above will just not be visible in the

55:12.800 --> 55:18.480
store to anyone on a previous framework so you could see how this is a really

55:18.480 --> 55:24.560
interesting approach to almost solving the rolling problem the applications are

55:24.560 --> 55:28.520
updated maybe by the vendors or by the administrator in their own container the

55:28.520 --> 55:32.340
base operating system you know it could be a nice stable LTS that just gets

55:32.340 --> 55:37.920
features added on by the upstream vendor in this case canonical it's a it's a

55:37.920 --> 55:44.280
very like a sealed off hypoallergenic like kind of like yeah approach to to a

55:44.280 --> 55:47.680
Linux server any reactions in the mumble room William do you have any thoughts on

55:47.680 --> 55:55.160
this I just want to see it happen all right that's one of those things that I

55:55.160 --> 56:01.280
feel that they gotta try it kids and kitty what are your thoughts yeah I had

56:01.280 --> 56:06.040
asked actually during the pre-show if this was the end product of all those

56:06.040 --> 56:09.520
rumors that we're going through going rolling if this is the actual

56:09.520 --> 56:15.920
manifestation of that well it's kind of it's kind of part of it in on the

56:15.920 --> 56:19.640
server side and on the phone side you know arguably the phone is is somewhat

56:19.640 --> 56:27.120
rolling in that we can send out a new system update image and developers can

56:27.120 --> 56:31.580
put their new apps in the store for the phone the same thing happens for Ubuntu

56:31.580 --> 56:36.560
core in the cloud so in the cloud will deploy a new version of the the read

56:36.560 --> 56:40.160
only snappy image and the developer the own cloud developer in this case or

56:40.160 --> 56:46.000
WordPress or Hadoop or whatever it is will update theirs and so it gets close

56:46.000 --> 56:50.600
to rolling I mean it's not because there's still gates on all of those

56:50.600 --> 56:55.080
things but it's it's a lot closer to rolling than every six months for

56:55.080 --> 56:59.440
example and you end up with a server in the cloud with your deployment on that

56:59.440 --> 57:03.400
you've got to think carefully about which bits you upgrade you know it makes

57:03.400 --> 57:07.040
me think though and wimpy I'd be curious to get your insights on this I like look

57:07.040 --> 57:11.960
at the Ubuntu Mate edition wouldn't it if you could start like if this Ubuntu

57:11.960 --> 57:16.320
snappy you know it's been out for a while it's something you could build on

57:16.320 --> 57:21.040
top of you think by the way by the way systemd based Ubuntu snappy right it's

57:21.040 --> 57:28.000
systemd first server cloud version of Ubuntu that will use systemd heyo if you

57:28.000 --> 57:32.720
could take Ubuntu Mate and and base it on sort of this base system where

57:32.720 --> 57:36.440
components of your distribution are containers that ship on top of it and

57:36.440 --> 57:41.000
when a new release of Mate comes out you would just ship out a new container to

57:41.000 --> 57:44.480
your end users wimpy are you driving with this is this something you've

57:44.480 --> 57:49.160
thought about it is something I've thought about and not just as a result

57:49.160 --> 57:56.280
of this Ubuntu core release but also from Lennox proposal for namespaced

57:56.280 --> 58:02.200
sub volumes and shipping a thin OS which you then provide libraries and

58:02.200 --> 58:09.520
applications as sub volume overlays and if you think about it as the upstream

58:09.520 --> 58:15.720
desktop developers so you could say the Marte development team or the gnome team

58:15.720 --> 58:20.880
or KDE or any of the others they are package managers in their own right

58:20.880 --> 58:26.000
because all of the components that make up those desktops come with configure

58:26.000 --> 58:32.840
scripts where you can do configure make make install and that is essentially all

58:32.840 --> 58:38.240
you need to build these overlay type systems and certainly it would make it

58:38.240 --> 58:43.880
much easier for the application developers and much faster for the

58:43.880 --> 58:48.960
application developers to ship their desktop environments their applications

58:48.960 --> 58:54.040
in that sort of paradigm I mean the snappy is Ubuntu snappy core is

58:54.040 --> 58:58.800
premiering on Microsoft Azure why because in their own words Microsoft

58:58.800 --> 59:03.560
loves Linux they say but so it's clearly this is targeted for the server but I

59:03.560 --> 59:06.360
I'm like okay that's neat I'll just be sitting over here eating my popcorn

59:06.360 --> 59:09.760
waiting for the desktop implementation of this because this honestly sounds like

59:09.760 --> 59:14.080
how I want my desktop I want a nice really stable core base that gives baby

59:14.080 --> 59:17.560
platform features that sound like like Popeye was talking about but I want my

59:17.560 --> 59:21.800
apps like I want my core set of applications fresh and rolling right

59:21.800 --> 59:25.560
well we've already said we're going to do that for the we're going to bring the

59:25.560 --> 59:31.320
technology that's in the phone to the desktop with unity 8 and siloed

59:31.320 --> 59:35.560
applications and app armor and all the kinds of things and the click store and

59:35.560 --> 59:38.120
click packages all the kinds of things are on the phone we'll bring that to the

59:38.120 --> 59:42.760
desktop but over the next couple of years this kind of leapfrogs all of that

59:42.760 --> 59:47.320
straight to the cloud I think because it's just easier and the time is right

59:47.320 --> 59:52.040
for it I mean you mentioned earlier about juice and Ubuntu core from 804 I

59:52.040 --> 59:57.160
think they're a bit ahead of the time back then and now it seems the time is

59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.680
right what with core OS and Docker and the popularity of all of that I agree it

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.520
does seem like the the right time and I think that's why honestly when Mark was

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.440
on the Linux action show a couple of weeks ago I specifically asked him about

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.240
core OS because it seemed like it was filling a hole that Ubuntu didn't have a

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:18.880
plug for yet and this is sort of their take on it but I wonder if it it to me

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.320
seems like it has some clear advantages to start in the cloud number one

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.840
canonical has a pretty good track record there now they have already a really

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.000
strong deployment so there's a lot of stuff built around that the place you

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.920
have a significant portion of canonicals businesses is built around supporting

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.640
that so it's important to them so there it's a good bet if you're making from an

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.440
enterprise standpoint if you're betting on that product but also you have to

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.000
figure that there's a lot of users that are going to just easily transition and

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.720
I was starting to wonder if maybe Ubuntu was gonna sort of turn into a bit of a

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.720
runtime that like would be deployed on top of things like core OS you know

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.760
it'd be the runtime that the Docker container actually used but now this

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.720
this sort of prevents that from happening where a shop that would still

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.600
be using Ubuntu in the container sort of the Ubuntu runtime could now actually

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.440
also be using Ubuntu on the base and I think that's this came out a time before

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.920
that bleeding even begun so the timing of it's really good there so anyways I

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.280
think Ubuntu snap is it's cool for the server I want it for the desktop already

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.440
I mean screw right same here just stop just stop it just move it over the

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.000
desktop get get a get a gnome container set up get a get a chrome container

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.760
whatever it takes just get all that and I'll use that make it so right so we'll

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.720
get more information about that soon any closing thoughts on that mumble room

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:36.320
before we run anybody have any pontificating yes he mentioned

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.560
something about bringing this to the desktop so are we going to see snappy

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.840
and proper on the desktop or is this a totally different package manager or

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:51.080
what do you have that's great bringing over from the phone to the desktop how's

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:55.960
that gonna work with apt yeah so yeah it's not actually even it's more than a

01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.640
package manager right oh yeah so on the on the desktop now if you want to

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.260
install some some application you go to the other Ubuntu software center or you

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:10.800
apt-get install something whereas on the phone we have a click store where there's

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.200
a siloed click application that you download from the store and install and

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.760
it's that that we will bring to the desktop there you go all right so we'll

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.260
cover more as we have info in the new segment on the Linux action show and you

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.320
can go play with it now there's like scripts out there to go get it if you

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.160
want to go play with a systemd powered version of Ubuntu you can have at it

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:37.760
it's an it's a new it's a new era of systemd and Ubuntu starting on the cloud

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:43.520
haters commence your hating yeah all right Matt well we have a pretty packed

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.040
show planned for Sunday I think we're gonna have multiple guests again it's

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.880
been really busy I know 24 the end of 2014 we got busy we doubled down it's

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.160
really it's thanks to our producers q5 system rotten corpse they've they've

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.160
really been hauling but Matt have a great week and I'll see you on Sunday

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.240
okay sounds good see you then all right everybody well thanks for tuning this

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.040
week's episode of Linux unplugged we do this show on Tuesdays we'd love to hear

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:07.480
your community review Fedora 21 next Tuesday join us over JB live TV don't

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.680
forget the big show on Sunday for more Fedora coverage all right everybody

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:35.080
thanks so much to in this week's episode see you back here next Tuesday

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:48.560
oh hi there so I'm playing a little video on the way out so great great show

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.040
thanks everybody mumble room you guys had a great showing and I wanted to

01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.160
mention you know we talked about the Advent calendar last week and this week

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:02.920
there today the Advent calendar image of the day is the Ubuntu core for QMU so if

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.560
you want to go play with you yeah yeah so here's an interesting thought you

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:11.680
know we were talking about upstart versus system D like it seems like years

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:17.360
ago but it was not that long ago and I kept I kept saying to everyone you know

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.080
upstart has way more deployments than system D when you think about it it's

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.860
like millions of a bunch of users there's math that may mint users there's

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.680
Chrome OS users there's rail users they're all using upstart right there

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.080
cumulatively there's way more upstart users than there are system D now with

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:39.520
Ubuntu core given how popular Ubuntu is in the cloud it's possible that we could

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:46.120
flip that the other way around just with us doing that I'd have to go get my

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.400
measuring stick though Popey's and to tell but that would be a jolly big

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:57.680
measuring stick Wow well it is it is tis of course the new rails the new rail

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.840
seven use the system deal there's probably quite a few deployments of

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:08.600
that oh wow I was by the way just I was just playing a video I opened it up in

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.080
the other tab I just recorded a video for the tech talk today patrons if

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.920
you're a patron over there just posted a video it's it's me talking about

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.400
something very shameful that I have done and I come clean I even have my wife

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.520
there as moral support well I make my just one of those things where you stand

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:26.680
out in front of a podium and I don't know well it's pretty close to that it's

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:34.120
pretty close you're speaking from experience no I know I'm not gonna go

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.200
to details it's too much shame it's too much shame if you're a patron you can

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.840
watch it though don't forget about the best of to everybody alright so blaster

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:46.720
last week blaster I said you know I'm thinking about finally breaking down and

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:52.440
replacing the radio in my truck because I listened you know I drive about six

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:56.000
seven hours a week and I exclusively listen to podcasts during that entire

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:01.320
time and right now it's pretty ghetto I have a Bluetooth speaker box that I turn

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.840
on and I just put on my dashboard while I'm driving and I drive down the road

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.000
with my Bluetooth connected to that and like okay I'm kind of tired of being an

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.200
animal I think maybe I'm gonna go get like a and a dash replacement that has

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.160
Bluetooth and aux in and USB and I'm just gonna finally do it right and it's

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:23.160
about a hundred and thirty bucks for a decent one and blaster says to me and I

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.200
was like I don't really want to do it because every time I replace the

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.600
dashboard unit I'm I'm really unhappy I don't I usually think it doesn't match

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.040
the speakers and I feel like I need to replace the speakers and then I need to

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:34.320
get an amp and then I need to get a sub and I'm never happy with the way it

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.200
looks and it's always too bright and it kind of looks tacky compared to what the

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.160
what what what Dodge put in there originally so I was like I was telling

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.120
blaster I'm like I don't really want to do this but I'm just I'm an animal with

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.960
this Bluetooth speaker I feel like I'm in the 80s with my boombox and he says

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.280
well before you rip out your radio on your dashboard try getting an FM

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.960
transmitter and I said this truck kills all FM transmitters I don't know if it

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:02.360
has the world's weakest receiver but I have I have tried three or four solid

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:10.320
really well reviewed Bluetooth wired all you know remote antenna where it's up on

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.120
the dashboard all different kinds of FM transmitters in my truck they've never

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:18.000
worked right for me he says well before you go in and you make the big change

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.560
try get try getting the go groove flex smart x2 Bluetooth wireless in-car FM

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.480
transmitter and it's one of these deals where it's got it's okay it's got like a

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:30.480
bendable neck and it plugs into the cigarette adapter okay it's got a

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.000
separate power button on the cigarette adapter too so you can just turn off the

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.080
power it's got a digital display so you can you can dial in right exactly to the

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.640
FM station you want it's got call and hang up buttons because it does Bluetooth

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.000
hands-free dialing too it's got an extra USB port so you can still charge a

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.080
device over USB when you have it plugged in and it also has aux in and out audio

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:52.440
jacks so that way if you don't want to use Bluetooth you can have it go in over

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.360
a headphone jack and that's important yeah cuz good quality and he's like so

01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.600
just give this a shot and you know tell me what you think I'm like okay fine I

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.760
mean it's this is way better than you know paying for somebody to install it

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.480
and ripping out my dashboard it's an old truck it'll probably get screwed up and

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.920
I gotta tell you Matt I've been using it for a week and it has been flawless so

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.880
it it does an auto scan that's not too new and you know you just it just auto

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.200
scans and finds the best frequency and you can dial it up and down a little bit

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.280
if you want it connects over Bluetooth so the phone just stays right in my

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.160
pocket and it just connects up and it starts broadcasting immediately so I

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.440
don't have like you don't turn the truck on and then until it connects no it just

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.420
immediately is transmitting and then it connects over Bluetooth within a few

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:38.320
seconds and then it has play pause and skip the play pause like starts the

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.800
podcast right up and the skip does 30 second forward so I can jump ahead or

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.600
jump back if I need to and it's just perfect it was and it was like 35 40

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.920
bucks so I have the $10,000 question because that sounds really enticing to

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:57.040
me where I live if I want to listen to let's say I like let's let's say I'm

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.520
trying to tune into one thing there's a lot of mix-and-match stations between my

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:04.960
county and your county mm-hmm it goes from Canadian rock to Marriott Marriott

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.960
music pretty quickly so you know so that type of thing so does it like self adjust

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.820
the frequency as it goes well you can but then you'd have to change it on the

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:17.000
stereo so what blaster recommended I do and this is what I've done although I

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.840
actually haven't needed to go to backup is I went to a trouble spot area that I

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.000
thought I would have some issues by the airport here and I went through on I

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.720
turned off all my transmitters and I listened in the truck I just dialed

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.080
through the dial until I found an empty station in that area and now I know if I

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.280
need to I can have a preset on the on the preset buttons and I can just turn

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.000
the FM transmitter to that and switch over to that really quick oh cool okay

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.280
yeah oh that's awesome so blaster thank you for the recommendation

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:49.320
Chris if you guys on it yeah it's great have you got a cassette player in your

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:56.960
truck Chris I don't just the CD yeah yeah yeah cuz in my in my old car I used

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.360
a cassette adapter that had a Bluetooth receiver in it so you put the cassette

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:06.280
in the cassette player and it's a Bluetooth receiver and then you can

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.080
send your audio over Bluetooth and it plays through the cassette system was

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.520
that in your car wimpy was that your Ford Anglia yeah no it was it was my

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:25.280
Ford pop which one was it you had the go grew flex my x2 yeah go grew flex smart

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.480
x2 all right now I'll let you go good all right have a good rest of your week

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:34.280
Matt I'll see you Sunday bye JB towels come everybody go boat I do believe

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:42.560
there's an x3 model I chose the x2 I think for a reason I think I remember

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.880
reading some of the reviews on the x3 they say you can still get in time for

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:53.880
Christmas it's defragging necessary on a solid state technology actually yes yes

01:10:53.880 --> 01:11:01.480
very necessary depending on your solid-state disk spread out across the

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:04.920
LBA range in such a way that it's actually mapping to the same die on the

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.160
SSD and you lose all the parallelism effects of the SSD and your speed drops

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:16.120
to crap your bottleneck on the on the IO horribly okay I always thought that

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.920
defrag would cause wear on the device it does cause wear because you have to

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:26.520
rewrite the whole file somewhere else about that now really you could probably

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.560
write like a petabyte to most MLC SSDs and be fine so you're probably not

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:34.480
worried about where in most cases well on SSDs why would you defrag anyway

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:38.960
because if all of the blocks get mapped onto LBAs which are on one die then you

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:41.800
lose all the effects of the performance of the SSD because you have to

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.880
constantly be reading from one die one request at a time and that makes it

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:50.080
really slow the more channels you use the better yeah that makes sense

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:56.880
Samsung the Samsung SSDs that have a lot of they have a cache mechanism which is

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.200
sort of a species of RAM when you're defragging actually uses that cache

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:07.760
mechanism to avoid writing to and at that point when there's a version of it

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.680
which is a like about eight gigs or something of cache that is RAM it just

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.440
increases that so make the process a lot faster on the Samsung disks they have

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:21.360
eight gigs of TLC which is that that's actually used in SLC form so you're

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.240
actually using those three bit by two different process technology as a one

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.080
bit cell and so you're using all of them as one you're grouping a bunch of cells

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.920
together as one cell and so they call it fake SLC but you get the durability

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:39.760
approximately of SLC in this case and they write to that as a cache it's kind

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.640
of like an S log in ZFS if you're familiar with that concept they write a

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:47.600
journal to that eight gig space and then slowly copy it into the TLC LBA ranges

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:51.200
as time goes on and the nice thing is this persists even if you power off

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.800
because it's just you know more flash that they're writing to but you get

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.360
really good durability durability out of it and you can write in order and then

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.680
go ahead and throw stuff off and map them into different LBA ranges later so

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:05.680
it's not doing super huge writes right you can get really good performance so

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:10.480
if you're if you're if you're writing if you're writing a really large file does

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.960
it bypass that and go right to the slower stuff I would imagine it should

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.320
and that's probably okay for a really large file this is a lot of random

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.640
drives they pretty much negate that problem altogether it's flatline

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:27.400
performance all together at the one terabyte 850 evo drives nowadays no I

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:35.360
want that do this loud I have mostly evos
