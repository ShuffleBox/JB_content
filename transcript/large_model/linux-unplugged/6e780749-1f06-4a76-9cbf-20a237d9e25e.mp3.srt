00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 7 for September 24th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,280
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast that keeps checking

3
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,360
the source of the Steam countdown page, hoping for hidden messages from Gabe. My name is

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,880
Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. Welcome to Episode 7, buddy. Thanks. Fresh off of

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,400
the birthday weekend, too. Nice, man. Oh, I know. It's been great. It's just been one

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,920
big whirlwind of acting like a complete nutjob. It's been awesome. You know what? I'm acting

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,760
like a nutjob tonight. I'm going carb crazy. Right on. I'm going to gluten it up, man.

8
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,280
So right now, I'm drinking a gluten-free hard apple cider. I got to keep the gluten down

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,240
because tonight we're going with a pasta with an Alfredo sauce. If I'm rekt for tomorrow's

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,600
on filter, you know why. I got crazy. And I got to hook you up with some of the gluten-free

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,800
recipes we got. My wife's got this entire monster cookbook for people that really like

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,280
to eat. Okay, good. It's none of the sissy stuff. It's like food. We'll have to share.

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,160
We'll trade notes. Yeah, totally. Now, you know, coming up on this week's episode, we're

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,920
going to, of course, be talking about SteamOS, which was just announced by Valve yesterday.

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,640
We're in the calm between the storms. Tomorrow, another announcement comes. We'll be doing

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
some speculation on what those announcements could be. But today, I thought we'd kind of

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,640
take a snapshot of where we're at with the announcement of SteamOS. We'll do a little

18
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
speculation, but really, we're going to talk about what this could mean for Linux. We're

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,800
going to talk about what this means for gaming and really what this means for an open platform

20
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,120
in general. I think we're going to have a great episode. Plus, we're going to bring

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,640
in our mumble guys who are always thinking about this stuff, always debating, a good

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,760
round table in there. Great opinions and whatnot. I think it's going to be a really fun episode,

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,480
Matt. I know it is. And plus, then after this, I'm going to go gluten crazy. Now, you know.

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,600
All right. Well, so why don't we start with a little follow-up, as is per tradition, before

25
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:22,360
we get into the main show. I wanted to read an email that came in from Jacob. Now, Jacob

26
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,720
was referring to last week. We got kind of on the whole Android discussion and we called

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,840
it the Android problem, if you recall, Matt. I remember. Well, Jacob thought it was an

28
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,040
amazingly eye-opening episode and another way to look at Google. He says, one thing

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,000
to note, on iOS 7 Google Chrome now, he says, maybe this has already been implemented on

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,200
Android, there is a feature they ask if you want to turn on, which sends all of your internet

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,140
traffic to some Google services for them to then compress it and send along to your phone.

32
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,400
In light of recent events, i.e. Snowden, it would seem that they aren't just compressing

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
all that data. Just something to think about. Great show, by the way. I just subscribed

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,360
to the All Shows feed. Constantly refreshing, waiting for the next show to come out. So

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,320
yeah, I'm of a mixed opinion. So I talked about this a little bit yesterday on Code

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,140
Radio, Matt, but here's kind of where I'm at. I think you're going to appreciate the

37
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,260
zen-ness of my sort of final position here. So one of the things that kind of got me all

38
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,560
riled up was lack of updates, right? Google's bad original deals that sort of torpedoed

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,520
the future update possibilities of a platform, and you know, the way that some of the carriers

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,480
can go crazy. But thankfully, there's alternative carriers now that kind of solve some of that

41
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,680
problem. Where I'm at with Google now, it's like, I just kind of like treat Google like

42
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,040
I treat my Twitter stream. Not my out replies, but just the front page of Twitter. Like,

43
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,600
I just jump in, I just see what people are talking about, and then I jump out. I'm not

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,680
one of those people that needs to read the whole Twitter feed, right? Yeah, I'm kind

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,240
of the same way. I mean, like with Twitter, I literally use it as my email forward. I

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,060
pay very little attention about what's going on there. But I really do. I mean, I pay some

47
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,880
attention to Facebook, I pay most of my attention to Google+, Twitter, not so much. Which is

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,940
ironic being it's Google. I try to read all my replies on Twitter. Yeah, I generally do.

49
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,320
Direct messages, I don't pay any attention. Well, they're harder to find these days. So

50
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,520
that's how I'm going to treat Android. When an Android release comes out, and if it meets

51
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,520
the conditions of a platform that I want, I'll make a precision strike. I'll grab that

52
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,980
device, going in knowing that, hey, maybe I'm going to have update issues. Hey, maybe

53
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,080
this is going to have stuff bundled along with it. And if I want to fix that, I have

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,120
to take certain steps myself. I feel like doing that sort of is like this. It's an acknowledgement

55
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,200
of the limitations, and then just kind of deciding, all right, well, it still has enough

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,560
incentives that I'm going to go ahead and go forward with it. That's where I'm at.

57
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,240
For me, it's very app specific. When it comes to data, I'm naively ambivalent about the

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,680
whole thing. I tend to just live with my head in the clouds and figure, you know, if they're

59
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,480
going to want to know something badly about me, they're going to figure something out.

60
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,120
So I just don't get too excited about it. I mean, it irritates me, but I try not to

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,860
focus on it too much because it just depresses me. So I mean, quite honestly, I am conscientious

62
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,600
about what I'm searching for or what I'm doing on my phone. Definitely so. Even the apps

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,440
I install, I'm very conscientious about it. But I would say for the most part, I'm pretty

64
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,560
ambivalent about it. I don't think too much about it, although I am having an app specific

65
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,240
problem that perhaps we'll talk about at the end of the show. But outside of that, no,

66
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm okay with it. I still like it better than iPhone.

67
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's get to the app thing because I watched something happen over the weekend on the Play

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,360
Store that I was pretty disappointed in that I think is real low class of Google and Google

69
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,920
Play. So we'll talk about it at the end of the show if we have time. One more piece of

70
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:44,320
follow up to yesterday, or I'm sorry, Sunday's Linux action show. Blackout Worm on YouTube

71
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,400
was responding to, remember we had the email where the guy was like, gosh, I could switch

72
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,640
to Linux. It's just that I really need iTunes. And we were like, what does anybody quote

73
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,920
unquote need iTunes for? Well, see, and I had to ask my wife because I haven't a clue.

74
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,680
She's the iTunes diva in this house. So I had to ask her. I was like, well, can't you

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,080
do this over Wi-Fi? And she says, well, I think you could do something over iCloud.

76
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,680
But she says, I honestly just connected to my, she just does the USB thing. Yeah, that's

77
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,520
what my wife does too. And she just, she said, she told me, well, it works. Why would I change

78
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,120
it? So that's what I thought the reason was. And I was like, okay, they just don't know

79
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,080
about iCloud and the fact that iTunes thinking is probably going to go well. Well, Blackout

80
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,720
Worm wrote and he said, the only reason I would need iTunes on Linux is for streaming

81
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,760
TV shows. And this is, he echoed a point that we heard from a few folks who said, I bought

82
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,160
into the, you know, I'm a cord cutter and I bought into the buy and breaking bad or

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,940
whatever on iTunes. He says, Netflix and Amazon's library is peanuts compared to iTunes. iTunes

84
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,560
has a lot of exclusives, meaning shows that aren't and will probably never be released

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
on DVD or Blu-ray. As a Linux user, I really hate that there's little to no DRM support

86
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,160
here. Can't get it working, nor MP4s that I bought from my iPad. I really wish that

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,920
would change. As far as digital media goes, Linux is 10 years behind. Uh, no. It's just

88
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,860
they're not included in these closed systems. Yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't even go, but the

89
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,840
whole 10 years behind thing, it's like, it really just depends on how you go about getting

90
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,600
your media. Well, and whose rules are you playing by? Are you playing, are you playing

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
by Apple's rules? Well then yeah, but of course they made that only work in iTunes. This is,

92
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,520
this is almost where I almost can see, ah, I hate going down this route, but, but you

93
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:23,720
know, I talk about sometimes, sometimes to me piracy, the piracy of content like TV shows

94
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,680
to me can, it almost feels like an act of civil disobedience in some sense because,

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,440
uh, yeah, it does in a lot of ways because artificial limitations that prevent you from

96
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,440
getting it because it's not actually affecting supply and demand. It's not actually affecting

97
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,960
a warehouse of goods. It's not, you know, it's not tangible. Um, you know, there's not

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,800
a tangible thing people can point you. So yeah, a lot of people, you know, so that,

99
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,760
that argument is, I think it's valid and the unfortunate part is about it is like when

100
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,240
you, when you pirate, you eliminate this DRM issue, the blackout worm, right? You eliminate

101
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,040
this incompatibility. Like you just throw it on a Plex server and then you have it on

102
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,560
every device everywhere at any time and the whole, all the problems are solved. And there's

103
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,240
like, there's this whole, and oftentimes it's higher resolution too, which is, you know,

104
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,240
a whole nother aspect to it. And so it's like, there's all these incentives and these deer,

105
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,640
all these walled off systems with DRM really to me just don't speak my language. They don't

106
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
speak a longterm solution to me.

107
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,740
Well, they're not very effective. Absolutely not. I don't think they're effective at all.

108
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,840
And I think that it really, it speaks to something when you can find that a pirating ecosystem

109
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,120
is actually more pleasant and usable than the official ecosystems that are authorized.

110
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,920
And I feel like as technology has changed so rapidly in the last five years, content

111
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,680
that like for example, blackout worm has purchased content that he bought on iTunes doesn't scale

112
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,080
to his evolving needs in a, in a changing technology platform environment. However,

113
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,680
content that he might've pirated, that's portable. That's, that's free. That's, you know, it's

114
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,400
going to move around however you want. It's just, it's, it's so dumb the way the system

115
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
works.

116
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,800
It is. And I also want to point out that Angelo was kind enough to point out that, yes, you

117
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,560
can actually sync over wifi. So his problem of needing that USB connection is really not

118
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,840
needed. You know, so Angelo, yeah, I understand. That's good to know. That's good. And so,

119
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,880
but I also understand that you know, pirating is not really a great option and it's not

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
necessarily an option that a lot of people want to do.

121
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,920
Well, and a lot of people can take more of a, I don't know, a looser, I've been known

122
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,000
to buy, we have what we call mom flicks and that's my mother-in-law who has approximately

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,620
15,000 DVDs and I'm probably low balling that. Um, any DVD, you know, so anything I want

124
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,680
I can rip. You know what I mean? It's like, it's a problem solved for me. So, you know,

125
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,320
it works out pretty well from that. So I have that option as well. And if it's not available

126
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,080
to me, then I probably don't need it that badly. You know?

127
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
I agree, Matt.

128
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
That was perfect.

129
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,660
I really, I really think also we just kind of need to put our big boy pants on and be

130
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,440
like, fine, you don't want to sell me your content. I'm not going to buy it. I mean,

131
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,880
we're willing to make that stance for open sourcing versus closed software. You know,

132
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
Photoshop, you don't want to make your software available for my platform. I'm not going to

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
buy it.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,320
I was able to do that with everything except Dexter and Breaking Bad. I just, I had to

135
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
have that.

136
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,440
That's fair. That's fair. I guess, you know, there is always that sort of a cultural, um,

137
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,440
experience, right? Like I, I am a Star Trek, you know, there's, it doesn't matter. I would,

138
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,720
I would, there are hoops I would jump through and have jumped through for Star Trek. I mean,

139
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,840
I have bought all that crap on Blu-ray or, or convinced family members to get it for

140
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
me for the holidays.

141
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,520
Exactly. That's where it's at. Yep. It's, that's where it's at. Like get me Star Trek.

142
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
You could do no wrong.

143
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,760
Well, and to be honest with you, uh, this is again, another advantage to physical media

144
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,040
in the sense that it's easily backupable, breakable. Um, and then I throw it into an

145
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,640
MKV file and I'm, and I'm good to go. I encode it with x264 and it sits on my, on my server.

146
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,760
Um, and it also is a higher resolution because it's from Blu-ray.

147
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
That's right.

148
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,920
And, and then I use Plex to manage the sampling. So if I'm watching it on my HTC one, Plex

149
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,680
manages the downscaling for me.

150
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,400
And you don't have to worry about it. It's great. It just works really, really well.

151
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,520
And there's such great Blu-ray ripping software out there for Linux. It's like a no brainer.

152
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,400
Yeah. We did an episode a while back on last, um, on backing up that stuff. You know, the

153
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,200
thing that I'm, I'm really loving these days is, uh, make MKV. I just think that's where

154
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,400
I've been. I mean, Handbrake's great. Don't get me wrong, but I've just, I don't need

155
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,720
all that. You know, I just need it simple.

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,920
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Ickmyre or he told me how to say it, but I can't help but say Ick. He

157
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,940
lives in Washington too. We just outed him. Sorry to do that on the air, uh, Ick. Anyways,

158
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,320
he suggests that we need, uh, uh, a JB Plex app. If anybody out there wants to make us

159
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,600
a JB Plex plugin, that would be awesome. Ickmyre, sorry. Uh, and Linux newbie said, did I mean

160
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,880
H two 64 and not X? No, I mean, so I mean, uh, H two 64 is, um, is, uh, everybody knows

161
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,560
what H two 64 is. X two 64 is an open source re-implementation of it. And it is so much

162
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,120
better. Like, and, and this is coming from somebody who initially on X two 64 was very

163
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,760
skeptical. I'm very skeptical on web M and VP eight. I'm hopeful for VP nine. I've also

164
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,480
been a doubter on, um, Theora.

165
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,920
I think Theora was, Theora has been garbage as long as I can remember. It's adorable,

166
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
but it's just garbage.

167
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,480
It's just not, it's just not a serious solution for distribution of media. And I think that's

168
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,680
one of the reasons why it struggled to take off. Um, and so, uh, but one of the things,

169
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,520
and I was initially a skeptic of X two 64. Oh, it's just a, you know, it's gonna, it's

170
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,080
a rip off. It's a clone. How can it, it's always going to be in catch up mode. Well,

171
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,680
I was totally wrong about that. Uh, H two 64 stagnates for the most part because of

172
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,280
the, a mass amount of interests that are involved with it. And X two 64 has managed to maintain

173
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,560
compatibility as needed. I mean, you do have to watch yourself, but, uh, the, everything

174
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,840
about it is better. The picture it delivers is superior to H two 64 it's open source code.

175
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,240
That's superior. Um, and the encoding times are better because it's more efficient at

176
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,520
taking advantage of multi-core, you know, my Bonobo, it will light up all four real

177
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,200
cores and all four virtual cores completely maxed out, uh, as it rips through video using

178
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,480
FFmpeg. Um, it's really great. So that's really awesome. Well, and I, and if memory serves

179
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,960
me, and it's been a while since I've tried it, uh, on Vorbis, you know, for the audio

180
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,680
stuff, I don't recall that being bad. No, no, Vorbis is fine. Yeah. Vorbis was great

181
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,480
for audio, but yeah, it was the video where we always had the, it was muddy or was choppy

182
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,480
or suffers from that. Not, not good, but not better enough than MP3. And since it's almost

183
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,880
the same to me. Yeah. All right. Well, so, uh, we got, we got some steam stuff. I mean,

184
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,920
this is, we knew we talked about it on Linux action show on Sunday. We said Monday, they're

185
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,840
going to announce this. I was watching the countdown that happened while we were recording

186
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,920
quarter radio. So my, my, my immediate, as the, uh, as the page went live reactions were

187
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,120
captured in Kota radio and it's funny. And I don't necessarily think this was, I don't

188
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,800
think this, I don't think this now, but at the time my first reaction was, Oh, this is

189
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,580
a huge slap in the face to Ubuntu. Right. That was my, my, my first immediate reaction

190
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,640
was, Oh, canonical thinks or a valve doesn't trust the canonical is going to deliver on

191
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,440
the desktop. They don't think they can hitch their boat that way or their, their car to

192
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,640
that wagon or to that horse. Well, you know, I think it's like the old saying, go, go is,

193
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,400
uh, you know, trust, but verify. And I think that's kind of what they did. Um, I think

194
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,640
they said, Oh yeah, no, we're, we're totally hip to you guys. But in, in addition to being

195
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,120
hip to you guys and being down with what you're doing, we're going to go ahead and do this

196
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,560
project over here just in case, you know? Well, and like so many people like to do there,

197
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,880
we believe they're going to base demoize off of Ubuntu, but before we get to all of that,

198
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:32,840
I want to thank our first sponsor this week, Ting.com. Ting, Matt, mobile that makes sense.

199
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:39,120
Yes, sir. Mobile that makes sense because Ting has no early termination fees, no contracts.

200
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,600
No contracts. Yes, that's right. No contracts. And you only pay for what you use. In fact,

201
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,360
let's just start with this this week. One of the things I love about Ting is their rates.

202
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,040
They break out your rates by minutes, text message and megabytes, and they bill you at

203
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,080
the end of the month for whatever bucket you fall into. So if you don't use your voice

204
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,800
very much, but you use a lot of data like I do, well then you end up paying an extremely

205
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,600
reasonable rate. I think my bill right now is around $14. It's incredible. And since

206
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,000
it's the way they base this is you can have multiple devices on one account with a pooled

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
amount of minutes. You just pay that $6. There's a flat $6 for the line. Bam, you've got a

208
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,560
line you own. Then from that point on, you only pay for what you use. So if that, if

209
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,520
that device sits on your desk for a month, you don't have to worry about the gadget guilt

210
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,320
of not using it. And Ting is making a lot of great new improvements. LTE lit up all

211
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,160
over the place. They have a goal of 200 million people covered by LTE coverage by the end

212
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,240
of 2013. They just turned on 34 new cities, tons of new coverage in Texas, and they just

213
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,040
got the Moto X. This is probably the Android phone to have now, which, shh, my HTC One

214
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,120
is in air shot. You don't want to make it jealous, Chris. I know, I know, Matt, but

215
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,080
this HTC One is looking really, really good. But if you're still considering something

216
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,680
else, maybe something a little of the larger variety like, oh, I don't know, the new Note

217
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
3. Well, good news because Ting has announced that the Note 3 will be hitting Ting. And

218
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,440
now Matt, you know, you know, when you have a big screen like that, this thing's going

219
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,440
to support a 5.7 inch screen. You ready for this? Three gigabytes of RAM and a 13 megapixel

220
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,560
camera. Let me put this in perspective. My main desktop computer, not, not the one I'm

221
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,480
on now, which has more RAM, but my main desktop has two gigabytes of RAM. I want to really

222
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,800
let that sink in for folks. I think people, if you haven't tried it on a large screen

223
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,840
device, that when you have, when you're taking a picture on something like the Note, the

224
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,960
screen is so big, you get such a good idea of what that picture is going to turn out

225
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,760
like and the framing of it. So, so, you know, man, Note 3 coming out, they just rolled out

226
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,200
the Note, I'm sorry, the Moto X. And the good news is, and it doesn't stop there, the LG

227
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,000
G2, the high-end Android smartphone that packs useful features and unique design with a 1080p

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,160
5.2 inch screen, 2.3 inch, or I'm sorry, 2.3 gigahertz quad core processor and a 3000

229
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,120
milliamp battery. They're going to have the G2 coming out on the Ting network as well.

230
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,340
That's also got Android 4.2. It's got a tri-band LTE antenna in that thing. And they've also

231
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:04,680
got some new refurbished feature phones. If you want something real straightforward, you'll

232
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,180
see those in early October.

233
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,320
Get something for the family, you know? And I have a real quick, super quick plug that

234
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,920
I want to do for Ting that I experienced and I talked about on the show last week. And

235
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,720
that was where I went a little bit over on my data. Not a lot, just a little bit. And

236
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm thinking, OK, I'm probably going to get rolled into the next plan, no big deal. I'm

237
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,360
going to roll into the next bucket, rather. OK, that's fine. Guess what happens? I get

238
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,920
an email saying, hey, you went a little over. We're going to eat that cost, and we're not

239
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,600
going to charge you extra for it.

240
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,600
That's awesome, isn't it?

241
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
What's up with that, right?

242
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
They're awesome.

243
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Whoa!

244
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
Yeah, they're awesome. And now they have an early termination fee relief program. So

245
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,120
if you're canceling a contract at your current provider, Ting will help you take the sting

246
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,360
out of that. You just go get your phone, port your number, then submit your ETF claim, and

247
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,040
it'll take up to $75 off your ETF. That's a great deal. They've also announced that they'll

248
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:57,680
be rolling out a new LTE hotspot, the Zing Mobile Hotspot MyFive 5000 LTE. Now, you combine

249
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,960
the Ting fantastic rates with an LTE hotspot, and the fact that you only pay for what you

250
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,680
use. So if you don't use it very much for a month or so, no big deal. That's a killer

251
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,000
deal. That's incredible. So go to linux.ting.com. Linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,760
device or, if you want to bring your own device, well guess what? $25 off your first month.

253
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,200
Since the average Ting bill is like $21, it might mean your first month is free. And then

254
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
later on, if you decide you want to get the Moto X or you decide you want to do something

255
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,760
else, you can. You can grab it. And it's super easy to do through the Ting website to get

256
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,980
them all set up and get it activated. And you combine that with their super, super wonderful

257
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:40,900
customer support, 1-855-846-4389. You call in anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern

258
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,040
and a real person will answer the phone. That's just so great. That is so awesome. So go to

259
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,840
linux.ting.com. And thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Big thank you. So there I

260
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,560
was, the end of Coder Radio, and Valve has to go and make a big announcement, Matt. And

261
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:03,800
the thing that struck me in this announcement, just like did not see it coming. And to your

262
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,040
credit, you totally, totally, totally called it at like the 36-minute mark in the Linux

263
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,040
action show last week. I'm going to play a clip. Steam box. And I think, you know, I

264
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,360
look at what the Ouya did. We've covered it a lot on Coder Radio. I look at what a lot

265
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,880
of these other companies are doing. I think Valve's the one that has the right approach.

266
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,560
And the fact that it'd be powered by Linux makes me ecstatic. Screw you, Xbox. Screw

267
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,920
you, Xbox. I'm getting the Steam box. You know, the more I think about it, the more

268
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm thinking, keep going back to what he said about the whole embracing the PC culture and

269
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,420
the fact that you can expand on it. It's open and so on and so forth. What if the box is

270
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,320
essentially a gaming thin client for your existing computer? Because if you think about

271
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,000
it, it sounds dumb at first, but if you stop and think about it, it's like, okay, I've

272
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,120
got my Steam box. Okay. Wow. You know, I really want to upgrade that hardware. Yeah. But if

273
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,280
you have a box that doesn't care and it's pulling it in from, I'm not saying that's

274
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,680
what it is. I'm just saying it's a possibility. I would say you called it, Matt. You totally

275
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,720
called it. That's one of the key features of a Steam OS. Yes, that's right. Ladies and

276
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,740
gentlemen, Steam OS. So this was the teaser last year. We shipped a software feature called

277
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,760
Big Picture, a user interface, interface, interface tailored for televisions and K-pads.

278
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,360
This year we're working on even more ways to connect the dots, dots, dots, dots for customers

279
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,520
who want Steam in the living room. Soon we'll be adding your design process so you can help

280
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,320
us shape the future. Now here's what we've got. Steam OS, so far what we know is going

281
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,920
to be a platform by Valve that they're going to offer out for free for people to deploy

282
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,360
on their hardware. They can make Steam boxes. Uh, we don't know for sure yet, but we believe

283
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,060
that Steam and Valve will announce a reference platform that you should follow. It'll be

284
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,520
Nvidia based. It'll probably be of a mid-range spec and it'll be running Steam OS. Steam

285
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,400
OS primarily is going to be based off Ubuntu. It has, of course, a Valve spin on it. There's

286
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,440
already repos up online. There have been for a while. We actually covered them like five

287
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,920
weeks ago on the Linux Action Show. There's been repos that you could connect to. Um,

288
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,440
they have been building them out and they've been calling it Home Test, which has been

289
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,600
obviously short for people who have Steam OS installed at home or are getting updates.

290
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,640
This has been around since April. So this is all something they've been building. Of

291
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,480
course, they've been working with Nvidia a lot. They've been working with the different,

292
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,120
uh, um, different parties on, on getting like a debugger built for Linux. And I love those

293
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,680
things because that's going to ensure not that it just exists, but it exists and it

294
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,640
works really, really well. Right. So we've been, so we've been seeing Valve very subtly,

295
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,160
very intelligently move towards the living room. One of the things that, uh, is I think

296
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,680
of particular interest is, uh, 40% of all games on Steam feature some sort of, and by

297
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:39,160
the way, I mean Linux games, 40% of all Linux games on Steam support some type of, some

298
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,920
level of controller support. So that amounts to 70 to 72 games of the total that are available

299
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,520
for Linux right now have controller support. However, when big picture mode was launched

300
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,560
last September, 23.7% of games available on Steam were listed with full or partial controller

301
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,800
support. That was 382 games total on Steam of games that have launched on Steam since

302
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:08,200
big picture has been launched about 48.4% of all of the featured or all full fee, all

303
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,400
of the games have featured or have full feature or partial feature for controller support,

304
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,960
raising the total pop population of games on Steam to nearly 30% or 617 games in total

305
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,640
now on Steam have controller support. So they've been working on this for a while, right? As

306
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,320
a part of that critical infrastructure piece, then they announced, you know, we're going

307
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,760
to, we're going to also announce some AAA titles. Uh, we assume those will have controller

308
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,160
support and they say, Oh, and Hey, don't worry if you've got, if you've got a steam library

309
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,440
full of stuff, but it's on windows, we're going to stream that for you. Oh, and by the

310
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,680
way, don't forget, we've also just enabled family sharing and that's something I got

311
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,960
to hit you up on. I got to borrow some of those games. I got a 16 year old over here

312
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,160
more, you know, games will be needing, I'll tell you, but I'm excited for this cause now

313
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,360
I'm seeing it from his eyes and you know, seeing it from a whole new perspective of

314
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,680
the sense of discovery. And it's just so exciting to see this happen, you know? So my, uh, my,

315
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:06,920
my prediction is here that, uh, we're going to have ourselves, uh, pop may be, I don't

316
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,680
think so, but maybe a hardware pre-order tomorrow. I don't think so though. I think we're just

317
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,600
gonna see a reference design, but I think we're going to see some sort of maybe potential

318
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,840
partnership announced with Nvidia. To me, it seems logical that the streaming technology

319
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,160
they're talking about is the Nvidia shield technology, but I think so. I think you nailed

320
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,160
it. I think you called that one. I would completely agree with that. That's just making sense.

321
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,240
It ensures that five, you know, two, three years, five years down the road, whatever

322
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,600
it may be, there aren't going to be any conflicts or issues because the partnerships already

323
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,560
in place, they have an equal interest in keeping that stuff on par. So this is to me, there

324
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,880
are so many interesting aspects to talk about this from what's it going to mean for Linux?

325
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,680
What's it going to mean for other distros like arch and open Sousa and fedora? What's

326
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,640
it going to mean for developers? I mean, there's so many different angles we can talk about,

327
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,240
but before we move off from the launch day announcement and what was announced, I want

328
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,840
to open it up to the mumble room and say, guys, is there any aspect of the announcement

329
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,280
or something that came out in the news that was particularly noteworthy to you? Anything

330
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,520
around with, you know, what you hope to see tomorrow announced? I'll leave that to you

331
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:23,920
guys now, buddy. I was surprised by the of being able to use your windows games on Linux,

332
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,120
which people do leave their computers running in an office while they're in the living room.

333
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,000
So hey, right. You're going to have to have a machine running occupied to do that streaming

334
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
because theoretically the streaming processing will take place on the windows PC, but it's

335
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,360
over the land. So it's not like what online was trying to do so much. This is true. I

336
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:53,240
guess I'm just looking for if it has really good updating features, because I know a lot

337
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,400
of people don't want to deal with updates, especially on Linux. Right. Yeah, they'd have

338
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,040
they'd they'd have they'd have to have their own system wide updater that sort of took

339
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,680
care of steam updates, system updates, game updates. And I think, you know, we've had

340
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,240
we have I'll leave it up to the folks in the mumble room, but we've had folks in the mumble

341
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,640
room who have connected to some steam repos, pulled down some packages and seeing that

342
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,520
there is their own like valve updater in the repo. And it doesn't necessarily sound like

343
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,720
it has to be on Ubuntu 12.04 either could potentially work on 13.04 that now that could

344
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,520
be interesting, although that's going to be an interesting release, you know? Yeah, no.

345
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,680
All right. Well, so here's where I think we should take this chat. And I think this is

346
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:46,200
something first thing I think I want to talk about is. So envision I think we're going

347
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,720
to envision something like an XBMC almost style distro based on Ubuntu 12.04 boots up

348
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,360
right in the steam big picture mode. And, you know, we've seen we've seen that, you

349
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,760
know, Ubuntu has been valves focus since they started steam for Linux. They already have

350
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,820
a repository for it. I think this will be just something they'll make available to folks.

351
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,680
And I think that they'll say, we recommend these specs, we recommend this hardware, but

352
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,840
you can do more video, you can do more CPU. But what I want to ask you, Matt, is what

353
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,120
do you think this means for OpenSUSE? What do you think this means for Arch? Honestly,

354
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,000
nothing, because I think they cater to different groups of people. I think they cater to people

355
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,440
with different goal sets and different interests. You know, there's always that, you know, do

356
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,280
we need to worry about some sort of evil division or whatnot? Do you think they're going to

357
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:32,200
create so Michael Dominic suggested that perhaps they're going to Androidify only to be steamify.

358
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,600
It's going to be maybe they maybe they're going to use, you know, their own display

359
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,440
manager. Maybe they'll use mere. Maybe they'll use, you know, they're they're they're going

360
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,240
to kind of over time become their own integrated solution, a customized separate kind of. Oh,

361
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,000
I think so. I think, you know, just like, you know, as you said, Android Androidify,

362
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,400
I think, you know, you look at Android and then you'll also look at the fact that other

363
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,480
operating systems are actually finding their way into the world. Firefox, for example,

364
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,480
things like that. So going back to the steam OS, I think, will that affect other distros?

365
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,120
No, I don't. I think that there's enough non specific interest to that space that everything

366
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,320
will remain strong. And as it is, I know that means that I do predict a lot of the sky is

367
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,760
falling from news outlets and folks on blogs and whatnot. Everybody's going to be freaking

368
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,080
out. Oh my God, Ubuntu and steam and all these guys are just big poo poo heads and they're

369
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,960
ruining everything. And we're going to hear lots of that nonsense like we always do. But

370
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
it's not going to happen.

371
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,920
You know, so I'll play a little bit of this clip. I'll go back to something we played

372
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:39,000
on Sunday. Yeah. On the other hand, PC gaming seems to have been immune to this back up

373
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,840
because we actually didn't play this part in peace to sort of double down on that rather

374
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:51,480
than going that the way that they should have responded is very much to key off. And that

375
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:59,560
was a very seductive opportunity. I'll let him play this. So one of the things Gabe talked

376
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,000
about in his keynote is that locking down the ecosystem, integrating the stream line,

377
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,480
it has actually led to less innovation, which has led to the decline of the industry. Interesting

378
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,040
point. So he may not lock it down. It is very much to key off of the strength of, you know,

379
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:20,280
the openness of the systems we had and sort of double down on that rather than going going

380
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:27,680
the other way. So jumping forward, what are we looking at now? We're looking at steady

381
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:36,640
year over year unit declines in PC sales. And so I think, you know, I kind of I'm I'm

382
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,120
I'm filling in and connecting a lot of dots for that could lead me to be very disappointed

383
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,600
down the road. But to me, it sounds like one of the things that's turned them on about

384
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:52,120
Linux is the fact that it is this sort of it's the it's the Internet of operating systems

385
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,100
in the sense that it's this open, common, connected platform that anybody can put their

386
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:04,500
goods on and sell. And and I think what if if Valve is successful here, Valve will take

387
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,560
the term Linux and take the general public thinking around Linux, too. Oh, that scares

388
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,360
consumers and it's too hard. So we're not going to brand Linux like Google doesn't Brown

389
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,800
brand the Chromecast as the Linux Chromecast. They just it's Chromecast, right? Because

390
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,920
like we talked about last week, Linux is scary. Exactly. It is scary. No, I think it'll be

391
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,500
interesting to see what they do. I do believe that at some level they may end up using something

392
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,120
like mirror or they may end up using something that would arguably be, quote unquote, you

393
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,420
know, locked down in the sense that it's not as widely popular or something like Wayland

394
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:43,760
or whatnot. But that doesn't but that doesn't mean that they won't go and take this and

395
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
make this to where you can run it the way you want it. You can take their OS and run

396
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
it on any darn thing you please. I believe they'll make that possible. And they may even

397
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,660
just go do that through APIs. And if they're successful, if they're successful at doing

398
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,160
this, then they'll go from Linux is scary to Linux is the platform where there isn't

399
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,640
a special interest controlling it and I can sell my stuff. And it'll have to be something

400
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,600
snappier than that. It'll be Linux is the Internet of platforms or something ridiculous

401
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,440
like cloud or vlog or whatever. Sure. Tweet. But it'll be like I think we could actually

402
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,440
go from to like Linux is this place where people are going to go to sell their goods

403
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,880
potentially. We'll see. I don't know. Well, I think it could at least help with the image

404
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,040
of Linux quite a bit. One thing I've learned watching steam over a period of time, as well

405
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,020
as watching other games in general, there are two industries and technology that define

406
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,760
media formats and that define direction, porn and gaming. Right now, gaming is going with

407
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,240
Linux. All we got to do now is get porn on board worse. And it's good. Everybody's music.

408
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,160
And I wonder too, isn't sort of like the you know, like you're right, like maybe it's gaming

409
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,320
comes here first and then other industries join along. But yeah, there's those two defining

410
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,440
industries that really historically define everything. I mean, they literally take direction

411
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,000
of media. They take direction of technology, even DRM. Yeah. You know what? Porn is going

412
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,360
to have a hard time in stores. I actually have something. Yeah. Well, I just think if

413
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:14,600
Valve does get successful at boasting Steam and having Steam on Linux, I think most people's

414
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:22,880
opinion will be like, Linux is for gaming because Valve made it very successful. You

415
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,040
know what I mean? Yeah. It could change like the whole perception around it, couldn't it?

416
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,720
Because like it makes Linux more appealing to say the younger crowd because the younger

417
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,400
crowd obviously wants to have really awesome games and really awesome graphics at the same

418
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,300
time. Right. Well, and I think Valve is in a, I know, okay. So I guess here's the question

419
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:52,080
is so Valve has a lot of clout. Steam's a great platform. I went and I Wikipedia'd out

420
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:00,000
the numbers here. Here you go. Here's a little bit of, here's some math for you. Steam, we'll

421
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,280
put it this way. Xbox Live has 46 million active users as of February, 2013. Okay. Xbox

422
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,800
Live 46 million. PlayStation Network, if you combine all of the PlayStation consoles with

423
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,240
all of like the Vita handhelds and all the handhelds they've sold, PlayStation Network

424
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:22,320
is a hundred million active users. That's quite a bit. But Steam actually has a very

425
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,120
respectable 60 million active users. Wow. So if you get 60 million active users, you've

426
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,120
got some leverage there to incentivize game makers and you could do it across the entire

427
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,600
store. So you could say, all right, a big AAA developer, if you're willing to make the

428
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,520
game for our Steam box, we'll give you a higher cut of your sales across the entire Steam

429
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,600
store. Like Valve has some room here to, you know, lean on developers to create something

430
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,320
for Linux. So I think that's the key right there. I think if they say, look, you're already

431
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,840
on these other platforms, you make these, you know, you make the needed modifications

432
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,720
to come to us, we're going to give you a bigger piece of the pie. And oh, by the way, this

433
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,200
is essentially a brand new market because they're opening up in the living room. Big

434
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,360
deal. You know, it's a big deal. No doubt. They have excellent pull against, you know,

435
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:15,360
developers because they have a huge base to work off of. And a huge customer base with

436
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,000
a good history of willing to buy products. You combine that with their pushing forward

437
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,440
on a lot of the fundamental aspects of Linux support. So they've been sort of changing

438
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:32,520
that image already with making the game performance faster, delivering their own games to Linux.

439
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,400
Steam with a lot of the back end features of Steam, I mean, the elephant in the room

440
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:43,200
is this is all commercial, this is all DRM. But the plus sides for Linux to me seem really

441
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,960
quite obvious in this scenario. I mean, this is a huge, this will be huge for Linux because

442
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,760
it sounds like in everything we're reading and everything we can infer is this thing's

443
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,080
going to follow pretty closely to mainline Linux. And I think what you'd end up having

444
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,040
for better or for worse is a quote unquote official standard for what Steam compatibility

445
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,480
needs to look like. And it's not like the standard in the sense that we went to a board

446
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,080
and a board came up with a consensus that all distros will follow. But what it is is

447
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,440
that every distro that wants to make a Steam game work can look at how it works on the

448
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,920
Steam OS and then do whatever kind of silly hacks they have to do to make it work on Arch

449
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,360
or OpenSUSE. Just like, you know, I mean, we get pipeline, I mean, hell man, we can

450
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,720
go watch Silverlight DRMed Netflix videos now on Linux. The Linux community is amazing

451
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,320
and making things work under their distro that are not designed for their distro. So

452
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,660
as long as we have a model to follow, which the Steam OS will be this quote unquote game

453
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:38,800
standard base that will follow. This will be the Steam base that we all follow now and

454
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,880
then we can make whatever they get working there, we can replicate it on different environments.

455
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
Yeah.

456
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,120
Yeah, but Chris, I kind of feel like that it's then also very important that in the

457
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,280
upcoming announcements, there is going to be a Steam box because without a reference

458
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,900
implementation of the hardware, like a real reference implementation, it might not really

459
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,760
take off as much as we hope. And then it's all been all for nothing.

460
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,240
I agree. I think if, you know, okay, so here's the problem. So say they do a Google route

461
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,280
and they make a Nexus device, right? Well, who the hell is going to order anything but

462
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,320
the Steam valve box? No, I mean, that sucks all the air out of the room. So what they

463
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,000
really need is to work with companies like new egg and have like the new egg Steam box.

464
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And we could have like a Linux action show Steam box. And then I, I agree that you need,

465
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,400
I hope, I hope that system 76 might do something like that because the, the only other device

466
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,280
we have seen is the piston and that thing costs a thousand dollars and that's just too

467
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,840
much. Well, isn't that the interesting thing is a company like system 76 could take a Steam

468
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:47,680
box and make one, but would anybody buy one? Could they make it cheap enough is really

469
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,360
the hard thing to come up with because Sony and expo and Microsoft sort of have this economy

470
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,280
of scale where they can make things cheap and then they can charge for licensing and

471
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,600
games and they can charge for Xbox live and whatnot. But what does Steve, what does valve

472
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:09,600
really have in their hardware? What if valve gave a system 76 or somebody else, you know,

473
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,680
they give them a cut. Hey, you get 10%, 20% of the purchase of every game and maybe go

474
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,600
ahead. Okay. With regard to that, we, if it is that steam bless one particular vendor

475
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,300
over another, then you would have people who don't know about Linux, don't know about companies

476
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,920
like system 76 and so forth that will eventually have to go to these companies to get their

477
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,420
stuff just as well as I think you might have a couple of quote unquote blessed vendors,

478
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,960
but it's going to be an ISO you can download, I think. Yeah, I'm sure it will be. It just

479
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,720
makes sense because it's as much coverage as possible. I mean, as far as getting back

480
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,560
to the steam box itself, one thing that we really need to remember too, is that if you're

481
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,960
married you generally have to consider what I like to call a front room real estate. Yeah.

482
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,400
And there's others on others. You have certain consoles that are, that have been blessed

483
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,800
to be there. They serve their purpose, but to add another console and then to have to

484
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,120
argue, well, we're now we're going to need a bigger cabinet or, well, we're going to

485
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,840
have to rearrange that. As silly as it may seem, that does come up. You know, it would

486
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,840
here anyway. And so that, you know, so size and proportion. And I think the question would

487
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,800
be asked, does it play Netflix? Does it play? Yeah, seriously. No, that's a legitimate question.

488
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,960
Does it play, does it play either games and or content that your spouse is into? On the

489
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,800
page, it states that they are talking to content providers. It's vague though. It's vague.

490
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,480
That could be a YouTube app for all we know. Right. Oh gosh. Yeah, no kidding. And we'll

491
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,800
just say, I can't answer your question about hardware costs. I mean, you've got the Linux

492
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,000
kernel, so it's pretty much adaptable to anything. So it's adaptable, but you still have to have

493
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,800
something that runs the games well. And so it's kind of hard for them to vet it. It's

494
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,320
not like the Xbox where you have this fixed platform. And so all the software vendors

495
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,480
sort of have a target hardware spec when they're designing the games. This thing needs to be

496
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,160
very powerful to accommodate almost any game stole price. And I think the streaming kind

497
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,920
of alleviates some of that. In fact, that gives them some flexibility, right? I also

498
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,160
think that because Valve was working with like Nvidia about drivers and stuff like that,

499
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,240
I do think they also need to work with AMD, but that's just my opinion. Oh, I'm sure they

500
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,320
will. I'm sure they will. I think they would have more or less standard specs that will

501
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,880
work with any game. And seeing that they have certain vendors who'd be blessed, like for

502
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,640
example, they're working with Nvidia, people would tend to work towards getting Nvidia

503
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:37,000
drivers working with their games. And you continue on that path. I think that Valve

504
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,200
just needs to really focus and make sure they get this on the dot is to have driver implementation,

505
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,040
correct? Yeah. Yeah. And because Valve has been doing business with Nvidia, they might

506
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,400
already have a deal for a chip they can put in their box for a very good price. They might.

507
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,280
I think price is crucial because they need to meet the price point of the PS4 and the

508
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Xbox One in order to get that console market share to get it really going and soon. And

509
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,640
if they do that, then the developers will come to them to make the money. I don't think

510
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,960
that will be hard. I think the way this has to work out, and I mean, the way I'd like

511
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,200
to see it work out is if Valve could make a box where, you know, if I just fall ass

512
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,200
backwards into buying a Steam box, I land on this thing. Like give me something for

513
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,120
just the most simple basic consumer to go purchase. Maybe it's advertised in the Steam

514
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,680
store itself. Maybe I could even buy it through Steam. But then make it available for anyone

515
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,280
to build one. And the reason I think that is because like I was picturing pitching

516
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,880
this to an Xbox fan, and like I think the question they would ask is, well, what controller

517
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,480
can I use? And my answer would be like, well, Valve has a really great controller they spend

518
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,600
a lot of time coming up with, but actually any controller that works with Linux you can

519
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,400
use. If you want to use the 360 controller, you can. You want to use the PS4 controller,

520
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,120
go for it. And so I think, you know, they need like the one-click purchase box that

521
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,520
just comes with everything. That's the one you get at Christmas. That's the one that,

522
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,200
you know, a real average user gets. But then later they could start building their own

523
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,680
the next time they get one, or they could, you know, swap out the controller for their

524
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,400
favorite console controller. And I think if they can walk that line, I agree with the

525
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,340
Mumble Room. If they don't really have something in 2014 for me to buy, well then they better

526
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:26,120
work really damn close with a few OEMs to have something. And it better be like, it

527
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,920
better feel just like buying one from Valve.

528
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,560
The controller points a good one, but one controller I'd like to see is just the standard

529
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,240
keyboard and mouse because for me personally, I'm an RTS fan and I can't get that on a console.

530
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,480
I think that's going to have to. I mean, I think, I think they'd have to, they'd have

531
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,160
to probably, you know, hard code it not to work.

532
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,560
Yeah, and that's the beauty of it being Linux is that that's something they should embrace

533
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,720
that you can use a keyboard or mouse, you can use your preferred controller. And I think

534
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
at the end of the day, you know, that's great.

535
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,280
Which would be my preferred controller.

536
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Yeah.

537
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,280
Yeah.

538
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,440
That's going to be, that's going to be one of their major curb appeals right there.

539
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,920
It is. Yeah. Because I was talking to my nephew about this. He's 16. He's like, well, can

540
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,040
I use, can I use my, can I use the controller that I use on my existing console? And I said,

541
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,320
probably. And he said, well, I'm on board. You know, he was good. He already has Steam

542
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
games. He's good.

543
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,800
What do you guys think about this streaming capability? Is this a band-aid or is this

544
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,280
like a long-term, okay, here's the way I see it. It could be a, a bullet point to address

545
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,280
the lack of AAA titles in the library, 200 Linux games, and only a handful of them are

546
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,160
the ones people are like totally clamoring for. Or, or it could be a long-term strategy

547
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,840
to say, kind of like Matt was saying in last, you know, this is really just a thin client.

548
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,560
And while yeah, you can play native games on it. If you want to use this thing for five,

549
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,000
five years, good on you. Just keep upgrading the video card in your PC and we'll just keep

550
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,840
streaming it for as long as you want. Is this a short-term thing or is this a long-term

551
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
thing?

552
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,760
I think it's both. There's going to be some people that are just going to really want

553
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,160
that thin client solution. And there's also some developers that will refuse to develop

554
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,920
on Linux until it's inevitable that that's the primary gaming platform. And then there's

555
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,440
going to be other developers that rush to support it. So I think it's really going to

556
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,960
be both solutions, short and long-term.

557
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:18,840
I do think that, I do think that they should probably work on trying to entice developers

558
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,720
and show that it's actually easier to work with Linux than it is to work with Windows.

559
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,400
Because the thing with Windows is that its kernel structure, yeah, it's very stable,

560
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,400
but it's not that fast and you don't get the good performance and you don't get to have

561
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,680
the capabilities that you do with Linux.

562
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:45,200
So I feel like NVIDIA has this entirely new technology, the streaming technology, developed.

563
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,680
And this is for them also a chance to make it like a standard.

564
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,760
So you agree it's going to be the NVIDIA streaming tech?

565
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:57,520
Yeah, because this is a chance for Valve as well as for NVIDIA.

566
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah, the consoles went with AMD so NVIDIA could really sell some units here.

567
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,760
And so I wonder then, if this is NVIDIA's streaming tech, it sounds like, I mean to

568
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,360
me, and I don't know where the squares with NVIDIA saying they're going to provide documentation

569
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,620
to the Novo project today, when you look at this, this to me seems like one of these features

570
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,880
that absolutely will require the proprietary NVIDIA driver.

571
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
It would.

572
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,880
It definitely will.

573
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:30,160
See, Alan in the chatroom thinks that streaming will never work, that it never works for games.

574
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,400
Now I don't know, I don't know, see, I'm of a slightly different opinion because for me,

575
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,280
I actually was able to play on live fairly successfully.

576
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,120
And on live was going to servers up in the cloud.

577
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,960
Now we don't know for sure, but I think everything points to the streaming is going to happen

578
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,120
over the LAN.

579
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:52,720
But where you're going to run into issues is everybody has really crappy Wi-Fi, right?

580
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,200
At least in average homes, nobody's got their Wi-Fi figured out.

581
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,320
There's a dozen different Wi-Fi APs just in range within my house.

582
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,560
So people who are not wired are going to constantly have problems, I would say.

583
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,480
Then it might scale down to 480p.

584
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,560
My answer to Alan, my answer to him saying that streaming won't work, I think on live

585
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,580
kind of failed just because they didn't have the coverage.

586
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:22,720
They didn't have all the servers in place as they do now.

587
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,600
I mean, I played on live for a while.

588
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:30,400
I mean, it wasn't good because I wasn't in like a closer coverage area, but if they had

589
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,600
more servers in like say one in Iowa or something like that, I would definitely be playing that

590
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
and it would have been great.

591
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,760
Yeah, and I think, you know, Cheeseburg in the burglary in the chat room makes a good

592
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
point.

593
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,480
You know, average Joe isn't probably going to be too impressed with the answer.

594
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,560
Yeah, I can play your games is, well, I actually take that back because if you're asking the

595
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,320
question, can it play game X, then you probably already have a PC and you already have that

596
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,440
game and you want to be able to play it.

597
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,120
So maybe actually.

598
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,160
But taking it into the living room gives you better two player ability.

599
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,480
You don't want to share your keyboard and mouse at your desk.

600
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,480
So you're assuming they can still play it back at the desk.

601
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,960
I would think it would take almost all the resources to just cause you're going to, I

602
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,880
mean the game has to, the game has to run.

603
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,360
I don't mean two player as in one person sitting at the desk and one person sitting

604
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
in the living room.

605
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,280
I'm talking about person a person B both watching the same TV in the living room.

606
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
Yeah.

607
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Console style.

608
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Yeah.

609
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
Yeah.

610
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Cause it is a console.

611
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,740
Streaming is also an enticement to developers.

612
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,640
If their game doesn't play as well over streaming and steam picks up a momentum, then they're

613
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,040
going to want to develop natively for Linux so that it is competitive.

614
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,040
Yeah, totally.

615
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,040
Yeah.

616
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Yeah.

617
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,040
I think that that would be the main point.

618
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,120
Most of the games that eventually, especially windows only games, you'll start to see a

619
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:50,440
dip in their games being played or being purchased because people want to use the steam box or

620
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,520
the steam OS because they can actually play it on larger screens and everything like that.

621
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,680
So eventually they would have to move over their games being played on Linux and will

622
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,280
actually be a win-win right.

623
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,120
Because in the other distros, we'll see how they got it working on steam OS and make it

624
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,920
work on their distro of choice.

625
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
Exactly.

626
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
And that's going to be huge.

627
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Definitely.

628
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,680
You know, I almost wonder if we're going to see something to where maybe it's kind of

629
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,920
a hybrid to where, okay, you've got the, uh, you, you, maybe you've got like some local

630
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,120
resources cached on the console itself and then the rest of it's being streamed in toward

631
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,400
basically where, you know, kind of a minimizes congestion from valve.

632
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,520
You know, I think people, I think, I think people would actually prefer that.

633
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,880
I think people would prefer to be able to stream it from valve because then you could

634
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,760
have somebody playing on the PC and you could have somebody playing on that.

635
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,760
Yeah.

636
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,840
Well, and if you cash local resources, like you cash in your, you got your maps cached,

637
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,000
you got various, uh, things like rendering, right?

638
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,440
That's where the, and that's where the seat, that's where the GPU is going to have to really,

639
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,040
you know, the whole Nvidia thing comes into it.

640
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,760
So, I mean, if they can kind of find that balancing act where, you know, there's still

641
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,800
some, there's still some caching going on locally, you still got enough to where it's

642
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,440
not just raw data going back and forth like crazy.

643
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,440
It's basically just gameplay.

644
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,440
Right.

645
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,280
Um, you know, well, if you did it right, uh, and essentially what OnLive did, and this

646
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,760
is why I think you could almost do it over a LAN is OnLive took, uh, either X264 or H264

647
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,940
and forked it essentially and created their own video codec and they would actually render

648
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,920
it as video and stream the video to the OnLive device.

649
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,040
Which is what the shield does.

650
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,040
Yeah, exactly.

651
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,960
It takes it before it goes to the HDMI port on your graphics card, if I'm right.

652
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,720
So if you can, if you can support, you know, a one to four megabit transfer rate over your

653
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,280
home LAN, that's essentially all you need to be able to stream that video bit rate.

654
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,080
Cause you're not actually streaming the raw data of the vectors and all of that.

655
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,480
You're just streaming the end output video.

656
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
Right.

657
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,760
That's pretty much every network.

658
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,760
Right.

659
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,760
Yeah.

660
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,200
It maybe is a little, a little pushing it for broadband connections for some folks,

661
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,360
but I should work over that.

662
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,120
I should work even over wifi.

663
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,120
I would think so.

664
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Yeah.

665
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I would think so.

666
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,440
They can probably drop the resolution to 720 without too many people noticing too.

667
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,880
I think part of it that I'm reasonably, another reason why I'm kind of excited about it is

668
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,520
because it's Gabe and it's valve, right?

669
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:10,880
If this was EA or, you know, Activision, I don't know, some company saying they're going

670
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,880
to make their own box.

671
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,880
I'm like, okay, good.

672
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
Well.

673
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,160
I'll look forward to that bastardization hitting the market soon.

674
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,360
Because valve has a, because valve has a good track record with their, with their comments.

675
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,360
Well, yeah.

676
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,720
I mean, just Gabe, you know, just totally we sort of, sort of, I mean, it makes so much

677
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
sense with that.

678
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,120
Why he was saying what he was saying at that keynote, it's, he's laying it all out there

679
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,240
saying this is the rationale.

680
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,920
And then when, when the news hits you, you know, you have this total framework to, to,

681
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,920
to view it all.

682
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,560
And I mean, it was pretty, pretty brilliant.

683
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,560
It was good staging.

684
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,400
I'm curious to see where it all goes.

685
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
Yeah, I am too.

686
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,320
And I think whoever did their marketing did a really nice job.

687
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,200
I mean, it was presented in a way of, here's why I care.

688
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,200
Love me a good countdown.

689
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,200
Yeah, exactly.

690
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,200
Right.

691
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
It's excited.

692
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,080
You know, one thing that I find.

693
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:03,000
I think that at the end of the day, Valve should more or less focus on organizing themselves.

694
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,240
Remember that they are just a platform in order to sell games, make sure that the development

695
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:15,440
platform is good for the developers, probably get one or two blessed vendors for the hardware,

696
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,720
but mainly focus on getting their stuff ported over to Linux so that the developers are easy

697
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,920
to move, to make a transition across to, to Linux so that they can get their game sells.

698
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,920
Right.

699
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,920
Yeah.

700
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,000
And if it is that they can do that, the hardware aspect of it will come eventually, whether

701
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,120
people like it or not, they would still be able to get, whether it's System76 or Dell

702
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,120
for that matter might want to jump on board because they see that, hey, everybody wants

703
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,760
to play games on Steam and every, and Steam using Linux.

704
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,000
So we need to, in order to get in on this, we have to be able to supply people with what

705
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
they want.

706
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,240
Well, you have a, you have a, you're going to have a whole range of people who just want

707
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,520
to play some of these side scrolling platformers or they just want to play some of these lower

708
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,840
end games and they could just, and as long as they're happy with streaming too, if the

709
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,920
streaming actually works, you could take, you could take an old box and just load the

710
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,360
SteamOS on it and call it good.

711
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,640
And you know, it doesn't matter if it can't play all the games natively because the streaming's

712
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,640
there.

713
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,040
And it could be this great use.

714
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,500
And if they tie in kind of video media playback, like I'm talking local LAN playback, give

715
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,360
me a little MKV support, maybe even a little Netflix action, action, I'm putting this on

716
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,840
every TV in my house.

717
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,840
Exactly.

718
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
That's, I think that's kind of what they're aiming for.

719
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,840
I really do.

720
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,600
And I think by hitting, basically looking at what the other consoles did wrong and that's

721
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,280
of course, you know, Wii is targeting nothing but family use only and any serious gamers

722
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,920
laughing at it.

723
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,440
Xbox and PS3 completely alienates most family folks and definitely into more of the people

724
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,880
that really like to play games.

725
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,960
I think by hitting that middle ground, and I think they can by having the side scrollers

726
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,800
as well as the hardcore games, I think they're going to be able to hit all the nails in the

727
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,800
head.

728
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,020
Well, and I think too, you have to look at some of this stuff in the perspective of a

729
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,960
struggling middle class, an economy that is continuing to have to make tough choices about

730
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,640
what they spend their money on.

731
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,640
And if I've got a two or three year old machine that can run SteamOS just fine, assuming I'm

732
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:07,400
okay with streaming a portion of the high end games, then to me, it's almost a slam

733
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,960
dunk because I get a console out of reinvesting in hardware I already have.

734
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,020
That's always been a great sales pitch for Linux usage.

735
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,060
It's always been a fantastic use for it and now, now we actually have a console contender

736
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,960
and so Valve is throwing their hat into the console ring by not creating one console but

737
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,720
by creating a platform and then letting the community build around it.

738
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,360
I'm pretty excited about that.

739
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,360
Makes complete sense.

740
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,980
We're going to keep digging into this and as we get more information, maybe even get

741
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,480
our hands on SteamOS, we'll talk about it more in the Linux action show, Matt.

742
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,320
But I thought we should probably get to a couple of email items that came in.

743
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,900
Yeah, good plan.

744
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,800
And before we do that, I wanted to actually make a special mention.

745
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,560
So I would talk about this pretty much as frequently as I feel people will tolerate

746
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,620
and that is our affiliate system.

747
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,920
We have links at the bottom of the Jupiter Broadcasting website.

748
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,840
We also have Chrome and Firefox extensions.

749
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,000
This is why I'm bringing it up.

750
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,880
Ah, the topic of the day, yes.

751
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,800
We did an update and I think it's really only Chrome that bit us in the butt but we did

752
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,960
an update to both to support new sites and to also kind of handle the, properly handle

753
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,960
the way when people click on an affiliated link on somebody else's site to make sure

754
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,160
our link doesn't override it.

755
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,600
That required a re, re, I don't even really, I don't really think it changes much except

756
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,920
for the way it just reads the URLs.

757
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,400
And anyways, that requires a reauthorization.

758
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,760
We had a massive drop off, a huge, huge drop off.

759
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,000
And I almost wonder if people are, it's maybe they are aware of it but they don't know if

760
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,080
they already have the old one installed, like do they know how to go into extensions?

761
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,080
It's super subtle.

762
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,800
Yeah, you gotta hit like the little hamburger menu and then go down there and say re-enable.

763
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,800
What's that look like?

764
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
Maybe show us what a hamburger menu looks like.

765
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,800
The three line.

766
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
I don't have a shot of it.

767
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,800
Oh, you don't have a shot?

768
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
That's fine.

769
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
So it's up there in the upper right hand corner.

770
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
Yeah, exactly.

771
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,800
It's that, it's that three dot, that three line.

772
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
It's called, they call it the hamburger menu.

773
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
And in there you reauthorize it.

774
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,880
We had a huge drop off so our, our expenses are super tight when that goes away because

775
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,000
the way we do it is we have advertising that pays for a certain running amount and then

776
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,200
we have a good portion that comes from the affiliates and that sort of balances out where

777
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,520
our different revenues come from.

778
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,000
But if either one drops off significantly, it really hurts the production.

779
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,640
So if you would check that and make sure it's enabled and if you don't already have our

780
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,920
browser extension, well you can find a link to the bottom of Jupiter Broadcasting for

781
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,900
Chrome or Firefox and we'd really appreciate it if you grab that and help us.

782
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:21,280
We have huge plans for 2014 and I've been kind of discovering over the last couple of

783
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,160
weeks, there's a lot of local listeners, Matt.

784
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,480
Oh, oh, that reminds me.

785
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,480
Oh, so, okay.

786
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,200
So we have a lot of local listeners, which how cool would it be to do an unplugged with

787
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,440
a few people in studio?

788
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,720
Dude, that would be awesome, right?

789
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,720
Yeah.

790
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,720
Okay.

791
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,000
So this is, I probably should have brought this up to you off air, but I'm going to

792
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
throw this out there.

793
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Okay.

794
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,220
One of the things we could do in a future where everything is, everybody has infinite

795
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,960
time and organization capabilities, you know, that future that we talk about all the time,

796
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,800
wouldn't it be fun to take a Tuesday and like go do something on location, do an unplugged

797
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,000
on location, and while we're doing that, record a segment for that Sunday's last, so sort

798
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,920
of kill two birds with one stone.

799
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,640
So we take a Tuesday, we do the unplugged show on location, maybe do like a meetup type

800
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,900
thing, and then, you know, I'll give you an example.

801
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:12,160
This was all while I was naked, I was in the shower, I think I had, I probably had soaked

802
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,800
my body, but I don't think I had put any shampoo on yet, so just that's about that stage in

803
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,800
the shower.

804
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,040
And why do I picture you with microphone in hand this entire time?

805
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,040
I don't know.

806
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Yeah, well definitely.

807
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,960
I got a waterproof microphone, yeah, yeah.

808
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,200
And so I was thinking it'd be really cool if like, the scenario I came up with was a

809
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,360
beer tourie, because we, you know, we met folks that run their breweries on Linux.

810
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:39,880
I was thinking real world, local Washington implementations of Linux in their work environment,

811
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,640
something you know, not so much like, here's our Samba server, I mean that's cool, I mean

812
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,000
good on ya, but we can't really make a segment out of that.

813
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,280
But like if you got like a brewery running Linux or a farm running Linux, oh dude a farm

814
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,680
would be awesome.

815
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,000
Anything running Linux that we could go look at and shoot a segment for for last, I'd love

816
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,160
to do some on location stuff for last, just kind of kick things up a notch.

817
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,960
And then we would do like a meetup somewhere around there, and then that's when we do unplugged.

818
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,700
So we'd be like killing like, basically we take a Tuesday and just knock out unplugged

819
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,080
and a segment for last and just have a ton of fun.

820
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,080
I like that idea.

821
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,800
I think, I don't see any reason why we couldn't.

822
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,160
It's an example of some of the things I want to do, and there's some ways I want to facilitate

823
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:19,480
that, and I have some great ideas for 2014, but we really need folks' support, so if you

824
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:23,520
please click those affiliate links and grab those browser extensions, it helps us plan

825
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
for that kind of stuff.

826
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,520
Absolutely.

827
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,680
Otherwise we're going to have to start doing like a, you know, save the children PSAs and

828
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,680
stuff.

829
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,880
Today on Unplugged, instead of doing a show, we're just doing a pledge drive.

830
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,880
Seriously, yeah.

831
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,060
Just, we're just going to keep talking, we'll keep talking, you know what we'll do is we'd

832
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,120
talk about iPhones until people pledged, and then when people pledged, we could talk about

833
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,640
Linux, and then once the like timer had run out, we'd have to go back to iPhones.

834
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,080
Basically a torture technique.

835
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,440
Or it has us like rummaging around various dumpsters looking for food because you guys

836
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,120
aren't supporting us with our, yeah, I mean.

837
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:56,880
Yeah, we take last and convert it into a dumpster diving, dumpster diving action show.

838
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,880
Okay.

839
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
Hey, this could run Linux.

840
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,880
He sees out of the dumpster, right?

841
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,880
Oh my gosh.

842
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,880
Okay.

843
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,880
So it's up to you fellas.

844
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,880
We'll see.

845
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,880
We'll see what happens.

846
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:05,880
We'll see where it shakes out, man.

847
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,880
All right.

848
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,000
So I've been an Arch user for over a year now and I, and it's basically because of the

849
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,280
awesomeness of make package and make and PKG.

850
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,000
The problem I'm having is that I can't find a desktop environment I like.

851
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Here's why.

852
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I'm a typical user.

853
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I'm not a typical user.

854
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I don't think.

855
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,760
I spend 99% of my day jumping between terminal and web browser.

856
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,400
I don't like messing with my desktop.

857
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,720
I want to look decent, but basically out of the box and get out of the way.

858
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,600
I'm using Cinnamon right now, but I've tried elementary OS after your review and I really

859
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,760
like Pantheon.

860
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,000
Based on this, I'm leaning towards installing elementary and running Arch in a VM.

861
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,360
That said, he says, cause he maintains a couple of packages in the AUR.

862
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,480
Good on you, Matthew.

863
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,440
He said, that said, there are still some apps I require the latest versions of like Gex

864
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,680
and get, I'm sorry, and Tmux.

865
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,920
So I'm planning on just compiling the latest versions of those myself on site like elementary.

866
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,120
I realized this may not work for everyone, but the, for the dev ops, for dev ops, sys

867
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:04,020
admins like myself, who don't like to waste time tweaking the desktop, it's becoming the

868
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,020
ideal solution.

869
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,040
I mean, I think we kind of zeroed in and that's who elementary OS would be good for.

870
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,920
The part I don't agree with is, I mean, it sounds like maybe he needs like, you know,

871
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,760
Exmonad or awesome window manager.

872
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,760
I mean, it kind of does.

873
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,760
Yeah.

874
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,960
And that might be something for him to explore as well.

875
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,320
And I'd also chime in on the whole Arch in a VM, just do yourself a favor and do a separate

876
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,320
partition.

877
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
Honestly, you'll be so much happier.

878
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,560
Especially when you're doing from the AUR, you need to build, right?

879
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:30,000
I just, I have building in a VM is like, Oh, and just Arch in a VM in general, just getting

880
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
it set up.

881
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,840
It's actually massively simpler on a partition than it is in a VM.

882
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
Is it based on my experience?

883
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:42,400
LXDE, we've got a recommendation from Ick in the chat room that LXDE would be good.

884
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:48,280
I guess, I think that, I think that really I'm still, so I switched back to Gnome for

885
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,360
a couple of hours this week and decided to go back to KDE because KDE is, yeah, you know,

886
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,920
with all the extensions, I had, I had extension problems again and I just felt like, you know,

887
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,760
with KDE I can make it be what I want.

888
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,260
And even if it takes a little bit of tweaking.

889
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:07,080
So I think, I honestly think, I do see how the, maybe try to just experiment with getting

890
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,640
the Pantheon desktop running under Arch.

891
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,040
I know there's people out there working on that and see if that gets you where you want.

892
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,320
Then try out elementary OS.

893
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
Sure.

894
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
All right.

895
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,320
Jonathan writes in regarding windows.

896
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,000
I'm not sure where this fits, but I just wanted to send it to you guys.

897
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,600
I'm more or less left on windows in the windows world.

898
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,240
And I've been stuck in the XP era.

899
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,920
Every time I had to take a quick trip into the Microsoft pool, it left me with shivers,

900
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,340
viruses, stupid gooey's and infinite reboot bonanzas.

901
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,560
And he's come to an epiphany.

902
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:36,260
He said, I think I finally understand why windows has ruled the enterprise desktops

903
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,740
for so long, despite all of the shortcomings he just listed.

904
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:46,000
He says, I'm interning at a large IT company, which means someone else does all the rebooting

905
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,520
virus scans and whatnot.

906
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,040
In that setting, windows is very usable.

907
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,880
Only the bad UI is left to deal with.

908
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,880
And of course, IE.

909
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,920
And he's got a great point because in enterprise, IT pulls their hair out with all the problems

910
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,920
windows has.

911
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,920
And then the end users all la dee da dee da circus music's going on in their head.

912
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,920
They don't have a clue.

913
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,000
You know, early on was one of the motivations to getting windows out of my home is I, you

914
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,800
know, I, uh, I can't, I can't remember what OS Andrew's on.

915
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:14,640
I mean, this is probably windows 2000 before I switched her to, uh, open SUSE and KDE.

916
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,640
And I just, you know, I come home and she'd have windows problems, printing problems.

917
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,600
And I was just like, oh yeah, no, I don't want any more of this.

918
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,120
And for me, it was like, I was literally, I I'd already been running Linux for some

919
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,800
time, but I went exclusive Linux when I found out that I think it was a win FS.

920
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,240
You know, I was looking forward to that file system with all the neat features they're

921
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,420
babbling about.

922
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,880
That wasn't going to happen.

923
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,400
I'm like, that's it.

924
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,960
If I hear the word NTFS one more time, I'm going to shoot something.

925
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,960
I just, I couldn't handle it.

926
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,440
He also, uh, he needs some advice from you, Matt.

927
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,600
He says, I've been forced, uh, through this company to use internet Explorer exclusively.

928
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,100
I'm in need of some therapeutic tips to get that dirty feeling off me when the workday

929
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,100
is over.

930
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,100
Any advice?

931
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,240
Uh, kill it with fire.

932
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,080
Um, that's the first I actually burn.

933
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,800
Yeah, like get, try and find like an old IE five CD, you know, they used to come in packages,

934
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,800
get some of those, light them on fire, do a barbecue.

935
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,800
You know, that could help.

936
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,160
You know, I don't know, man.

937
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
That's, that's tough.

938
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,880
Spend some quality time with candlelit, candlelit Mozilla, you know, just kind of get it around

939
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,000
your monitor, get some, uh, Barry White going, you know, what I would do honestly too is

940
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,600
like sometimes you need to like relive how bad it used to be in IE land.

941
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,360
So like go like find a VM of like windows 98 with like three or something and then live

942
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,320
that for a day and then be like, wow, this new IE is great.

943
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,320
Great.

944
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,920
And it's not, that's the horrible part.

945
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:32,480
Uh, Kiwi in the chat room says that, uh, he could just drink heavily.

946
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,480
That could also.

947
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,480
Yeah, that works.

948
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,480
Yeah.

949
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,480
And the beer goggles in IE is looking pretty good.

950
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,480
Yeah.

951
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,480
There you go.

952
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,920
Uh, so we, we had an email that came in from Ritison, who is a Manjaro Linux user and he

953
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,360
wanted to talk about SteamOS versus Ubuntu Edge.

954
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,200
I started to get through it and he, you know, I was going to read it cause he says blast

955
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,760
is my favorite podcast of all time.

956
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,760
He looks forward to it every week.

957
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,280
And I thought, well, okay, I got to read this guy.

958
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,280
Strong.

959
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,280
Yeah.

960
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,280
Right.

961
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,280
But it's very long.

962
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,840
Uh, but what he says is he thinks it's an interesting correlation to look at sort of the, um, big

963
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,880
run up to Ubuntu Edge and then the court of immediate drop off where his valve is sort

964
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,800
of taken this different approach where they've started, um, very small, you know, make this

965
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,800
work better.

966
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,180
Uh, like Gabe called it the sweater, um, the sweater approach where they pull us one thread

967
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,320
and then just leads to the next red means the next thread and they've been making those

968
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,260
things better, whereas canonical is kind of like put everything out there, let's go, let's

969
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,260
do this by it.

970
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,440
We don't even have all the bits done yet.

971
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,340
Not all the infrastructure done yet, but if you, if you commit to this week, we can try,

972
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,720
we can get, try to get it done.

973
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,920
Uh, he says that he feels like, uh, that it requires large companies like valve who have

974
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,960
deep pockets to make this possible.

975
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,720
He says, I look forward to the crazy future of Linux, but I resent that it does take these

976
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,160
huge companies like Google and valve, you know, of course, Google with Android to push

977
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,160
her forward to public adoption sometimes.

978
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,880
However, I feel like Gabe understands that and respects the philosophy of open source

979
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,880
more than others.

980
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:55,480
And I actually use the word Linux on the steam OS announcement page, unlike certain popular

981
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,120
distro that makes no mention of Linux anywhere on their website or mobile OS, uh, I truly

982
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:05,880
feel steam OS is pure Linux's chance to gain market share and a user base.

983
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,920
It deserves, even if users are unaware that they're running it, which considering the

984
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,120
state of some computer users, knowledge comes to as no surprise, sorry for being so long,

985
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,280
but I'm really excited and keep up the great work.

986
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:23,040
A managerial user and you know, he's right, this could be, um, this could be like, uh,

987
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,040
this could, I don't know, I don't, I don't want to be too crazy, but you know, if you

988
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,840
look over history, the common platform eventually takes over.

989
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:36,760
Like you start with individual things like very purpose-built operating systems, very

990
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:40,280
purpose-built devices that really only do one thing.

991
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:45,280
And then as, as the general technology advances and becomes more powerful, uh, it just becomes

992
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,800
economically more viable to use that technology and to continue to create your own technology

993
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,280
every single time, uh, all, uh, you know, these individual platforms that we have now.

994
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,900
So it kind of, you know, I've always kind of seen a day and age where, um, these big

995
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,160
guys move on, Microsoft moves on, Apple moves on.

996
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,200
And what we're left with is a really healthy Linux ecosystem because Linux has kind of

997
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
taken over there.

998
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Linux kind of moves into mobile, Linux moves into the living room, Linux moves into the

999
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,880
desktop and over time it's on the server, it's on the cloud, it's on the work, you know,

1000
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:19,120
it's everywhere because as people leave that area or the, or the common generally available

1001
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:23,760
platform becomes good enough, it just becomes almost crazy not to use it.

1002
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,440
And uh, steam could be, steamOS could be the beginning of that takeover, not just from

1003
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,360
a Tivo standpoint, but from a really large scale deployment standpoint of, of an ecosystem

1004
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,000
where people are actually making money, people are actually developing and creating something

1005
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,600
of extreme value.

1006
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,120
And I'm, I'm really, really, really excited that it's Valve doing it and I'm, I'm really

1007
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,880
interested to see the kind of opportunities we're going to have in last to cover this

1008
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,320
because there's tons of potential for them to screw this thing up royally.

1009
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,320
Oh yes, yes there is.

1010
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,320
Right?

1011
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,560
And we're going to be there to watch that happen if that does happen, but there's also

1012
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,600
opportunities for like, what's the best way to build out a steam rig?

1013
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,000
What's the cheapest steam rig you can buy?

1014
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,920
What's the nicest steam rig you can build?

1015
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,840
You know, it's endless possibilities, endless possibilities.

1016
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,280
And then just watching adoption as well, because as we all know, uh, computers are nothing

1017
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,520
more than how do I accomplish blank?

1018
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,080
We really, most people don't really pay a lot of attention to what the OS is.

1019
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,240
It's how do I do this?

1020
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,240
How do I do that?

1021
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,240
How do I Skype?

1022
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,240
How do I browse the web?

1023
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,240
How do I send an email?

1024
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,240
How do I game?

1025
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,240
And Valve is going to be sending the game.

1026
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:29,540
And what I like about that is it's totally solving that problem at the same time.

1027
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:33,240
Like you could be completely checked out of the whole steam ecosystem.

1028
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,300
You could never buy a title.

1029
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,960
You can never use steam OS.

1030
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,720
You're still getting better kernel X.

1031
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,160
You're still getting better Nvidia Y.

1032
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,240
You're still getting all of these improvements that they're making that are going to hit

1033
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,560
the rest of general Linux.

1034
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:49,560
And that to me is also sort of like this everybody wins scenario here.

1035
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,560
If it's successful.

1036
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,560
Right?

1037
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,560
I think it will be.

1038
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,960
I think, and I think the advantage they have is that they don't have the pressures that

1039
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,920
say Apple or Microsoft have from shareholders.

1040
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,600
Now that's not, I don't know what steam, I don't know what Valve's exact corporate structure

1041
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
is.

1042
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,760
Last time I checked, I think they're privately held, which is if they are to stay that way,

1043
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,880
you'll be happier because it's less headaches and you can go long game.

1044
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,560
If once you go, once you go public, you're short game.

1045
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,920
And so that limits your options.

1046
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,360
So yes, I think in the long run they will be successful.

1047
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,400
It may not happen all at once and may, they may have some bumps in the road.

1048
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,720
They may even have some costly mistakes, but I think because they're taking that sweater

1049
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,000
approach, it's going to work out for them.

1050
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Yeah.

1051
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Cause they're doing all of the really, you know, low level grunt work that has to be

1052
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,520
done first and not just building the flashy presentation on top of all of that first.

1053
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:37,120
Like they're doing the stuff that, you know, general consumers will never, ever, ever give

1054
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,400
them credit for.

1055
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,720
It's not sexy.

1056
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:43,360
It's not going to win them over in, you know, the, in the general consumer markets.

1057
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,680
Only the stuff that us Linux nerds care about, but it shows that they're taking the right

1058
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,680
approach.

1059
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,240
And here's something they won't do that Google did.

1060
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,320
We've talked about how Android basically sold their souls to get themselves on various mobile,

1061
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,280
with various mobile carriers and various phones.

1062
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,400
And of course the carriers or the phones themselves would be bastardized with all the software

1063
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,400
and stuff.

1064
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,400
Valve won't do that.

1065
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,040
The Valve stuff will remain here.

1066
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,040
I believe that through and through that anyone they hook up with, they're not going, you're

1067
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:11,160
not going to see lots of, Hey, get this new, you know, lots of the little icons appearing

1068
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,160
all over your screen or any of that.

1069
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
It's going to be great.

1070
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,160
It's going to be really solid.

1071
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,240
Wouldn't it be interesting to like, if Roku eventually rolled out a steam box, cause if

1072
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,320
they can take the platform and they just have to put up, you know, you could have the Roku

1073
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:26,360
maybe in three years, the Roku XL is got a, you know, a really good graphics processor

1074
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,480
in it and it has the steam, steam OS on it or something like that.

1075
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,480
I think so.

1076
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,120
Well, and just to look historically at Roku and I'm probably partially correct on this

1077
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:39,240
and I think I am, if I remember correctly, the guys behind Roku are actually the guys

1078
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,920
behind replay TV.

1079
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,920
These guys know what they're doing.

1080
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,200
And Roku is Linux based already.

1081
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,440
Yeah, it is Linux based and they, and they got it right.

1082
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,760
So I think that, yeah, if they did hook up with Roku, that would be very wise of them.

1083
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,760
Anybody could.

1084
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,080
I mean, you could just take, I mean, if the boxy box was to come around, say that, you

1085
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,920
know, we, the boxy box guys time traveled to the future and created their product.

1086
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,880
Why not base boxy box on the steam box and if you could, you know, maybe if there's a

1087
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,640
way to do video and all that kind of stuff, because sure, then you just get the advantage

1088
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,640
of the steam library.

1089
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:08,640
It's like, it's, it's like when you ship an Android tablet, you want to be able to put

1090
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,640
the play store on there.

1091
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
It's bingo.

1092
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,640
Exactly.

1093
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,640
All right, Matt.

1094
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,080
Well, I think that'll wrap us up for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

Oh yes.

1102
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,200
On Sunday and we will be doing some more steamOS coverage and following that as well.

1107
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,000
Hey, by the way, calendar page has been updated.

You can now select your time zone on the freaking calendar page.

1109

Pow.

1110
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,640
Makes it super easy.

1111
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,840
Anywhere in the world, not just US.

1112
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
That's right.

1113
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840
Hey Matt, have a great week.

1114
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,840
I'll see you on Sunday.

1115
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,840
Sounds good.

1116

See you then.

1117
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,840
All right, everyone.

1118
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,840
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1119
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,960
We'll be back here next week.
