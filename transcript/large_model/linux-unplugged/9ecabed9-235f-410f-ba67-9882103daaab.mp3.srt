1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
See valve has a new VR headset

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,180
Yeah, yeah your VR is dead it was never living ouch

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:17,180
All right. Well, I can use it today when we have a VR headset and my wife is sat there like in some

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,840
Stupid jewel popping game or something in 3d on the sofa and we never speak to each other anymore because she's got this fucking stupid

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,600
Or maybe it's the other way around and it's me. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know though

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,560
I felt that way too, and then I got an oculus and I changed my mind

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,200
Yeah, the thing about VR is I can remember going down to Piccadilly Circus in like

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,280
1992

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,080
1993 when I was a student and put in this, you know

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,740
15 pound headset on my head and paying five quid to romp around in some line art

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:00,880
3d world and it was kind of interesting and kind of impressive for the day, but ultimately

12
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,900
Yeah, just something. Yeah, but now you could have one in your house, right?

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,740
So that's one big difference is the opportunity cost of you playing with it is you picking it up on your head, right? Yeah, the the

14
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,940
Hardware will be lighter and will fit your head better despite you having a massive

15
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,420
All true all true gonna torpedo torpedo you in however keep going

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:29,120
Go and keep making a big target for yourself. There is also the fact that you can now get immersed in games

17
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:35,140
Like well, let's pick an easy target Minecraft where you can spend six hours

18
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:41,940
Yeah, Minecraft. Yeah, big targets getting bigger and bigger. It's easier to shoot. Go on then go on then shoot me down

19
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,940
What's wrong with sitting there playing?

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,020
Minecraft is the same the VR today is sexier hardware and sexier graphics

21
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,340
But it's the same shit. We were doing 20 years ago. It hasn't actually moved the needle, right?

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,820
But it's just the same stuff 20 years ago. It was it was the the Nintendo Virtual Boy. That was no no

23
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,060
I'm talking about the stuff you could you could stroll into and use but but think about it

24
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,220
What about VR now the graphics are better the headsets are lighter

25
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,740
The resolution is higher, but it's the same

26
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,860
It's the same experience that they're trying to sell us that we were we were looking at 20 years ago. Just a bit better

27
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Right. They were interesting

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,020
They were they were way ahead of their time back then well

29
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,580
Why aren't we now? Why aren't we thinking? Why aren't we 20 years ahead of the time now?

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,820
Why aren't we why haven't we got things that are pushing the envelope?

31
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,460
They're a bit shit and a bit rubbish because we haven't got the hardware and the equipment to to deliver

32
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,260
Okay, I want to do 20 years from now

33
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,260
I'm just improving on what we were already doing 20 years ago

34
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,060
They're rubbish by the by the end of next year by the end of 2016

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,420
So we'll get the first gen ones out first gen being oculus second gen being valve

36
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
We'll get these ones out of the way this year

37
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,140
Next year, you'll go on Alibaba and be able to buy cheap

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,540
commodity VR headsets super cheap

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,600
I mean, come on and what are you gonna what are you gonna do with it?

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,920
Well by then there'll be shitloads of games in Steam because valve are bringing them to market

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,940
Yeah, a shitload of shit games is what I envisage is what it's gonna look like 18 months from now, right?

42
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,840
but I can sit on my sofa and I can be immersed in a game and

43
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,420
My kids can be watching TV. Well, whatever game it could be Minecraft

44
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,560
You can't say that shit 20 million nine-year-olds can't be wrong

45
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,240
When I've played it, I'll let you know whether I think it's shit or not. Oh, you haven't played it yet. No, never

46
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,180
Apparently it's like Lego, but I actually do Lego in real life

47
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,840
Your fingers hurt and my I've been playing Minecraft all day and my fingers don't have well, okay

48
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,140
so I've spent the weekend helping to build a 20 foot tall rocket out of

49
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,340
Three hundred and thirty thousand pieces of Lego, right?

50
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
Compete with that

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,140
Shit well what I've built millions of people could come by and and

52
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:16,180
See my server and drop by and help and contribute yours is a photo on a on a dead social network Google Plus

53
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,940
That nobody's ever gonna see yeah

54
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,840
But then again the whole of North Hampshire community is involved engaged in building this absolutely epic rocket out of Lego

55
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,320
Which right is the real world and it's real 3d and everything and the definition you wouldn't believe the quality of the graphics

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,440
It's like it might be analog, but it's really good

57
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,200
Can you check? Can you change the theme? Can you change the skin? Yeah

58
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,880
Yeah, we're doing at the moment in red white and blue

59
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
But you know you could do it in just black and white or you could do it in puce

60
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,880
Cyan and yellow if you really wanted to but you'd have to rebuild it. You couldn't just press a button and make it

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,400
Yeah, yeah, but think about have you ever imagined what it would be like to tip over a 20-foot?

62
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,800
Rocket out of three hundred thirty thousand bricks of Lego. I mean just imagine

63
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,440
Have you ever wondered what it's like to blow up a house with TNT? I mean

64
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,780
No, that hasn't crossed my mind this happens you're not as deranged as I thought you were with me you really are

65
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,580
I'm disappointed

66
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,580
What about the Microsoft?

67
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,340
Microsoft hollow lens where they're gonna overlay over your environment now come on that is kind of useful because

68
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,000
You just like take something simple like you're taking a part of PC

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,580
And you open up the case and maybe all of a sudden you could have outlays of like here's all the tickets ever assigned

70
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,020
To this PC. Here's your company inventory information about it this video cards stuff like that hollow lens

71
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,460
Maybe that's real. So so what you're describing there is augmented reality. I believe that's the buzzword. Is that right? Yeah

72
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,340
Wow, you sound like an old man Wimpy. Hey, well, I'm an old man. I've got gray hairs and everything

73
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,780
Um, I think augmented reality has got far more mileage than VR, frankly

74
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,500
Now, you know see in Microsoft's world. They also have the ability

75
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,300
So I think in anything that's gonna be successful today. You got to have a whole ecosystem

76
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,700
You got to have like you got to have app partners like Netflix. You're gonna have to have they have Skype

77
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,180
They have an app store that universal applications that people write for Windows 10 and the phones also work on hollow lens

78
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,740
somehow, I

79
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,260
Mean so they even have the ecosystem to back it up. I

80
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,420
Think when it comes to augmented reality

81
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,100
It's easier to do as well

82
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,300
honestly, so not the full integrated thing, but actually just the

83
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:39,700
Basic level of you know, you have something that identifies the product that you're looking at in a in a in a store

84
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,900
Yeah, speaking of minecraft. Here's here's minecraft in your living room using hollow lens. I don't think this is ever gonna happen

85
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,660
this is Microsoft isn't Microsoft has never been able to pull this kind of thing off and

86
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,300
It's just like this isn't really gonna happen. This is a surface table all over again. Yeah, it's yes

87
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,280
This is not gonna happen. It's the surface exactly. This is the table. This is the table all over again

88
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,140
or

89
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,380
there's gonna be the three leading ones like as I said Microsoft valve and

90
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,340
Facebook and then there'll be loads of

91
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,220
Cheap and cheerful knockoff Chinese ones next year. I guarantee

92
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
Sources where in this

93
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,580
yeah, and

94
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,100
What are you actually going to do with these things? That's that's the other thing. I just don't see what the purpose is

95
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,940
so so I imagine that I would be able to see a 3d render of Chris's studio and

96
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm sat here at home with my goggles on while I'm listening to him doing

97
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:51,220
You're describing the Internet when it was sold to us in 1994 right now, that's true. This is a Unix system

98
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:59,540
I know this, you know, it is exactly it's 3d and I want 3d and I want to be able to while we were working around this

99
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,740
Virtual cyberspace back in the mid 90s. I had some great demos, didn't they remember the Sun Microsystem demos where you have doing up?

100
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,940
Oh, man, you know what Chris?

101
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,180
I actually worked at Sun Microsystem and helped create some of those demos back in the day. Those are good

102
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,940
I wanted to live in that virtual world. I would never have to leave my house. I

103
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,340
Go to the mall and and at malls online stores weren't websites

104
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,180
They were represented as virtual reality first-person stores

105
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:35,280
You're gonna want and think how how out of date was that because look back what people were trying to create was a 3d

106
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,780
Representation of a shop that you would walk around in the same

107
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Inefficient manner that you walk around a real shop. Yeah to do your shopping

108
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,620
It was so backward thinking a second life game is as close to that as possible. Yeah

109
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,020
Yeah, well, it's how we approach everything when we bring it into a new era

110
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,540
You know we we we we kind of put like all our the old way of looking at things out

111
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,740
And then as new people come along they they shake that stuff

112
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,300
Yeah, the two industries that are gonna push this are the same two industries that you're gonna push this

113
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,980
Oh, come on, baby. Go and get your credit card out. Tell it. Tell us what it is. You subscribe to the two things that you

114
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,540
buy are

115
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,780
Games and porn. Yeah, we go

116
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,460
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that honestly still feeling a little nostalgic

117
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,840
My name is Chris and my name is Matt and Matt. So we had last week

118
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,260
We had a show that was pre done for us because we were taking some time off during the beard apocalypse and during the scale

119
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,040
Coverage which we're gonna do a little bit more of in today's episode couple of interviews

120
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,860
One that I put back in the rotation based on a request from an audience member because it's for a really great cause and

121
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,140
One that really blew me away

122
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,420
I didn't expect to ever feature an interview on the Linux action show or Linux unplugged from this company

123
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,260
but Noah got it and we found out they use a lot more Linux than we expected and then also there's a

124
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,020
Really in-depth discussion with an Ubuntu representative at one of at the Ubuntu booth

125
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,340
so we'll play those coming up in the show a little bit and then also

126
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,580
After all of that

127
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,020
I'm gonna pick wimpy's ear on all of the developments going on with the Ubuntu Mate project

128
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Some of their news and also just maybe any mate updates in general and some other stuff

129
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
So Matt, we got a lot of ground to cover

130
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,860
Good stuff. We got you know, we got to get down to business. So I thought first there's just a couple of like

131
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,540
Speaking of being nostalgic. There's just a couple things. I wanted to touch on the first one before we get into the main show. I

132
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Don't know if this makes you feel old or what?

133
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
on this day in

134
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:57,700
1999 March 3rd 2015. Yeah, it's March guys. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. It's March

135
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,400
Gnome 1.0 was released on March 3rd 1999

136
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,820
Slash that headline goes as follows or blurb

137
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,220
Gnome 1.0 is now released for download

138
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,020
Please pursue the pursue the press release and then download it via a convenient FTP mirror

139
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,860
And then they also say and I forgot about this extension and then they have this update

140
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:24,700
The next the next day forgot to plug my own program if you've installed no more want scrolling slash dot headlines in your panel

141
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,500
Check under applets amusement slash app Wow

142
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,580
You know why I was reading them in between that, you know, cuz I had to stock my compound up for Y2K and all that

143
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,340
So I was you know busy with all that sort of stuff. That was a bit that year was the busy year

144
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,700
Alright, so let's bring in the mumble room time appropriate greetings mumble room

145
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:53,340
Good evening anybody in here old enough to actually remember the release of Gnome 1.0. I'm not gonna say

146
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
Yeah, I am old enough and also

147
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:09,220
Dare I say it that it was much easier to compile KDE back then so I was a KDE user back back in those days

148
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,220
Oh

149
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:18,020
Good times good times, you know what it makes me think of it makes me it makes me think of KD as well because that

150
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,740
Was actually a hardcore KD user back and back in those days. So it actually made me think of the same thing

151
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,980
Alright, so in the pre show which if you're listening on the download will probably be featured it in the post show

152
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,900
How about that for a little time travel? We got into a big discussion about smart watches and wearables

153
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,700
It's the big thing right now, you know next week's the Apple watch event and a pebbles got their Kickstarter going right now

154
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,900
which I

155
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,800
Think I'm totally gonna back and Poby just back during the pre show

156
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,800
But nobody's been talking about what the Firefox OS is doing watch wise

157
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:56,140
So I found this article over at Linux gizmo's pocket watch a pocket watch that runs Firefox OS

158
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,340
Screw putting on your wrist check this thing out with its slick sexy wood style. It's got a

159
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,460
Japanese style wood that's beautiful

160
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,940
and it has a camera built-in right it's got a metal ring around the front and

161
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,100
You can hold it kind of like a smooth pebble

162
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,980
It's a dish shape fits in the palm of one's hand and the round screen is fairly small

163
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,620
But if you it appears to be probably larger than most Android wear devices like the moto 360

164
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,120
Look at that. What do you know? I don't know, you know, I'm I almost want to say I'm skeptical

165
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,860
No, it actually sounds pretty cool. It does sound pretty cool

166
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,980
I'd had it's one of the things I'd want to actually try before I could really give a proper judgment

167
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,860
But it sounds different sounds pretty cool. So yeah, I don't know

168
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,500
Little skeptical. Yeah, I am very skeptical

169
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,420
Just

170
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,120
Does everybody have to be doing this really?

171
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,420
Like can we all do we all have to be doing this can can some of us just focus on one thing and just do

172
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,560
One thing right?

173
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,900
That would be nice. Don't ask poppy because apparently Ubuntu can't oh, yeah, I

174
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,260
Get you know, your guys's pre-show got me all riled up. I'm all fired up now

175
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,380
It's like they were really going at it now. I'm all I'm all ready to go

176
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,820
Which kind of while I'm at it, I'll take it. I'll take it just a quick shot at wimpy

177
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,880
Just a real quick one wimpy now. I got to give a thumbs down to the Amazon fire TV thumbs down

178
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,660
I I mean I wanted to love a Linux running rig like like no other but in my

179
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,740
Estimation for the money the Roku 3 is the much better by it is

180
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,700
so I heard you I heard you hint that you are not impressed with my

181
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,220
recommendation on on unplugged I think

182
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:48,980
Yeah, maybe it's a geographical thing because I think you're more spoiled in the US with online

183
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,980
You know media services I give you a basic here's a basic bar. There's first of all, there's no Jupiter broadcasts now, right?

184
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,220
No, there's that there's a dedicated Roku app now you could sideload it now

185
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,780
See a big part of my complaints are if you sideload most the apps it solves most of the problems

186
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:11,180
But I just find the Amazon app selection to be extremely limited. It's like I have three apps maybe that I like four apps

187
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,700
Yeah, that's why I sideload almost everything. I have a really great GUI a sideloader

188
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,780
Oh, I think so. I think this is where the difference is. So you have to sideload things to get what you would consider

189
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,140
normal service

190
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,060
Whereas in the UK what we would consider a complete service is available

191
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,100
Through the App Store, which is where it differs from the Roku. Hmm

192
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:41,220
Well, I also feel like the Roku kind of has a much more freewheeling open community where anyone can contribute

193
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,260
With us certainly true. Yeah, and I so I like that aspect of it a bit, too. I

194
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,140
Don't know. I just I mean it's they're both at the end of the day

195
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,340
Ding-ding. I'm trying to try not to say that anymore, but the end of the day

196
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,140
They both will play my Plex files. They've you both can you can sideload Kodi on them

197
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,620
All right on about the Roku, but you can sideload Kodi on the fire. So that's good

198
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,460
I mean that gives it a major plus in my book

199
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,020
But the thing I really like about the Roku is it does feel

200
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,460
It's a little bit faster to get just to what I want. There's less stuff. They're trying to sell me like all the prime stuff

201
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,700
It's all up in my face and then also

202
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,420
That there's a Jupiter broadcasting app, which is really nice. I

203
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,940
Would go so far because I have both I have the stick for for the Amazon situation, but it's the same same experience

204
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,500
I do feel like Amazon's experience is very much like a gigantic ad being blasted in my face the entire time

205
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,940
No question about that sideloading just to get it to work even remotely usable

206
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,660
That being said when you actually get into something like Plex or whatnot Roku feels painfully dated

207
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,660
Painfully dated. I mean just really bad. Although that is changing. It's actually got a new thing coming out

208
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,860
Yeah, they do there is a Plex update coming for the Roku but still not gonna be as nice as the fire then and you

209
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,300
Know the the Netflix app on the fire TV supports multiple profiles, but on the Roku it doesn't

210
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,460
No, it does now it doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't know I'm not in the UK. It doesn't

211
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,260
Oh, okay, so it doesn't work on the Roku

212
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,940
Yeah, so anyways working on a thing so maybe you know, we're playing a bit of catch-up enough

213
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,980
Yeah, I would say VPN is your friend. I think if you live in a region where you're not services that we have there

214
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:17,620
Yeah, maybe I mean I you might even get different firmwares for all I know that she has different may even different menus

215
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,180
Either way, I that was just my roundabout way to say that they're both good devices

216
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,660
They both run Linux, of course, but I wasn't quite sure that I was going to be able to do that

217
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:34,460
But I wasn't crazy impressed with with fire TV. I'm not crazy impressed with Firefox's attempt here

218
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,700
I mean, I'm totally willing to give it a go. Maybe it's not even the Mozilla project

219
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,380
So I literally just found this before the show just to talk to you guys about it

220
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,220
I kind of like if I if I step back and thought about it being possible

221
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,980
You know, you could think about maybe putting a GSM connection in this thing

222
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,460
You know if there was a way if there was a way to really kind of

223
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,860
Make this thing connected. So it was a true true legitimate computer

224
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,220
That would be that would be kind of interesting then you might have my attention

225
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,260
But I just I don't think you could put the horsepower or the battery life in it to pull it off yet

226
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,980
Maybe one day maybe you got to start somewhere right guys

227
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,940
Speaking of starting somewhere. I'll tell you where I'm gonna start right now

228
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,380
Let's start with our first sponsor this week and that's ting

229
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,040
Now this is a great time to move to ting because ting is rolling out the open beta to their GSM network

230
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,800
And you remember our buddy chase from how to Linux and he's actually been on Linux unplugged a couple times

231
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,220
He is setting up a pretty sophisticated security system and he said, you know what, you know

232
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,160
It's something you've never mentioned but a great use for ting is

233
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,380
Remote systems that need internet connectivity, but don't use a lot of data

234
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,940
They send off reports or they do a nightly upload like once a night or a weekly thing

235
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,180
He said tings perfect for this. He says I looked around I said I could buy some prepaid things

236
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:56,860
I had different routes to go but tings flat six dollars a month then just pay for what you use and I don't need any

237
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,060
voicemail and

238
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,940
He has the thing you can send the SMS text messages and then do image uploads and video uploads

239
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,700
And so he just when it needs to send a text message a couple of times a month

240
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,860
He pays for the text and it's like nothing. It's like nothing

241
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,220
It's so great and there's no early termination fee if he wants to turn it off because there's no contract

242
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,660
It's a really cool service

243
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:23,640
And in fact, if you go over to linux.ting.com, you can take advantage of the Linux unplugged discount and support the Linux unplugged podcast

244
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,580
It's a great way to say hey, I heard about this on unplugged. I really appreciate you helping them stay on the air

245
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,620
So go to linux.ting.com like $25 off your first device and then you can go grab like this ting GSM card

246
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,100
And this is cool because it's a pre-cut to multiple different sizes

247
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,720
So you grab this one thing and it fits in your various different devices

248
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,680
Ting also just added the moto G for $91. This is unbelievable. This is

249
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,320
Unbelievable phone for $91 and you get it with no contract. It's unlocked. It's yours $6

250
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,920
Go to linux.ting.com. Here's a here's another ride you could go

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,320
These novatel mi-fi devices. This is like internet in your pocket $6 for this mi-fi hotspot

252
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,840
It's tri-band LTE you get the signal coverage right there

253
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,260
This is a great way to go

254
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,760
And then of course if you want to spend just a little bit more just a few dollars more you can get the net gear

255
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,160
with the LED

256
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,320
Screen and it gives you the touch interface and all that kind of stuff

257
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,400
They've also now got the Kyocera hydrovibe

258
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:29,900
Which is a slick phone as well as the LG g3 the Nexus 5 the iPhones the Galaxy tab and the iPhone 6 and 6

259
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,860
plus

260
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,360
Unlocked and all yours including the HTC m8 go to linux.ting.com

261
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,640
Linux.ting.com try out their savings calculator give it a try see what you might save you'd be surprised

262
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,300
But your actual usage in there and then also check out the ting blog like right now

263
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,400
They're talking about like their customer service demands right now with their new GSM rollout, but also

264
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,720
Some changes in the sprint network, which they're dealing with and updating customers on their blog

265
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,480
And you can read more about it ting is really great about updating their customers

266
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,580
It's a great way to go because they have an incredible control panel no hold customer service

267
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,160
You only pay for what you use unlocked phones

268
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,520
I mean, it's just like it's just it's a really great way to go and like one of the things that I constantly

269
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,000
Constantly mentioned because it's just so damn useful is every phone just has hotspot and tethering

270
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,240
It's just part of the plan like it's just not like they don't try to trick you into some sort of gimmicky plan where you

271
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,680
Have to pay more you just turn it on and have it and I think about with the T with the GSM network now

272
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,880
Coming online for those of us who have devices like you know many of the multi-sim devices

273
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,360
But the Nexus 5 is one of them you now have the advantage to switch between

274
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,160
GSM or CDMA now you're gonna have to figure out how to do that and make sure you can manage in the tin control panel

275
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
And they're gonna have more information on that soon

276
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,040
You can switch between whichever area has the better service and then turn on the hotspot or tethering and you're just paying for the data usage

277
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,400
That's pretty slick

278
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,920
Linux dot ting comm go check them out and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

279
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,680
I hope you guys are kicking butt keep up the good work

280
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,360
Okay, so then there was one more thing

281
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,240
I wanted to discuss with the with the panel because there's a there's a piece of software

282
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,420
We've talked a lot about on the Linux unplugged show

283
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:15,200
And I think a fair amount of us on the show have used it for at least different periods of time if not extensively

284
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
bit torrent sync

285
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
new version announced today

286
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,120
They're rolling out bit torrent sync Pro or just call it sync if you're hip

287
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,160
$40 a year

288
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay

289
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,600
This this is they say as they bring the beta to an end

290
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,120
They're exiting beta as sync 2.0 comes out bit torrent is introducing a business focused pro tier starting at

291
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,600
$39.99 per year per user not per device

292
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,960
But per user to date there have been over 10 million downloads of the alpha and beta versions of sync generating 145

293
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,720
petabytes of data

294
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,320
According to the VP product management Eric pounds in an interview at TechCrunch the pro products $40 charge

295
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,400
They say is competitive when you compare it to Microsoft's

296
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,200
$90 for owner own cloud or what in our own cloud on one drive and the $99 for Dropbox

297
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:16,440
Here's the really big catch though the free edition if you don't pay the $40 per year for bit torrent sync now the free edition

298
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,480
limited to 10 folders

299
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,840
Unlimited in size in those 10 folders

300
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,400
So that means at the root level only 10 folders

301
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,600
So the other features of pro include control over folder permissions and ownership that can you can change at any time

302
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,520
Once you link all personal devices together via private editing all your shared folders available wherever you need them

303
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,320
Consume on-demand view contents of very large folders consume only the content you need and preserve the storage capacity

304
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,240
Which is useful especially say on mobile devices that is very useful

305
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,680
I use Dropbox. It's one of the reasons

306
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:56,200
I still use Dropbox very heavily selective sync and also adding private you get you get technical support like priority technical support

307
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
for the pro version

308
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,840
Limited to 10 folders now if you update to the new bit torrent sync 2.0

309
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,000
They just came out today boy, you know, I'm actually for now

310
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm okay with it, but I think in the future I might have to start looking at alternatives

311
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:18,080
I don't know. Hmm. I feel I don't know. It's a boy. I mean, I'm not I'm not real happy with it

312
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,400
I know that but I sure am getting sick of the beta label being used as an excuse for making bait and switches

313
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,680
Okay

314
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,480
Cuz here's what I feel like what happened is here everybody go out and implement our technology help us prove it out

315
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,000
Make sure we bang on the code, but also get hooked on our infrastructure

316
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,400
Yeah, and then oh by the way now now thanks that it's no longer beta

317
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,280
So now we get to charge. Oh, but we're also gonna remove functionality

318
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,360
right because see the problem is is I have like I

319
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,880
Have a folder for all the unfiltered supporter shows notes all the notes for all the unfiltered shows

320
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,920
Well that I share that folder out directly

321
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,960
So when you subscribe to that folder you get every shows notes in one folder

322
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,920
Well right now that'd be that's hundreds of folders, right?

323
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,040
So I would have to restructure the way I do all my sinks and put that in this it just doesn't work

324
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,680
It doesn't work at all for me. It's this sort of this totally breaks the way I use BitTorrent sync

325
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,520
Well, I also think it proves a good argument for other alternatives at some point, you know something

326
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,160
It's open source that you know is not as likely to do that to you in the future. But the same. Yeah, so I

327
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,440
Go ahead with it. I've I've been testing alternatives as I

328
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,440
a full back plan for bt-sync because this has been rumored for yeah for some months now

329
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,040
Yeah, and the only solution I found and this is for my personal

330
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,680
synchronization of files that can rival bt-sync in terms of volume of files and size of files is

331
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,280
cfile s e a f i l e

332
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:02,400
Right see see file comm which is an open source solution. I I can't get sync thing to scale up to

333
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:09,240
What I'm trying to do, but see file does but I don't know Chris whether it's going to work for your use case or not

334
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,880
So you'll have to give it a try and see how it works

335
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,600
because being able to just give out a key and then anybody just has that key and now is thinking is

336
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:25,560
Even though that that big long key is scary-looking the in in actual practice. That is so elegant

337
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,160
No links needed no names nothing to search right? Yeah

338
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,640
I don't even have to like go like give them an email address to the bittorrent sync program to send them an invite link

339
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,000
like I could just

340
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
instant message them a hash key and

341
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,640
It's just so nice and miss that I'm gonna miss that so much

342
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:49,160
So this that's the and that's a major problem with sync thing. That's the major major problem with sync thing

343
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,240
Is I just could not individually add every single person to my swarm and and sync thing

344
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,520
Even if you've got, you know, four or five laptops, you know shared between your family

345
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,600
Then it gets in a pickle just managing that few number of devices

346
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,400
So yeah sync thing

347
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:14,880
Really doesn't work so well once you get beyond a few devices the other nice thing about the way the bittorrent sync works is

348
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,880
essentially a CDN

349
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,240
Because there's as a few people grab the file they then see the rest of the other files

350
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,120
So it's I really like the way it distributes large media files

351
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,020
So I wonder if I bought the pro

352
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,200
which is pretty easy to justify as a business expense if the everyone else subscribing would have to have pro or if

353
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,120
or if they just get if they just get the advantage of

354
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,360
Me having pro so I can have more than ten folders. That's fine. I'll spend $40 for that. I

355
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,680
Think that's an important differentiator because even if it's in fact that they don't have to have pro now

356
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,760
What's to say six months down the road? They're like, hey, you know, we could really increase our revenue

357
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,240
Yeah, that's the problem on both ends to get to that many folders

358
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,160
Yeah, that's the question like on Dropbox, right?

359
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,380
If you have a really big folder both people on both ends of the Dropbox have to have more storage on their account

360
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,280
So I guess historically if we look at this based on their pattern of behavior

361
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,600
We know that they have no problem shafting you for a buck

362
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,760
So it may be good to look into some alternatives now before it becomes even more

363
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,180
Later, man, you're making me sad dude. I know giving you a sad you are you are

364
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:29,660
Because really this this this works so well for what I need because it doesn't it doesn't require any centralized cloud storage

365
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:36,820
You know, it distributes these large files each person acts as a seeder. It's it's just the publishing process

366
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,340
This would be true with most sync things with the publishing processes. I drop things in a folder

367
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:46,720
So I think going forward because realistically you pulling the plug on it just out of spite right now

368
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,580
It's just not realistic going forward keep things as they're going now do what you got to do to keep it up

369
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,700
But in the background begin looking at alternatives that you have to pull the trigger

370
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,740
You literally just basically you switch the tracks versus going. Oh my god

371
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:07,700
Daredevil and you had something you wanted to jump in with yes, pretty much. I was just wanted to point out that own cloud even though

372
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:13,060
It's currently not supporting and they didn't even set up as in the roadmap of setting

373
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:20,420
Let's say the clients can actually go and work as a central place as well the client itself, but they have federated own cloud

374
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,860
A hosting so you could have to own clouds communicating together

375
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,620
So I'm not sure how feasible would it be?

376
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,860
But then I would have to have like everybody in the unfiltered audience that wants to participate with an own cloud instance. Yeah, I

377
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,460
Mean, it's like the same way you have the client though

378
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:43,380
So if you instead think of it as if you had it locally installed instead of in a server, right?

379
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,220
And that's the federation you have well, that's pretty much what you already have which is a client right now and

380
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,060
Heaven's revenge you wanted to mention pure io

381
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,320
Yes, I found this little programmer application called pure io

382
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,260
a few days ago it is

383
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,780
Kind of a personalized vault that you use. There's no

384
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:13,180
Limitations on file size. It's got a built-in messenger. It's actually built from the same person who makes mini lock and crypto cat

385
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,820
Everything is encrypted and you will only have the key

386
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,300
It is interesting because it's only for you and I know that you can send

387
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,080
messages to people and I can send you a link to the file, but it's not much of a

388
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,080
synchronization sort of

389
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,740
R-sync or bit torrent sync type thing which kind of link all of your things together

390
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,300
But you do you can send files around and there is no limitation. It's limited by your

391
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:44,860
Upstream bandwidth or downstream bandwidth and whoever you send the messages to it's more of a

392
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
completely

393
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,560
Seems like it'd be a good collaborative like little back and forth

394
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:59,980
Families use it. I've been trying to use it with a few like one friend, but it's not very I can't exactly give a full

395
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:06,500
Recommendation based on only using it with one person. Okay, I might I might play around with it a bit

396
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:13,780
It looks and there's a Chrome extension you can add it's native which can be on Mac Windows or any Chrome

397
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,780
That you want. So here I owe

398
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,300
Platform here. I owe comm and I'll have a link in the show notes appear. I owe comm

399
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,200
Okay, wimpy you wanted to jump in on the own cloud sinking point

400
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,420
Yeah, I've tried own cloud through version five six seven and eight

401
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,140
On its eight seven, which what was out now eight is that the new one?

402
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:44,020
I was blessed. Yeah, and it's great for sinking, you know contacts and calendar and stuff like that

403
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:49,940
I've had good success in using it for that, but I've never really got it to work. Well with with large

404
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,540
volumes of file synchronization

405
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,820
And I've really tried I really want that to work because everyone keeps raving about it

406
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:06,260
And I don't think that I can be so unusual because it's just just me and some some data that I need to shunt around

407
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:13,000
The place but yeah, I just cut I can't get it to work for me reliably and the thing is is it sort of fails

408
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:20,680
Silently so you end up with all of your devices out of sync and then you have to sort of unpick the tangle

409
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,700
by hand

410
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,980
so

411
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,260
Yeah, yeah

412
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,580
No, it's a nose experienced quite a few problems with the file sink as well bit torrent sink has been a rock for me

413
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,240
So even more so than bit dropbox has been

414
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,320
Yeah, yeah, it's been super reliable for me. And that's why I'm so

415
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,960
Disappointed that yeah, you know, we hoped that it might become open source, but no they've gone the other way

416
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,920
Yeah, you know that's part of that's part of what feels like the bait-and-switch is they were kind of

417
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:58,160
You know, they danced around that oh, maybe yeah, we'll think about it. Now it feels like that was sort of a mislead

418
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,240
Feels a little bad lucky, you know, it feels good Linux fest Northwest and I'm the reason why I'm plucking this because I want

419
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,080
To meet you. I want to say hi to you or say hi to you again

420
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,480
If you made it before come say hi to Matt too. He'll be there right now. You're gonna make it right now

421
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,640
Oh, absolutely talk. I'm sure by then we'll have a few episodes of how to Linux out

422
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,240
So people have all kinds of things to talk to you about and we'll also have as much of the crew coming as possible

423
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
so it'd be great to see you and

424
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,880
We are in the process this week

425
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,280
Kind of like really locking in some plans

426
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,360
So if you'd like to be involved somehow or something to contribute email Angela at Jupiter broadcasting comm and let her know

427
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,960
And it's it's April 25th and 26 Bellingham, Washington Linux fest Northwest 2015. I think we should be considered a sponsor

428
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
You know, I'm gonna talk to them. I plug them like every week

429
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,000
Yeah, you should I don't want to see you guys there because I'm gonna be walking around a bit more

430
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,160
Will there be swag, you know, actually so there's a lot of stuff going on in there

431
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,520
Will there be swag, you know, actually, so this is something

432
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,080
Where we are talking about we're talking about doing a limited run Linux fest Northwest shirt

433
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,840
Because one of the things we want to do is offer reimbursement for some of the people that have to travel

434
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:12,240
because if you think about it like Chris Moore is on the is on the east coast, of course

435
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,120
Q5 and rotten corpse are on the east, right?

436
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,680
So it to bring to bring them in and Alan as well, although Alan I suspect will probably volunteer to fund himself

437
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,880
But I would offer to fund his trip as well all on the east to bring them over to Linux fest Northwest

438
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
And then to put them up in a room

439
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,440
For three days or whatever it's going to be

440
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,360
uh

441
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,520
Yeah, that's going to be a nightmare expense-wise

442
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,920
So yeah

443
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:41,920
We'll probably run a limited run Linux fest Northwest shirt to try to not only give you guys something unique for Linux fest that

444
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,920
We can have there which means we got to start it soon

445
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,600
But to also help

446
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,440
Raise funds to cover some of those costs. I don't think it would cover even half of it

447
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,200
But maybe we could who knows so we'll probably have more about that soon and i'll let you know

448
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,920
Well and speaking of doing something soon regarding Linux fest Northwest i've been going for many years

449
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,680
I'm actually originally from Bellingham. So i'm going to give you all some advice when it comes to hotels and motels start reserving immediately

450
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,040
Don't wait

451
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Yeah, get get in early because it will fill up so fast and you will be left with the places on the

452
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,160
The motels you might not want to stay in i'll just leave it at that

453
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,400
There uh, there are some really good ones too, but you get them good and fast. Uh, yeah Bellingham is um,

454
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,520
Um, it's a good taste of Washington in an interesting way. It's a little eclectic. It's a little hippie, but it's

455
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,840
Yeah, okay

456
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,040
Well speaking of hippie, um

457
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,080
If you the two areas you want to pay attention to meridian and fair haven that's pretty much where you want your hotels to appear

458
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,080
You want to avoid uh, sammich, uh, generally speaking. Yeah, there's some that's pretty hit and miss

459
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,640
But yeah

460
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Also, uh, if you are a beer fan some of the best beer in the pacific northwest is going to be there

461
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,600
A lot of great breweries up there also some folks, uh at the fest usually every year who are uh,

462
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,000
Uh brewers that use linux we've featured them before they'll be there. I mean really good stuff

463
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,160
Traditionally also they've had an after party at the spark museum, which is a really great radio museum

464
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,920
Really really nice and they have a tesla coil there that they fire off and there's food. It's it's a really unique thing

465
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,400
Uh, and bellingham's all about the food and the brew for sure. Yeah, so it's a good trip

466
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,040
It's and and linux fest northwest. I I think you know having been around and seen a lot of them

467
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,600
I think this is got to be in one of the top three fests

468
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Uh in the country, so

469
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,200
Well, it's cool to watch how it's matured over the years because I mean you remember the old ones

470
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,440
I mean, it's just very very different i've been going since not quite but since nearly high school a little bit after high school

471
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,840
Quite and it's been i've been going a really long time

472
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,520
I've been going since the first person I started going with was my high school one of my high school computer teacher

473
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Oh my gosh, that's crazy

474
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,680
I yeah

475
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,840
Now that was a couple years after I was out of high school

476
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,040
But so i've been i've been going so long that i've been going angel used to go with me to help me take notes

477
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,760
And she'd be there for a while when she was pregnant and she'd be like trying to sit in those seats, you know

478
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,000
Be at ball perrego helping me take notes. Yeah. Oh man, that's wild

479
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,240
It really has it really has come into it's something else something else that's kind of unique that they do

480
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,960
Uh, and it's perfect because it's the pacific northwest is they have a college there that has uh, some chef courses

481
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,640
And they do a big barbecue. Now you can leave we often leave because we usually have a large crew but uh,

482
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,000
They're they're at the college campus. They're barbecuing up salmon and ribs and stuff like that

483
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
And the salmon's really good stuff

484
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,800
So there's also it's a good opportunity to get some pacific northwest barbecued salmon and they have these big barbecue grills

485
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,840
They cook them on

486
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,480
And there's enough local of uh folks of us that we you know, usually able to provide transportation for most everyone

487
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,600
So yeah, that's a pretty good time. So that'll be uh, april uh,

488
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,480
25th and 26th you can find out more at linuxfestnorthwest.org. They're not paying me to plug it

489
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,880
I just really would like to see you guys and it's a good is we only

490
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,840
It's the biggest one we do in the year because it's here in our backyard and we don't have to fly all the gear everywhere

491
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
So we can go a little bigger

492
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,440
Uh, that's right. Hopefully we'll have uh, we'll have maybe by linux action show on sunday. We'll have the uh, fest swag stuff ready

493
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,640
Uh, all right

494
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,640
So, uh, we gotta uh speaking of fest

495
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,240
We gotta talk we got a couple of more interviews to play from scale and then we're gonna talk

496
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,600
Um about mate because I mean damn it

497
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,120
Yeah, I I never would have expected so much exciting things to be happening with a desktop based on the known tomb paradigm

498
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,920
I you know

499
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,840
Like if you would have asked me a year ago where some of the most interesting things were happening

500
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,960
I wasn't I wasn't going to guess that so we're also going to talk to wimpy about some of that stuff because it's crazy exciting

501
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,980
Uh first i'm going to talk about digital ocean head over to digitalocean.com

502
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,680
right now digitalocean

503
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,920
Dot com

504
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,120
Yeah, I don't know i'm trying to make them a jingle we have a uh, oh my we have we do have a promo code though

505
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,880
That I do have do unplugged one word do unplugged go uh, go over there and use that that just keep that in mind

506
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,440
While I tell you about digital ocean now, you'll see why you want a promo code

507
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,400
Uh, so digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up

508
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,760
Your own cloud server and it's legit. You're going to get root access to this thing

509
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,520
You get to watch it boot all the way up

510
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,600
You get this great console to manage it and it's a it's a it's a free bsd or a linux rig

511
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,480
Come on, let's be honest. It's gonna be a linux rig, right? You're not an animal

512
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,600
It's a linux rig and it's gonna rock and it's super fast

513
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,920
I I would go recommend you just go spin one up over at digital ocean use the promo code do unplugged

514
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,440
You get a ten dollar credit and just kind of play around with that the package management the speed of it and just have some fun

515
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,560
You'll you'll you'll find too. You'll you'll get started in less than a minute probably about 55 seconds or less

516
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,600
Sometimes it's as low as 26 seconds. I've gotten some crazy tweets

517
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,640
And the pricing plans start only five dollars per month

518
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:32,260
I'll get you 512 megabytes of ram a 20 gigabyte ssd one cpu and a terabyte of transfer a terabyte

519
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,160
for five dollars

520
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,520
yeah, I

521
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,680
One of the things I do for a living is I distribute content

522
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,000
I can't look at that when I say five dollars, I think maybe i'll just buy like six or seven of these

523
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,040
Right, you know just actually the problem is is uh, let's see

524
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,880
One terabyte. Yeah, that would be a lot of droplets

525
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,000
So, okay wouldn't quite work out but you know you you might not have that problem one terabyte might is I would imagine is

526
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:01,120
Way more than enough and if you're thinking about maybe setting up something like c file or own cloud or bit torrent sync or sync thing

527
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,760
Isn't drop is you you could go pay for somebody's ridiculous amount of cloud storage or for way less money

528
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,360
You could have it on your own rig up in the cloud that you control at digital ocean

529
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,480
Right. There's a lot of opportunity there. They have one click deployment applications do some really great stuff

530
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,960
You can do full dns management over there. They have data center locations in new york, san francisco, singapore, amsterdam and london

531
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,400
I love that too because if you're going to do the sync stuff, that's something to consider

532
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,000
And then you know

533
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,760
You'll have that interface to manage it and that interface that they have is so intuitive the control panel is crazy powerful

534
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,840
But yet like they didn't make it very complicated

535
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,200
So you can get through to a really fast pace and get everything you need but not feel like

536
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,360
They've removed some sort of necessary feature because they've just they've just spent time to make sure you have access to all that stuff

537
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,560
But it's designed well run all on top of linux

538
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,360
Which is a boatiful at this tier with these tier one data connections go over there right now

539
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,280
Try it out do unplugged go spin yourself up something like a ghost installation or wordpress install

540
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,180
There's so many possibilities digitalocean.com

541
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,960
See what we've been talking about use the promo code do unplugged and a big thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

542
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,600
You guys rock

543
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:19,440
now matt, uh, I love these clips that kernel linux or aka noah got at uh at scale because

544
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,400
I'd never been and I was kind of on the fence this year. It looks like i'm definitely going next year

545
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
There's some great folks to talk to

546
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,840
Uh, why don't we start with the kids on computers initiative?

547
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,120
This is one that a longtime viewer eb wrote in and he said you got to feature this one because I saw it on

548
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,040
Your live event, but you didn't play it in last

549
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,360
He says this is a really good cause and he wanted to know more information about it and he was right

550
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,720
Uh, I went back and I watched the clip and I thought he's absolutely right

551
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,760
So, uh for a good cause here's uh kids on the computer at scale 13 x

552
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,480
So as both a father

553
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,480
As both a father of two kids

554
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,440
That I desperately want them to be all involved in computers at least as much as possible and understanding

555
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,160
Uh the ramifications if they're not into technology and as a person who wants to see linux implemented wherever possible

556
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,840
I was beyond elated to come across stormy with the kids on computers project here at scale where they

557
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,800
Well, they do amazing things. They do amazing things. They not only do they bring computers to kids

558
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,920
They essentially build their own little mini internet to take to places that don't have access to the internet. How are you today stormy?

559
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,160
I'm great. I'm glad to be here at scale talking to everybody about this. Yeah, it's fun, right?

560
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,840
so so I guess my first question is

561
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,780
You obviously when you're dealing if you're if you're if your goal is to go out and put computers

562
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,720
To kids that don't already have them chances are that there's probably not a lot of money

563
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,880
The budget isn't real high for doing these kinds of things, right? No, they usually have no budget

564
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,120
So we actually we either collect donated computers and install linux and free software on them educational software

565
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,160
Or we we apply for grants and get money to buy new computers, but the schools themselves have no money

566
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,800
We do like the communities be very involved. So it's been really awesome at some of our schools

567
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,320
The parents do fundraisers are they pitching a dollar or two a month per kid?

568
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,880
Which is a lot of money for them and they've been able to like set up computer labs build the buildings

569
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,360
Um both parents, you know, they had parents build the buildings to put the computer labs in

570
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,120
Um, they hired computer teachers off of donations that they've they've gotten

571
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,560
So we work in communities where people are really willing to give and they participate but there's no money there. So

572
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Can you can you tell me why?

573
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:37,040
Uh, can you tell me how that plays into linux first? I mean, why not?

574
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,040
Why not purchase microsoft windows or why not purchase a bunch of macs?

575
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,840
So our goal is to empower kids to be able to create and to do things in the world

576
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,400
And and so by giving them linux and free software things that they can like learn how they work

577
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,360
Maybe not in the beginning

578
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,600
But you know they can learn how they work and they tweak them and they can build on it. It's much more powerful

579
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,760
Than teaching them that the world is about pirated software that they have to steal from someone

580
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,600
Right on the head right on the head

581
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,760
So uh, so in a lot of these places

582
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,480
I understand that there isn't a lot of money and that that leads to not a lot of services and not a lot of services means

583
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,880
There perhaps might not actually be internet there. So tell me about the tools that you give these kids so that they can access

584
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,760
The internet without having access to the internet

585
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,720
Yeah, so the main thing we wanted to bring was like the knowledge of the world and education to these kids

586
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,800
Um, so we've worked with different things like rachel and khan academy and we give them essentially on every machine for sure

587
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,900
Educational software so they can play math games or things. We give them a full offline copy of wikipedia

588
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,680
usually in their native language and

589
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,600
I'm always in their native language so far and we we give them a complete set of the khan academy videos

590
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,520
Um, all the ones in their language as well. That's crazy. So we don't have wikipedia. We don't have access to wikipedia

591
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,320
So we'll bring the wikipedia to you. Yes, it's really amazing

592
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,680
They have an entire more than what it would be in a set of encyclopedias on every computer and they can look up their book

593
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,160
It's cool in one school. We were setting up the computers and this is in this little town in mexico

594
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,920
That they have they not only don't have internet cell phones don't work though

595
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,280
They're in a canyon and they don't have any like landlines

596
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,600
So they really don't have any communication and we had three moms come in while we were working

597
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,840
And they sat there the entire afternoon and browsed through wikipedia and khan academy

598
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,840
And this wasn't on the internet

599
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,040
No, no, like just in this little lab in this little town in this little canyon like these people played with it

600
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,640
That's unbelievable. Is there a particular distribution that you use when you go to set up these computers for kids?

601
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,200
We've played with a bunch of them. So we're not tied into any we've tried edubuntu. We've tried libuntu

602
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,520
Um at the moment we're using uber mix

603
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,280
Um, one of the things we need is something that runs with really low memory on really old machines

604
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,960
That's very customizable. So right. Yes, so it has to be new enough. It has to be new enough and late late late enough that

605
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,400
Those kids are getting a good that they're getting a relevant experience and at the same time it has to be a

606
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:05,360
Accommodating to very legacy hardware essentially. Yeah, it's the hardware and the amount of memory and stuff that were that limits us

607
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:11,440
Well, that's absolutely outstanding if people wanted to I assume that you guys could always use the donation or could always use a you

608
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Know a plug for uh for your website

609
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,840
So people wanted to give back if people wanted to donate hardware people wanted to donate money. Where could they go?

610
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,160
They could get a ww kids on computers.org. Um, you can get involved there

611
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,840
We're always looking for volunteers whether you like working with technology or you're good at marketing or you speak another language

612
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,600
We've got something to do. Um donations help the money goes a long ways like, you know for very little money

613
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,640
We can bring a donated laptop to a country and give it to someone so donated hardware or money

614
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,000
Um, we're doing a fundraiser here for cool hats. They're made by a local businessman in one of the communities that we work with

615
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Yeah, and so we're selling those as a fundraiser

616
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,040
All right

617
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,520
Well outstanding and this is a way that if you if you uh, if you care to contribute to this project

618
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,080
Not only are you contributing towards linux here?

619
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,760
Not only are contributing towards open source

620
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,840
But you are putting in the hands of kids that wouldn't not only they're not

621
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,400
People that you're not converting people from windows you are converting people from no computer at all

622
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,960
To a linux based experience and that that's essentially what they are going to know

623
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,240
You have the power to do that. So I you know, you know from the bottom of my heart

624
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,480
Thank you for doing what you're doing. Thank you for going out to do all this

625
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,920
This is a super cool project and i'm really excited to follow you and see how things go

626
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,800
Thanks so much for stopping by and spreading the word. Please please come help us out. We appreciate it

627
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
That's a pretty neat initiative, uh

628
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,760
I I actually kind of wish I could figure out more of those things and and help direct

629
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,600
More attention to them. I feel like I have just some stuff I could send to these places

630
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,000
We we should seriously one day

631
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,240
I don't know if we'd have to have somebody that would be committed to doing the leg work

632
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,800
but we should seriously consider one day doing a roundup of

633
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,200
Places all around the world maybe or at least in the uk and the us and canada

634
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,080
Uh where uh people could donate equipment that would get then loaded with linux

635
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:02,080
Like you have to you know stuff that would go for linux towards linux use and deployment. That'd be really cool. Sounds awesome

636
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,840
Uh, well, that was a really interesting, uh initiative. So that's kids on computers and uh, you can uh, you can check that out

637
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,240
So we have uh, we have two more interviews to play and this next one's a bit of a long one

638
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,000
And it's because there's a lot to cover

639
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,680
It's the ubuntu booth one and I saved it just for this episode because it is kind of long

640
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:24,560
But it's there's so much ground and then the one after that is the one that I never thought we'd feature an interview from

641
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,960
On any of our shows let alone that they were big linux users, but it makes a lot of sense

642
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,040
So we'll start with the ubuntu one first

643
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,200
Many times as I walk around these conferences I find it increasingly difficult to actually find linux

644
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,160
I know that sounds a little weird, but being at a linux convention sometimes finding the linux isn't so easy

645
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,600
I especially have a a place a special place in my heart for people that use linux on the desktop now

646
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:59,200
I'm here with nathan and he's from ubuntu the community outreach. They he very much cares about seeing linux on the desktop. Isn't that right?

647
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,840
Yeah, it's the most important thing in the world

648
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,560
I agree with you

649
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,000
I mean world peace and and world hunger those things don't pale in comparison to getting people to use linux on the desktop

650
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,400
I think because there's so many proprietary operating systems

651
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,320
On retail stores that that's why we don't have world peace. I agree. I agree

652
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,400
I think it contributes to all the problems in the world. I think if we had desktop linux that would solve all of these

653
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,560
So obviously, uh, we're here

654
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,280
We have some fine looking system 76 machines behind us

655
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:30,400
And of course the orange which represents ubuntu tell me what it is specifically that makes ubuntu such a great desktop operating system for regular

656
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,600
users

657
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,280
So we take um the hardware capabilities and stability of the linux kernel

658
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,240
We take the massive amount of software available for debian

659
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,680
And additionally for ubuntu we take that we polish it. We have a clear goal of what we want on the desktop

660
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,600
We have the unity desktop interface that scales beautifully to large screens laptops touch screens

661
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:58,560
Phones as well. Yeah, and so as we take this this uh software with a with a clear strong vision across different devices

662
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,120
Uh, I think that that one

663
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:07,360
Unified vision is what helps ubuntu be so so awesome on the desktop now. I see that you have the bq there

664
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,640
Uh now those aren't you said those aren't shipping actually until march

665
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,240
So you're kind of a special person in the us to have one of those. Yes

666
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,760
Uh, so there were about 50 people who were uh, ubuntu insiders that were flown to the launch event

667
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:23,280
I was not one of them stuart langridge was and uh, so I stole his phone

668
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:28,560
He was he was actually nice to donate it to the booth this weekend and jono might donate his uh tomorrow

669
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,080
So we'll have two of these

670
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,000
And this is just so the nexus fours we have our development phones and they run really beautifully. Um, but there's a lot of um,

671
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,160
The the specs in this are kind of low and people are really upset because they're used to really high-end android phones performing

672
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,560
Okay, well even just so optimized this uh, this phone works beautifully. Uh,

673
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,480
You know just even on on these specs so we're demonstrating that today

674
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,160
That's outstanding now

675
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,400
How do you like the actual usability of ubuntu?

676
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,200
On the phone because I I installed it and granted it was a couple months ago

677
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,640
But I found there were some very key features I found to be lacking

678
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,880
So for example, I didn't see an email client

679
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:13,760
So there is an email client, uh, it's it's been developed by um by uh, I think they're canonical members

680
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:18,080
But but by the community and it's a part of uh of uh, trello. I think it's called deco

681
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,160
Okay, and so it doesn't ship on the phone by default, but it is in the store for free

682
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,280
And once it's super stable, it's a little bare bones

683
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,560
Although it's getting just to where I think it's a actually really nice client

684
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
Uh, as that is that grows more mature it'll be shipped by default

685
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,120
But it is in the store and and it's a it's a really nice client

686
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,320
All right. There you go. And there's a little audio pop. So i'll leave it there

687
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,240
Um, boy, it was a good interview, too

688
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,880
But i'll have to uh, i'll pull out more clips if there's more in there

689
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,360
Maybe next week can play it because that pop in that audio happens sometimes from the conversion of the camera clips

690
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,680
All right. So, uh one last interview to round out our scale coverage

691
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And this is the company I never thought we'd have an interview with on the show

692
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,680
Uh, and it turns out they use quite a bit of linux

693
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:10,160
Okay, we're here at scale 2015 scale 13x we're walking around and I expect to see a lot of linux when I go to these

694
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,760
linux conventions

695
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,760
Sometimes the linux isn't quite as obvious as you might think it is and that is exactly what I found out when I came across

696
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,920
Disney who doesn't love disney, so i'm here to talk a little bit

697
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,820
Uh, what exactly disney does with linux how you guys use linux and yeah for anyone that thinks that disney is all about cartoons

698
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,400
And animations all of that stuff is actually powered by linux

699
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,200
Correct. So we actually have linux running in

700
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:42,000
A lot of our operation environments and one question that you actually asked me was if we had linux running in our desktop environment

701
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,160
Right and that is so especially in our animation environment. They actually have fully linux based environment

702
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,360
So, um a lot of times individuals will sort of uh identify disney as a brand

703
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,080
And the affinity just to themselves

704
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,760
but the amount of technology that disney uses to actually support its business lines is

705
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:07,440
Huge and linux is actually a very large component to that technology line, which is why we're here

706
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,560
Yeah, well and so and you know, and of course it goes without saying that

707
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,440
The linux community in general always appreciates people like you that that that build a business on the backbone of linux that are willing

708
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,000
To give back that sponsor these kinds of events that come here and talk about I mean, that's you know, that that

709
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,160
Right from this perspective

710
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,840
It's about being able to go ahead and provide the community with a little bit of

711
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:34,180
Sort of support overall in general and letting them know what it is that we do with this line of technology

712
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,480
And just making sure that people understand that it can go hand in hand

713
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,200
So we have obviously a huge brand that's out there, but a lot of it is done with amazing technology such as linux

714
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,040
So and the reason I brought up the desktop thing is because you walk around and you see a lot of the presenters

715
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,480
They they talk about linux and they talk about building their business on linux

716
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,960
But at the same time they don't trust linux enough to actually use it on a day-to-day basis

717
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,800
It might be in it might be on the servers in the back end that does that stuff

718
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,920
But they're not looking at it

719
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,040
They're not interacting with it

720
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,600
And what was interesting when I was speaking with you is I get the impression that there are places in disney where?

721
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,720
When you walk into work everything is linux

722
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:20,080
I'd probably say in selective environments, especially in areas like animation or our feature animation environment

723
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,680
That is so the case

724
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,120
And that is just generally case by case in terms of how much linux is used overall within each environment

725
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,800
So it may not be the case for all environments, but specifically especially for our animation teams

726
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,920
It's a very big part of their day-to-day

727
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,960
That would be yeah

728
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,000
And what would really be cool is if someday those tools that you guys use

729
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,680
If those ever became available for purchase or for that would be absolutely awesome

730
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,280
If somebody wanted to find out more about uh, disney and disney's involved as linux. Is there somewhere you can point them or

731
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,840
um

732
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,880
In terms of disney and disney's involvement with linux

733
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,140
I probably say in general you can go ahead and sort of check out disney technology

734
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,960
Dot com or a little bit more so I would say, uh, disney tech jobs dot com

735
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:11,920
um through disney tech jobs dot com, you'll actually get a really good understanding of our overall technology environment and sort of

736
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,840
How we're able to go ahead and kind of use linux as well as other open source technologies within our environments

737
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,960
And that's going to be specific to every segment and every position that we have. That's absolutely outstanding

738
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,840
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us. Really appreciate it. Thank you

739
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,000
And as colonel linux points out in the chat room

740
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,840
They are hiring so uh, you can get yourself a gig at disney

741
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,840
Uh managing some linux servers

742
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,920
You know instantly my brain flashes to that song from frozen. Let it go. She's talking about proprietary software

743
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,120
Let it go. Let it go

744
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,880
Let it go

745
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:53,680
Get it out of here. I think is uh, yeah, let it go because it is wasted effort

746
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,800
Yeah, exactly. Yes. Nice. Very good callback, man. Very good callback. Uh, all right. Well, we gotta talk mate. We got umate

747
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,360
Uh don't pursue. Oh, thanks sarah. Well, you know, I thought if this podcasting thing didn't work out

748
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,160
I would okay. No, you don't think I could become a disney singer

749
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Well, there goes that plan

750
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,160
Yeah

751
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,760
Guess I better stick to reading ads and that's why our next segment is brought to you by

752
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,280

Yeah, 33 percent discount linuxacademy.com

756
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:39,460
Slash unplugged so why go to like high because i'll tell you why linux academy is built by people who are crazy passionate

757
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,180
About linux they get the open source community. They're involved in it developers

758
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:51,540
And educators came together and created a platform that they call linux academy and it is awesome. It is a resource you can go to

759
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:57,640
To learn just about anything in the spectrum of linux open source amazon web services

760
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,980
Big technology stacks that you really want to deep dive into and walk away with expert knowledge stuff

761
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,900
You can go take the test and pass and I can't tell you how many success stories I hear

762
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:12,340
It's amazing and part of the part of the reason is because I understand what the problem is with all the other systems

763
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:17,700
All the other systems are generic. They're just general training platforms. This is built for this kind of stuff

764
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,060
I'll give you a few examples. Um, you just choose from any distribution you want

765
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:23,860
They have seven plus distributions you choose from the courseware

766
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:30,340
Adjusts to match those distributions the virtual machines for the labs automatically adjust to that distribution, right?

767
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,260
Because they get it you can download the study guides and just keep them. They're yours

768
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,980
They have live stream events where you can ask the educators

769
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,980
It's so nice because you can also go in and keep track of your progress and see right where you left off

770
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,180
See how far you've gotten see how much longer you have to get how long it's going to take you

771
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,020
It's really easy to wrap your brain around this stuff like for me

772
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:53,140
I go and i'm like, okay now i'm going to learn python now in the past before I had linux academy

773
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:59,060
And I have an active subscription to linux academy. I would have really had this nebulous ambiguous goal

774
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:06,100
Self I will learn python and and I would then what go get a book go do go google

775
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,380
Like but then how do I know like the guide i'm reading is any good?

776
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,900
It's just this just it's it was never really a way. I would actually take action on it

777
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,660
That was always the problem I would get to is I couldn't really conceptualize it and take action

778
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,900
Linux academy solves all of that because they really wrap it in something. I can put my brain around

779
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:27,220
They have an introduction guide that's going to take you five hours. Here's some course material. I get it

780
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,280
It clicks and now I can get the job done linuxacademy.com

781
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,100
Slash unplug go sign up make your skill set a little bit better

782
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,180
You're not familiar with docker, but you've been hearing a lot about it. Go take a course on it

783
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,860
You need to go administer some kvm systems go take a course on it

784
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:47,160
You're going to go work on aws go use one of those scenario based trainings and actually work with the technology

785
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,720
Before you have to go put your hands on it linuxacademy.com

786
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:55,780
Slash unplugged and a big thanks to linux academy for sponsoring the linux unplugged program you guys keep it up

787
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,540
They have a whole bunch of new stuff coming up. So it's really a good time to become a subscriber

788
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,620
I'll talk about that more really soon

789
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,420
Mr. Wimpy if you still around sir

790
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,060
I had a few things I wanted to pick your ears and brains about

791
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:13,880
Uh, and that is the stuff coming up for the big ubuntu mattei project, which is now a powerhouse among distributions

792
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:20,420
That is not only an official flavor of ubuntu, but apparently is so damn rich

793
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,420
Is just giving out money to other open source projects. What's going on?

794
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,700
Well, uh, yeah

795
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,820
Powerhouse and rich is that so?

796
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:36,100
Um, I don't know where to start with that really

797
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,900
Yeah

798
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:44,340
It's all full of superlatives. Uh, how do I follow that? Um, yes. Well, uh, I suppose

799
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:49,140
Um the big news is we're now an official part of the ubuntu family

800
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:54,740
Which is just terrific and we're already reaping the uh benefits of being

801
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,560
part of the official canonical

802
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,700
uh infrastructure team and

803
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:07,260
having uh, and also getting consideration from you know, the the wider ubuntu group

804
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,300
On decisions that are being made now. So that's really great. So i'll give you an example

805
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,140
so today I was contacted by two of the guys that are

806
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:20,140
uh working mostly on bringing system d

807
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:27,920
Enablement 1504 and they wanted to make sure that ubuntu mate 1504 was going to play nicely with system d

808
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,040
And they gave me all of the tips about how I could test this

809
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,560
And make sure it was working. Okay, because they they want a tick in the box that ubuntu mate is going to work

810
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,960
And so now being official, you know, we're given that kind of due diligence and that's just terrific. Yeah, no kidding

811
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,040
That is really great. And plus you get also the hosting infrastructure for the repos and the iso images

812
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,960
Yes, yeah, so there's a number of other benefits. So we've got access to the build server now, so um

813
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:06,160
Uh, that's terrific and and more importantly the official build infrastructure because i'd had to sort of reverse engineer it as best as I could

814
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,400
and I think to

815
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:16,640
Most people the ubuntu mate images look and feel and smell like real ubuntu, but I knew where they weren't quite the real deal

816
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,240
uh, so now they really are so for example now on ubuntu mate you can now use the uh,

817
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:29,760
The oem config so you can you know install a batch of machines in oem mode and then uh,

818
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:36,560
Close them up and uh when you turn them on it asks you, you know who you are and where you are

819
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,480
Does it mean at some point?

820
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:45,600
I would maybe be able to be like on a bare ubuntu like server type install and do apt-get install ubuntu dash mate

821
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,840
That's all possible now. So that all happened a couple of days ago

822
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,480
So if you were to download the mini iso for example go really trim

823
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,920
Uh, you can now do a task cell install of the ubuntu mate, uh desktop

824
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,400
So, uh, it's all it's all you know fully enabled throughout the stack now

825
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Wow, that is a big deal

826
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:14,000
Congratulations. Yeah. Yeah, it's terrific. It's been it's been a long old grind and and really the tipping point was um,

827
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,680
About a month ago. I was fortunate enough to travel to montreal with work

828
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,120
And one of the guys from canonical

829
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:28,800
Who i'd been working with to try and do all of the back end build infrastructure enablement was based in montreal

830
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:34,880
So, uh, I met up with him and uh, we went out for coffee and beers and went to

831
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,000
The montreal university and went to the montreal linux meetup for the evening

832
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,280
And we and we hacked away on this for sort of um until about four o'clock in the morning

833
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:51,520
And that was really where it all started to sort of gather momentum and and start to sort of fall into place. So, um,

834
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,080
Yeah cypher mox as he's known in the irc. He was he was terrific

835
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:02,640
He's really made a big difference and there's about uh, eight or nine people at canonical that have really really sort of made this

836
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,680
Happen in the last two weeks. It's been uh, it's been great

837
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:11,840
Now, uh, there's also a couple other things. I want to talk to you about number one is uh, you did something that I think uh,

838
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,120
Would be

839
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:17,120
Really neat to see a lot of other projects too. So you have some community funds, right?

840
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:23,040
Uh does help pay for the cost of the projects and I guess there was extra funds and so you kind of paid it forward

841
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,120
That's right. So, um, one of the things that came out of the community

842
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,920
back last year was um,

843
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,240
they wanted a community site that wasn't hosted through the social networks because

844
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,520
You have a lot of people that are uncomfortable with signing up to facebook and twitter and google and what have you?

845
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:45,600
So I said well i'd be perfectly happy to um host it all and and you know put it all together

846
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,600
But I couldn't afford to run it myself. So I started a

847
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,200
Funding campaign to just cover the costs of hosting a server

848
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,760
And the money started trickling in around november time last year, and I just gave it a couple of months lead time

849
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,680
So I knew i'd got a buffer, you know, so that um, it was comfortable

850
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:10,640
But um, it kind of uh overtook itself. So we're comfortably funding a rather beefy server

851
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,160
So it's a a quad core server with four gigs of ram and raid six disk and uh,

852
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:22,240
Six terabytes of um bandwidth per month and that's where we're hosting our discourse community

853
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,680
In addition to what we do in the social networks

854
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:31,280
And we're now using that to really sort of develop some of the teams in the project as well interesting because i've noticed

855
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:36,000
You know, the project's also pretty active on google plus in the ubuntu community. Yeah

856
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,000
Yeah, it's it's active on google plus also

857
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,800
Also surprisingly active on facebook as well. One of the community members started a facebook group. I wasn't sure whether that was going

858
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,320
To be any use or not, but i'd say that's almost as big as um,

859
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,840
As the google plus group and growing much quicker because it was it was

860
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,400
Some months behind

861
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,760
Um, but anyway, we've had all of this money donated which is terrific

862
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,400
And i've been thinking about you know, how we can can make use of it

863
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:09,840
And i'd originally been thinking of doing like, um, uh, you know code bounty something like that

864
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,440
But I thought it would be better to actually identify projects that we're already making use of

865
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
and sort of um

866
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,240
Fund those projects. Oh, very cool. So we've got to a point now where we've we're not rolling in money

867
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,280
You know, and I know a couple of months ahead of where we are, but we've got a little bit of surplus

868
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:34,880
So I wanted to pick a couple of projects that we're dependent on that sort of make

869
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,000
Ubuntu mate what it is that aren't part necessarily of of mate itself

870
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:44,640
And I was thinking about well, where will I you know, where will I look to support?

871
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:51,760
And then I got an email from um, marcos costales who's the developer for for two projects one is uh,

872
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,820
Gufw, which is the front end for the the uncomplicated firewall and he's also the developer for folder colors

873
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,660
Both of which i've integrated into mate

874
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:08,580
Gufw has been there since day one and folder colors. I added um, just a couple of weeks ago

875
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:14,740
And he sent me an email that basically said um, I really love the project. Um, uh, here

876
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,300
Here's how you do it

877
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:22,260
I really love the project. Um, uh here here's how you disable

878
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:27,780
The donation links in folder colors so it doesn't you know nag people

879
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,940
And i'm telling you this because I think the project's great and I really want to see it succeed

880
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:37,140
And I was like, well, there we go. There is the first person that we should reward

881
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:44,820
So, um, we went through the accounts and uh, we've donated 50 to g u f w

882
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:51,700
And then we've donated another 50 to folder colors and taking taken him up on his offer of disabling the

883
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,780
donation links in the in the folder colors, uh piece so that was a hundred dollars we've donated this month and also

884
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:06,260
we've got um when you download ubuntu mate through the ubuntu mate.org website, there's a

885
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,340
You know, could could you give us a download tip? It's not um, you have to fill it out

886
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:17,220
It's just there alongside the rest of the content and it suggests tip us two dollars

887
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,540
If everyone who downloaded ubuntu mate gave us two dollars

888
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:27,220
It would fund the full-time development of ubuntu mate and also the mate desktop

889
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:32,660
Um, and we've had quite a few people doing that. So from that i've been able to

890
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,100
um

891
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,100
Give uh, thirty dollars to the mate desktop team this month as well

892
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:42,340
Nice yeah, I really like uh, that approach

893
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:47,220
Uh, in fact, I I was wondering if maybe down the road if maybe this might be something that takes off a little more

894
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:53,300
Because open source really does depend on uh, everybody that you're building on top of and everybody that sort of is riding on top of you

895
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:57,140
And uh, like uh, not only did I not really know about folder color

896
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,700
Uh, but I by the way love that you integrated it

897
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,180
But uh now like hearing that backstory, too

898
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:05,700
That's just that's so awesome the way that the project worked together with you guys like that

899
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,300
Yeah, and I think that for a distribution it's easier to

900
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,220
gather

901
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:18,100
Donations, I mean we talk about you know, um people wanting free software as in free of cost

902
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:23,380
But people are so generous, you know, we're asking we're not asking for anything

903
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:30,020
We're gently encouraging them to give something but the the the money that's coming in is

904
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:35,140
Surprising quite frankly far far far more surprising than I I I realized

905
01:08:35,940 --> 01:08:42,820
And we can really do things with that. Um, and you know, uh, I I can't afford to make a hundred dollar donation

906
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,620
Uh as an individual

907
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:52,100
But using ubuntu mate as a platform to do that that actually makes a difference to the developer of that piece of software

908
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,740
That's uh, it's not gonna it's not gonna pay their wages or anything, you know grand like that

909
01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:02,420
It's it's still a small contribution, but it's much more than I can make as an individual. It seems sound

910
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:06,020
it seems like investing in the ecosystem and uh,

911
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:10,580
The other thing is it's made me kind of think about how I could apply something like that here

912
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:16,580
Um, and I don't know exactly how that would be but wouldn't it be interesting to take like if we if we had a milestone

913
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:23,300
Where if we reached a certain set amount of funding, uh, then we would contribute a percentage to maybe production linux software

914
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:30,580
Like video editors like, you know, or or uh, uh, audio editors or maybe other things like gstreamer or things like uh,

915
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,020
Ffmpeg or or vlc or or something like that

916
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:39,220
That's it gives me a lot to think about and I think a lot of projects could think about how they could apply it to uh,

917
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:44,900
To their their kind of uh setup and and sort of reinvest in the tools that they use like

918
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:49,220
Jupiter broadcast, you know, we're freaking lives and dies on ffmpeg

919
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:53,540
Like if anybody deserves a buck from us, it would be at the ffmpeg project

920
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,380
I don't even know how their funding is set up

921
01:09:55,380 --> 01:10:00,260
but and the other thing is like I could imagine like so say down the road we did something like that where we set

922
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,900
Up a goal on our on our patreon.com today page where we said all right after this milestone

923
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:09,300
We're going to give we're going to give back to open source every month and then imagine like so I reach out and I get

924
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,500
I start, you know here ffmpeg project. I want to I would like to donate

925
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,020
Well, then maybe that starts a conversation with the project and then we land a great interview time

926
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:20,820
Well, then maybe that starts a conversation with the project and then we land a great interview too. Like there could be other types of

927
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,620
You know benefits to it too other than just yes quite

928
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,740
And now you have a dialogue with these projects, right?

929
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,700
Well, this is it. This is it now now, uh

930
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:37,700
We have a relationship because now i've exchanged many emails with mark awesome. We've actually started talking about some

931
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:45,620
Um spin-off projects so it actually then you know garners some involvement in the project other than what i've already

932
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:52,020
Seen is out there. So this is a mechanism. I'm going to try and use going forward to actually

933
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,460
uh recognize the efforts that people have put into their

934
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,180
Applications and try and use it as a way to bring them into the the wider ruben tumato project

935
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:07,300
And uh and and reward them for you know, um what they've what they've achieved

936
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,380
So it will be in a small way and as your plan is as this happens to continue to

937
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:15,140
Post about it kind of are you going to do like an online? What's your what's your plan?

938
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:18,100
They're kind of making it sort of transparent for the community

939
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,460
Well, yeah

940
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:25,300
So when when I first tabled the idea of taking donations to pay for the community server

941
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:30,500
I set up front and I do this quite regularly if there's anything that i'm not sure about

942
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:36,820
I ask the community so it's very democratic. I put a poll out and I basically say vote on this

943
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:42,260
How do you want things doing? So when I said, um, i'm going to open up for donations

944
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:49,460
How do you want the finances reported the result of that feedback was they wanted a monthly statement of accounts?

945
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,900
So that's what i've been doing since I think december time

946
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:59,140
So at the end of every month, I post a detailed list of these are all of the people that donated

947
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,980
This is the amount that came in. This is what the money was spent on

948
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,140
And how we've we've used it and I felt a little bit

949
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,540
Awkward about this

950
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:16,180
Last month or the month before because I spent some money on an ibook g4 that I bought off ebay

951
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:20,740
Because I wanted to work with one of the community members on the power pc port

952
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:26,420
And I was like, uh, you know 80 quid's quite a lot of money to spend on a second-hand computer

953
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:29,460
And I don't really know anything about power pc

954
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:35,540
But as a result, we now have power pc as an officially supported architecture

955
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:42,100
So I feel that that money was well spent and certainly for those people in the ubuntu marte community

956
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,700
That use power pc. They're super happy with that

957
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:50,660
uh, and I feel that you know, that was okay, it was okay to spend that money because there was a

958
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,860
a measurable result

959
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:59,860
As a result as a result of spending that so this month i'm going to buy

960
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:02,340
a raspberry pi 2

961
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,420
And an odroid c1

962
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,900
And this is a precursor to

963
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,540
uh trying to achieve

964
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:12,920
Um v7 hard float images for 1510

965
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:19,060
very nice and so 15, uh, but before we get to 1510 1504 is going to have

966
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:26,180
An official power pc edition. It's going to have one click compiz enablement for the desktop, right? I mean, this is fancy. Yeah

967
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:29,960
Yeah, so so some of the headline features for 1504

968
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,540
I've worked with the upstream compiz team. So i've i've

969
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:42,500
ported the integration layer to marte in compiz i've also ported the um,

970
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:48,180
um, uh the compatibility plugin, uh to marte as well. So now in

971
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:55,060
1504 uh, you'll see there's a proper marte compatibility plugin and then i've also added um,

972
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:59,940
Detection of the marte session for compiz so it knows

973
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:02,740
Compiz knows it's running under marte

974
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:07,780
And these are the plugins and this is the profile that it should use because this is marte

975
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:14,820
It's not gnome and it's not unity. So we've got first class. Um compiz support and i've spent

976
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:17,200
many evenings

977
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:24,260
Tweaking a sort of a default marte compiz profile with the same set of defaults that give you

978
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:31,140
Some nice transitions and some nice effects without being too sort of in your face and over the top

979
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,860
And uh, and i've just i've just sent another merger proposal

980
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:41,140
Um, I think yesterday evening which has been accepted to just tighten that up a little bit

981
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:47,860
But as a result as a result of working on um on compiz I had to sign the uh,

982
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,560
ubuntu, um

983
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,500
Cla

984
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:59,140
So I was invited to sign the cla. Yeah, and i've i've read the small print very carefully and as I understand it

985
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:03,220
Every second tuesday, I have to go to poppy's house and wash his car

986
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:08,580
Yeah, and every and every and every last thursday of the month I have to cook him dinner or something

987
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,940
And also I think you're also obligated to catch his chickens when they get out

988
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:17,940
Yeah, all right, and that too but but only if only if uh, the the day of the weekends and why

989
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,220
Well, everyone should be obliged to do this

990
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:29,380
Everyone should have to I I had one more thing. I wanted to talk to you about uh, uh wimpy and that is uh, i'm

991
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:33,300
I'm, uh pushing the buttons right now. I just became a uh patron

992
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:40,100
Uh of the project. Yeah, so talk about this a little bit. So I the reason I want to talk about this too is because um,

993
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:46,740
I I I suspect that this might be something more distributions pick up because to me it seems like a no-brainer

994
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:51,700
Of course i'm using patreon and it's maybe more geared towards content creators in a sense, but uh,

995
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,300
People can go to patreon.com slash ubuntu underscore matey

996
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,060
And if you're already, uh one of the patrons of our network

997
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:02,500
Then your stuff's already set up is just really click one click button

998
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:07,460
And uh, they have 29 patrons right now making 174 a month for the distribution

999
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:13,700
And I wonder if the other projects like maybe elementary os couldn't go on something like this. How's it worked for you so far wimpy?

1000
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:19,700
Well, it's it's effectively the patrons that have funded the community server

1001
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:26,980
So all of the setup costs and the server and the month-to-month server hosting, but more importantly, uh, the bandwidth

1002
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,220
costs because um ubuntu matey

1003
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:34,820
1404 and 1410 which are unofficial and therefore we're having to

1004
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:41,940
Field the costs of delivering that for are being downloaded between 900 times and a thousand times a day

1005
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:46,180
So that's a lot of bandwidth that we're having to fund

1006
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:52,980
Yeah, so those those patrons are basically funding funding the distribution network

1007
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:56,340
So without them, uh, it wouldn't have happened

1008
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,340
um, and I went down the patreon route because

1009
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:06,580
Um, you you could do you know kickstarters and crowdfunding and you get a gob of money up front

1010
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:14,820
But there's no longevity. You want sustainability. So yeah, so I I went for it might take longer to build up ahead of steam

1011
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:20,980
But I want to know month to month like the project can support itself what I the reason why I think it's actually kind of

1012
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:24,100
Brilliant and yes, there's bounty source and there's other ways to do it

1013
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:29,380
But the other thing that's kind of nice about it is it legitimately one-to-one translates to the interest in the community

1014
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:36,180
So you can scale up your efforts and your investment as the community scales up their investment and it directly corresponds as they want

1015
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:39,460
More they'll fund more and then you can afford more or you can come to them and say okay

1016
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:42,660
We can do this next thing and the the milestones allow you to say

1017
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:46,260
All right, once we reach this milestone, this is something the distribution can offer

1018
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:50,500
Uh, you in fact, you need some new milestones in there as a matter of fact. Yeah, I do

1019
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,820
And in fact, we don't listen to milestones are the worst part

1020
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:58,980
I have I have got some that i'm going to add but um, you talk about you know, the community want more

1021
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,420
so at the moment

1022
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,420
There's uh about four of us that are discussing some

1023
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,740
merchandise team

1024
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:13,860
Because what we're getting quite often now is people saying that they want stickers for their computers or they want mugs and t-shirts

1025
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:18,980
and all of that good stuff, so we're just putting together a team to try and uh,

1026
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,540
And fulfill that requirement

1027
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:27,860
And again, there'll be a little bit of kickback which can go into the project which we can then use to do

1028
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:33,080
You know the next thing and the next thing so hopefully it's a cycle of self-sustaining

1029
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,200
Self-sustaining uh that we can we can start to generate

1030
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:43,720
Well, i'm looking forward to 1504. I think uh, I think we'll have a review when it comes out because I think that's

1031
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,720
I mean, I think already

1032
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,680
Uh, the distribution is in my in my estimation seems to be one that's worth watching already

1033
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,640
And that's a pretty I mean there's a lot of distributions that sort of uh,

1034
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:58,600
That sort of hover in that kind of I mean, I don't mean to really put people down

1035
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
and it's not really the same thing but

1036
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,060
Uh mandriva a little bit just a little bit. I mean, I love me. I love mandriva. I love you guys

1037
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:09,340
I'm a mandrake user back in the day. I was a draft club member

1038
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:14,300
Uh, so I got the special repos. I mean seriously, I love it. So honestly, but

1039
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:19,180
I actually just just talking in terms of sheer relevancy. I just wonder

1040
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,420
um

1041
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,380
well

1042
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,380
Yes, it'll be interesting to see what happens. So

1043
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:33,200
So distro watch were refusing to list abuntu mate whilst it was unofficial and the day after we got our official status

1044
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:35,500
distro watch

1045
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:39,020
Put up an abuntu mate page on distro watch

1046
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:42,940
And that was a week ago and we're at number 23 now

1047
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:50,460
In a week, so I know they're hinky stats, but it's a it's an interesting barometer for you know

1048
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,680
Uh interest let's say yeah. Yeah

1049
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,800
Uh, I I can I can there's other ways. I don't know. I've watched this stuff for a long time

1050
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,560
There's other ways you can gauge it. Yeah

1051
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:07,040
And and it's the thing is now it's getting difficult to to follow the the downloads because now we're on the official canonical infrastructure

1052
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,000
I can't track all the downloads. So I don't know

1053
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:19,600
how popular 1504 is versus 1410 and you know 1404 so I start to lose some visibility the

1054
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:24,560
There was a recent article on was it the register where they?

1055
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,600
Yeah, the upcoming

1056
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,920
The upcoming 1504 release and didn't he talk about the torrent stats or was that some?

1057
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,560
Yeah, no, it was it was the register article. Are you familiar with the register? I think that's mainly

1058
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,560
In the uk. Oh, yeah

1059
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:48,480
Okay, so um, yeah, the register covered the 1404 beta releases and covered ubuntu mate and happened to remark that the

1060
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,160
The the seed ratio for ubuntu mate was three times that of any other flavor. So

1061
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:59,520
That's kind of interesting. Yeah, it is. Yeah, look at the register doing a write-up on that

1062
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,520
I'll link to that in the show notes as well

1063
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:07,600
Um, so yeah, we've got some good stuff planned and the other the other new feature in 1504

1064
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,600
That's probably worth mentioning is yes. You've got compass that you can turn on

1065
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,920
uh with a

1066
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,600
drop down menu

1067
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,920
But the other thing i've been working on is the user interface switcher. Oh, yes

1068
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:26,240
Okay, so this was something I had the idea about because the default mate, um

1069
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:33,840
Um desktop arrangement isn't how I actually use the system. So I created a number of panel layouts that that suited me and also

1070
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,040
Another podcaster who has a particular requirement for how they drive their machine

1071
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,480
And I created these and they said what you should do is you should you know make a gooey so you can switch between these

1072
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,960
So i've i've now made this so um

1073
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:53,040
Effectively, you've got the you've got the mate default arrangement. You've got the open suzer

1074
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,480
Uh desktop arrangement as was some years ago

1075
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,680
And then something that looks broadly like um windows xp like

1076
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:09,040
And then something that looks somewhat macos 10 like and that integrates with plank and what have you so

1077
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:14,560
You can you can quickly switch your panel arrangement to single panel top or button

1078
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:22,080
Uh with with docs and or not or dual dual panel and you can just cycle through them very quickly find one that

1079
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,200
That broadly reflects how you want to run your system and then customize it from there

1080
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,040
But uh, hopefully, um, it's just something a little bit different

1081
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,760
and the uh, the

1082
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,760
porting the

1083
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,960
menu to the mate menu and setting up the uh,

1084
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,000
The windows thing makes it kind of feel like a windows 7

1085
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,440
Interface so people who want that could easily get that really quickly

1086
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:51,680
Um, yes. Yeah, i've called that theme redmond as well in sort of, you know hat tip to uh to xp

1087
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:58,080
Uh, so, you know what i'm gonna do, uh, i'm gonna just I think everybody should go check out the distro watch

1088
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:00,960
Uh link because that's number 23 right now

1089
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:06,080
Uh, and so I I just tweeted it out right now and uh, you can check it out

1090
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,400
It's distro watch dot com slash ubuntu mate

1091
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,320
Uh, and I think a lot of people like to learn about this distribution because it's pretty compelling you can hear

1092
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,320
It's got a lot of cool features coming

1093
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,720
So go check it out. Maybe go up a little bit further in the ranks and people check it out even more

1094
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,440
Wimpy, that's a ton of stuff. So are you uh, not you're not pulling your hair out. You're doing okay

1095
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:28,080
You're not about to uh, lose too much sleep or um go insane from all the workload

1096
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,280
No, I am working two jobs at the moment

1097
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:37,760
I'm effectively doing my day job and then i'm coming home and then doing another like full shift

1098
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,520
Most most nights until sort of you know one two o'clock in the morning. So I am

1099
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,520
I'm properly exhausted

1100
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,640
um, I just need to get over the hump of

1101
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,160
Fixing up for the the 1504 stuff

1102
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:57,840
Hopefully be done in a week and then it should be a nice easy cruise in through

1103
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:04,640
Beta 2 release candidate to final and uh, and in that period we can uh, we can start to

1104
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:11,680
Look at the planning for 1510 and i've got some gsoc mentoring i'm planning at the moment as well

1105
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,320
Wimpy, I tell you what. You almost make me want to switch away from arch that close too bad

1106
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,760
I could just easily install matte

1107
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,960
Of course, you know what honestly is I miss all of the fine touches you're doing like the color like the file

1108
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:29,120
Like you need to you need to like can you just can you make all that like a package that I could just install on arch?

1109
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,680
uh, yeah

1110
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,880
Yeah, no, no, you're a little busy. Yeah. No, no, I probably could it's just finding time

1111
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:43,040
Um, some of it's there already to be honest with you other people are maintaining some of those packages. But yes, it's uh,

1112
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:49,040
If I did that then I sort of dilute the the value. I know i'm to marta

1113
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:53,840
And so you have to walk what I have to do is just watch everything cool you do and then just go try to rip

1114
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,840
It off on my own desktop on my own

1115
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:02,880
The thing the thing i've been working hard on is the the the mate marta tweak and marta menu

1116
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:07,520
And marta menu. Yeah, i've made those distro independent

1117
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:13,220
So those were forked from the mint utilities and now they don't carry any specifics

1118
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,680
For either ubuntu debian or mint. So those tools could be used on on any distro now

1119
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,180
so

1120
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:24,400
Technically you could get all of that one click goodiness

1121
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,960
for compiz on

1122
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:33,120
On arch and a couple of weekends ago. I did update the compiz packages for

1123
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,080
For arch linux for marta users as well because I maintain those there as well

1124
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:45,440
So, uh lots coming power pc support eventually arm support 1504 and even 1510 in the works

1125
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:52,960
Officially a flavor now of ubuntu and the patreon and the distro watch submission. We have links to all that stuff in the show notes

1126
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:58,000
Thank you very much for taking such a keen interest in the project. It's been great to watch it wimpy

1127
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,280
It's been a lot of been a lot of fun and uh, it's well it runs all my computers

1128
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:05,520
I just signed up on the patreon because that's that's selfish interest for me. I need this to work

1129
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:09,360
It's genuinely a great product just to that's the great part. I want to contribute

1130
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,560
And and what you and what and what you get is the warm fuzzy feeling that if there's any money left over we'll find a

1131
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,360
A good candidate that's worthy of some funding. Um

1132
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,000
That that directly benefits ubuntu marte and every month now

1133
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:31,440
Uh, I plan to support an open source project through our um our funding campaign

1134
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,800
That's really cool. You keep it up as long as you can because that's a pretty neat deal

1135
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,080
Uh, all right. Well, we'll probably wrap it up there

1136
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,320
So, uh, did you know the linux unplugged show is live that all these people we just talked to they're not recorded

1137
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:47,040
Well, they're recorded now that you're hearing them, but when i'm talking to them, they're live and you could talk to them

1138
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,040
You could be one of the people we're talking to. Oh my gosh go to jblive.tv

1139
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,940
We do this show on a tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1140
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:59,280
Slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone and don't forget if you can't be here live

1141
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,400
But you still want to contribute because you know, you'll love us

1142
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,360
We do have that subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1143
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,000
We pull stuff in from there and we'd love to have that

1144
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,320
You also have the irc you can participate in and you can always help out financially too at our patreon

Patreon.com slash today the money raised there goes to all of the network

1146
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:22,800
And matt, you know, I think with linux fest around the horizon. I've already started thinking about spring now in summer

1147
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,700
I'm thinking about doing an episode of the show around the barbecue

1148
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:29,280
Nice, I should probably just focus on next week though. Tell you the truth

1149
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:34,240
It's okay to have long-term goals, but you know your short-term ones can't lose focus, right?

1150
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,600
Well matt have a great week and i'll talk to you next week

1151
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:42,000
In fact, uh, maybe if you swing your timing just right when you come down here on monday for your super secret mission

1152
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,840
I'll have some barbecue just there's a possibility. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. All right, everybody. Thanks so much for this week's episode of linux unplugged

1153
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,120
We'll see you right back here next week. And also we'll see on sunday. We're gonna do our production under linux episode finally

1154
01:27:53,120 --> 01:28:12,340
So tune in for that. Thanks so much. See you next week. So

1155
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,360
Oh

1156
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:34,800
Dang it. I was just uh, I was just reviewing uh poppy's contract and apparently we didn't dedicate enough time to ubuntu touch poppy

1157
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,280
How's the ubuntu, uh touch project going in the bq stuff all good?

1158
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:46,000
I'm, sorry. I'm contractually not allowed to talk about that now. Oh, wow. Oh, wow

1159
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,560
Shabang, huh? Okay, fine try to give you a chance to give us you gotta wash his truck if you want this to work out

1160
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,360
Chris that's what's coming down to i was trying to give no, it's fine. It's really fine. Oh, it's good, huh?

1161
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,680
Okay, it's trying to give a bro. It's right. It's fine

1162
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,840
Hey jb titles.com jb titles. Do you see um?

1163
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:08,080
There was a photo that went past on google plus one of the people at the meizu

1164
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,720
stand the meizu mx4 is one of the devices we're shipping soon and uh,

1165
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,400
There was a couple of samsung executives hanging around the booth

1166
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:22,640
Looking at the meizu phone running ubuntu, which was nice, you know, yeah, I want I want that phone, you know

1167
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:27,360
If if tyson ever doesn't work out for them, you know, we'll be there for them with proper limits

1168
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,960
There you go. Next time we're doing this show next week

1169
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:38,240
the apple watch is going to be announced like whatever features it has are going to be established and the price and shipping date is

1170
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,240
going to be announced and uh

1171
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,800
I don't know like

1172
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,280
Here I am like before and i'm still like thinking i'm still not

1173
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,320
I I don't feel like they've sold me on why I want an apple watch

1174
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:54,080
Although I don't feel like pebble ever sold me all I want a pebble and google never sold me

1175
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,960
I want an android where exactly i'm still kind of in this area where

1176
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:03,440
So the thing I like about the new pebble is the fact that they're touting it as being more hackable and having

1177
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,800
Um a connector on the back that you could attach

1178
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:12,720
The watch to or attach the strap the band the band so the bands can have different sensors

1179
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:15,760
It says it could be bands. Yeah, the bands could have sensors or they could be more batteries

1180
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:21,280
Or you could just take the watch completely off your wrist and have that as the control unit for something else

1181
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,640
Oh my gosh have all kinds of under stuff underneath it. It doesn't have to be

1182
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:30,000
Things type gizmo. Yeah, exactly. But the thing that the thing that kills

1183
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:37,760
Pebbles android and ios obviously i'm speaking from a perspective of someone who doesn't actually use android or ios anymore

1184
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:42,480
I'm screwed. I can't use either of those. I have to buy into the apple ecosystem to use an

1185
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:48,800
Uh the iwatch and I have to buy into the android ecosystem in order to use an android where watch so

1186
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:53,760
You know i'm boned either way. I can't use either of them. Whereas pebble seems to be a bit more open

1187
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,480
They're completely open source

1188
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:01,280
I think the future of the watch is on having something that just receives dummy information

1189
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,360
Has a framework for displaying ui and the back end is always elsewhere

1190
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,400
And this is for the stores an open protocol

1191
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,960
You just enter in the story and you get options on the watch

1192
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,280
This is what pebble is doing you can push a pebble app with their api and write no code

1193
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:18,160
And people can choose to install it and it's amazing nice

1194
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,320
But still you install it like what I really am. You install it to the watch

1195
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:30,260
You know, that's exactly what i'm saying. You don't do anymore that the app exists actually on the store computer

1196
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:35,920
Yes, it's on the apple store. You just you just say go and then it starts showing the information. There's no

1197
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:40,720
Choice, you know, there's no setup for it. You just oh I want this to show up

1198
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,280
Someone's already put it together for me. You just say okay show it on my watch

1199
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:49,520
I got over the watch thing when I was like 10 when I got a timex data link and I started programming it

1200
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:55,040
It's a flashing screen the scratch flashing monitor and programming it that way

1201
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,360
even though there was only programs that I could put and download to the phone via the

1202
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,280
Sensor like the light sensor onto it. It was still pretty cool

1203
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:08,400
I kind of got over that way back then the watches now aren't really attractive to me. So

1204
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:17,120
So pebble have clearly got like first mover advantage because they were kind of first out the gate in this space

1205
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:24,720
And with their e-ink displays and the battery life they've been able to offer something that they that is

1206
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:31,840
Similar to the watch wearing experience that you would already have had, you know, because these other smart watches

1207
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
They're trying too hard. Yeah

1208
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,160
It's not about firmware updates it's about whether your watch will still tell the time at nine o'clock at night

1209
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:48,560
So I don't know if you guys have seen this sony e-ink watch. It's not a smart watch per se in the same way

1210
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,360
That you would call it but it takes basic bluetooth stuff

1211
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:57,680
And the amazing thing is the whole thing is an e-ink display like the band itself and when you can go in like say

1212
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I want I like this design band and you can just go and say I want this design band

1213
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:07,040
I want the phone the the the watch at the top to look like this and it's like you can do that

1214
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:10,800
And I thought it was so cool. I was like that is the watch I want

1215
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,800
And what is it running?

1216
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:19,040
It doesn't run anything. It's like it's kind of a dumb watch where it takes in some basic input. Yeah. Yeah

1217
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,840
Oh my god, this pebble thing is cheap

1218
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1219
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:36,320
I think I am on record saying that that is the business model to go on the show here. Okay. I've just backed it

1220
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:40,400
Really? Are you gonna get a phone? Did you get a watch to go for the steal?

1221
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:46,480
Yeah, you're just drunk on hot cross buns you poppy poppy. You should go for the steel while you still can

1222
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,840
It's more posh. That's fine

1223
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:54,720
I'm not much more expensive. It's so what are the I haven't actually looked at this

1224
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,440
Only the steel does the cool bands

1225
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:04,400
Oh, really so they have uh, 68 000 backers wow 10 million dollars, so they're definitely funded

1226
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,600
Is this the right kickstarter? Am I which one do I look at? Yeah, you're on it. Yeah

1227
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,360
You're right. I think they're going like an hour and a half or is that the original? How do I know?

1228
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:17,360
I'm not looking at the oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, this is pebble time. This has the new watch no compromises. Yeah. Okay. All right

1229
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:18,880
So here we go. This is

1230
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,400
Yeah, uh, this is pretty cool. All right. I'm gonna play just a little bit of it. Hey kickstarter. My name is eric

1231
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:30,560
I'm the founder of pebble. You may remember pebble from our first campaign when a bunch of you supported our quest

1232
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:35,440
To build the world's first real smartwatch. I do remember that. Okay, so

1233
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,040
Oh, okay, so you right when you jump in all the price levels are uh,

1234
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:47,840
Your choice of one pebble time steel, which includes your choice of color includes a leather strap an extra metal strap. Oh

1235
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,520
Oh, I really want to do that

1236
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,600
Hmm. Well, I don't know see this seems like it's hard to it's hard for me to gauge right now

1237
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,760
Which is the wearable watch to go behind but seems like pebbles the one doesn't it?

1238
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,680
At least for us maybe yeah

1239
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,360
I think I want to back at you guys

1240
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,720
I have a really cool completely online, uh,

1241
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,680
Development environment for it too. It's sweet

1242
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:17,600
You can be as long as you're on the same network as your phone

1243
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,680
You can just write code and push it right to your watch. I think I want to back it. Should I back it? I kind of

1244
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:25,520
I want and then I could if I got oh gosh, I want one now. Oh, this is the steel

1245
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,240
We're we're at a tipping point chris. There's there's there's two ways. This is going to go

1246
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:36,720
When apple come out with their apple watch that will set the um,

1247
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:42,720
Direction for the wearables market if apple make a success out of it

1248
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:48,800
Everyone else will jump onto that ship firmly and if apple's wearables flop

1249
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,360
it will be uh

1250
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:58,640
A novelty that never really gains any traction and it will be the likes of pebble that own that space

1251
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,440
And it will be a relatively small market

1252
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:07,520
So where do you want to be? Do you want to be either way pebble sounds like a safe bet? Yeah, I think so

1253
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,800
I think I think well that you know, like I said, they've got a lot of different brands

1254
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,760
I think I think well that you know, like I said, they've got first mover advantage

1255
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:19,840
They're far more far further along than the others in actually delivering a wearable device

1256
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,400
You know something that you can wear all day long that works

1257
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,880
One of the better things about the pebble is that i've had mine for over a year now

1258
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,680
And I think only two or three people have ever been like, oh, is that a smartwatch?

1259
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:33,200
It's just it just blends in. I don't think that these other devices are going to do that

1260
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,600
The thing apple has is giant gobs of money

1261
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:47,760
And yeah, and that that's something that pebble never has which is going to be hard to compete with and maybe they get the

1262
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,840
hacker mentality

1263
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,880
That you know people like us will play with it, but apple

1264
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,760
will have uh

1265
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,760
premium stores and

1266
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:03,120
Lots of news airtime on all the mainstream channels as a result of them being apple

1267
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:10,640
But here is the trick. It's open source, right mostly so at least so that means that any

1268
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:16,000
Low-end store that looks at the high fees to do partnership with apple. It still wants a phone

1269
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:21,520
A phone. Sorry a watch is probably going to do with the pebbles

1270
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,160
especially

1271
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,800
Yeah, the thing is the thing is is uh

1272
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,880
Uh, all the the hackability and open source stuff is great for the likes of us that are discussing this now

1273
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,480
But if I say to my wife i'm going to get one of these smartwatches and she's going to say to me one

1274
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:42,960
And i'm like, well it can tell me all of the things that's on my phone and the time

1275
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,400
She's going to say well, why don't you just look at your phone?

1276
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,880
Yeah, and and this is this

1277
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,280
This is how I feel about it

1278
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:57,440
It's nothing you see the problem is these watches in overall have been

1279
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:00,960
Marketed as a device for a consumer to buy

1280
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:06,480
I really think that these are devices for a store to offer to a customer to a member

1281
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:11,620
But like that or a cheap one that is subsidized by these businesses

1282
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:17,440
But for what what are you going to use it for? This is I haven't seen a compelling use case yet

1283
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,600
I use my pandora

1284
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,600
Or my

1285
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:31,120
Membership card on the store. It gives you more information and to the store they win more precise information about your actual buying habit

1286
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:37,600
But i've got nfc and my mobile phone. I already carry that everywhere. Why can't I do those things with my mobile phone?

1287
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,160
It's great. This is remote without having to take your your phone out of your pocket

1288
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,000
But my phone is out of my pocket. I'm sitting down. So why is that? Why is that compelling?

1289
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
What so how big is your phone?

1290
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:55,220
Uh, that's that's my like everyone that I see as these huge ginormous

1291
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:02,320
Fablets, I'm gonna call them. Yeah. Yeah, i've I've I had a note too and today i've just replaced it with a nexus 6

1292
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:09,840
So I I got I have the firefox west flame is my my my main phone and it's already to the point where it's like

1293
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:16,960
This is kind of large and I don't want anything bigger than this and yet I can't buy anything smaller than that now

1294
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,960
So it's it's honestly

1295
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,640
You could buy an abuntu phone. Yeah about the same size as the firefox flame

1296
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:31,680
I'm, actually I have both in my hand right now the firefox flame and the bq phone and they are pretty much identical size

1297
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,520
Pebble is nice when I get an email notification and my phone's in the other room

1298
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,640
But I can hear it and I can see the email and know that it's not worth getting up for

1299
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:44,480
Yeah, when I want to skip a song that's playing and I don't want to unlock my phone and deal with getting into the app

1300
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:45,920
To skip a song

1301
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,920
on

1302
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:53,460
Okay, so the song skipping if if you put yourself in an environment where that's more convenient

1303
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:56,320
Because it's on your wrist like for example

1304
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,400
If you're cycling for example

1305
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:04,880
And you've got your phone in a backpack and you've got your headphones in and your watch is on your wrist and you're cycling along

1306
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:11,200
You can be measuring your distance and velocity and all of that good stuff and you can skip tracks

1307
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:14,900
You I can see a use case for a smartwatch

1308
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:22,800
But you have to kind of think really hard and you can't see that most people are going to get value out of

1309
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,360
a device like that

1310
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,360
This is if you're an upper class businessman

1311
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:31,120
You're sitting in a really important meeting and your phone's on silent, but your wish is you know

1312
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,120
Giving you a buzz that your wife is calling you

1313
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:39,680
Upper class businessman doesn't know how to use his phone or his computer and therefore he won't know how to use his smartwatch either

1314
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,680
No

1315
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:48,000
Way of saying other end of conversation would be look at your watch now when you look at your watch

1316
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
You're gonna think you're looking at facebook

1317
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:54,880
Well, it's true I do sometimes that's that's the other thing

1318
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:01,200
Your guys are thinking about okay. Why I as a consumer will acquire a watch

1319
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:04,960
That's why i'm saying the future of these watches is not on you acquiring it

1320
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:12,080
It's in the companies that want the information from you will give it to you and then you're gonna start using some of these

1321
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:16,160
Uh leverage I don't understand this approach because the watch doesn't collect any data

1322
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,160
Oh, so this is the beauty of it once you are inside the store

1323
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:26,000
Usually they have patterns on on okay what things you decided to pay on the cash, right?

1324
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:31,520
On the cashier right with your membership card for you to get the discount. That's why they apply the discounts

1325
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:38,480
Okay, what about extra information on a product based on you closing your watch to the divide to the product?

1326
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,760
You take the watch doesn't do any sort of communication like that

1327
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,280
Well, I guess are you envisioning like these stores like the watches will get so cheap

1328
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,880
These stores will have like a branded watch. They give you as part of the membership program
