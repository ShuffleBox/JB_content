1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
I'm really glad that we got you on user, I think you're going to balance out those guys

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,660
from across the pond, you know what I'm saying?

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,860
What I think is cool about it is I feel like it's a show that I could play for somebody

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,720
that's non-technical and they wouldn't be totally lost or bored.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,220
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,040
And there's still enough in there for people that really like the technical discussion

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,760
where you get something deep in there.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,040
I think you guys struck a really good balance, I loved it.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:40,160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 267 for September 18th, 2018.

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's mostly patched together

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,080
and it's ready to go with a huge show.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
My name is Chris.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,080
My name is Wes.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
Hello, Wes.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,440
It's nice to be in studio, you know what I mean?

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,400
Oh yeah, you're here, you're operating and you're looking great and we've got a great

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
show today.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,280
I've got a lot of show in me.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,280
I've been off the air a little bit.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
It's pulling out the seams.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,600
It is, good thing I've got bands around me to hold me together.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,880
Well coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program, we'll get into IPFS, the

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,360
Interplanetary File System that works by you requesting a hash to the network and the network

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,800
finds the file.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,640
It's all been really conceptual until this week when Cloudflare has introduced their

26
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,480
IPFS gateway and we'll tell you how you can get started with this in a bit about the Interplanetary

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,340
File System.

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,840
Then you heard it right, Mr. Torvalds is taking some time.

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,360
He's got some patchwork to do, but this time it's on his self, on his own person.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,000
Person patches, people patches for Linus and we'll tell you what's going on with Linus.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,120
We'll read between the lines in a few places and ask if he's dealing with burnout and then

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,640
we'll discuss the new contributor code that has been committed I guess to the Linux kernel

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,120
would be the way to put it.

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:02,400
Some of the controversy surrounding that and maybe the idea that we're recognizing a new

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,000
pivot for the development of the Linux kernel.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,480
There's been a bunch of others like workflow and tools in the past and perhaps now we're

37
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,720
seeing something new.

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,320
We'll discuss that plus some people are saying there's going to be a fork.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,080
We'll talk about some other projects that have implemented code of conduct and how that's

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,600
going for them and then we'll end the show on a really great note.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,720
Wes and I have received our new work rigs.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,200
They came in just the other day, ThinkPad T480s.

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,360
I've had a chance to load mine up with GNU slash Linux.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,280
I'll tell you the specs, how I'm achieving battery life that will blow you just away

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,200
and the maybe bad news too.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,160
The bug that is in this series of laptops that affects CPU performance and the work

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,040
around for that and then we're going to talk about our setup.

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,240
What we're kind of doing differently from our past setups, we'll talk a little bit about

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,520
what's important in a work machine for us and maybe some of the plans that we have to

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,440
tweak these machines to make them a little better in production than they are out of

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
the box.

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,720
Maybe some software too, some stuff we've been playing around with.

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,380
So we've got a lot to get into.

54
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,800
So before we go any further, we've got to bring in the virtual level.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
We've got to.

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,280
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
Hello.

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Good afternoon from North Carolina.

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,080
Hey, welcome back, Alex.

60
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,400
It's good to hear from you.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,720
And how has the move gone?

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,680
Hey, I survived the hurricane.

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Wow.

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Welcome.

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Yeah, that is a hell of a welcome right there.

66
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Not normally what you have to deal with.

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Oh my gosh.

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,480
Well, it's good to have you back amongst us.

69
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,840
You probably heard Brent and Dan is in there as well as Eric, ironic or ironic or Mr. Badger

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
as I call him.

71
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,120
MiniMech and TechMav are all joining us in the virtual lug today.

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,400
And I wanted to start with this IPFS story because it sounds, well, it sounds out of

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,560
this world.

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,400
So Cloudflare says they are very excited to announce the Cloudflare IPFS gateway, an easy

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,260
way to access content from the interplanetary file system that doesn't require any special

76
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,520
software on your computer.

77
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Pretty neat.

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,880
Yeah, they say we hope that our gateway hosted at cloudflare-ipfs.com will serve as a platform

79
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,160
for many new, highly reliable and security enhanced web applications.

80
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,280
It sounds like this is just the first part of their distributed web gateway project.

81
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Yeah.

82
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,840
And this is all taking part on what is Cloudflare's quote unquote, crypto week.

83
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,320
They have crypto week.

84
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,760
And so this is part of it now.

85
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,200
You guys know this, but just to kind of sort of get into the background of IPFS, usually

86
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,440
when you access a website from your browser, your browser tracks down the origin server

87
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,080
or servers that are the ultimate centralized repository for a website.

88
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
Yeah.

89
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,000
You know, it doesn't have to be how it works really though, right?

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's a better way.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There's a better way.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,640
So you know, you start sending your request.

93
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,920
It sends a request from your computer to the origin server, wherever that might be in the

94
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
world.

95
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,340
And that server sends back the content to your computer.

96
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,680
That system has served us well for, I don't know, decades now, I guess.

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,320
But there's a pretty big downside.

98
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,880
Centralization makes it impossible to keep content online any longer than the origin

99
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,120
servers can host it.

100
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
And that can be expensive.

101
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Yeah.

102
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
And fair.

103
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,080
If you look at some of our like back catalog now, a lot of those links go nowhere because

104
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,960
those servers are offline or their pages have been brought down.

105
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,680
So what can we do about that?

106
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,640
Well, enter IPFS.

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Ooh.

108
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Hmm.

109
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,120
The interplanetary file system is really a peer to peer file system composed of thousands

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,380
of computers around the world, each of which stores files on behalf of the network.

111
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,560
These files can be anything like, you know, your cat pictures, 3D models, pictures of

112
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,320
Levi or even entire websites, five, what, million or billion files?

113
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,440
I can't, the number is so huge my brain can't even comprehend it, has already been uploaded

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,640
and published into IPFS.

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
That is impressive.

116
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
Yeah, that is.

117
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,360
They have a really good description of how it all works, including some graphics in a

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,040
blog post that we will have linked in the show notes, linuxunplug.com slash 267.

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,960
But it's like a block storage system, right?

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Yeah, I think the big thing is it's content addressable.

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
So with IPFS.

122
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Hmm, yeah, okay, that's, yeah, yeah.

123
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,060
It's not blocks, right?

124
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,240
If there's data blocks, but it's not like a block system like a drive.

125
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,040
Right now, so every single, you do group them into blocks, but every single block of data

126
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,080
stored in the system is addressable by its cryptographic hash of its content.

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,920
So that's how you can say like, I'm looking for this, I've got this hash, go reach out

128
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,700
and then the network in a peer to peer fashion can then, whoever has a block that matches

129
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,880
that hash can serve you the contents.

130
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,800
And that could be a number of systems.

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,100
And the network is what figures out where that's stored.

132
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
You can actually distribute them.

133
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,440
So if you've got, you know, you've got one, it's like a little CDN near you, but everyone

134
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
can play.

135
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
You don't have to have special permission.

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
I like that a lot.

137
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,000
And you probably figure there's a number of ways to access IPFS content.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,200
You can install IPFS on your machine and essentially become a node of the IPFS network.

139
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,160
And it probably is the best way to interact with the network if you were going to really

140
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
get down into the weeds.

141
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
If you're going to be developing applications that run on it or really using it a bunch.

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,840
But if you're just kind of curious, if you're IPFS curious, there's an easy way.

143
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,680
And of course you want to be able to bridge to the real world.

144
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,740
Now, of course there are already some of these bridges, but there's not that many organizations

145
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,880
out there running one who have the kind of reach and bandwidth that Cloudflare has.

146
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Right.

147
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
That's the big change here with Cloudflare doing this.

148
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,840
They have, they're setting up this HTTPS gateway to it and that is going to make it really

149
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,820
easy for people playing around.

150
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,720
So that's IPFS in a nutshell.

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Probably just whetted your appetite.

152
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,600
We could probably go way more into it really.

153
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Yeah.

154
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,920
There's a lot of those topics I would like to play with more and cover more.

155
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,960
But up until now it just had felt like, you know, it's like any project that's sort of

156
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,800
off its own corner, doesn't see wide adoption.

157
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,880
Maybe that can change now?

158
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,360
That's what I feel like changed actually.

159
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
You're right.

160
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,400
It feels like IPFS is no longer off in a corner where I have to go get this Go app off of

161
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,820
GitHub and build it myself to connect to the network now.

162
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,680
Now I can use my web browser and if you get the hash, they've just made it, you put the

163
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,160
gateway URL in there and then slash the hash.

164
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
And that's essentially it.

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,160
I mean, it's really simple.

166
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,300
So you could see how you could programmatically catch, you know, build fetchers and things

167
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,440
like that too for people that could go fetch the documents off of IPFS without requiring

168
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,520
any fancy client-side software, right?

169
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,280
Or if you want to use IPFS for your own things, backing things up or just providing content

170
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
to people.

171
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,560
Now you have a plain text link for regular folk.

172
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,200
So I also think the other next step is, you know, building your own gateway.

173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,760
So what, you know, spin up your own droplet or something and build your own gateway to

174
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
IPFS.

175
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,260
So that way you're not going through Cloudflare necessarily because they'll probably eventually

176
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,840
want to monetize that data, I would assume.

177
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,000
And we just can't, I mean, while it's nice of them to do this, we don't really know what

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
their intentions are or how long they're willing to do it.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,200
And we certainly, it's a nice thing to have, but we shouldn't rely on it.

180
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Yeah.

181
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Yeah.

182
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,240
And I am, I'm intrigued by the whole concept.

183
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,200
I want to play with it more down the road.

184
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,780
So I'm glad that they're making it easier because it's a good way to dip your toe.

185
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,440
Last week in the post show, Eric, Mr. Eric, the IT guy stopped by and gave us his recap

186
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,700
of the Libre application summit.

187
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,280
It feels like this summit's getting a lot of attention, and I think it's because they

188
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,880
have the right people there.

189
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,560
Well, Dan and Cassidy from Elementary OS made it as well, and they've created a post up

190
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,000
on their Medium blog.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,800
And Dan's here to tell us a little bit about his trip.

192
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,080
And Dan, I'm curious, what was your big takeaway from the Libre application summit?

193
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Well, it was just like a really intimate setting compared to some of the other conferences

194
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,360
that I've attended.

195
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,880
So it was really kind of an interesting, different, really experimental startup-y kind of feel

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,440
as far as a conference goes.

197
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
That's interesting.

198
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,720
Like everything was really kind of loose and undefined, and it was kind of like create

199
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,520
in the conference as you go, schedule talks were kind of shuffled around and new little

200
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,560
lightning talks inserted in between.

201
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,920
And it was like it was very fluid environment.

202
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,640
It was really interesting.

203
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,000
Now Eric, he seemed to observe last week that there was, I don't know how to put it that

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,160
doesn't sound like corporate speak, but like multiple stakeholders there.

205
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,640
There was folks from the Plasma Camp, the Gnome Camp, and different priorities in the

206
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
open source community were there.

207
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,880
Did you get that sense as well, or did it seem like there was a particular audience

208
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
it was playing to?

209
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
Yeah, it was definitely diverse.

210
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:17,840
Actually, there was a moment where Cassidy and I had just given our group talk, and then

211
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,960
immediately after Alish from KDE got up to give his talk, and kind of the premise of

212
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,200
our talks were like the exact opposite strategy, and it was really interesting because we were

213
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,960
able to kind of poke fun at each other and kind of say, you know, like we're doing things

214
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,640
completely differently, but what can we learn from each other?

215
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
That is good.

216
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
That is good.

217
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,840
One of the people who puts it in the chat room, he was there, he says, you know, had

218
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,040
a real un-conference feel in a good way.

219
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
I like that.

220
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I like it.

221
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
And what do you think of the location?

222
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,600
Denver, some people love it.

223
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Some people think they should move it for next year.

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,760
How much do you think that matters in an event like this?

225
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm asking you as somebody who does this as a full-time job, would you travel just about

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,720
anywhere in the States for an event like this, or do you think location really does make

227
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,680
a difference in who's able to contribute?

228
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,080
For me, definitely having it in the States as opposed to in Europe made it a lot easier

229
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,440
for me to get out there because our travel budget isn't that big.

230
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,240
So it's nice to have more conferences that are Stateside.

231
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,240
I think that it is definitely a thing when we have so many people that are either volunteers

232
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,320
or like individuals or, you know, not representing large organizations, that having more conferences

233
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,560
that are easier to attend for those people should be a priority in the overall community.

234
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,900
You definitely piqued my interest.

235
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,400
You and Eric both have gotten me thinking this is something I'm going to have to attend.

236
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,160
Hopefully the timing and everything works out pretty well.

237
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,400
Maybe you and I could both go next year.

238
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,240
Oh, that's a great idea.

239
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,280
We can lobby them to change the name in person.

240
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,280
There you go.

241
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
Hey, now you're thinking.

242
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,760
Mr. Full-Time Podcaster over there, if you didn't catch episode 266 of the show last

243
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,780
week, we announced that Jupiter Broadcasting has joined Linux Academy.

244
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,820
We laid out the grand vision, our plans for the next few months, how we want to utilize

245
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,720
the Patreon funding, and all of that is right at the top of 266.

246
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,920
So I encourage you to go give a listen to that if you can.

247
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,000
User Air is back as well.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We announced that last week.

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,680
Dan's one of the hosts on there along with Popey and Joe, and I think I'll be on the

250
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
next one.

251
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,840
I'm not positive yet, but my plan is to go on there and talk about my recent, what do

252
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,840
you even describe that?

253
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Life event.

254
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Life event.

255
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Yeah.

256
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
All the surgery and all that.

257
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,160
Can I just say, Chris, it's so, I hope I speak for a lot of the listeners, it's amazing

258
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,840
to hear you back and healthy, and we're all just super pleased for you.

259
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Well, thank you, Alex.

260
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,320
I appreciate that.

261
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,700
It is fun for me to be back because I do miss doing the shows, but I very much appreciate

262
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,040
Wes has been filling in for me on Linux Action News.

263
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
He's been killing it.

264
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Killing it.

265
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
You set the standard.

266
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,040
I just got to live up to it.

267
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,760
I mean, some people show up and they fill in, but then other people, they step up, and

268
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,160
Wes is doing, you can tell, he does the research, he dives into the story a little.

269
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I listen.

270
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I hear that.

271
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Look at you.

272
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
He's doing the research.

273
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
So that's been, him and Joe have been great on Linux Action News recently.

274
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,360
I think it's 69, 70, and 71 if you want to go catch those recent episodes.

275
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,080
I think they've turned out great, and it's a little different since I'm not there, which

276
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,640
is funny for me because Linux Action News is the child of the Linux Action show.

277
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,760
So I have a really strong sense of, not ownership, it's like co-ownership, but it's a strong

278
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
sense of co-ownership.

279
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
You gave that to the world.

280
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,160
Yeah, so it's weird not to be on there, but at the same time, it's like now I get to listen

281
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,360
to it, which has been great.

282
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,580
Also recent tech snaps, killing it.

283
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,320
You've been filling in for me extra hard there.

284
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,880
You've had Wimpy come in recently and fill in, and on the last week's episode, Alan Jude

285
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
stopped by.

286
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
Amazing.

287
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
Both of them.

288
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,120
As you'd expect, that's an extended edition of the Tech Snap program because, Alan.

289
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,680
And then this week, I won't say who yet.

290
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,980
I'll tease that next week, but someone you likely know, a member of the community who

291
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,040
really knows his stuff, a great guy, is going to be joining Wes if all works out this week

292
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,740
for the next Tech Snap that gets recorded.

293
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,220
So there's been some really great stuff going on here at Jupiter Broadcasting, even with

294
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,160
me away, the wheels of progress, I guess.

295
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Oh, yeah.

296
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,120
Turning and turning, and there's just going to be more and more.

297
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,920
One of the things that we have coming up soon is we're going to be looking at ways to simplify

298
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,960
and automate the production part of the show.

299
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,280
So you can't really automate Joe.

300
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,920
Joe is our editor, and that is just a process that you need somebody talented to sit down

301
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
and go through.

302
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
So we can't...

303
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,360
Thankfully, you just feed him flax and then podcasts come out, so it works really nicely.

304
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Yeah, right?

305
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,600
That's how it works.

306
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,700
But everything after Joe could be done by computers.

307
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,560
And that really is going to be kind of our goal, is we'll sit here, we'll do the shows.

308
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,680
You can't replace us, hopefully, yet.

309
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,040
Then Joe, you can't replace him.

310
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,720
But everything after Joe could be automated.

311
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,360
And so we'll be building tools around that.

312
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,820
We'll open source whatever we work on.

313
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,960
We're going to try to do it all in our new public GitLab instance that Eric has set up

314
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
for us.

315
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,200
What is the URL for that, Eric?

316
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
It's Jupiter...

317
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
What is it?

318
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Jupitercode.io?

319
00:14:53,200 --> 00:15:00,180
Yeah, it's GitLab.Jupitercode.io, and it's just going to be the start of a collection

320
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,680
of tools that we're going to use.

321
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,880
Hopefully get something like a Jenkins or something along those lines up and running

322
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
at some point.

323
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,640
Yet another domain name, Chris.

324
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
I know.

325
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
I love my domain names.

326
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
You got a collection now.

327
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
I really do.

328
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,080
Turns out, a little side, when you sell a business, those domain names are actually

329
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
worth something.

330
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,200
So it was an investment all along, and I just didn't even know it.

331
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,960
So the other potential use for that GitLab instance that Eric has set up is the issue

332
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,960
tracker.

333
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,200
I'm not sure how I want to do this yet, but I will be rolling out feature requests and

334
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
content requests.

335
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,680
And they might be different systems, or they might be together, or I don't know exactly

336
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
how we're going to do it.

337
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,680
But I see those as two distinct things, a technical thing you want from the Jupiter

338
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,040
Broadcasting Network, like a type of feed.

339
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,200
This feed doesn't work for me because of X so far.

340
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,960
Or I'm trying to build this app, and it would be great if I could get a JSON of X, Y, and

341
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,080
Z shows, versus, hey, it'd be really nice if you had video.

342
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,320
Those are two different requests.

343
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,560
One's a feature request, and one's a kind of like a, I guess they're both kind of feature

344
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,520
requests, versus I'd like you guys to talk about IPFS more.

345
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,040
That's a content request, and that feels like a separate channel.

346
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,200
But I'm not sure.

347
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,160
But whatever we do, we'll do it out in the open.

348
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,880
Whatever code we create, we'll open source it.

349
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,480
And then, if time allows, we'll try to document as best we can.

350
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,000
That's going to be an area that we're a little weak at, but we might be able to get some

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
help.

352
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,160
Yeah, and that's where feedback from you guys telling us where it's weak or what you need

353
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
to actually use those tools would be great.

354
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Yeah, so those are things that we're now working on, and I think when we actually have something

355
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,760
to share, we'll talk about it.

356
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,660
And if we end up running into some fun problems or have to build some Linux boxes, I actually

357
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,440
know we're going to be building some droplets to do some of this.

358
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
We could talk about all that stuff and the software we're using and the projects and

359
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
how they're connecting.

360
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,520
So it could be some good stuff.

361
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,600
We won't overdo it with the podcast stuff, but when we have an interesting thing around

362
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,420
open source and free software to talk about, we'll do it, and I'm looking forward to that.

363
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,240
So those are all things that are sort of coming, and you can check out TechSnap and Linux Action

364
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,920
News to hear something a little different there.

365
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,680
But I think that's all the delays I had.

366
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,000
Did I have any other things I could...

367
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't know.

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,880
I mean, do you have anything else to pull out here?

369
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
I don't think so.

370
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
We could talk about our laptops.

371
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
We've got these new ThinkPads.

372
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Oh, yeah.

373
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Oh.

374
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,640
But we should probably talk about the major thing that happened in Linux this week, actually

375
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
two major things.

376
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Yeah.

377
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Let's be responsible, I guess.

378
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
That's our job as podcasters.

379
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
That's what we're here for, right?

380
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
All right.

381
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,160
So this week, when Linus was announcing a new RC of the current development kernel,

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:37,180
he added something a little unusual that boiled down to his temporary stepping away of maintainership

383
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:43,520
of the Linux kernel, which is a rather historic moment in the 20-year history of Linux in

384
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,840
itself.

385
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,720
But his announcement really has been shaking the entire internet.

386
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,640
People are really going all off the walls on this, and he really owns some of his recent

387
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,680
behavior or some of his infamous behavior that's been going on for a while.

388
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,660
He talks about how the discussions both public and on private mailing lists have been building

389
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,060
for years.

390
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,580
Some of these discussions came about recently, though, in probably a more louder tone because

391
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:17,280
of some recent scheduling snafus around the maintainer summit where Linus had, quote,

392
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,840
accidentally scheduled his vacation to take place.

393
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,000
And then in the subsequent discussions about moving the maintainer summit's location so

394
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,500
that way Linus could attend, it brought some things to the surface.

395
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,000
And he gets into it a little bit.

396
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,780
He says, it's not like this discussion itself is any way new to this week.

397
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,880
We've been discussing maintainership and community for years.

398
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,640
And I think when he uses the term maintainership and community, they're really loaded terms

399
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
in this context.

400
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,920
I think what Linus is saying is, maintainership is not just maintaining the code that goes

401
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,360
into the area you're responsible for, but it's also all the human aspects.

402
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,840
And then he brings in community as well.

403
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Right.

404
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,720
I mean, this is a human project made by humans interacting.

405
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,040
And yes, there's like the log of git commits, but everything else that goes before that

406
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,200
actually happens, you also have to manage.

407
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,160
And he's saying the discussion of what that role is and how it interacts with the other

408
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,440
members of the community has been going on for years.

409
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
And I see that.

410
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,720
I did some searching around.

411
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm sure you could find stuff before this, but I saw conversations in this regard back

412
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,520
in 2009.

413
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,920
And you've seen it if you followed Linux for a while now, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, even,

414
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,040
some of these conversations about Linus's outbursts were being had.

415
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,900
But he says, what's new this week is really my reaction to it and perhaps me being a little

416
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
more introspective.

417
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,740
And there's two parts to that.

418
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:47,520
One was simply my own reaction to having screwed up my scheduling of the maintainership summit.

419
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:54,880
Yes, I was somewhat embarrassed about having screwed up my calendar, but honestly, I was

420
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,440
mostly hopeful that I wouldn't have to go to the kernel summit.

421
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,680
He didn't want to go to his I mean, his the summit for his his kernel.

422
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,720
Yeah, he didn't want to go to it.

423
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,200
And he kind of is admitting to intentionally booking his vacation.

424
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,960
Clearly there's some psychological factors here to play.

425
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,540
He says, I was mostly hopeful that I wouldn't have to go to the kernel summit that I have

426
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,760
gone to every year for just about the last two decades.

427
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,200
Well, but that whole situation then started a whole different kind of discussion.

428
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,440
And kind of incidentally to that one, the second part was that I realized that I had

429
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,620
completely misread some of the people involved.

430
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,160
That's a big admission.

431
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,000
That is a that is a big admission.

432
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,040
This is where he says the whole look yourself in the mirror moment comes in.

433
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,860
So here we are me finally on the one hand realizing that it wasn't actually funny, or

434
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,240
a good sign that I was hoping to just skip the yearly kernel summit entirely.

435
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,800
But on the other hand, realizing that I really had been ignoring some fairly deep seated

436
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,960
feelings in the community.

437
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,920
He then writes, This is my reality.

438
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,660
I'm not an emotionally empathetic kind of person.

439
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,240
And that probably doesn't come as a big surprise to anybody.

440
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,040
Nope, nope, not at all.

441
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,000
No, I would think we knew he wasn't big on reading others emotions covered it.

442
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,240
In fact, you might almost say it's it was a classic aspect of Linus really.

443
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,600
He says the fact that I then misread people and did not realize it for years of how badly

444
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,740
I've judged the situation and contributed to an unprofessional environment is not good.

445
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,080
This week, people in our community confronted me about my lifetime of not understanding

446
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
emotions.

447
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,040
So something happened this last week, he says this week, people in our community confronted

448
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,120
me about my lifetime of not understanding emotions.

449
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,880
My flippant attacks and emails have been both unprofessional and uncalled for, especially

450
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,000
at times when I made it personal.

451
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,100
In my quest for a better patch.

452
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,840
This made sense to me.

453
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,440
I now know this was not okay.

454
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,040
And I am truly sorry.

455
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,240
That reads is genuine to me.

456
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,680
Yeah, I mean, I don't, you know, he's in a position where he doesn't really have to

457
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
write.

458
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
It's his project.

459
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
It's his, you know, he could write whatever he wants.

460
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,080
It's this is really heartfelt, and it's very public, very public.

461
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,600
He knows as he's writing this, every word is going to get quoted in news articles, it

462
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,620
was on CNBC, the entire email, it's going to be all over the web, millions, if not definitely

463
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,980
hundreds of thousands of people will read these words.

464
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,600
And he's owning it right here.

465
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,100
You got to respect that.

466
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,080
That's not an easy thing to do even in private.

467
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,340
Yeah, right.

468
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,560
And he's doing it in a very, very, very public way.

469
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,060
But also, it's a watershed moment for the perception of the Linux kernel team.

470
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,760
You know, I think you could clearly say Linux kernel has been sort of held up high by many

471
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,760
people up on the top of a mountain.

472
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:56,600
This is the example of a community where your technical contribution is the sole thing that

473
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
decides your merit.

474
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,420
And if you submit a shit patch to the kernel, you'll be told it's a shit patch and they'll

475
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,720
yell at you.

476
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
And it's not based on the color of your skin.

477
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,200
It's based on the technical merits of your submission.

478
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,520
And this is Linus, the holder of that image saying, that is no longer true.

479
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,960
We must also try to be empathetic.

480
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,840
We must also try to be, in a word, inclusive.

481
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,600
He doesn't use that word.

482
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
That's essentially what he's getting at.

483
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Yeah, we'll get to more, you know, that spirit of being excellent to each other.

484
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Yeah.

485
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,520
He says the above is basically a long-winded way to get to a somewhat painful personal

486
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,300
admission that, hey, I need to change some of my behavior.

487
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,640
And I want to apologize to the people that my personal behavior hurt and possibly drove

488
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,280
away from kernel development entirely.

489
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,600
And then he writes it in one short paragraph.

490
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,600
The one that, when I read that Monday morning, I had to take a moment.

491
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,120
He says, I am going to take time off and get some assistance on how to understand people's

492
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,600
emotions and respond appropriately.

493
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,000
He's stepping down as the maintainer temporarily, handing the reins over to Greg KH, which seems

494
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,040
like a huge moment.

495
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,880
I mean, has this happened before?

496
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,640
I don't think so.

497
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,640
I know he's taken vacations.

498
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
I know he's got hobbies.

499
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,160
But even then, on his vacation, he's posting RC updates to the mailing list.

500
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,680
Yes, he often does.

501
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,760
He often does.

502
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,320
He is really owning this entire thing and calling himself unprofessional.

503
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,060
He's apologizing to people.

504
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,680
And that, to me, feels like it's going to have ripple effects throughout the open source

505
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
community.

506
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,540
And it must also say something about how much he cares about this project and the people

507
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,000
that he's worked so long with to build the project.

508
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,080
Because it's easy enough, especially as the guy at the top, to say, whatever, my way or

509
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,640
the highway, I don't need you contributors.

510
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm going to take my colonel over here.

511
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,960
Or it's easy to just back away and never come back.

512
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,840
It really seems like he cares about it and wants to keep contributing and is trying to

513
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,160
find how to do that best.

514
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:04,120
And I find there's a big disconnect, I guess what I'm trying to say, between what the public

515
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,600
reaction to this has been, which has really spun the whole gamut.

516
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,840
People are freaking out.

517
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,640
I have seen conspiracies about Linus being blackmailed.

518
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,280
And there's even in the GitHub thread about the code of conduct change we're about to

519
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,120
talk about, there's someone offering Linus shelter if he needs to be protected from whoever's

520
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,920
out to get him.

521
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,200
The range of responses to this has been pretty extreme.

522
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,260
But I think Linus sees it in a much more practical sort of way, as he typically would.

523
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,120
He refers it as a pain point.

524
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:42,160
And I would swap that word pain point, and I would say a transition moment or a shift.

525
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,540
He writes, put another way, when asked at conferences, I occasionally talk about how

526
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,080
pain points and kernel development have generally not been about the technical issues, but about

527
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,300
the inflection points where development flow and behavior changed.

528
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:58,260
These pain points have been about managing the flow of patches, often been associated

529
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,240
with big tooling changes, like moving from making releases with patches and tarballs,

530
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,700
to discussions about how Linus doesn't scale up to 15 years ago.

531
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,880
Even the ones about using BitKeeper and then having to write Git in order to get past the

532
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,340
point that was no longer working for us.

533
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,040
We have had that kind of pain point.

534
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,680
We haven't had that kind of pain point in about a decade.

535
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,440
But this week felt like that kind of pain point to me.

536
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,680
And I think you could replace the word pain point with that kind of transition, that kind

537
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,840
of shift.

538
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,480
It's a 20 year old project that dominates the world.

539
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,880
It has to have these kinds of changes every now and then, and sometimes they're painful

540
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
ones.

541
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,240
Yeah, I mean changing workflows, there's all these human factors that aren't about the

542
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,960
actual commits, how they get there, how you work with them, what gets approved, what's

543
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,960
the dialogue that has to go through to get it approved.

544
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
How do you make that work?

545
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,960
And that's going to change when you have 10 contributors or 10,000 contributors and over

546
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
time.

547
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,040
And maybe you could argue there was a time where technical excellency was of absolute

548
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:05,520
importance, especially when you're competing with a lot of cutthroat commercial companies.

549
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,760
And I don't think he's saying it's not of utmost importance.

550
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,640
I haven't seen anything that says that, you know, just because you're nice means your

551
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,640
patch gets accepted.

552
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,640
Right?

553
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,960
That doesn't have to be that way.

554
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Yeah.

555
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah.

556
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,720
It'll be really interesting long term to see if he can stick to this and how long has he

557
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
gone for.

558
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,960
He writes about seeing folks at the maintainer summit, but he doesn't really say how long

559
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,840
he's going to be gone either.

560
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
Yeah.

561
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,280
So Greg will finish up this kernel and we'll see about the next.

562
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Yeah.

563
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,160
So he just says, yeah, I'll be out for 4.19.

564
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
But 4.19 is fairly far.

565
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,760
It's at RC4 right now.

566
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,760
So it's pretty far in the development process.

567
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,640
Something tells me he might not be back for 4.20.

568
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
We will just have to wait and see.

569
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,360
And then once he does come back, we have to wait and see if there actually is a tone change.

570
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Yeah, right.

571
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,360
I mean, he's setting this from the top.

572
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,400
How does that filter down through all the levels of contributors and how does that affect,

573
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,880
you know, new people joining the project and how it goes?

574
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,480
Does anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts on the line of stepping down for a bit or

575
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,640
him trying to take care of himself and, you know, fix himself up for a bit?

576
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
Yeah.

577
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,880
I mean, given another Libre application summit plug, Cassidy did a talk about technical problems

578
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,480
versus social problems.

579
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,180
And the fact that as technical people, we always want to concentrate on how to solve

580
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,180
things with code.

581
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:26,640
And sometimes we forget that solving social problems is a often faster and more effective

582
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,560
way to get the results that we want.

583
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,500
So I think it's really important for someone like Linus to say, hey, you know what?

584
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,040
Social problems are actually important too, and we need to really think about the kind

585
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,880
of problems that we're creating for ourselves and not addressing them.

586
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Yeah.

587
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,600
I have at times come on the air and kind of defended the way Linus works because of the

588
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,080
results seem to me to speak for themselves.

589
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,400
But then I kind of, this week when this news came out, I kind of put myself in the position

590
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,480
of, well, what if I talk to my team this way?

591
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,320
What if I just like, you know, just tore you up for doing something, you know, like what

592
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,920
if you made a mistake in land and I just ripped you up for it?

593
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,960
That would not be productive.

594
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,200
There's that element of, you know, it wouldn't fly in a workplace or other professional environment

595
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,080
where you expect to have standards about how people interact with you, even when they're

596
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
upset or you're being chastised.

597
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,520
And just because it's an open source project, now maybe if it's, you know, your open source

598
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,580
project that you've been doing for by yourself with for two years in your basement, okay,

599
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,160
you set the standards, but Linux is not there anymore.

600
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Yeah.

601
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,240
And remember, it's, you know, partially governed by that foundation too, which may play roles

602
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
in some of this.

603
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,720
Brent, you've noticed a trend though in just project leads sort of stepping back and some

604
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,200
officially, some unofficially.

605
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Yeah.

606
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,800
It feels like maybe once a month on the show here, we talk about someone who's either stepping

607
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,120
back officially or unofficially just to take a break or go travelling or try to find themselves.

608
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,740
I mean, you're kind of taking a little bit of a forced break, aren't you?

609
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,180
So just wondering if, you know, some of these, well, most of the people in the open source

610
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,760
community are so dedicated and yet maybe they're not taking enough time for themselves.

611
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Yeah.

612
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Especially hard when it's a passion project.

613
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Right.

614
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,720
I mean, how many like single person distros do we worry about and talk about because you

615
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,200
see like, well, can they support it?

616
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,200
And when life changes, will there be people to fall back so it keeps going?

617
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Yeah.

618
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Yeah, exactly.

619
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,800
So I hope he is able to take this time and I hope it is productive for him.

620
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,000
I do think it would be good not just for getting more people involved with the project because

621
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,640
it's entirely possible that people have been scared away from contributing to Linux.

622
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,960
It seems to be that's what Greg infers, you know, in a post we're about to talk about

623
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,280
is that people have been scared away from the project, that the existing code of conflict

624
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,140
hasn't worked and Linus has sort of been the representation of that.

625
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,160
But more than that, I think it could be good long term for the reputation of Linux.

626
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,680
I think a lot of times when Linus kind of goes off the handle and then people report

627
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,600
on it, it kind of puts Linux in that amateur light a little bit.

628
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,840
And I think it can be easy to if you are, you know, more thick skinned, you can be like,

629
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,400
well, okay, like I can take it.

630
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,480
I know where Linus is coming from.

631
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,880
I know his intention is just to get good patches.

632
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,200
But it's also easy if you're like, well, I could spend my time, I'm a smart developer

633
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,320
contributing to this project, or oh, I see like all those free BSD guys, they're really

634
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
nice.

635
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
They don't yell at anyone.

636
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Maybe that's just my preferred work style.

637
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,360
I'm going to go over there.

638
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,400
We do see that actually, we do see that.

639
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,420
And you know, I think what we're about to get into is the second bit of news of Linus

640
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,600
stepping down for a bit and handing the reins over to Greg, that in itself would have been

641
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,540
a huge story for this week that we could talk about all day.

642
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:40,440
But I think it has to be held in context with also the new change in the code of conduct.

643
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,920
So in the past, the Linux kernel, for not a long time, but for a few years now, has

644
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:53,480
had a code of conflict that essentially outlined the rules for conflict if it arises.

645
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,560
And this week, submitted before Linus's resignation email, he committed a code of conduct change.

646
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,000
Now the introduction here is written by Greg Kh.

647
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,160
And I think it's important that we get into this.

648
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:11,920
He writes, the code of conflict is not achieving its implicit goal of fostering civility and

649
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,360
the spirit of being excellent to each other.

650
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,920
So that's Greg right there writing that it's not currently achieving its goal.

651
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
It's not working for us.

652
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,840
The code of conflict is not working.

653
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,080
He then writes, explicit guidelines have demonstrated success in other projects and

654
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,600
other areas of the kernel.

655
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,640
I can't speak to any authority if the code of conflict has worked or not.

656
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,320
Greg is in a better position than I to know if they need a code of conduct.

657
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,400
And we're probably going to argue and debate the specifics of what that code might look

658
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,000
like.

659
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,680
But I think it's interesting to see the reasons and the goals that Greg in particular here

660
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,320
and the kernel maintainers are looking for.

661
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,360
He writes, here is a new code of conduct statement for the wider kernel.

662
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,040
It's based on the contributor covenant as described at www.contributor-covenant.org.

663
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,880
From this point forward, we should abide by these rules in order to help make the kernel

664
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,720
community a welcoming environment to participate in.

665
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,000
So to appreciate the new code of conduct, I want to read to you the old code of conflict,

666
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,240
which is just two paragraphs.

667
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,440
It's pretty simple.

668
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,360
It goes, the Linux kernel development effort is a very personal process compared to, quote,

669
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,400
traditional ways of developing software.

670
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,200
Your code and your ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique

671
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,040
and criticism.

672
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,960
The review will almost always require improvements to the code before it can be included in the

673
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
kernel.

674
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,520
Know that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for

675
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,040
the overall success of Linux.

676
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,640
The development process has been proven to create the most robust operating system kernel

677
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
ever.

678
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,360
And we do not want to do anything to cause the quality of submissions and eventual result

679
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,160
to ever decrease.

680
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,000
If, however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable due

681
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,440
to this process, that is not acceptable.

682
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:01,360
If so, please contact Linux Foundation's technical advisory board or the individual members,

683
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,880
and they will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability.

684
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,480
For more information on who is the technical advisory board and their roles, please see

685
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,440
and then insert the URL.

686
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,400
That is essentially the entire code of conflict.

687
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Pretty straightforward.

688
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,920
It essentially says be nice to each other, expect to have a few conflicts here and there

689
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,440
because everybody's really passionate.

690
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
That's essentially what it's saying.

691
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
Right.

692
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,560
You're not going to have, no project this size is going to have no conflicts.

693
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Right.

694
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,640
The rule on how to communicate, it's a set of rules to guide conflict.

695
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,280
That's changed now.

696
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,720
The new contributor covenant code of conduct really lays out the rules and guidelines on

697
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,400
how to communicate within the project.

698
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,180
It starts with a pledge.

699
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,160
The contributor covenant code of conduct starts with this.

700
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,160
In the interest of fostering opening and welcoming environments, we as contributors and maintainers

701
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:56,780
pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience

702
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,280
for everyone.

703
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,720
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include using welcoming

704
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,400
and inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully

705
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,600
accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the community, and showing

706
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,640
empathy towards other community members.

707
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,720
Now I would pause here that so we got inclusive language, which is a bit vague, but being

708
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,800
respectful to different viewpoints and experiences, that is an area that I think is actually pretty

709
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
important.

710
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,400
To that end, we may have to consider being inclusive to Linus himself, who perhaps like

711
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,720
some of the many other developers I've met in my life, has a certain type of personality

712
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,280
that is very driven.

713
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,020
It is unempathetic.

714
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:46,320
It's the kind of personality that has the audacity to think they can create a world-dominating

715
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
operating system.

716
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,000
And when he announces Linux, he starts humbly, but just the idea that you could go out there

717
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,120
and create something better than what Bell Labs had made, or what people staffed at universities

718
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,400
getting hundreds of thousands of dollars a year could create, to have the viewpoint that

719
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,480
you could make something better, that takes sort of an absurd personality.

720
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,680
It takes somebody who's maybe a bit obtuse in other areas.

721
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,000
I've met many of developers that are totally normal personalities, totally normal social

722
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,900
lives, all that kind of stuff.

723
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,780
But I've also met a lot of developers that maybe are a bit off socially.

724
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,080
They're a bit off on the personality.

725
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,100
They may even have a personality disorder that prevents them from having all of the

726
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,740
tools necessary to understand someone else's emotions.

727
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,000
And if that is the case, then we must also be inclusive of them.

728
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
And Linus may be one of those people.

729
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
Right.

730
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,600
I mean, you have people on the thick skin side of things, and you have people on the

731
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
thin skin.

732
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,880
And I don't think it's right that either side gets to dictate entirely that they meet on

733
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
their side.

734
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,880
We need to find a good way in the middle where you can still be yourself, but there are guidelines.

735
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,440
There are people from way different backgrounds and experiences and styles of communicating

736
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,600
so that you can all work productively together.

737
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Yes.

738
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,760
Now, so far, all of this is pretty common sense.

739
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,080
Nothing really too concerning in any of the language.

740
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,600
Some people can make the argument you don't need to define this stuff.

741
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,320
But I think looking at the discourse of the modern internet, I think it's probably pretty

742
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,380
clear you do need to define some of these things because the internet can be a dumpster

743
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,680
fire of comments and horrible things.

744
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,240
And we certainly see it in other things, right?

745
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,840
I mean, you have these roles when you work for a business or are part of a community

746
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,200
or a volunteer organization.

747
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,120
I mean, even we go to LinuxFest Northwest every year, they have a code of conduct as

748
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
well.

749
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Right.

750
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,200
And I think I want to separate out the use of a code of conduct with the specific code

751
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,840
of conduct they have now implemented.

752
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I think those are...

753
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
That's important.

754
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Yeah.

755
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
They're different things.

756
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,780
And I'll tell you, there's one area, and there's a few in here that concern me, but there's

757
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,200
one area that jumped out at me as a potential issue.

758
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,960
And it's about...

759
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
It's two things, really.

760
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,360
The maintainers have the right, it reads, and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject

761
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,580
comments, commits, code, Wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned

762
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:01,840
to this code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors

763
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,320
that they deem, quote, inappropriate, threatening, or offensive or harmful.

764
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,960
Some vagary there, but pretty understandable.

765
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,280
What is inappropriate?

766
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
What is offensive?

767
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,200
Those are all things that'll have to be fleshed out as that happens, unfortunately.

768
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,200
The enforcers are going to be key to this thing working, right?

769
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Yes.

770
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,860
The level-headedness that they go with this, the balance that they take, is going to make

771
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,360
or break this thing.

772
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,760
And we are watching a massive experiment now unfold.

773
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,540
We are watching a fairly well-defined, but vague language, code of conduct be applied

774
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,480
to one of the world's most important software projects ever on a massive public scale.

775
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,400
And now we're going to see how it gets implemented and how it gets enforced.

776
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,800
And there is an area where there could be particular chances for abuse.

777
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,300
They write, this code of conduct applies with both within the project spaces and in public

778
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,480
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

779
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Examples.

780
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Now, I like this.

781
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
They define the examples of this.

782
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
This is good.

783
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,040
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address,

784
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,400
makes sense, posting on an official social media account, like the project's Twitter

785
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:16,500
account or something, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

786
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,280
Clearly defined, these are public spaces in which this code of conduct is still going

787
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
to apply to you.

788
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
Right.

789
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,140
But then the next sentence sort of undoes all of those examples and just makes it really

790
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,740
vague and arbitrary.

791
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:35,560
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers,

792
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,500
i.e. the people that are in charge of enforcement can decide what qualifies as representation

793
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,560
at the time of enforcement, is how I read that.

794
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,960
And by putting that in there, they completely undo all of the specific examples where you

795
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,600
could clearly define when you're representing the project.

796
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,520
That kind of vagary, I think, can lead to abuse.

797
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,100
I mean, it also depends, I think, how it's applied, right?

798
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
You said it really well.

799
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,600
This is a tool for the maintainers in the community.

800
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,520
It can be used poorly or it could be used well.

801
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,040
And if you've defined these things up ahead, maybe there's a new thing you're attending

802
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,520
and the maintainers want you to know that you are going to be a representative.

803
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
That's OK.

804
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,440
If after the fact they say, you know, you were really representative there and you didn't

805
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
behave correctly, that's where it really could get into trouble.

806
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,160
And who defines what the borders are there?

807
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:25,960
So say you're part of a project, say you're part of the Clojure project now, and you go

808
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,960
to an event to go to a Clojure booth and you're there representing this project.

809
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,160
Well, let's say later on you decide to go and get a few drinks with some people at the

810
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:39,900
event and you post a selfie of getting super wasted at a bar on your Twitter feed.

811
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,760
Are you a public representative all of a sudden still?

812
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
Like where does the border?

813
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
It needs to be really clear.

814
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
That kind of stuff.

815
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Yeah, it needs to be discussed.

816
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,800
If that could get you kicked out of the project, you need to be really clear where the line

817
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
is.

818
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Right.

819
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,160
And then this also doesn't really discuss what are that, you know, is it your band

820
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
the first time?

821
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,160
Are there warnings?

822
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,520
Are you there so that people, you know, have recourse and feel like they're being fairly

823
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,320
treated after being accused of these guidelines?

824
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
I don't know.

825
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,040
Eric, you point out it really comes down to who the enforcers are and how they behave.

826
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,600
Yeah, that's that's where my concern lies.

827
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,200
Because if if your enforcers are more thin skinned, then you've you've got a problem

828
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,880
because it seems like a very critical and understood part of I mean, just the development

829
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,200
process is you're you're hanging out at a hack fest or something and and you and two

830
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,320
other developers get into this huge argument over, you know, what sort of encryption screen

831
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,200
encryption scheme to use and you fight it out, you argue about it, and then you come

832
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,920
to some kind of decision and go grab a beer.

833
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:42,380
But someone who's external to to the community, someone who's external to that that process,

834
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:48,000
you know, having been there multiple times as a systems engineer, it's part of the process.

835
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's almost necessary.

836
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,600
Yeah, especially when people are passionate.

837
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,840
I mean, we could what if this thing quite a bit.

838
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:56,600
I think but your core point about how the enforcement gets done and who does it, I think

839
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,880
is the takeaway because it's, you know, if they use if they're wise, and they use good

840
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,880
judgment, then it really could be a productive tool.

841
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,220
I think it shows our trust in in that community, right?

842
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,440
Like do we think that the maintainers are are mature people who have in good faith and

843
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,720
care about the community and really do want what's best?

844
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,600
Or are they just going to use this to further whatever agenda that they were going to do?

845
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,920
I'll also say that while this does add some specifics, and as we're talking about, in

846
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,240
some ways, not enough specifics before with the code of conflict, none of this was covered.

847
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,360
And they still had all that power, right?

848
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,600
The maintainers can still do what they want.

849
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,720
They're still in charge.

850
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,600
So we're just getting some more rules that just might not be enough or the right type

851
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,600
of rules.

852
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
I'm not big on rules.

853
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,120
You know, the biggest problem with this particular code of conduct that I see is the language

854
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:39,720
used demands the members of the community are a certain way and holds them to some really

855
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,160
fairly good sounding standards.

856
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,720
But the trouble is overreach tends to creep in.

857
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,720
And a code of conduct should be a document that describes what will get you kicked out

858
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,680
rather than the criteria being allowed for you to stay.

859
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
You follow what I'm saying?

860
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,600
So I would, a code of conduct to me should clearly tell you where the boundaries are

861
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,400
and what the repercussions are, rather than defining how you need to behave to stay.

862
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,800
I think there might be room for both just in from the different backgrounds thing, because

863
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,000
the focus really is on, you know, this isn't a place to shoot the shit.

864
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,720
This isn't a place to just have fun discussions with friends like we care about kernel maintainership.

865
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
We care about the kernel.

866
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,960
And now I agree that there should be both, that we should be clear about what is totally

867
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,960
not acceptable.

868
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,320
What are the consequences?

869
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,400
But it might be useful in the same way you have, you know, style for your code and the

870
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,920
way your patch has to be formatted.

871
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,880
Maybe there's some amount of rules that can say like, and here's the phrases that are

872
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,920
helpful to us and facilitate a quick and easy discussion of your code.

873
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,920
Yeah.

874
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,800
Yeah, I think the other aspect of the code of conflict, which kind of appealed to me,

875
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,160
and I wonder if there couldn't have been an opportunity to just extend that, is the universal

876
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,800
problem with rulemaking is it is much easier to introduce a rule than it is to remove a

877
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
rule.

878
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Absolutely.

879
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Yes.

880
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,280
And it's, you know, you see this everywhere in companies and governments, any bureaucratic

881
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,280
institution.

882
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
They never get repealed.

883
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,280
You just add more.

884
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,280
Yeah.

885
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,160
And that's my that's my that's my other kind of concern.

886
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,960
I think, too, you know, there's other there's there's all the obviously other voices RMS

887
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,520
responded to the code of conduct and said, I disapprove of strict codes of conduct.

888
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,600
They feel rigid and repressive to me.

889
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
That's what he says.

890
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
And I tend to agree with that.

891
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,960
It does feel rigid a bit.

892
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
Get it out of here.

893
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,560
He also says, however, since I've never participated in Linux development, the Linux code of conduct

894
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
will not affect me.

895
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Of course not.

896
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,160
He says, however, he's never even installed the darn thing.

897
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,240
Yeah, I do know that Linux is a kernel and nothing more Linux kernel is redundant.

898
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,440
And then he goes into the history of the canoe project, which is so classic RMS.

899
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,860
I would have almost been disappointed had he not.

900
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:46,600
But the core point about what about adopting a different code of conduct, maybe one that

901
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,880
didn't have so much political charge around it?

902
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,880
Yeah, I like that.

903
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,440
I mean, are there ways we can do this better?

904
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,520
How about just a very simple one, which just says, don't be a jerk.

905
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,800
I mean, is that enough?

906
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,720
Well, I think people are saying it is not.

907
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,640
I think I think what Greg was saying is that it was insufficient.

908
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,560
Being excellent to each other did not work out.

909
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,680
But with with great responsibility comes, I don't know, you know, all that kind of

910
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,680
superhero stuff.

911
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,240
I did like I did like Dom Getter online.

912
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,280
He proposed the no code of conduct code of conduct, NCOC for short.

913
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,680
It's a new idea designed to help find communities and projects that will not get stuck endlessly

914
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,040
debating how members should behave.

915
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,680
It's to be adults to each other is the other one.

916
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,720
Gentoo actually has a fairly good code of conduct that I wonder if the Linux kernel

917
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,840
could not have adopted.

918
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,520
I think the core issue here really is that the code of conduct that they chose itself

919
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,220
is very politically charged.

920
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,320
The core author, you know, the primary author of it is a political activist.

921
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,840
And they are sort of a big personality.

922
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,360
They're well known in that circle.

923
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,080
They have a very strong opinion.

924
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:00,520
And it seems to draw a lot of controversy if they had adopted another community's code

925
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,920
of conduct, or maybe chosen to extend their existing one, and not chosen one that seems

926
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,920
to be one of the most politically charged out there.

927
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,980
And then tied to an author with a bold and loud personality, we may have avoided a ton

928
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,720
of this upset.

929
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,480
And I wonder why that wasn't the direction it almost felt like, ah, hands up, we don't

930
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,480
we don't have time to deal with this.

931
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,760
Let's just go adopt the popular one.

932
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,040
Yeah, I wonder if it was like that, or if it how much how much has this been discussed

933
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,240
behind the scenes that we're not aware of, right?

934
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,240
And like, how much can we spend some energy for everyone who's concerned?

935
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,520
And I think there are legitimate concerns, of course, can we spend that time saying like,

936
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
how can we change this?

937
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,520
How can we because it is?

938
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,600
Yes, it does come from a weird background.

939
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,980
But I think it's important to keep in mind that, you know, these are this is they copied

940
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,400
the parts they want and can change it as much as they want, right?

941
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,240
So future commits could make this whatever we need it to be.

942
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,920
There is now though, that looming discussion of is there going to be a fork?

943
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:57,080
Somebody on the get get post where they announced the new code of conduct says, I would civilly

944
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,240
suggest that this commit, if it's not reverted, then I hope the kernel will be forked and

945
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,720
stripped of this code of conduct and available for distribution package managers for easy

946
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,340
installation and kept in parity with the current kernel, a move such as this will inevitably

947
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,440
not bring about what the code of conduct intends to bring but will dilute contributions to

948
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,760
the project, create more conflict and punish individuals and ex communicate those who have

949
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,560
wrong opinions or politics and push merit aside and bring forth his demise fork the

950
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,560
kernel.

951
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,040
Come on, that's like the most negative possible way of looking at it.

952
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,520
But welcome to the internet, Alex.

953
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,520
Yeah, fair.

954
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,520
Fair point.

955
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,760
Yeah, I agree, though.

956
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,400
It's very like, it's very much it's it's it's all merit based, right?

957
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,360
Like everybody's upset because we're switching from a merit based system now to something

958
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,360
else.

959
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,040
But they're not accepting the merit based decisions of the current leaders at the same

960
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,040
time.

961
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,220
Like if it's if it's merit based, and you like the way it worked, then you should be

962
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:57,660
accepting of the people in charge's decisions because it's all merit based right now.

963
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,660
So which one is it?

964
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,660
You can't have it both ways.

965
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,240
I like I said earlier, not a fan of more rules.

966
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,580
I generally think what we're doing here is probably going to create more bureaucracy

967
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,360
around the development of Linux kernel.

968
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,560
I also think the Linux kernel is in a market position and maturity where it can handle

969
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,480
this and not be the end of the world.

970
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Right.

971
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,560
I mean, I think it's interesting, too, because it has been you know, this is a change after

972
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,640
a long running project where we see a lot of other projects that have come along and

973
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,840
either added it with much less drama or have just started with it right things like curl

974
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,200
or Kubernetes that are seemingly doing just fine or have massive momentum.

975
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,880
But adding it after the fact after a long community that already has its own norms and

976
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,880
values.

977
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,880
That's it.

978
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,880
That's that can be dicey.

979
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,520
Yeah, it's really going to be about watching where this thing goes.

980
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:39,520
Yeah.

981
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,600
And these are these agreements and conditions are, you know, they're an aspect of that community

982
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,160
and each community, even with the same language is going to interpret that and handle it differently.

983
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:55,600
Will we see people getting kicked out, will we see people's people's speech being suppressed?

984
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,400
Or will we see civility improve on the mailing list?

985
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,200
These are all questions that we just won't have answers to until we watch this thing

986
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,200
play out.

987
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,840
And we really won't know until Linus has been back for a while.

988
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,480
And we see maybe new contributors come along.

989
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,120
And we maybe hear from people if it's made a difference or not, we just won't know.

990
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,600
We need stories about like, I wanted to contribute, but I couldn't because of this or, you know,

991
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,480
the reverse people said, like, I didn't want to contribute before, but hey, now I feel

992
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,160
better that I'll be respected and I want to be a part of the community.

993
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,460
It's one of these situations where I think it's worth not overreacting.

994
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,860
It's worth taking a measured approach.

995
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:31,800
And I don't want to disparage anybody who thinks this is a great idea.

996
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,720
And I don't really want to disparage anybody who has great concerns about this.

997
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,480
And I've heard from all of you, I've heard from those of you who felt like they shouldn't

998
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,480
contribute before.

999
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,480
And I've heard from those of you who believe this will be the end of the Linux kernel.

1000
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,600
And you are looking for another boat to jump to.

1001
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,960
People are a lot of people are joking that they're gonna switch to open BSD this week.

1002
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,960
I've heard a lot of that.

1003
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,760
I just think that's all we can do right now.

1004
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,880
Yeah, we just have to we just have to wait and see, does the fork become really popular

1005
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,240
and that's where the community goes?

1006
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,440
Or does the kernel just keep keep on going?

1007
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,000
If I had a DeLorean that could get up to 88 miles per hour, I might go back and try to

1008
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,680
convince them maybe adopt a different code of conduct just to avoid some of this, even

1009
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:15,060
if it's heavily inspired by 25 years ago or whatever it was when then it's put out 93

1010
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,480
on the Dominix mailing list or whatever it was.

1011
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,120
Open source was it just was nowhere.

1012
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,360
It just wasn't it just wasn't even a thing.

1013
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:30,200
And like Wes said a few minutes ago, you've got projects now like Kubernetes and loads

1014
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:36,120
and loads of other massive open source projects that have been born as a consequence of the

1015
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,540
open source movement.

1016
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,460
People now have a lot better idea about how to behave and how to conduct themselves in

1017
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,360
these scenarios.

1018
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,760
I do think, you know, you can't just have an open door and just say, you know, like

1019
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,400
I said earlier, don't just be a jerk.

1020
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,000
I think there has to be a little more structure to it than that.

1021
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,160
But honestly, I think we're at a point now where it's quite well self-policing and governed

1022
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,600
as a as a movement, you know?

1023
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Yeah, I think that's likely the case.

1024
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,440
And I think we'll learn more.

1025
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,400
Perhaps we'll learn about the Linux Foundation's role in this change.

1026
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,120
You know, that is a good question.

1027
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,040
I did notice they are the ones that you report to if you have enforcement issues.

1028
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,680
It's tab at linuxfoundation.org, which is a technical advisory board.

1029
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,680
So that's interesting.

1030
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,520
I would be delighted to learn the back story there.

1031
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,720
But I think for now, I'll just leave it to the audience.

1032
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,960
Let us know what you think linuxunplug.com slash contact, send us in your thoughts.

1033
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,680
The range of it with, you know, I'm trying to soak in as many thoughts and opinions.

1034
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,320
This is one of those things where it takes me more than a week to really come to some

1035
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,320
sort of...

1036
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,000
We're still in the sort of the stunned silence phase of this, right?

1037
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,200
It was just like two days ago.

1038
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,640
It's been literally just like a day and a half, really, since we've learned about this.

1039
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,760
So it's still, you know, I'm processing.

1040
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,680
Sometimes I come on in a week or two and my position has changed a little bit.

1041
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,560
But I think that's where I want to end it now.

1042
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:56,040
And I'd like to hear the audience's opinion on it, too, on the Unplugged show.

1043
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,440
So let's transition to our new goodies that we got this week.

1044
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,980
Kind of perks of becoming Linux Academy employees is everybody gets to pick a machine.

1045
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,800
And Linux Academy has a policy, you pick your own operating system.

1046
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,640
And Wes and I had been kicking around the idea of these ThinkPad T480s, buying them

1047
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,320
personally, which was taking us forever because that's got a chunk of change.

1048
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,660
You want to make the right choice.

1049
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,480
And so they arrived late yesterday.

1050
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,240
So Wes is about to unboxes right now on the show.

1051
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,380
You ready, Wes?

1052
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,380
It's exciting, right?

1053
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,800
It's a thin ThinkPad box.

1054
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,400
That's the ThinkPad T480 designed for serious business.

1055
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,800
And we got it with a couple of extra options.

1056
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,020
I love it.

1057
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,720
Little theater of the mind there.

1058
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Get it out of there, Wes.

1059
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,720
Yeah.

1060
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,720
It's light, right?

1061
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,720
It is light.

1062
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,720
Yeah.

1063
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,720
Look at this.

1064
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,440
No, but it does have a three cell battery built in right now.

1065
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
It's built right in.

1066
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,280
So I'll talk about, I'll tell you why you get your, why you open it up and get your

1067
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,320
first impressions on, which I think would be really good.

1068
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,480
I'd love to hear, but I'll tell you about the specs.

1069
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,480
Okay.

1070
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,480
Here's the hardware that we got in these.

1071
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,800
So these are the Lenovo ThinkPad T480s, not 480s, people have wondered.

1072
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,840
They weigh 3.6 pounds.

1073
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
This is light.

1074
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,220
I mean, I can one hand, I can hold this for hours.

1075
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,960
It's got a, we got them with the 14 inch IPS 1080p display.

1076
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,520
So we decided not to go 4k on these ones.

1077
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,480
I already having used mine for a little bit longer than Wes has obviously, I'm already

1078
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,120
very thankful of, of going 1080p because there are certain apps that have never gotten high

1079
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,080
DPI that I've really strained my eyes to use.

1080
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,000
And now they just look glorious on this IPS display.

1081
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's got an eighth generation I7 8650U, runs at 1.9 gigahertz base, turbo is up to 4.2

1082
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
gigahertz.

1083
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,200
Although there's a caveat there.

1084
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
We'll get into that.

1085
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,200
Yeah.

1086
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,600
These suckers have 32 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM.

1087
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:48,880
So screw you MacBook with your 16 gig limit, one terabyte PCIe MVNE drives in them.

1088
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Oh yeah.

1089
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,840
And then the way these Lenovo's work, which is pretty fancy, is as a three cell built

1090
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
in battery.

1091
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,840
They don't call it that.

1092
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,320
They call it like a power station because they got to brand it.

1093
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,680
It was just silly, right?

1094
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,800
But then we also got it with the additional six cell battery that snaps into the back.

1095
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,880
So you get the three cell and the six cell combined.

1096
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,720
And on my first night of testing, I actually failed to run the battery down, even when

1097
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,520
I left it running downloading for a while overnight.

1098
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:24,840
So why right now running plasma neon 1804, I'm estimating about 10 hours of battery life,

1099
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,000
10 hours.

1100
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,640
That is more than I need.

1101
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,640
I mean, that's fantastic.

1102
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,640
That's all day battery.

1103
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,420
That is all day battery, all work day battery.

1104
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,180
It's got Intel wireless in them, and then some of the best parts really is the connectivity.

1105
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:43,160
Along the right edge, there's two USB three gen one type A ports, and one of them is also

1106
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:49,320
a Thunderbolt port where you charge the device over USB-C. HDMI out, it has gigabit ethernet,

1107
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:55,400
a full ethernet jack, audio jack, SD card slot, and the security lock slot that Lenovo's

1108
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,400
have.

1109
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,400
Yeah.

1110
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
Did you say that?

1111
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,400
It has a headphone jack.

1112
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,400
Yeah.

1113
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
You got to be specific.

1114
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,400
I know, right?

1115
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,540
It's pretty fricking exciting.

1116
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:07,920
And it's also a certified Ubuntu machine.

1117
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,240
Great viewing angles on the screen.

1118
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,240
Yeah.

1119
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,240
Yeah, it is.

1120
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,500
Arch wiki is pretty sparse on this machine because basically everything works with the

1121
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,900
exception of a throttling bug that the T480s, as well as several other models of Lenovo's

1122
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,220
and even a Dell have, which we'll have the specifics linked in the show notes.

1123
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:31,260
But it turns out there's an issue with throttling that only exists on Linux.

1124
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,860
It really comes down to Intel and their crappy data sheets.

1125
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:39,580
The cause is simply that there is an activation offset in the master temperature control target

1126
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,280
register, which they flip some bits.

1127
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,860
And so essentially the issue is the kernel, it prevents the CPU from boosting all the

1128
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:51,100
way to 4.2 gigahertz.

1129
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:57,740
On some systems it'll go like around 3.5 gigahertz, maybe even 3.9 gigahertz in some cases, but

1130
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,820
it won't stay there because of this stupid fricking bug that exists.

1131
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,240
It's just part of, it was really a typo on Intel's part.

1132
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,760
And as all things in Linux, there's actually a workaround script up on GitHub that will

1133
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,340
fix this issue, but it involves turning off secure boot.

1134
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,740
It required a couple of, oh yeah, you can't have thermal de-installed to monitor the temperature

1135
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,740
stuff.

1136
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,740
Oh, okay.

1137
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,080
So it's not a perfect fix.

1138
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,660
So we are technically limited in max performance right now because of this bug.

1139
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,300
And it would require a firmware update on Lenovo's part to fix it.

1140
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,160
Now they have released two firmware updates for these machines for Linux.

1141
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,220
And we, as we talked about, we should be able to use them right from Linux.

1142
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,220
Right.

1143
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,940
Cause they're now part of the LVFS project.

1144
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:45,940
So there may be a fix inbound or could try this experimental script.

1145
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:49,220
I'm curious, we'll have to do some benchmarks with this script and really see like, you

1146
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,820
know, how much does it really affect and what of, what of our potential workloads will actually

1147
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:53,820
benefit.

1148
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,820
Right.

1149
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,820
Yeah.

1150
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,500
Cause I did some testing with the remote connection software that we use to remote back to the

1151
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,900
studio and it did great.

1152
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,460
It did better than most laptops do.

1153
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,460
So I'm pretty happy with it.

1154
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,860
We'll have some additional resources though, if you want to know more about that or read

1155
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:10,580
some reviews for the T480 with Linux, but we're doing things a little differently this

1156
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,580
time.

1157
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:15,820
So first of all, one of the things that I really like is that Wes and I got identical

1158
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,820
laptops.

1159
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,940
And those of you who've listened to the show for a while might know that one of my ways

1160
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:23,500
of achieving like solid production is trying to have duplicates of machines.

1161
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,500
So that way we can swap machines if we need to, or swap parts and everything's compatible

1162
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,780
or move a hard drive image to another system when it's like a laptop fries and we're live

1163
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,780
on location.

1164
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:38,060
You know, there's having two of the machines that you use to get on the air is just, it's,

1165
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,700
it's almost a necessity really if you're doing a lot of live broadcasts or a lot of on the

1166
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,960
road productions.

1167
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,500
And so that was the main driver for us getting exactly identical systems is if Wes and I

1168
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,680
are in an event and one of us is having a technical issue that's preventing us from

1169
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,920
recording a show, we can, we can part swap.

1170
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,200
Or we could just have all the right dongles or batteries or yeah.

1171
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,380
If I get a doc here in the studio or another power adapter, you can use it.

1172
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,380
Perfect.

1173
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,180
You know, there's all those things that are just, I think really, really great about having

1174
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,380
two identical machines.

1175
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:11,020
But I, this time around, and I'm curious what you're going to do differently this time around

1176
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,100
I'm leaving windows on it, which I never do.

1177
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,780
I never do that, but I've shrunk the partition down.

1178
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:23,660
So it's like a 90 gig Linux or I'm sorry, 90 gig partition for windows and then the

1179
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,620
rest of the terabyte drive is for Linux.

1180
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,620
That's pretty reasonable.

1181
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:30,280
I thought, you know, maybe for some funky firmware thing or maybe some game might come

1182
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,340
out someday or some like my Garmin in my RV can only be updated from windows, right?

1183
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,780
Maybe a guest has some software they can only use to communicate.

1184
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,100
We got to bring them in on windows just that once.

1185
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,100
Maybe you never know.

1186
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,780
I mean, I really have not needed windows for years, but I just thought if I'm getting a

1187
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:50,520
licensed version of windows pro and I got a terabyte drive, I could burn 90 gigs and

1188
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,220
have it there just in case.

1189
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:55,980
Plus, I've now mounted that partition under Linux, which can be kind of handy when using

1190
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,980
wine and stuff.

1191
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,980
That can be really nice.

1192
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,980
Yeah.

1193
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,180
So that's one thing I'm doing differently is I'm, I think for now, I don't know if I'll

1194
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,180
keep it that way.

1195
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:08,260
I could see myself like reloading this machine and I could see myself blowing windows away.

1196
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:11,220
I mean, at some point, you know, like six months go by and you're like, I just haven't

1197
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,220
used it.

1198
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,220
Yeah.

1199
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,700
The other thing too is you can always shrink it as much as you want.

1200
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,700
That's true.

1201
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,460
Take a little backup of it and we could keep it on a server somewhere.

1202
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:22,780
So yeah, for factory maintenance or whatever, you can lay that disk image back down.

1203
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,100
So that's one thing I'm doing differently.

1204
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,340
I also opted not to go Kubuntu.

1205
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:31,820
I decided to go neon 1804, even though still kind of in the testing, I just, I wanted to

1206
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,820
be right on that edge.

1207
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,820
Yeah.

1208
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,580
Well, I like the fresh plasma, fresh hot plasma.

1209
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,020
But you get the LTS base.

1210
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,020
Yeah.

1211
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,020
Yeah.

1212
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,020
So those are, what are you doing?

1213
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,020
Anything differently?

1214
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,020
Are you going to do a different distro?

1215
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,020
Are you going to keep windows?

1216
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,020
I've been using Kubuntu.

1217
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:49,500
I've been enjoying plasma a lot and it makes a pretty nice, I don't know, GNOME works pretty

1218
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,460
well for me for just like terminal and browsing the web.

1219
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,140
But when I have a lot of windows open and I really want some like complicated window

1220
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:01,380
management or I need to manage multiple workspaces, plasma has a little bit of an edge in just

1221
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,380
extensibility.

1222
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,380
Yeah, I agree.

1223
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,380
And you've been using it a lot.

1224
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:06,780
So it'd be nice again, in that same vein, if you need to use my laptop.

1225
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,780
It's true.

1226
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,780
It's true.

1227
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:12,220
So I was looking at maybe the latest Kubuntu, but you're tempting me with that neon.

1228
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,620
I'm going to be curious what you see.

1229
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,860
I mean, I think Kubuntu is so rock solid.

1230
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:19,900
Like if you want a true workhorse, then I think you're, you know, and it's 1804 based

1231
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,900
too.

1232
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,900
We've also got enough space.

1233
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,400
I'm debating, you know, maybe I'll keep windows too.

1234
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,340
Maybe get like just LTS Kubuntu on there, set up ready to go, all the software we need.

1235
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,780
That's like your workhorse distro.

1236
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,740
Backup workhorse and then have other space for distro of the week and or just whatever.

1237
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,740
That's a good idea.

1238
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:36,740
Yeah.

1239
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,740
Cause we do that a lot.

1240
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,460
I probably should have left a little space on mine cause we do that a fair amount.

1241
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:44,660
In fact, I was thinking about giving project Trident to go for a week, you know, just live

1242
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,660
on project Trident.

1243
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,740
I am debating some, some ZFS on root for this guy.

1244
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,740
Yeah.

1245
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,740
We'll see.

1246
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,740
That'd be fun to hear.

1247
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,740
Yeah.

1248
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,300
So, you know, we've already kind of covered it, but we also wanted to call out what's

1249
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:02,500
important to us when designing and building and then selecting and purchasing a work machine.

1250
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,180
Because if this was a machine for me just to bop around the RV or something like that,

1251
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:11,660
I may have gone with an XPS 13 or maybe a Gallego.

1252
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:16,580
Like I don't think I would have necessarily picked a ThinkPad T480 for my personal, just

1253
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:21,220
like stick it on the couch and use it for browsing the internet just for fun.

1254
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:26,180
But when it came to a work machine, I needed these quote unquote legacy ports that all

1255
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:31,700
of my current audio hardware uses, USB-A, ethernet to transfer multi-gig files.

1256
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,700
Yes.

1257
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:35,020
And I mean, just for live streaming, you can't beat ethernet.

1258
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,020
Yeah.

1259
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:42,020
So I was able to pick the whole package, 14 inches, 3.6 pounds, 10 hours of battery life,

1260
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:46,260
which even if in heavy production, that works out to be five or eight, I'm fine.

1261
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,260
Fine.

1262
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,260
Yeah.

1263
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,260
That's huge.

1264
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,260
Yeah.

1265
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,260
They're not the most beautiful.

1266
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:54,180
I think they have their own sort of elegance, but you can tell they're while light, they're

1267
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,180
rugged.

1268
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,460
You know, they've been building ThinkPads for a long time.

1269
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,740
They do feel rugged.

1270
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:01,740
With those batteries, don't forget, you can do the Noah Choliatt trick of pulling one

1271
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:05,180
out and shoving a new one in and it doesn't have to reboot or anything.

1272
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,300
It keeps going because that built-in 3.7 keeps going.

1273
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,300
It's great.

1274
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,180
How'd you find the nipple in the middle of the, they call it a track point, don't they?

1275
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,180
How'd you find that?

1276
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:13,180
Yeah.

1277
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,180
You know, I've used it a bit.

1278
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,180
It's not bad.

1279
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,180
I kind of actually like it.

1280
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,860
The track point is decent.

1281
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,200
The track pad is one of the better ones on a PC laptop.

1282
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,380
It's got some grit to it.

1283
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,820
And it's one of those where you click the whole track pad.

1284
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:27,760
I don't like that part too much.

1285
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,580
So that's why I've sort of been preferring the nipple.

1286
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,580
Yeah.

1287
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,100
I have more experience with the Dell's version of the nipple, but I do kind of like it.

1288
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,100
It's nice.

1289
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,100
It's a great thing.

1290
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,860
But when you're just using the mouse, you want to go real quick, it can be handy.

1291
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:42,180
It's nice too, because I disabled the track pad as soon as I connect my Bluetooth Logitech

1292
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:47,380
MX, which I love the Logitech MX Anywhere series of mice.

1293
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,340
They're the best mice for a laptop.

1294
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,360
And so I keep one in my bag.

1295
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,300
And so as soon as I connect that, I have the track pad disabled.

1296
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,660
So that way I don't ever have any like mistaken touches while I'm typing.

1297
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:02,820
That keyboard is the best keyboard I've used in a laptop in probably seven, eight years.

1298
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,820
Yeah.

1299
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,820
Decent travel.

1300
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,820
Great for broadcasting.

1301
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,140
It feels good on the fingers.

1302
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:13,780
And I have RSI issues, and the MacBook keyboard triggers them, because I'm an old man now.

1303
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,780
I just type really heavy.

1304
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,700
I'm used to mechanical keyboards.

1305
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,180
I grew up on the IBM PS2s and things like that.

1306
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:21,140
So I was clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.

1307
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,580
And I smashed my fingers into the MacBook, and I have to constantly remind myself, don't

1308
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,580
type so hard.

1309
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,580
But when I get going, I just get going.

1310
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,580
You just get going.

1311
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,580
You're passionate.

1312
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:29,580
Not an issue on the ThinkPad.

1313
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:30,580
Not an issue at all.

1314
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,700
It's one of the best laptop keyboards I've felt in a really long time.

1315
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,060
And so what are your first impressions of it?

1316
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:36,460
Now you've had it out of the box for a moment.

1317
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,460
What do you think?

1318
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:38,460
I like it.

1319
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,100
I think this is going to be just a really good...

1320
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,540
It's not flashy, but it just feels like I can sit down, I'll know that it's going to

1321
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:47,100
boot up, it's going to be ready to go, and it's got the guts to perform when we need

1322
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,100
it to.

1323
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,100
Yeah.

1324
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,100
Yeah.

1325
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,980
And I also want to talk a little bit about some of the tweaks that we're going to make

1326
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,980
to the machine to use it in production.

1327
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:59,260
Both Wes and I have been experimenting with a project called KX Studio.

1328
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,580
And KX Studio is like a series of packages or repos that you can overlay on your distribution

1329
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:08,220
and bring in a bunch of cross-platform pro audio applications.

1330
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:13,100
It's a huge collection of different ones, specifically some that are used to set up

1331
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:19,380
jack audio, which I'm just beginning to really wrap my head around because for a full mobile

1332
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:23,460
machine where I'm recording my microphone and I got a soundboard and I'm recording my

1333
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,340
remote host and all of that, I got to use something more sophisticated than just straight

1334
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:28,340
pulse audio.

1335
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,860
I can start creating virtual sound devices and capturing them to specific files.

1336
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,860
Yeah.

1337
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,460
I mean, when you think about all the equipment we've got up here in the studio, it's a challenge

1338
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,580
to get all of that working in a laptop.

1339
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,540
We've done it before, but not with jack, but we've done it before using external audio

1340
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,500
devices and sophisticated routing.

1341
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,740
And the goal here is to do it all in software.

1342
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,800
We'll see.

1343
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,300
We have members that join us in the mumble room fairly frequently that are using jack

1344
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,940
audio with reliability and have great things to say about it.

1345
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:01,100
And there are tools with jack audio that allow you to draw a connection from one audio device

1346
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,240
to another audio device, like you're patching wires and it's a visual thing.

1347
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,260
It's really cool.

1348
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,380
The applications like Katina or something like that.

1349
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,380
Do you remember?

1350
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:11,380
I know you've been playing with it.

1351
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:14,980
I mean, there's, there's several, there's the whole, the, like the cadence suite of

1352
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:15,980
applications.

1353
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Cadence.

1354
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:17,980
That's what it was.

1355
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,980
Yes.

1356
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:19,980
Cadence.

1357
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:20,980
And cadence itself is like a nice gooey that'll help you get jack all set up.

1358
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,500
It's got stuff like, you know, also impulse bridges built into it.

1359
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:30,220
And then Cadia, C-A-T-I-A, is the jack patch bay software that lets you drag and draw to

1360
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:31,220
different devices.

1361
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:35,260
And it really is such a nice model, you know, where you, you get these jack clients and

1362
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,580
they show up and you've got inputs and outputs and then you can just connect them however

1363
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,540
you want and jack handles the rest.

1364
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:44,700
And our favorite recording software that we use now under Linux to record a podcast, Reaper,

1365
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,020
has full support for jack devices.

1366
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,020
Oh, it works so nicely.

1367
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:48,900
So they show up as input channels.

1368
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,900
It's just brilliant.

1369
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,580
So I can, I could, you know, have a jack device that is just my microphone and I can record

1370
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,060
that as a separate track in Reaper.

1371
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,140
I can have a jack device that's just when he's remote or if I'm remote and that goes

1372
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,140
on a channel.

1373
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,340
I mean, the potential is, is, is huge.

1374
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,540
And that's one of the tweaks we're going to be making.

1375
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:11,060
I've got the KX studio repositories, I've got Cadia and a few other things installed,

1376
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,780
but I don't really have not really wrapped my head around how to actually create virtual

1377
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,300
in and out devices and stuff like that.

1378
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,640
That's like the next stage I'm going to be going to.

1379
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,260
But my hope is in a month or two, I've got this thing down pretty well.

1380
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,300
And KDE neon is going to be stabilized by then.

1381
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,900
And I'm going to have a pretty sore, serious remote mobile workstation that's fans don't

1382
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,700
kick up when I connect back to the studio.

1383
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:32,700
Right?

1384
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,700
Yes.

1385
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,460
And I think, I mean, I think some of the KX studio 1804 repos are also stabilizing a bit.

1386
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,540
So you know, wait and see, not everything's going to be perfect.

1387
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,260
It does make me think too, we need to, you know, we should do, we'll try to do a good

1388
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:45,360
job documenting this too, because I know, I mean, it'd be good for you guys to see,

1389
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,500
but also on our end, if we just need to redo something really quick, we don't want to be

1390
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,500
futzing with it.

1391
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,500
Yeah.

1392
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,740
I don't want to make it like a holy install that I can't touch.

1393
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:52,740
No, no, no.

1394
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:53,740
Absolutely not.

1395
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:54,740
Got to be able to nuke and pave and reset it up.

1396
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:58,780
And I think we can get there because it just puts it around you and I have made some progress

1397
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,420
just, you know, individually.

1398
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,420
Very excited about it.

1399
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,540
They're just, they just, you know, I use the machine all night and all day yesterday.

1400
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,840
It came at noon.

1401
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,620
So I got it at noon yesterday and just immediately went to work.

1402
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,620
Tore right into it.

1403
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,620
Yeah, of course.

1404
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:13,620
Oh my God.

1405
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:16,080
So I booted into windows for the first time just to like log into my account that Linux

1406
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,620
Academy had created and, and you know, log in and do any of those firmware updates, but

1407
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:23,260
they'd all, they'd taken care of all that, but I was just curious, you know, he's like,

1408
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:24,260
what's this like?

1409
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:25,260
What's this environment like?

1410
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,260
It's so bad.

1411
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,980
Windows, like when you search for windows update in the start menu, you get like everything

1412
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,040
but windows update.

1413
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,380
You get like the windows update settings and windows update hours and all these things

1414
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,740
that are not windows updates.

1415
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,020
Just actually doing the updates.

1416
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:38,020
Yeah.

1417
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,620
If you write check for updates, then you get, I mean, it's just, windows 10 has got so much

1418
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:42,740
going on.

1419
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:47,340
It's been blurking at me with OEM messages and blurking at me with, with Microsoft messages

1420
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:51,860
about installing defender when I first logged in, my CPU was completely pegged for like

1421
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,860
five minutes.

1422
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,020
And so I launched, you know, I do control it, delete to go use the new task manager,

1423
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,520
but now they've got a baby task manager that brings up, so I got to click something else

1424
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,500
to get a decent task manager now.

1425
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:06,020
And then I look at it and 98% of, or it was two CPUs or something that's just completely

1426
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:11,020
being dominated by the windows defender doing a malware scan of my system because apparently

1427
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,580
the first login of my account ever was the time to do that.

1428
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,180
That's what you want as your first run experience.

1429
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:18,660
So I, you know, I opened up the machine literally the first time I log in, the fans are going

1430
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,660
like crazy.

1431
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,260
Like, there's so much stuff going on.

1432
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:22,420
I'm like, this is awful.

1433
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,040
This is, this is horrible.

1434
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,620
Could not download that KDE neon 1804 preview ISO fast enough.

1435
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,620
How did that install go?

1436
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,620
Oh, beautiful.

1437
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,620
Beautiful.

1438
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:32,620
Secure boot worked fine.

1439
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:33,620
Oh yeah.

1440
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,620
Oh yeah.

1441
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:35,620
Secure boots on using UEFI.

1442
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,620
No problem.

1443
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:40,700
The only thing that was a little tricky was, you know, I decided to install G parted to

1444
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:47,060
shrink the partition because I just find that the cute unity ish, whatever that ubiquity

1445
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:51,940
installer is that they're using for Kubuntu and KDE neon, the partition is just, it's

1446
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,940
not great.

1447
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,940
Like the fields are too narrow.

1448
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:54,940
You got to expand it all out.

1449
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,940
You always got to, you got to stretch the window out and make it bigger.

1450
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:00,340
And then you got to click on the partition and click change.

1451
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,340
You can't just double click.

1452
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,340
It's just dense.

1453
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,500
It's just hard to be G parted for just getting some serious disk work done.

1454
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:09,900
I flipped over G parted, did some of my heavy lifting there, resized the NTFS partition

1455
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:14,020
there, did a safety reboot back into windows to make sure everything was good, booted back

1456
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,020
into the neon installer.

1457
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,980
And then it just did the installation like normal.

1458
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:17,980
Went flawless.

1459
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,980
Beautiful.

1460
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,860
And since, since neon has been installed, man, it's just been beautifully fast.

1461
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:25,340
Like it's just incredibly fast boot.

1462
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,340
I got it all.

1463
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,780
I got plasma totally customized the way I like it in an evening.

1464
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,460
And this is with like all your electron apps.

1465
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,460
Oh yeah.

1466
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:34,620
I'm running Slack and I'm running mail spring and I'm running telegram and I'm running all

1467
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,180
that stuff all the time and each using KDE windows rules, they're assigned to their specific

1468
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:43,020
windows, their desktops and with specific window constraints.

1469
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,620
And it's just great.

1470
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:45,620
It's just great.

1471
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,620
Super fast.

1472
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,620
I installed a couple of steam games, you know, doing all this stuff while we're on, on battery.

1473
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,260
I didn't even take my power adapter home.

1474
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:54,260
I was like, let's see what this laptop can do.

1475
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,820
Oh, you're living on the edge again.

1476
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:56,820
Yeah.

1477
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:00,800
After playing on the machine all day, I disconnect the USB power adapter and I grabbed the laptop

1478
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,580
and I go home power adapter free.

1479
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,420
And I'm like, I'm going to see if I can make it all night.

1480
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,820
I was up till 10 30.

1481
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,180
I mean, I got home.

1482
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:10,740
I use that machine through dinner, through watching deep space nine.

1483
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,700
Like I did not move from that machine all night.

1484
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,500
My, you know, my situation sort of precludes me moving a lot anyway.

1485
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,080
So I sort of stay put anyways.

1486
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,760
And so I'm sitting there working on that machine all night on battery, installing software,

1487
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,100
you know, snapping stuff up, like just going nuts and downloading games and trying them

1488
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,440
out.

1489
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,380
And I ended the night by, by just letting the machine continue to download software

1490
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,380
for another 90 minutes.

1491
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:36,100
And I just turned the screen off and I went to bed, came back, it had, you know, dutifully

1492
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:41,300
gone to sleep, but it finished all the downloads and I look at things still has 27% battery

1493
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:45,420
and it's still telling me three and a half hours left of, of charge.

1494
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:46,420
Oh, I'm excited.

1495
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:49,900
I know it was really something like, I didn't know I could accomplish that in Linux.

1496
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,820
Like I didn't know that was going to be possible.

1497
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:52,820
So that was really neat.

1498
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,660
That was a really great first impression.

1499
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,320
And the fact that the machine just was never a slouch, you know, just kept up with everything

1500
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,320
I was doing.

1501
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,500
I think having MV&E drives really helps with that.

1502
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,660
And then having that I seven, do you have a USB-C charger pack for it yet?

1503
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,660
Yeah.

1504
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:07,660
That's what it comes with.

1505
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:08,660
Yeah.

1506
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:09,660
It comes with a USB-C.

1507
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:10,660
Really?

1508
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:11,660
Yeah.

1509
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,660
It's like a 65 water.

1510
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:13,660
And I guess you can get up to like a hundred Watts or something.

1511
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,660
If you get the doc.

1512
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:15,660
Yeah.

1513
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:18,100
Cause they, they used to, the four seventies is the one that I have and they still came

1514
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:22,820
with the square Lenovo tip, but the CS480 has USB by default.

1515
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:23,820
All in.

1516
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,740
And that USB-C port is also a Thunderbolt three port as well.

1517
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,740
So.

1518
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:28,740
Yeah, it is.

1519
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,980
Oh, that's beautiful.

1520
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:30,980
Very excited about this.

1521
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:34,460
Once you figure out how all the cables work in that weird domain, that just the possibilities

1522
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,460
are endless.

1523
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,460
They were fully spec'd.

1524
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:41,780
They were close to $1,800, you know, but that's still significantly cheaper than a Mac book.

1525
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:42,780
Significantly cheaper.

1526
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,780
For the value we're getting.

1527
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,780
I mean, well worth it.

1528
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,780
Yeah.

1529
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,780
Very happy with it.

1530
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,860
So the kick in the tires and I'm sure eventually I'll probably load some other distros on there

1531
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,860
and stuff like that.

1532
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,620
But really looking forward to just building a rock solid mobile recording studio in a

1533
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:55,620
laptop.

1534
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:56,620
Yeah.

1535
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:57,620
If you guys have tips, let us know.

1536
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,620
I mean, some of you have been using Jack out there.

1537
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,380
Maybe you've got some things we really shouldn't miss when getting that set up or I'm a new

1538
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,380
ThinkPad user here.

1539
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,380
I mean, I've played with them before.

1540
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:07,140
I had a really old one back in the day, but I'm new to this.

1541
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,500
So if there's like ThinkPad things we need to do, I'd like to know.

1542
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:16,820
I would go as far as to conjecture, and this may be hopeful thinking, but you almost have

1543
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:21,140
to believe that Lenovo has done work to make sure this works under Linux.

1544
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:25,660
Because when you look at like the Ubuntu Wiki and the Arch Wiki, they basically say everything

1545
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:26,660
just works out of the box.

1546
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:30,580
And like when you read people's reviews for the current T480s, like everything just works.

1547
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,160
All the hardware just works.

1548
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,700
And then you look at the work they've done with LVFS recently, I think there's more going

1549
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,700
on.

1550
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,700
There's some playing ball happening that maybe they're not so public about.

1551
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,700
Yeah.

1552
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:42,160
And one of the things that really drew me to the T480 is I think Alex and others had

1553
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,860
told me that, you know, there's a lot of folks at Red Hat using this particular model of

1554
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:47,860
ThinkPad.

1555
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,100
And I thought, okay.

1556
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,100
They know what they're doing.

1557
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,100
Yeah.

1558
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,220
Maybe they're hip to what Lenovo is actually doing behind the scenes.

1559
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,860
You know, they could be having those business to business conversations and Red Hat could

1560
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:00,700
say, hey, we'll buy 10,000 of those if you can make sure it does XYZ okay for us.

1561
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,700
Yeah.

1562
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:07,140
So Wes, you were saying anything specific to ThinkPads and Linux?

1563
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:11,780
There's a website, thinkwiki.org that has some interesting stuff.

1564
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,540
I dropped a link in IRC for you.

1565
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:14,540
Oh, we'll check that out.

1566
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,500
I'll try to toss that in the show notes too.

1567
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,500
Yeah.

1568
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,220
I think it was a good choice.

1569
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:23,620
It's not like you've said, it's not the most flashy laptop you could find, but I think

1570
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,100
it's a really practical solution.

1571
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:28,340
And if you're on the fence out there about what machine to get, I really endorse this

1572
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,340
machine.

1573
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,900
It's pretty fantastic and it's nice to see everything just working out of the box.

1574
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,540
The one thing I'm a little worried about, I've read that plasma users have issues with

1575
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,400
the Thunderbolt security model.

1576
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:43,720
You may recall, we recently covered that Gnome added support for user prompting to authorize

1577
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,340
Thunderbolt devices when you plug them in.

1578
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:50,180
I mean, these suckers are sitting on your PCI bus and plasma does not yet have the facility

1579
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:53,500
to authorize and prompt you to authorize them.

1580
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,940
And I have read, cannot confirm yet, but I have read that if Thunderbolt security is

1581
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:03,620
turned on, that as a plasma user, you have to log out and log into Gnome 3 and then authorize

1582
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:08,460
the device, like a doc or whatever it is, then log out of Gnome and log back into plasma.

1583
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,180
And you have to do that every time you change a device.

1584
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,380
That sounds horrible.

1585
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,620
And so what I did is I just turned off Thunderbolt security in the BIOS, which is actually an

1586
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:16,620
option.

1587
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:20,780
I don't know what all the ramifications of that are other than exposing my PCI bus, but

1588
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:25,180
I'm going to, your RAM is mine now Chris, you better watch those ports.

1589
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,180
Who needs Heartbleed?

1590
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,980
Wes will just plug in.

1591
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:31,900
So yeah, I made that choice for now, but I'm hoping the plasma project just did a great

1592
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,460
support for that security authorization.

1593
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,460
Yeah, they probably,

1594
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:37,120
Something we'll cover I'm sure right here on Linux Unplugged.

1595
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,120
Very fun though.

1596
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,300
It's great to get new machines, especially ones that we had been kind of thinking about

1597
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,820
anyways for a while.

1598
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:44,380
And I'll be really curious to hear your report after you get it loaded and run.

1599
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,460
I do think a nice Linux Unplugged sticker is going to look great on the back.

1600
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,460
I like the way you're thinking.

1601
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,780
I like that, Wes, I like that.

1602
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:55,740
So if you've got any experience with machines like this or other tips like the Lenovo Wiki,

1603
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:58,420
let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1604
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,180
You can also grab our RSS feed that way you get every single show.

1605
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:06,900
It's just linuxunplugged.com slash RSS and you plug that in to whatever reader or downloader

1606
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,900
you like.

1607
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,900
You got, oh, look at that.

1608
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:09,900
It's already in the show notes.

1609
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:10,900
Boom.

1610
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,900
Very nice.

1611
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:12,900
All right.

1612
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,300
Well, go get more Wes over at TechSnap.Systems.

1613
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:18,500
Catch him on the recent episodes of Linux Action News as well.

1614
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,180
It's some great Wes Payne episodes.

1615
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,180
Thank you, sir.

1616
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:22,580
Stepping up, hitting it out of the park.

1617
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,540
It's nice to have you here full time now and I think it's already paying dividends.

1618
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,540
It sure is.

1619
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,140
Well, so go get more Wes and we'll be back next week.

1620
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:34,780
I am probably still going to be for a while, at least a couple more weeks, kind of taking

1621
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,780
it easy.

1622
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:37,300
Try to be here on Tuesdays for this show.

1623
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,580
Going to try to make it for Coder later this week, but that's probably about the most I'll

1624
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:41,980
be doing for the next few weeks.

1625
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,980
I'm still there though.

1626
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,300
Still working every single day, still checking in on stuff, making sure Wes doesn't ruin

1627
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,300
everything.

1628
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:48,300
I need a lot of supervision.

1629
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,300
Yeah.

1630
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,300
Yeah, that's for sure.

1631
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,740
But in the meantime, that will bring us to the end of this week's show.

1632
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:55,420
I encourage you to join us.

1633
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,300
We got that open mumble room where you can comment and participate in the virtual lug

1634
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,540
and that goes before the show and after the show.

1635
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:02,860
We often hang out and chat a bunch.

1636
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,860
We have a great time.

1637
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:04,860
It really is fun.

1638
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:10,260
And I have a strong sense that an unplugged barbecue is in our future.

1639
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,100
When I've recovered, I can move around a little bit better.

1640
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:14,420
I think I can smell it already.

1641
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,420
Yeah.

1642
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,460
I feel like an unplugged barbecue is in our future.

1643
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:23,540
So stay tuned for details on that and hit me up on telegram, telegram or Jupiterbroadcasting.com

1644
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:24,780
slash telegram.

1645
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,540
Join our group and let us know your ideas for a barbecue.

1646
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:28,540
Join us live next week.

1647
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:55,100
In the meantime, we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1648
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:04,260
Oh, the unplugged show.

1649
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,300
There we go.

1650
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,300
Oh, yeah.

1651
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,300
All right.

1652
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,300
We got to title this thing.

1653
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,460
We ran right up to the Ask Nor program this week.

1654
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,460
So it's a big show.

1655
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,460
It was a lot to cover.

1656
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,460
I really did half.

1657
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,460
You did half of it twice.

1658
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:16,460
People don't know.

1659
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:17,460
But we did.

1660
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,460
Yeah.

1661
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:22,620
The recording stopped and we had to redo part of the show, which was never fun.

1662
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:23,620
But we got through it.

1663
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:24,620
We got through.

1664
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,620
Here we are now.

1665
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,620
Super impressive.

1666
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:27,620
You guys did awesome.

1667
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,740
I feel like I was listening to it for the first time.

1668
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,740
Well, good.

1669
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:31,740
Good.

1670
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,740
Yeah.

1671
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:36,940
You know, when I saw that Linus news, like I literally had to sit with it for the morning.

1672
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:41,740
Like it, it, it, I guess I didn't realize how much it would have impact me.

1673
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,740
Yep.

1674
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,740
It was hard.

1675
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,740
It was hard to write.

1676
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,740
You couldn't just like chew on it immediately.

1677
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:46,740
You had to let it percolate up.

1678
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,740
And I just kind of just posted the link somewhere.

1679
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,820
I would look at them later and came back to it.

1680
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:52,600
I was going to mention it didn't quite make it into the news.

1681
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,300
But those of you out there that are running Windows and my stats show it's a fair percentage

1682
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:01,380
of you, our friends over at Microsoft and Canonical have a new baby.

1683
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:06,680
There are now optimized Ubuntu desktop images available for Hyper-V in the Hyper-V gallery.

1684
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,500
And it's kind of legit.

1685
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:13,280
They've, they've integrated XRDP upstream to add support for enhanced session mode.

1686
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,320
They've improved clipboard integration.

1687
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,100
There's dynamic desktop resizing support.

1688
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,600
And there's also now support for shared folders for the hosting guest file transfer and a

1689
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,620
much improved mouse experience and it's easy to move between the host and the guest desktop

1690
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:27,620
window.

1691
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,620
Nice.

1692
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:32,180
I mean, if you're on professional, you might not really need VirtualBox anymore.

1693
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,180
That's what I mean.

1694
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:36,420
If you're a Windows, yeah, if you're a Windows 10 user on Pro and you've got Hyper-V, they've

1695
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:42,020
now got this Hyper-V gallery where you can just install 1804 optimized for Hyper-V. I,

1696
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:45,540
you know, I could try it on my new Windows partition actually and see how it goes.

1697
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:50,540
I hadn't really realized that, but I could actually try like Windows subsystem now and

1698
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:51,540
this.

1699
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:52,820
No, careful, careful.

1700
01:18:52,820 --> 01:18:53,820
Once you taste it.

1701
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,720
But that's negative in the freedom dimension.

1702
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:56,720
Is it?

1703
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,720
Is it?

1704
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,720
I have a hard time.

1705
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,720
And the value of this is negative.

1706
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,220
I can't really figure that out.

1707
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,220
Like it's.

1708
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,020
Or is it like a surreptitious freedom injection into that proprietary universe?

1709
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,020
Right.

1710
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:07,020
It's like a beachhead.

1711
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,020
Like it's like a Trojan horse.

1712
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,020
We are the wedge.

1713
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:22,340
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.
