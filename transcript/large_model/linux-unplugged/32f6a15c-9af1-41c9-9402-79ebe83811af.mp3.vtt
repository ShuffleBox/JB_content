WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.560
anybody had a chance to catch my new video series you guys seen the new the

00:03.560 --> 00:06.360
new video series I launched I think I've done three videos three videos are out

00:06.360 --> 00:10.960
now we're just now getting to Berkeley and at meet BSD so I've got a question

00:10.960 --> 00:15.160
for you sir and what why have you struck out with your own individual YouTube

00:15.160 --> 00:19.960
track channel excuse me well because it's a couple of things is I have good

00:19.960 --> 00:26.380
question I have been I've been over the last year I've become more of a YouTube

00:26.380 --> 00:30.640
content consumer you know I've always just sort of viewed YouTube as the place

00:30.640 --> 00:34.480
that is it's like another RSS feed we just dump we give it we put another dump

00:34.480 --> 00:38.720
of our stuff on YouTube and I haven't given a lot of thought to how people

00:38.720 --> 00:44.280
actually watch content on YouTube and so as I started watching more and more my

00:44.280 --> 00:47.600
content on YouTube because I don't have any other really great way to watch

00:47.600 --> 00:54.200
current daily television and I got the Android TV and it just sort of changed

00:54.200 --> 00:58.960
how how I how I consume YouTube and I realized that I don't like the channels

00:58.960 --> 01:04.240
that post all kinds of stuff political stuff development stuff tech news stuff

01:04.240 --> 01:07.880
Linux stuff it's like it's too much it's I when I sit down and watch the

01:07.880 --> 01:11.360
television I like I'm kind of an eminent I'm gonna track I have something I want

01:11.360 --> 01:17.240
to watch and so because this wasn't technical it's not really about Linux

01:17.240 --> 01:22.400
it's not about information security or networking it's it's just it's really

01:22.400 --> 01:28.240
more about me and it gets more personal as it goes on it sort of felt like I

01:28.240 --> 01:33.040
would be disrespecting the subscribers of the Jupiter broadcasting channel

01:33.040 --> 01:38.540
because I was sort of dumping something in their feed that wasn't why they

01:38.540 --> 01:42.440
subscribe to Jupiter broadcasting they subscribe for technical content oh and

01:42.440 --> 01:47.040
here's ten videos which are tangently connected to technical content but only

01:47.040 --> 01:51.120
for a small percentage of them enjoy it just but people like it and so it just

01:51.120 --> 01:53.920
felt like it was probably more appropriate to do something that was

01:53.920 --> 01:59.920
like this on my own channel and and then if there is probably I don't know yet

01:59.920 --> 02:03.720
but long term if there seems to be a lot of interest and it's worth a lot of

02:03.720 --> 02:07.680
effort on my part I would probably continue to produce it as a side channel

02:07.680 --> 02:15.120
to Jupiter broadcasting that's more like this the show behind the shows this is

02:15.120 --> 02:22.360
Lennox Unplugged episode 173 for November 29th 2016

02:30.360 --> 02:35.880
Oh welcome to Lennox Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's got a random craving

02:35.880 --> 02:40.760
for curry and beer my name is Chris my name is Wes hello Wes yeah you've got me

02:40.760 --> 02:45.400
hungry let's be honest Wes we have a newspack show and and Chris has been

02:45.400 --> 02:48.760
complaining for the last few weeks hasn't he yes it's the dearth of the

02:48.760 --> 02:53.400
news what's going on but now we've got it's back I guess everybody was just on

02:53.400 --> 02:57.600
Halloween break I'm not sure what Thanksgiving break now they've got their

02:57.600 --> 03:00.560
food they've got fresh energy they're making they're all back and they're

03:00.560 --> 03:04.180
making tons of open source updates we're gonna cover a lot of them coming up on

03:04.180 --> 03:07.280
this week's show we're gonna start with like the only non Linux stuff that's

03:07.280 --> 03:09.720
worth talking about just right here at the top we're gonna take our medicine

03:09.720 --> 03:14.400
and then moving on into the show did you hear about the core VLC developer who

03:14.400 --> 03:20.800
says no one cares about Linux that hurts it did hurt and apparently it hurt him

03:20.800 --> 03:25.040
too just as much we'll tell you why plus Debian is making a big change Ubuntu is

03:25.040 --> 03:29.960
gonna go with a rolling hardware kernel what is that really what's happening

03:29.960 --> 03:33.840
we'll tell you about that snaps have some nice updates coming along we'll get

03:33.840 --> 03:37.360
a little state of the snap the new XPS is out but there could be some big

03:37.360 --> 03:43.000
limitations and then we're gonna get super nerdy with Wes we're gonna talk

03:43.000 --> 03:48.200
about net data net data back ends data miner DB and all the crazy stuff he's

03:48.200 --> 03:52.000
been working on in his day job recently you know what I'm really looking forward

03:52.000 --> 03:54.820
to this because Wes you know we don't I don't know if it comes up in the show

03:54.820 --> 03:58.080
very much but you are heads down in this stuff all the time and you're working on

03:58.080 --> 04:02.080
some of the most buzzword heavy stuff that we talk about ain't that it is

04:02.080 --> 04:05.120
actually your day job so we're gonna talk a little bit about that then also

04:05.120 --> 04:09.560
just sort of a heads up for noobs on managing devices in Linux and then last

04:09.560 --> 04:14.720
but not least I'd like to round out the show with a classic conversation it came

04:14.720 --> 04:19.640
up in light of the fedora 25 review we did and that is upgrade versus nuke and

04:19.640 --> 04:24.680
pave when you're doing a new install or like a new release or etc etc so

04:24.680 --> 04:27.920
obviously if you just watch this week's episode Linux action show I'm referring

04:27.920 --> 04:32.040
to my upgrade from fedora 24 to 25 I've gotten a ton of feedback and by feedback

04:32.040 --> 04:36.920
I mean extreme criticism one nice probing like hey Chris why did you

04:36.920 --> 04:41.280
choose to do it this way and about 95 you moron so we're gonna we're gonna

04:41.280 --> 04:45.320
talk about those and talk about upgrade versus a new campaign because I think

04:45.320 --> 04:49.080
that's sort of a classic that we really haven't tackled much on this show so

04:49.080 --> 04:52.440
there's a ton of stuff to get into I did mention we have some veggies so to help

04:52.440 --> 04:56.040
us chew on these let's bring in that virtual lug timer appropriate greetings

04:56.040 --> 05:06.000
mumble room sandwich in there and I am hungry I don't know I don't know you

05:06.000 --> 05:10.680
know I get some child Chris I do you're right I oh well Wes has helped hooking me

05:10.680 --> 05:14.760
up though he brought in like this cozy sweater brew which is from Iron Horse

05:14.760 --> 05:19.120
brewery which that sounds kind of interesting cozy sweater a vanilla milk

05:19.120 --> 05:26.840
stout it's rich it's not too heavy I think where's this one from here canned

05:26.840 --> 05:34.760
and brewed by Iron Horse brewery in Washington hey Ellensburg you have yet

05:34.760 --> 05:38.320
to bring something outside the Pacific Northwest there was one the the Melvin

05:38.320 --> 05:42.480
but wasn't in the Pacific Northwest all right I won't but that was a really good

05:42.480 --> 05:44.760
beer so there has to be an exception so I'm gonna give it a go I'm gonna give it

05:44.760 --> 05:55.280
a hold on survey says beer is delicious that's a great beer that's quite tasty I

05:55.280 --> 05:59.520
might say that beer is tasty Wes thank you very much cheers to Linux so this

05:59.520 --> 06:05.160
headline is a little revolting this I I'm not gonna do I'm not gonna decry

06:05.160 --> 06:09.960
fake news but this headlines a little much Microsoft is telling developers

06:09.960 --> 06:13.440
whatever you're doing in Linux soon Windows 10 will do it and better

06:13.440 --> 06:19.840
whatever Linux can do we can do better the tech giant Nick Heath writes lays

06:19.840 --> 06:24.920
out its plans for the future of Ubuntu and bash on Windows 10 there's a couple

06:24.920 --> 06:28.880
of interesting little tidbits in here I thought we might cover mm-hmm it's laced

06:28.880 --> 06:34.200
with this language that I find myself exhausted by and I'm really hoping as we

06:34.200 --> 06:37.720
move on people can stop speaking and writing like this and you know it's

06:37.720 --> 06:42.840
sentences like this the firm recently updated Windows 10 to let users run a

06:42.840 --> 06:48.700
range of Linux tools from inside the OS the firm the firm being yet another way

06:48.700 --> 06:52.880
to refer to the tech giant which is another way to refer to the company in

06:52.880 --> 06:59.400
Redmond which is another way to refer to Microsoft I'm so sick of it and then it

06:59.400 --> 07:05.880
goes into this this sentence structure that implies that Microsoft were the

07:05.880 --> 07:10.360
ones to create this Windows 10 runtime that Microsoft did the development work

07:10.360 --> 07:13.960
when it was canonical that did the heavy lifting there Microsoft did the kernel

07:13.960 --> 07:17.400
enablements but that stuff was there for other compatibility layers they've had

07:17.400 --> 07:24.240
in the years past and the previous version of this sentence it wrote the

07:24.240 --> 07:30.260
firm quietly updated Windows 10 to let users run quietly updated and they

07:30.260 --> 07:35.160
removed the quietly since since we first started and it's just kind of that's

07:35.160 --> 07:39.640
that's obnoxious but they say whatever this is a quote from a Microsoft

07:39.640 --> 07:43.560
representative whatever it is that you normally do on Linux to build an

07:43.560 --> 07:48.520
application whether it's in go Erlang or in C whatever you use please give it a

07:48.520 --> 07:53.200
try on bash on Windows and they also want you to file bugs they say you know

07:53.200 --> 07:56.320
it's a big part of it the article goes on to say forthcoming updates some of

07:56.320 --> 07:59.220
which already available to those using the early builds of Windows 10 under the

07:59.220 --> 08:05.320
insider program includes support for Ubuntu 1604 hey more Linux tools like

08:05.320 --> 08:11.160
IF config and ping so you can which is really nice because there's a lot of

08:11.160 --> 08:15.000
tools that rely on IF config to get information so if you don't have IF

08:15.000 --> 08:17.920
config a lot of other tools don't work the other major new addition will be

08:17.920 --> 08:21.640
increased interoperability between bash and Windows environments effectively

08:21.640 --> 08:25.920
this will let developers call Windows applications from within bash well

08:25.920 --> 08:29.720
allowing them to write a bash script to automate complex builds that include

08:29.720 --> 08:34.120
Windows applications and to invoke bash applications from Windows PowerShell

08:34.120 --> 08:39.000
this all makes me feel very funny inside Chris so all of this is moderately nice

08:39.000 --> 08:43.800
right good for them at one point is Microsoft advocating that you stop using

08:43.800 --> 08:48.120
Linux and switch to Windows because the headline says Microsoft tells devs

08:48.120 --> 08:52.520
whatever you're doing in Linux Windows 10 will do soon too the tech giant lays

08:52.520 --> 08:56.080
out his plans for the future of Ubuntu on bash on Windows 10 the only thing the

08:56.080 --> 08:58.600
guy said is whatever it is that you normally do on Linux to build an

08:58.600 --> 09:03.240
application whether it's in go Erlang or C whatever you use please he says please

09:03.240 --> 09:09.360
comma give it a try on bash on Windows that's that's a very that's right it

09:09.360 --> 09:11.640
seems like really they just want users and they want to make it better which I

09:11.640 --> 09:16.080
mean yeah perhaps with no ill intent I mean were you gonna say something I was

09:16.080 --> 09:19.760
gonna say Windows does it better except for running dotnet and SQL Server Linux

09:19.760 --> 09:24.120
apparently does that call out to a Linux action show story week yeah dotnet got

09:24.120 --> 09:27.160
that dotnet team was starting to run stuff on Linux and was surprised by 2x

09:27.160 --> 09:30.880
performance improvement before the identity optimization this is another

09:30.880 --> 09:33.440
kind of story like I said we just got a couple of non-linux stories that are

09:33.440 --> 09:37.080
kind of Linux related here at the top can I just say yeah good I am sick of

09:37.080 --> 09:39.960
them calling it bash for Windows when they implemented the Linux kernel

09:39.960 --> 09:44.080
compatibility layer and they're still just calling it bash it just seems so

09:44.080 --> 09:47.600
weird do you think they should be calling it for Linux when should they

09:47.600 --> 09:50.840
call for Ubuntu on Linux I don't know it depends on what their ultimate goal is

09:50.840 --> 09:53.640
yeah they might just want to call it like a Linux compat layer because that's

09:53.640 --> 09:57.480
exactly what it is the technology is called Windows subsystem for Linux yeah

09:57.480 --> 10:02.600
that's its actual name I'm just it's the people calling it bash for Windows but

10:02.600 --> 10:06.400
actual Microsoft representatives are saying bash on window a better say bash

10:06.400 --> 10:10.840
on WSL or something like that they say bash on Ubuntu on Windows that's how

10:10.840 --> 10:15.520
it's pitched not in that article though all the ZS users really hurt I do

10:15.520 --> 10:18.560
actually feel like Ubuntu should get more prominence not only because it's a

10:18.560 --> 10:22.600
name brand that people recognize but also because it is the Ubuntu user land

10:22.600 --> 10:25.960
you're using and they did a lot of the work to you know help make this happen

10:25.960 --> 10:31.480
seems weird to lean on to leave it's not like I mean I've seen arch running on

10:31.480 --> 10:34.320
there but I'm not seeing I'm not seeing a lot of people running anything but a

10:34.320 --> 10:37.240
boot to at this point and if you're doing anything in production you're

10:37.240 --> 10:41.120
gonna be using the official image from Microsoft like bootstraps the Ubuntu

10:41.120 --> 10:44.360
image and gets apt working everything whereas like getting another environment

10:44.360 --> 10:48.280
working is incredibly painful the way they've set it up so far so there was a

10:48.280 --> 10:54.200
bug on Azure that specifically affected Red Hat instances did you see this mm-hmm

10:54.200 --> 10:58.280
this is a thing that I guess Amazon had probably engineered around because of

10:58.280 --> 11:01.880
their long experience but every now then you know I mean as you're in some senses

11:01.880 --> 11:05.360
is a newer platform right and the vulnerability was discovered by an Irish

11:05.360 --> 11:11.560
software engineer called Ian Duffy Ian Duffy I'm sorry I bet how how how how

11:11.560 --> 11:15.000
great would have been if it was I key right I mean how good that would have

11:15.000 --> 11:18.920
been amazing that would 100% anyway so I key discovered and reported on my to

11:18.920 --> 11:22.760
Microsoft as part of its bug program I key discovered that the glitch while

11:22.760 --> 11:26.160
working a while that while working on a hardened Red Hat Enterprise Linux for

11:26.160 --> 11:30.520
use on both Amazon Web Services and Azure now here's what it was kind of

11:30.520 --> 11:32.720
interesting is because part of the spec you should have operated under a

11:32.720 --> 11:36.440
metered billing pricing model consuming software updates from a local Red Hat

11:36.440 --> 11:40.200
Enterprise Linux repository owned and managed by Azure or Amazon depending on

11:40.200 --> 11:44.760
what you're using mm-hmm both AWS and Azure utilize deployment of the Red Hat

11:44.760 --> 11:49.000
update infrastructure places super boring I'm sorry anyways he noticed that

11:49.000 --> 11:54.000
some Red Hat packages RPMs contained client configurations for each reason

11:54.000 --> 11:58.160
region on Azure from this he was able to discover all the URLs for all of the

11:58.160 --> 12:01.760
regional reddit update applications on Azure and obtain access to archives

12:01.760 --> 12:06.080
containing log files configuration files and SSL updates and they could be used

12:06.080 --> 12:09.960
to gain full administrative access to the update appliances he said that

12:09.960 --> 12:12.640
despite the applications requiring usings and password-based authentication

12:12.640 --> 12:16.440
it was possible to execute and run their back-end log collector on a specified

12:16.440 --> 12:19.080
content delivery server when the collector service completed the

12:19.080 --> 12:22.520
application supplied URLs to archives which would then contain multiple logs

12:22.520 --> 12:25.560
and configuration files from the servers he said it might have also been able to

12:25.560 --> 12:28.400
get access to the storage accounts because he was able to read all of the

12:28.400 --> 12:32.000
information in those logs Microsoft has since taken action to prevent public

12:32.000 --> 12:35.920
access to log monitoring application and the Red Hat update appliances but it's

12:35.920 --> 12:38.560
not really known if anybody ever exploited these particular vulnerabilities

12:38.560 --> 12:42.920
in the wild so he's looking around seeing these RPMs these RPMs have all of

12:42.920 --> 12:46.760
the source URLs for the main servers he then goes to the main servers discovers

12:46.760 --> 12:50.120
the logs are available from by reading the law you can just grab those files he

12:50.120 --> 12:53.920
gets the whole map of the Azure Network and starts getting access to the systems

12:53.920 --> 12:57.680
it's probably pretty hard to run a cloud it's like they're getting better at it

12:57.680 --> 13:01.040
but there's always these little problems you know what else is hard and that like

13:01.040 --> 13:04.000
I said just we're just gonna talk about a couple of these we're not gonna spend

13:04.000 --> 13:07.200
a lot of time on this but damn it this pisses me off so much this pisses me off

13:07.200 --> 13:11.480
so damn much Android is hard especially the security on it and this is an

13:11.480 --> 13:15.920
article that is probably worth your time and the you may have seen the headline

13:15.920 --> 13:22.440
floating around Android security in 2016 is a mess he points out the obvious

13:22.440 --> 13:27.120
vendors like LG Samsung you know me etc after selling you the phone have no

13:27.120 --> 13:30.080
incentive to keep your phone software up to date with Google's fixes and

13:30.080 --> 13:34.840
everybody knows this and he goes in and makes some really brilliant points in

13:34.840 --> 13:38.680
here this talks out it talks about the media tech and blue phones that were

13:38.680 --> 13:43.760
available on Amazon they were uploading all of your information oh right I goes

13:43.760 --> 13:48.400
into how the A-list phone makers manage he talks about how Google's incentives

13:48.400 --> 13:51.640
don't really stack up either and then when we get to the what can we do

13:51.640 --> 13:59.920
segment of the article he says if money is no object my only sound advice can be

13:59.920 --> 14:05.680
to buy an iPhone Apple is still shipping security updates albeit iOS 9 for the

14:05.680 --> 14:10.400
iPhone 4s which was released in 2011 that's five years ago kids the iPhone

14:10.400 --> 14:14.720
5 is still being kept up to date with iOS 10 furthermore then you look at the

14:14.720 --> 14:21.240
things like encryption implementations iOS 4 released six years ago was already

14:21.240 --> 14:25.400
more advanced than the encryption in Android 7 Nougat released in August of

14:25.400 --> 14:28.880
this year in short already Apple has made better choices and how exactly

14:28.880 --> 14:32.680
different files are encrypted while Android went for a whole disk

14:32.680 --> 14:37.560
encryption which tanked battery life tanked CPU performance nobody used it

14:37.560 --> 14:41.440
all the OEMs disabled it yeah exactly and Android's finally gone its file

14:41.440 --> 14:44.320
base but they're actually not even doing that and they're not encrypting

14:44.320 --> 14:50.360
important parts of users data which is detailed in another blog post so he says

14:50.360 --> 14:55.440
if you're gonna go Android if you're gonna stick with Android you got to go

14:55.440 --> 15:05.840
pixel or Nexus so mr. pixel um why didn't you get an iPhone you know I've

15:05.840 --> 15:10.320
had an iPhone before I had an iPhone 4 for quite some time and it wasn't bad

15:10.320 --> 15:18.320
but it's just so it iOS just feels like a different abstraction than a

15:18.320 --> 15:22.840
traditional computer or a computer that I recognize and know how to use well

15:22.840 --> 15:26.640
that's a great way to put it and so it's not bad and I can see how other people

15:26.640 --> 15:28.840
might like it they've done a lot of very you're never gonna get access to the

15:28.840 --> 15:32.280
file system you'll never understand the structure of it you don't have an

15:32.280 --> 15:35.240
understanding of how applications can actually communicate with each other

15:35.240 --> 15:39.120
yeah you have no visibility over the processes on the machine I'm also

15:39.120 --> 15:41.800
someone you know who falls into weird little niches and I like to do weird

15:41.800 --> 15:44.840
things like try to run tink on my phone or whatever and so it's just without

15:44.840 --> 15:49.000
jailbreaking and then breaking a lot of the you know security that iOS has I

15:49.000 --> 15:53.440
don't really have no way to do that boy that is a that is a great point

15:53.440 --> 15:56.040
William did you specifically have I know you and I kind of talked about this

15:56.040 --> 15:59.760
before do you have any thoughts on this particular topic I'm so frustrated by

15:59.760 --> 16:03.120
the iPhone but it's so much better than my Android experience I think overall

16:03.120 --> 16:06.760
that I stick with it what frustrated I'm frustrated that like a lot of

16:06.760 --> 16:10.320
applications won't run in the background all the time and so you know like sync

16:10.320 --> 16:14.440
clients and things which I have three of I have to open manually when I want them

16:14.440 --> 16:19.320
to sync yeah yeah that is so frustrating and technically is infrastructure to get

16:19.320 --> 16:22.640
that working but none of them have it working so I don't know what the deal is

16:22.640 --> 16:27.120
yeah yeah they can't check to see if you're plugged in or on battery which I

16:27.120 --> 16:30.640
think is frustrating like I know sync thing on Android is super nice because

16:30.640 --> 16:34.280
you can set it so that it only activates when it's plugged in and it only

16:34.280 --> 16:38.200
activates on Wi-Fi and then you know you're not gonna drain your battery by

16:38.200 --> 16:40.720
connecting to sync thing but it was when you I were talking about this in

16:40.720 --> 16:43.200
pre-production I was like well what do we have anything new to really add to

16:43.200 --> 16:46.320
this conversation I mean you've got the pixel so you've made your choice there I

16:46.320 --> 16:49.600
have the iPhone 7 specifically because of this reason this was the thing that

16:49.600 --> 16:56.600
pushed me over that and application stability but your mom she's on an older

16:56.600 --> 17:00.900
she's on an older phone yeah she's got the Nexus 5 not no longer getting the

17:00.900 --> 17:05.600
new new updates does that as a geek does that bother you a little bit yeah you

17:05.600 --> 17:08.800
feel like gosh maybe I should get mom a new phone for Christmas yeah you know it

17:08.800 --> 17:11.680
makes me yeah it makes me think about that like should I have just told her to

17:11.680 --> 17:16.120
buy you know buy the book at the iPhone even if it was expensive mm-hmm and I

17:16.120 --> 17:18.360
wish I could give her more but you know there's just nothing I can do to help

17:18.360 --> 17:21.240
her and she's not gonna buy a pixel that's just she doesn't need a phone

17:21.240 --> 17:23.880
she doesn't use it to that capability she just needs a smartphone for the base

17:23.880 --> 17:29.200
stuff you know wimpy is in there with the the Ubuntu touch you know that's

17:29.200 --> 17:33.400
right so he's like a whole nother level when it comes to this because even when

17:33.400 --> 17:37.120
you're on the iPhone you know you really you're putting your trust and faith in

17:37.120 --> 17:41.280
Apple not to screw something up or not to work with somebody or etc etc so

17:41.280 --> 17:45.280
I feel like wimpy he's like he's like the prepper you know like the crazy

17:45.280 --> 17:49.000
prepper who's got like the bunker that's filled with all of the stuff for y2k

17:49.000 --> 17:54.680
that's wimpy right now I don't want to be that might wake you up really what

17:54.680 --> 17:57.880
are your thoughts on this it was security one of the things that moved

17:57.880 --> 18:03.680
you towards the Ubuntu mobile platform or was it what what not not security so

18:03.680 --> 18:10.280
much as just the data pooling and you know in light of oh yeah that's right

18:10.280 --> 18:13.240
the Google aspect of which we're not we haven't even broadened the conversation

18:13.240 --> 18:17.960
yeah point and not just not just the Google aspect but now I don't know if

18:17.960 --> 18:25.600
this is being publicized in the US but the Investigatory Powers Bill has now

18:25.600 --> 18:31.760
passed as law yeah you can I've done a little bit of following yeah replacing a

18:31.760 --> 18:37.480
something that was declared unlawful by the courts last year and was due to

18:37.480 --> 18:41.600
expire at the end of this year so fortunately for the government they must

18:41.600 --> 18:47.920
be so pleased this new law has been passed and enacted that now makes the

18:47.920 --> 18:54.320
previously unlawful thing lawful which is just terrific so yeah so you know

18:54.320 --> 18:58.240
with those sorts of things and therefore you know companies like Google who

18:58.240 --> 19:02.440
obviously got access to a lot of data they now become the government's best

19:02.440 --> 19:06.480
friend when they're looking to mine information and it's not so much about

19:06.480 --> 19:13.920
my own personal data because it's all in aggregate it's how the we were talking

19:13.920 --> 19:20.160
about YouTube incorrectly content IDing stuff earlier I think you know a trend

19:20.160 --> 19:27.000
that we will start to see is data mining for particular keywords and you know

19:27.000 --> 19:35.040
photo image analysis that incorrectly indicates that people are subject to or

19:35.040 --> 19:40.200
should be subject further deeper investigation in error is going to be

19:40.200 --> 19:46.720
something you know maybe a nightmare scenario would be let's say you're using

19:46.720 --> 19:54.040
Google Allo for your text messaging and you know you you have young kids and

19:54.040 --> 19:57.800
sometimes you you you would pass photos back and forth as the kids those would

19:57.800 --> 20:04.160
be those would be indexed but then also you know sometimes like you know I don't

20:04.160 --> 20:07.040
know I'm this hypothetical but like maybe I'd put a joke in there about oh

20:07.040 --> 20:10.160
I'm so sick of the kids let's put them on the street corner and see if we can

20:10.160 --> 20:14.120
sell them for 50 bucks mm-hmm you know or some joke like that that is an in

20:14.120 --> 20:18.640
joke between two people that know it's an absolute joke but now what happens if

20:18.640 --> 20:21.920
the government gets access to that data and can index all of it and build a

20:21.920 --> 20:25.200
personality profile about you or something creepy like that and the other

20:25.200 --> 20:29.600
example I've used in the past is that being in a family where there are lots

20:29.600 --> 20:35.440
of young children and as I've explained and any father will know young

20:35.440 --> 20:39.640
children have a predisposition to take off all of their clothes and run around

20:39.640 --> 20:48.480
but naked or or as near as when when photographs of taken of your children in

20:48.480 --> 20:53.960
those situations and you happen to have cloud-sinking services turned on the

20:53.960 --> 20:59.160
flesh tone analysis algorithms that can run over those photographs aren't

20:59.160 --> 21:04.120
associating you as the parent of that child and the innocence of the situation

21:04.120 --> 21:10.120
it's just a whether this is a suspicious image or not and and if that then gets

21:10.120 --> 21:15.560
flagged up as you are now a person of interest you know that's not what you

21:15.560 --> 21:19.840
want so that these are where my concerns it's not about my individual data it's

21:19.840 --> 21:26.040
about how that can be I think even if you don't have a specific scenario even

21:26.040 --> 21:28.560
if it's not about kids because that's sort of hard to connect for people that

21:28.560 --> 21:33.560
aren't parents I think where my where my concern lies is if we're if we're

21:33.560 --> 21:38.560
monitoring collecting and storing the date the data and records today what

21:38.560 --> 21:43.240
information will they be able to generate and suss out you know years

21:43.240 --> 21:48.560
down the road because once you have it stored what you can analyze and look at

21:48.560 --> 21:52.880
that data it's endless right and as we know there are so many laws that it's

21:52.880 --> 21:56.440
easy to violate even unintentionally or you know what that means true so I

21:56.440 --> 21:59.080
William I heard you sign is there anybody else that wants to jump on

21:59.080 --> 22:07.560
before we move on jump on jump on you know no okay oh well I got that took a

22:07.560 --> 22:11.800
weird turn that took a weird turn I got weird you know we started I came in no

22:11.800 --> 22:15.840
it's good it's good I just how have you been liking the pixel let me pick it up

22:15.840 --> 22:20.640
you've been liking it oh you let me hold it again yeah sure so you're right now

22:20.640 --> 22:24.640
two weeks into it yeah I still need to get a case and protect I'll probably

22:24.640 --> 22:27.320
order that tonight yeah what I have what have you what have you thought so far

22:27.320 --> 22:31.320
I'm liking it a lot it's a I haven't I haven't done much I haven't like

22:31.320 --> 22:35.320
customized it very much or used it but obviously I'm enjoying USB C that's very

22:35.320 --> 22:39.560
nice it does charge fast as advertised I am liking the camera there's some

22:39.560 --> 22:42.000
differences I did like some things about my previous phone as well but I'm having

22:42.000 --> 22:45.840
a good time with it and the battery life has been great so I feels like I'm on

22:45.840 --> 22:48.680
like a modern platform I'm getting I'm you know I've got the updates from

22:48.680 --> 22:52.080
Google yes I feels like it's a phone I can use and like not have to think

22:52.080 --> 22:56.040
about I do agree with the author that if you're on the Nexus line if you're on

22:56.040 --> 23:02.760
the pixel line you're in a much better position that is I do feel like I if you

23:02.760 --> 23:07.360
set aside the other Google privacy aspects and you just go for the OS we

23:07.360 --> 23:10.800
all know we all know this stuff needs patches constantly I mean if they're

23:10.800 --> 23:15.440
running with Linux kernel in there you know you know there's not only them not

23:15.440 --> 23:18.840
only is their own their own software have vulnerabilities in it but there's

23:18.840 --> 23:22.620
just core fundamental vulnerabilities in the underlying kernel and so getting

23:22.620 --> 23:26.840
those security updates for me was sort of like a baseline and I I'm not trying

23:26.840 --> 23:30.160
to be fancy about it I'm not trying to say like oh you can I'm not trying to be

23:30.160 --> 23:34.880
like some like Android master race user that says you can only buy pixel or

23:34.880 --> 23:39.560
Nexus I'm saying really like if if you care at all about like the security of

23:39.560 --> 23:44.520
your laptop or your servers or your desktop you should honestly really care

23:44.520 --> 23:47.480
about the security of your phone and I think that's why I talk about this

23:47.480 --> 23:51.920
because there is such a mindset out there and I don't mean to call anybody

23:51.920 --> 23:55.320
out but you know I go to these meetups and I see people and they pull out their

23:55.320 --> 23:59.240
old Android phones and I'm not trying to shame them but they're really old and

23:59.240 --> 24:03.800
insecure and I understand absolutely when it's a when it's a budget thing but

24:03.800 --> 24:07.480
you know even a 5x would be still getting updates and you can pick it up

24:07.480 --> 24:11.760
for fairly cheap definitely so I don't know it's oh I really would like people

24:11.760 --> 24:17.280
to to to think about this I would really like people to to walk around devices

24:17.280 --> 24:21.760
that are getting updates just simply for not just them but for the rest of the

24:21.760 --> 24:25.520
network yeah exactly it's a community thing well speaking of networks let's

24:25.520 --> 24:28.360
let's stop right here and we've been talking about mobile let's talk about

24:28.360 --> 24:31.320
our first sponsor that's this week this fit it all in let's bring it all

24:31.320 --> 24:35.960
together that'd be ting go over to linux.ting.com to get $25 off your first

24:35.960 --> 24:40.280
device or $25 in service credit ting is a great solution to this if you have a

24:40.280 --> 24:45.160
Nexus or a pixel device they don't have like an agenda to get you to install

24:45.160 --> 24:49.400
their version of a launcher or their skin there's nothing there's nothing

24:49.400 --> 24:54.440
about that experience that ting uses to monetize the user that requires they

24:54.440 --> 24:57.960
stay on the way of the updates it's it's totally opposite of their business model

24:57.960 --> 25:01.200
ting does not get in the way of the updates from the upstream OEM if you

25:01.200 --> 25:05.240
have a Nexus device you get the monthly updates if you have a Samsung device when

25:05.240 --> 25:08.720
Samsung ships an update you get a day of on the ting network there's no there's

25:08.720 --> 25:13.000
no incentive for ting to delay it and that's the business model you want now

25:13.000 --> 25:17.400
that's that's sort of just a side ting is just great all around also because if

25:17.400 --> 25:21.760
you only pay for what you use wireless it's six dollars for a line so if you

25:21.760 --> 25:26.400
want a couple of phones if you have a Nexus 6p and you have an iPhone 7 like I

25:26.400 --> 25:30.320
do because I'm working on both two lines six dollars a month

25:30.320 --> 25:34.720
Rekai upstairs he's over he's working up he's working in the upstairs basement

25:34.720 --> 25:39.920
right now editing this show as we go and I'll tell you what it would be extremely

25:39.920 --> 25:43.160
expensive for Jupiter broadcasting to pay for a traditional phone line like a

25:43.160 --> 25:46.840
giant family plan because he's he doesn't you know he talks to friends and

25:46.840 --> 25:52.520
family over Skype isn't they all do Skype he's on Telegram all the time and

25:52.520 --> 25:58.040
when he's here which is most of the time he's on Wi-Fi yeah and so why would I

25:58.040 --> 26:02.520
pay for like even a hundred minutes he doesn't use it why would I do that it's

26:02.520 --> 26:06.560
so great because I can give him total mobile freedom if he wants to go outside

26:06.560 --> 26:10.360
the studio and go do stuff he's got data he's got cellular he's good to go from

26:10.360 --> 26:12.560
a business perspective you can communicate with him as you need to

26:12.560 --> 26:17.480
exactly otherwise when he's here I'm only paying for what he uses six dollars

26:17.480 --> 26:21.920
for the line I think it's so great so go to Linux dot ting comm to support the

26:21.920 --> 26:25.400
show and get a twenty five dollar discount they have a Black Friday sale

26:25.400 --> 26:29.240
and I think maybe ting forgot to check their calendar I think some of these

26:29.240 --> 26:35.240
devices are still on sale yeah like you can get the LG tribute 5 for 50 bucks

26:35.240 --> 26:40.120
Wow and look at this you can also get the tin tell it I don't know it any tell

26:40.120 --> 26:45.160
I don't even know what this is a wearable phone and GPS tracker for 150

26:45.160 --> 26:50.680
bucks plus 50 and ting credit look at that it's like a that is so cool it's

26:50.680 --> 26:54.920
like a little tracker runner thing that has a CDMA yeah and ting is great for

26:54.920 --> 26:58.040
that things you just need a data connection for you know I know because

26:58.040 --> 27:00.880
you can get just the GSM you only pay for when you use it look at this thing

27:00.880 --> 27:05.360
has GPS you can track it on a map that's pretty cool pretty cool and it has a

27:05.360 --> 27:11.960
phone too that's amazing for 150 bucks Wow I never even seen it that's that is

27:11.960 --> 27:16.200
the greatest check them out linux.com mobile that makes sense shake up the

27:16.200 --> 27:19.120
mobile industry and get your patches don't let your mobile carrier stand in

27:19.120 --> 27:28.200
your way linux.com let's move into some more updates now we have things that are

27:28.200 --> 27:32.880
a little more controversial you might have seen the headline core VLC

27:32.880 --> 27:38.680
developer says no one cares about Linux and open HMD is a joke oh my gosh over

27:38.680 --> 27:45.040
at VR on linux.com this is a spicy post an email exchange between Norbert and

27:45.040 --> 27:50.960
one of the core developers of VLC and always in gadget do you remember the

27:50.960 --> 27:53.840
details on this I can't remember the details it was very heated it was

27:53.840 --> 27:56.800
very the video land dev said this is well let's get to the because this

27:56.800 --> 27:58.880
actually doesn't really matter because this is the part that just caused

27:58.880 --> 28:02.080
everybody get upset right the video land developer said that no one cares about

28:02.080 --> 28:10.680
Linux and the VR has no shot on Linux mostly it's a driver issue and this got

28:10.680 --> 28:14.960
a lot of attention today and it's kind of disappointing because when the story

28:14.960 --> 28:21.480
was posted to r slash Linux JB stopped by and answered and said hey I'm I'm the

28:21.480 --> 28:26.040
guy that was being interviewed in this email exchange here and I never said

28:26.040 --> 28:31.000
that about Linux that's not what I said now it's not clear exactly what how that

28:31.000 --> 28:35.600
happened right yeah but I want to get into the quotes I want to get into what

28:35.600 --> 28:41.720
he says actually happened but before we do that this is all sort of gotten the

28:41.720 --> 28:48.400
ball started got rolling here when VLC announced 360 degree view in the Windows

28:48.400 --> 28:53.400
and Mac OS versions of VLC but not in the Linux version so the website VR and

28:53.400 --> 28:56.760
Linux decided to reach out to the VLC project find out what what would the

28:56.760 --> 29:02.640
deal was hey guys how come we don't have 360 degree video in VLC and as wimpy

29:02.640 --> 29:06.600
will often advocate this is a core feature that we absolutely have to have

29:06.600 --> 29:14.040
on the Linux desktop is 360 degree VR video and so I believe I believe no okay

29:14.040 --> 29:22.080
so the VR on Linux site reached out and got kind of I don't know a snappish back

29:22.080 --> 29:25.880
and forth there was a bit of a culture clash he goes into their IRC they start

29:25.880 --> 29:30.040
making some typical jokes about Linux in their IRC that everybody kind of knows

29:30.040 --> 29:33.200
are just jokes this journalist supposedly quote-unquote

29:33.200 --> 29:36.280
journalist this person that runs the website supposedly takes these quotes

29:36.280 --> 29:39.720
out of context and then creates the headline VLC developer says no one cares

29:39.720 --> 29:45.360
about Linux that's the background so here is what that VLC developer actually

29:45.360 --> 29:50.160
says he says the issue on VR is that there are a very large number of

29:50.160 --> 29:53.600
headsets and that all of them require some different drivers and different

29:53.600 --> 29:58.000
API's to work with them even on Windows it's not very stable and unfortunately

29:58.000 --> 30:04.840
the people riding the drivers do not care about Linux hence the quote but the

30:04.840 --> 30:10.200
very very very three varies large majority of developers of VLC are using

30:10.200 --> 30:14.400
Linux because it's the only same system you can use to base your work on

30:14.400 --> 30:22.200
therefore I have never ever ever said no one cares about Linux this is the most

30:22.200 --> 30:30.120
stupid thing I have ever seen especially outside the VR context but yes so far

30:30.120 --> 30:35.120
very few people care about Linux VR the drivers are very bad compared to Windows

30:35.120 --> 30:41.280
and the gamers using VR are very few on Linux seems pretty fair yeah very few

30:41.280 --> 30:45.960
anywhere aren't they mm-hmm right well maybe we'll see there's a Star Trek game

30:45.960 --> 30:53.360
coming out that might get me to get a PlayStation if I could I would I had a

30:53.360 --> 30:57.640
prediction on that other podcast you know the other one for this year which

30:57.640 --> 31:03.720
was that VR would continue to lack adoption and I found some figures to

31:03.720 --> 31:09.120
demonstrate what the market thought the VR adoption would be this year oh and

31:09.120 --> 31:18.240
what the adoption has actually been and it is abysmally below target by millions

31:18.240 --> 31:24.480
and millions and millions of units so I don't think calling out Linux for poor

31:24.480 --> 31:29.560
VR support is an issue because there's very little VR support and what VR

31:29.560 --> 31:35.960
support exists is beyond the means of most people anyway unless you have an S6

31:35.960 --> 31:40.520
or S7 and that I say that because I was at a Thanksgiving event over the

31:40.520 --> 31:46.440
holiday and one of our family friends was there with a Samsung s7 and the new

31:46.440 --> 31:51.320
VR headset and it was here how much does an S how much does an S7 and the

31:51.320 --> 31:56.340
matching headset cost you know the S7 out the same as a VR gaming PC and you

31:56.340 --> 32:02.400
know what it's it's so bad it is so worse than even the oculus than the

32:02.400 --> 32:10.040
5 it is it is it is it is baby VR it's baby VR with a diaper on it and with a

32:10.040 --> 32:13.520
with a stinker in the diaper and it's going around telling everybody it's VR

32:13.520 --> 32:19.200
and it I you know I watched everybody there try it on and that was their first

32:19.200 --> 32:24.760
VR experience and I went home yeah you can look at a dinosaur yeah you can you

32:24.760 --> 32:27.160
can look at the up to the Jeeps over there and you can look at a dinosaur

32:27.160 --> 32:31.080
that's VR all right it is very disappointing it's very expensive the

32:31.080 --> 32:35.240
hardware requirements are ridiculous the headsets are not standardized the all of

32:35.240 --> 32:38.520
it is just it's a total it's a total doesn't give a good approximation of

32:38.520 --> 32:42.120
what like the most exciting aspects of VR at least like the good ones are at

32:42.120 --> 32:46.440
least looking from the outside and I got it I will I will admit I am NOT a VR

32:46.440 --> 32:50.120
enthusiast I do not follow it super closely but at least looking from the

32:50.120 --> 32:58.160
outside it does look like it is stacked for failure core companies haven't come

32:58.160 --> 33:02.400
together like I would have expected them by now there's no standardizations like

33:02.400 --> 33:05.400
I would have expected by now big companies that I would have thought

33:05.400 --> 33:09.680
would be in it are not in it right now it's still kind of small there's not a

33:09.680 --> 33:14.760
solution for the cable problem right now we haven't seen like 2017 you know

33:14.760 --> 33:18.520
concept models of VR headsets that are totally wireless what we're seeing

33:18.520 --> 33:22.720
instead are backpack PCs that have huge power cords coming off of them this is

33:22.720 --> 33:28.080
this is not looking good so maybe Linux not being on the forefront of it isn't

33:28.080 --> 33:31.400
the biggest deal yeah I guess I'd love to be wrong because I really felt like

33:31.400 --> 33:35.800
my experience with the oculus was sort of revolutionary yeah I know a lot of

33:35.800 --> 33:39.720
people who like the vibe a lot yeah I heard good things do you have any

33:39.720 --> 33:43.280
thoughts on Debian putting everything in slash user screw it we're just gonna put

33:43.280 --> 33:47.960
everything all of the things no that's not actually quite true but there is

33:47.960 --> 33:51.240
evidence of a shift that can be found in the bootstrap option that has arrived in

33:51.240 --> 33:56.000
the latest unstable branch where Debian developer has posted news in the mailing

33:56.000 --> 33:59.480
list as well saying that if you use Deb bootstrapping with a certain command you

33:59.480 --> 34:03.860
can now merge slash user with slash bin s bin and lib they'll be they'll put

34:03.860 --> 34:07.160
symlinks in their former positions or something to that effect do I have that

34:07.160 --> 34:10.760
right mm-hmm you know and there's consolidation like Arches done is that

34:10.760 --> 34:13.760
what you're gonna say would be I was gonna say exactly the same thing isn't

34:13.760 --> 34:17.480
this what fedora and arch have done several years ago yep yeah I think I

34:17.480 --> 34:20.400
mean it's it's funny in the historical sense that now like everything is under

34:20.400 --> 34:23.980
slash user you know given like it's like some of its original purposes and just

34:23.980 --> 34:26.280
like it's we could just have those things under you know just under the

34:26.280 --> 34:30.800
root directory perhaps but I think practically you know we have the file

34:30.800 --> 34:33.760
system we have we have the you know legacy and dependencies on the file

34:33.760 --> 34:37.600
system structure so this seems like a very practical thing to do I was looking

34:37.600 --> 34:42.520
it looks like arch did this back in 2013 mm-hmm which means I've been using

34:42.520 --> 34:48.280
that's when I switch I switch to arch right as the systems I just first set up

34:48.280 --> 34:52.080
we're switching over and then the systems I set up slightly after already

34:52.080 --> 34:56.960
had this transition said it so that's that's my milestone was this big switch

34:56.960 --> 35:02.320
that arch did that's a long time anyways if you're curious the new option is sort

35:02.320 --> 35:05.160
of it's sort of nice one of the reasons for the change that the current hierarchy

35:05.160 --> 35:09.880
creates busywork for developers they have said like back in January developers

35:09.880 --> 35:12.780
were talking about the change would mean that we don't have to try to harass a

35:12.780 --> 35:19.240
thousand package maintainers into doing essentially on untestable busywork to

35:19.240 --> 35:22.660
move things around between slash user slash business live to support a tiny

35:22.660 --> 35:27.160
handful of systems for which other approaches are available and they also

35:27.160 --> 35:30.480
say another good reason for doing this it greatly simplifies the creation of

35:30.480 --> 35:35.640
read-only file systems which are useful for things like USB Linux distros and

35:35.640 --> 35:40.520
secure environments transaction updates things like that

35:40.520 --> 35:43.440
hey sounds like a good thing not a big deal really

35:43.440 --> 35:46.480
Debbie and just sort of coming in line with changes but I guess this means that

35:46.480 --> 35:52.600
Ubuntu will also be making this change that I guess is newsworthy too and I

35:52.600 --> 35:55.880
don't really think it's gonna cuz with symlinks left in place it almost don't

35:55.880 --> 35:59.480
imagine the majority of people will see this I was like I would like them to say

35:59.480 --> 36:05.260
hey no symlinks nice and clean you know what that breaks though there's a there

36:05.260 --> 36:08.440
are distros there are distros out there that have radically different file

36:08.440 --> 36:11.840
systems mobile can any of you be my external brain what's the one I'm

36:11.840 --> 36:15.400
thinking of that has a totally different file system hierarchy that makes a lot

36:15.400 --> 36:19.720
more sense that they're the only distro bow Linux maybe I think that's it yeah

36:19.720 --> 36:23.480
gobo was posted there nixos also does something yeah every package is stored

36:23.480 --> 36:28.840
individually every single build hey you 1604 users would you like in a little

36:28.840 --> 36:34.680
hwe huh huh you want a little hwe yes I do a little hardware enablement that's

36:34.680 --> 36:41.320
right sick starting with Ubuntu 16.04.2 and beyond you're gonna get hardware

36:41.320 --> 36:45.800
enabling hardware enablement kernels which are backported from newer Ubuntu

36:45.800 --> 36:50.840
releases in order to allow new hardware to work on the older LTS release that's

36:50.840 --> 36:56.400
not new that's not all of that interesting but what is new is they're

36:56.400 --> 37:01.560
calling this new version a rolling hardware enablement kernel a rolling hwe

37:01.560 --> 37:06.360
kernel essentially consumers of an hwe kernel will automatically be upgraded to

37:06.360 --> 37:10.720
the next kernel offered in the subsequent point releases until reaching

37:10.720 --> 37:16.720
the final kernel offered in 16.04.5 so it's not like true rolling it's just

37:16.720 --> 37:20.040
that you automatically get your kernel upgraded to the next hardware enablement

37:20.040 --> 37:25.880
kernel with future LTS point releases I think I'm getting that right I mean

37:25.880 --> 37:30.840
perhaps a more yeah not quite rolling but at least more frequent I like that

37:30.840 --> 37:35.680
though approximately I was talking with mr. Tonell there in the in the Mamba

37:35.680 --> 37:40.680
room about neon and neon is based on 1604 and if I do decide to try out the

37:40.680 --> 37:43.800
plasma desktop again I think I'm gonna do it on neon and I like the idea that

37:43.800 --> 37:48.480
I'll get a modern neon desktop right LTS 1604 that gets hardware enabled

37:48.480 --> 37:52.960
kernels which means newer laptops will be supported and whatnot so hopefully a

37:52.960 --> 37:55.440
very stable system that's not gonna you know you get new things but it's not

37:55.440 --> 37:59.280
gonna break on you yeah yeah that is that is particularly appealing to me you

37:59.280 --> 38:05.920
know kinds oh yeah oh you are what do you think about this as somebody who's

38:05.920 --> 38:09.200
kind of doing that very approach do you care about news like this is this seem

38:09.200 --> 38:12.320
like this is gonna be kind of a compelling feature to what you're now

38:12.320 --> 38:17.120
using as your standard desktop this is great for future proofing stuff I mean

38:17.120 --> 38:21.840
even though it's not really a thing but it's more like my hardware is fine I

38:21.840 --> 38:27.200
don't have a problem with it but the the fact that this they're using a 1604 and

38:27.200 --> 38:32.720
their their goal for neon is to always be LTS so in a year or two oh well not

38:32.720 --> 38:36.240
two but a year and a year and a half it'll be more of a problem that is it's

38:36.240 --> 38:41.360
based on 1604 just like every district that's our ever been LTS based that you

38:41.360 --> 38:46.000
know 1404 like elementary or mint or whatever they always had the same kind

38:46.000 --> 38:49.760
of problems with hardware support and stuff like that so this kind of yeah

38:49.760 --> 38:54.520
that was very nice provides a benefit to that too and also because the church of

38:54.520 --> 39:00.160
neon maybe can I pick on you do you know does this mean like if I'm running an

39:00.160 --> 39:05.560
1604 install will I have a newer version of the kernel will it be like version

39:05.560 --> 39:11.280
4.8 or is it stuff that actually gets back ported to the 1604 kernel that

39:11.280 --> 39:17.080
shipped every right so this this isn't so different from what's been done in

39:17.080 --> 39:22.800
previous year or previous LTS is so the point to release is always the release

39:22.800 --> 39:30.320
where the hardware enablement kernel first lands and traditionally that has

39:30.320 --> 39:37.040
been named after the current interim release kernel that's out so at the

39:37.040 --> 39:44.240
moment that's Yakety that's from 1610 so the 1610 kernel will get back ported

39:44.240 --> 39:50.040
into 1604 and traditionally it's not just the kernel it's also the graphics

39:50.040 --> 39:55.000
stack comes along with it as well oh right I remember that yeah that is kind

39:55.000 --> 40:00.520
of a big deal too but the names of the packages were always named after the

40:00.520 --> 40:05.480
interim release so they were something something hyphen Yakety and I think

40:05.480 --> 40:08.880
what's happening this time round is that that naming convention will be dropped

40:08.880 --> 40:14.880
so that once you opt in to the hardware enablement kernel which you have to

40:14.880 --> 40:21.120
manually do it via updates if you're running 1604 dot one or earlier or will

40:21.120 --> 40:27.840
be embedded by default in the 1604 dot two ISOs once you've opted into that

40:27.840 --> 40:34.400
you will get the subsequent releases for zesty and whatever a and B might be

40:34.400 --> 40:37.840
automatically through updates once you've opted into the hardware

40:37.840 --> 40:45.880
enablement kernel that's pretty neat you and do you know if this is changed all

40:45.880 --> 40:49.800
if I've also opted into the live patching service or can I have my cake

40:49.800 --> 40:57.280
and eat it too you know I don't know the details on that I will imagine that the

40:57.280 --> 41:01.760
live patch will work but I tell you what why don't we discuss that next week and

41:01.760 --> 41:06.720
I'll get an answer from an authoritative source I guess I'm sort of fantasizing

41:06.720 --> 41:11.200
about like a 1604 machine with a current desktop environment a hardware

41:11.200 --> 41:14.200
enablement kernel that continues to give back ports and live patches that's

41:14.200 --> 41:17.240
sounding like a great workstation it really does yeah exactly I was about to

41:17.240 --> 41:20.780
say perfect work so this the only thing that's changed here though is that in

41:20.780 --> 41:27.140
the past you would choose to opt into a particular right kernel release it

41:27.140 --> 41:30.640
sounds more like how I'd want to be stacked whereas this time it will now

41:30.640 --> 41:35.200
move with each of the interim releases automatically which seems ideal really

41:35.200 --> 41:40.160
yeah and and sort of playing into this sort of making that the ideal

41:40.160 --> 41:45.280
workstation is I saw a really popular story today on Twitter was actually from

41:45.280 --> 41:50.080
OMG Ubuntu about I think it was five applications I already snapped up that

41:50.080 --> 41:53.080
you can install right now and of course one of them was telegram which is of

41:53.080 --> 41:56.000
course they're gonna get you up the top of my list and I it seems to be there's

41:56.000 --> 41:59.640
some serious movement happening around snaps so I kind of wanted to pick

41:59.640 --> 42:03.000
wimpy's brain if we go a little bit further and and talk about this story I

42:03.000 --> 42:07.360
saw on softpedia this is now you can package your apps as snaps without

42:07.360 --> 42:13.040
bundling their dependencies which I would think would make these snaps

42:13.040 --> 42:17.760
significantly smaller but I but at the same time that feels like it's sort of

42:17.760 --> 42:21.280
defeating the entire purpose I thought the whole point was that I download this

42:21.280 --> 42:28.480
one thing and everything runs what's going on with me well this is utilizing

42:28.480 --> 42:36.000
the content sharing interface which was tabled at the snappy sprint in the

42:36.000 --> 42:40.560
summer which was the sprint that all the community people were invited to so the

42:40.560 --> 42:46.000
likes of the elementary project and the KDE team via blue systems and myself

42:46.000 --> 42:50.600
then as well so this is when we first heard about this content sharing

42:50.600 --> 42:56.800
interface and the idea here is that if you have got a common platform that lots

42:56.800 --> 43:04.280
of applications target then that platform can be snapped and it can share

43:04.280 --> 43:10.360
its assets so that applications can connect to them so for example in this

43:10.360 --> 43:14.360
in this case the the article in question is talking about the Ubuntu app

43:14.360 --> 43:21.080
platform which is essentially Qt based applications so those that you will find

43:21.080 --> 43:29.280
in Unity 8 for example so here you now have a platform snap for Qt and you can

43:29.280 --> 43:38.640
now elect to connect to those assets in that common platform for your Qt based

43:38.640 --> 43:42.200
snap so does that mean the client is aware when I install something that says

43:42.200 --> 43:46.200
hey I've already got all of the Qt dependencies and since that's that's

43:46.200 --> 43:51.600
something that's so specifically these are not dependencies this is a word you

43:51.600 --> 43:57.480
absolutely have to avoid this is this is a either a bunch of libraries or a bunch

43:57.480 --> 44:02.240
of assets but it essentially a collection of files that another snap

44:02.240 --> 44:06.900
can connect to and behind the scenes they're effectively being bind mounted

44:06.900 --> 44:14.580
into your application at runtime oh okay so so if another application I've

44:14.580 --> 44:20.880
installed has those libraries the new application I install will mount that

44:20.880 --> 44:24.880
image connect to the and use the libraries in that image yeah yeah

44:24.880 --> 44:29.360
exactly so so how does that affect like updates like if I update one snap but

44:29.360 --> 44:32.560
the other snap doesn't get updated but it's dependent I'm not depending but

44:32.560 --> 44:37.160
linking in order to control that there's a mechanism called assertions that make

44:37.160 --> 44:42.680
sure that you can ensure that this particular platform snap can is

44:42.680 --> 44:47.600
compatible with this particular application snap and and and the those

44:47.600 --> 44:53.880
those connections won't be broken in any way how does that avoid be feeling like

44:53.880 --> 44:57.560
dependencies though because it doesn't that sound like okay would that then

44:57.560 --> 45:03.120
prevent one snap from getting updated if another snap is using its libraries not

45:03.120 --> 45:07.200
necessarily because the platform snaps can be versioned independently so in the

45:07.200 --> 45:15.040
GTK parlance you could have a GTK 318 platform snap and a GTK 320 platform

45:15.040 --> 45:22.600
snap and a GTK 322 snap okay and within the application that you're creating so

45:22.600 --> 45:29.640
let's choose get it you can define in the get it snap which which version of

45:29.640 --> 45:34.480
the platform snap it requires I see okay it seems like it's like a handy option

45:34.480 --> 45:37.300
where like you then you know if you don't want to depend on one of those you

45:37.300 --> 45:40.720
still have all this capability and roll your bring your dependencies with you

45:40.720 --> 45:45.200
exactly and and you know there are some big wins here so the sizes of the

45:45.200 --> 45:50.520
individual application snaps come down considerably sure yeah the example of

45:50.520 --> 45:55.280
these cute applications they were looking at individual applications using about

45:55.280 --> 46:03.020
86 Meg and coming down to about 1.3 Meg by using content sharing and also the

46:03.020 --> 46:07.520
build time reduces as well it doesn't have to pull in all of that stuff so the

46:07.520 --> 46:11.840
build time plummets considerably from you know close to 1 minute 50 down to a

46:11.840 --> 46:17.600
few seconds so those those are all those are all good wins for sure and it's not

46:17.600 --> 46:23.440
just it's not just the Ubuntu platform snap that's available in this fashion

46:23.440 --> 46:30.260
the KDE team have been working towards snapping KDE 5 and the plasma

46:30.260 --> 46:35.640
frameworks and they've been using this technique for some weeks now and have

46:35.640 --> 46:40.000
demonstrated significant gain so I think their platform snap is like a hundred

46:40.000 --> 46:44.920
and sixty or a hundred and eighty megabytes and if you repeat that many

46:44.920 --> 46:48.560
times over for each of the individual applications that obviously you know

46:48.560 --> 46:53.360
doesn't scale very well but they they create this platform snap and then the

46:53.360 --> 46:58.960
individual application snaps are you know measured in one or two megabytes

46:58.960 --> 47:06.120
or smaller so you know it works 300k 300k yeah and there was a great

47:06.120 --> 47:12.600
introduction to this given by Harold sitter who works for blue systems on KDE

47:12.600 --> 47:18.320
at the Ubuntu online summit a couple of weeks ago so if you go to summit.ubuntu.com

47:18.320 --> 47:23.500
and look up the the KDE presentation which I think was on the

47:23.500 --> 47:29.320
Wednesday he gives a good introduction to how and also actually shows the code

47:29.320 --> 47:33.760
behind so shows the snapcraft.yaml behind the scenes in terms of the

47:33.760 --> 47:39.060
platform snaps and the individual application snaps and demonstrates how

47:39.060 --> 47:42.720
they're connected and how they work so he did a great job of actually sort of

47:42.720 --> 47:47.520
showing this you know in real terms and how it's benefiting the KDE team he's

47:47.520 --> 47:53.200
also involved in developing neon so in him most of the guys in blue systems are

47:53.200 --> 47:58.280
yeah you're making me you're making me you know you're making me want to use

47:58.280 --> 48:05.960
neon I gotta say rotten dang it you'll find out on a future show maybe so yeah

48:05.960 --> 48:09.140
well how hey rotten what do you do to mount Samba shares what do you do how

48:09.140 --> 48:14.200
does that ever something you do oh yeah just auto mount what do you mean well

48:14.200 --> 48:17.620
okay so you're doing it like when you boot up or you're doing it so like what

48:17.620 --> 48:22.600
I was one of the things I love about one of the things I love about Nautilus is I

48:22.600 --> 48:27.560
can show up at a network I joined I joined the wireless network I hit browse

48:27.560 --> 48:32.960
for other locations all of the different Samba shares and AFP shares and SSH

48:32.960 --> 48:38.160
servers show up I can double click an SSH a server I can double click a Samba

48:38.160 --> 48:44.120
server I can double click an AFP server and it mounts using the gnome virtual

48:44.120 --> 48:49.760
file system as an actual folder on my file system which we're gonna get to in

48:49.760 --> 48:54.280
a little bit why that's a big deal and for me the fact that dolphin can connect

48:54.280 --> 48:58.640
but when you double click a file it has to download the file to your local hard

48:58.640 --> 49:03.600
drive and then open up the associated application like that doesn't work when

49:03.600 --> 49:09.440
you're looking at a 20 gigabyte MKV file right it's rough that is rough yeah and

49:09.440 --> 49:11.480
that explore ability especially if you're you know you're roving around

49:11.480 --> 49:15.400
you're taking your laptop to different networks so you use a like you use like

49:15.400 --> 49:20.000
you just you just mountain to the file system rotten that's what you know I'm

49:20.000 --> 49:24.640
mounted as a network share I'm tempted I'm gonna do it I think you've talked me

49:24.640 --> 49:29.520
into it I'm going to I'm going to install the plasma meta package I will

49:29.520 --> 49:35.600
point out one thing what while neon and arch are both currently up-to-date neon

49:35.600 --> 49:40.200
gets the newest release the same day arch is like a couple weeks at the most

49:40.200 --> 49:44.760
it's like a week we can be two weeks maybe but neon is day of within hours

49:44.760 --> 49:48.760
that would be nice and I think here's what I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm gonna

49:48.760 --> 49:51.980
install it right now while we're doing the show we'll see how what happens at

49:51.980 --> 49:54.760
the end of the show I'll log out and see if I can use if we have a show still

49:54.760 --> 49:59.160
yeah but here's my thinking if I like it then maybe I would go neon but I might

49:59.160 --> 50:04.200
as well dip my toes here I love I love the arch package management tools I love

50:04.200 --> 50:07.320
just getting in there and installing things from the AUR like an animal all

50:07.320 --> 50:12.400
of that so I'm gonna do it right now I'm gonna do it like a like a like a just an

50:12.400 --> 50:20.320
animal do it do it live on the show I'm gonna put in my s right here hmm 426

50:20.320 --> 50:26.280
packages it's only gonna download isn't that interesting 154 I like it yeah I'm

50:26.280 --> 50:30.800
really excited to see how this goes so as of recording it looks like I'm seeing

50:30.800 --> 50:36.880
a lot of plasma 5.8.4.1 packages 5.8.4 seems to be the first time installing

50:36.880 --> 50:45.000
as we record so I'm gonna say yes to this and we are off to the races it is

50:45.000 --> 50:49.040
West it is super satisfying you know that reminds me of that same satisfying

50:49.040 --> 50:52.920
feeling when I install packages over a digital ocean for serious digital ocean

50:52.920 --> 50:55.920
if you want to have a great package experience install them on a digital

50:55.920 --> 51:00.720
ocean droplet what's a droplet a droplet is an all SSD powered Linux rig

51:00.720 --> 51:05.600
or free BSD over at digital ocean comm in fact if you use our promo code of

51:05.600 --> 51:10.320
power did you hear that it's on paper you know what that means it's official

51:10.320 --> 51:14.840
because a tree died fitness right here you hear that you can't make those sound

51:14.840 --> 51:17.960
effects up you can't put that in the sound board nope you can't find that on

51:17.960 --> 51:23.080
freesound.org can't do that it's right in house special effects do unplugged

51:23.080 --> 51:26.920
all one word lowercase you create an account you put that in there you apply

51:26.920 --> 51:31.160
it you get $10 you can go spin up a Linux rig and guess what Wes they're not

51:31.160 --> 51:36.600
sitting around over digital ocean they're now offering fedora 25 over a

51:36.600 --> 51:41.000
digital ocean comm so you can spin up a four door 25 server of course they've

51:41.000 --> 51:45.400
got the Ubuntu's they've got the Debbie ins I got the core OS sent OS and free

51:45.400 --> 51:48.600
BSD and they have data centers in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam

51:48.600 --> 51:53.160
London Toronto Germany the pricing is great five dollars a month for a basic

51:53.160 --> 51:58.200
rig but you can also do hourly I've been getting a rig now that's like it's like

51:58.200 --> 52:02.120
three cents an hour it's great so reasonable it's so nice and the

52:02.120 --> 52:07.120
interface is perfect I could perfect balance of powerful but easy to use and

52:07.120 --> 52:12.360
their documentation is top-notch they just published on the 1st of November a

52:12.360 --> 52:16.840
guide on configuring next cloud on Ubuntu 1604 so if you've been thinking

52:16.840 --> 52:20.880
about setting up next cloud want to roll your own cloud you want to have some of

52:20.880 --> 52:24.560
the services and what's really nice too is you can set this up on Android and

52:24.560 --> 52:29.040
iOS to sync with the next cloud instance and it's your own and you manage it at

52:29.040 --> 52:32.960
digital ocean comm use our promo code you can get it for two months for free

52:32.960 --> 52:37.320
just got to use that promo code do unplugged one word and apply it to your

52:37.320 --> 52:41.000
account over digital ocean comm and you can dig around in their tutorials and

52:41.000 --> 52:44.560
there's all kinds of handy information in there and now you can deploy fedora

52:44.560 --> 52:49.840
25 fresh look at that that's pretty cool and you know it's nice how much they

52:49.840 --> 52:52.360
keep up with you know various Linux communities it shows could very much

52:52.360 --> 52:56.400
what's also super nice about it is they're working upstream they're working

52:56.400 --> 53:00.520
with the projects it's not like they're just going off and taking the ISOs and

53:00.520 --> 53:04.280
like they're communicating with the projects they're setting up channels for

53:04.280 --> 53:07.160
updates and patches so everything's handled super smoothly great

53:07.160 --> 53:11.280
relationships yeah digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a

53:11.280 --> 53:17.680
big thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the um so I think this is a

53:17.680 --> 53:21.120
good sign now there's some concerns I have with this but I think this is a

53:21.120 --> 53:27.480
good sign the XPS 13 the Sputnik that's been been sort of like a trial balloon

53:27.480 --> 53:31.760
by Dell right is getting another update sort of right right on the nose I

53:31.760 --> 53:35.000
believe it's right on the anniversary of the Sputnik launch too which is kind of

53:35.000 --> 53:41.480
funny the 59th anniversary there's a new version of Dell's and they call it like

53:41.480 --> 53:45.080
a developer laptop right yeah it's not I don't really even know if there it's I

53:45.080 --> 53:48.120
don't even know if project Sputnik is the right term anymore but that's what

53:48.120 --> 53:52.600
everybody knows it by so they have a new XPS 13 developer edition that's what

53:52.600 --> 53:56.280
they call it developer edition laptop it's got seventh generation Intel core

53:56.280 --> 54:02.060
processors it ships with Ubuntu 1604 preloaded the killer wireless card which

54:02.060 --> 54:07.640
are the rebranding of Qualcomm a Theros and infinity edge display either 1080p

54:07.640 --> 54:13.240
or in their 4k version so it's a slight bump from what we're familiar with and

54:13.240 --> 54:16.760
it starts at nine hundred and fifty bucks under a grand yeah that's nice

54:16.760 --> 54:23.040
for an i5 8 gigs and of RAM and 120 gigabyte 128 gigabyte flash goes all

54:23.040 --> 54:29.200
the way up to an i7 apparently they say with 16 gigs of RAM and 512 gig SSD

54:29.200 --> 54:33.520
however when I tried to configure one out of out of just curiosity I couldn't

54:33.520 --> 54:36.920
get it above 8 gigs so I don't know if maybe it was just Dell's horrible

54:36.920 --> 54:45.120
horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible bad website or if you really

54:45.120 --> 54:49.980
can't get it in more than 8 gigs but it does seem to be encouraging that Dell is

54:49.980 --> 54:53.280
continuing to update it now the commenters on Hacker News say it's not

54:53.280 --> 54:59.480
all roses the battery lasts for 13 hours under Linux which I guess is less than

54:59.480 --> 55:02.840
expected seems alright he said that I'm like good

55:02.840 --> 55:09.040
god man that sounds great the headphone port is very noisy with Linux and not

55:09.040 --> 55:13.120
noisy with Windows I have I have personally experienced that a lot with

55:13.120 --> 55:18.880
different machines Wi-Fi Wi-Fi that's the that's Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi performance

55:18.880 --> 55:22.680
is I guess horrible under Linux and supposedly fine under Windows just in

55:22.680 --> 55:26.960
you know I don't know that I that feel this I don't know the HDMI port I guess

55:26.960 --> 55:31.520
does not work under Linux correctly so there could be a couple of things that

55:31.520 --> 55:36.040
maybe are not perfect yet maybe if you ran arch you wouldn't have that that's a

55:36.040 --> 55:39.720
good question as well there's not a lot of details there but I think this is a

55:39.720 --> 55:42.880
good sign I think this is a good sign from Dell that they're continuing to

55:42.880 --> 55:47.640
build this thing and I look at a lot of the options out there and I still think

55:47.640 --> 55:52.600
the XPS is a very competitive offering I love mine I love mine and my drive

55:52.600 --> 55:56.480
just died last week I was I was reviewing fedora 25 that my hard drive

55:56.480 --> 56:00.320
died so that's like the Mac right you can't service it at all no I can pop the

56:00.320 --> 56:02.880
bottom off and I can replace it it's just kind of a bummer that I've got

56:02.880 --> 56:08.680
terrible I have lost yet another you burn through those things Brandon you

56:08.680 --> 56:15.120
just ordered next ps13 yeah I did well congratulations the mr. new owner do you

56:15.120 --> 56:18.980
have it yet no not yet oh well I would love placing my

56:18.980 --> 56:28.160
MacBook Pro oh dang what was running on the MacBook Pro Mac OS this is a big

56:28.160 --> 56:31.200
this is Brandon this seems like a big deal to me am I am I right this seems

56:31.200 --> 56:40.480
like a big deal well I switched to Mac OS and from Linux in 2008 so yeah this

56:40.480 --> 56:44.240
is a big deal for me well I'm gonna be really curious to hear how it goes will

56:44.240 --> 56:49.080
you come back and let us know and give us an update on on the transition yeah

56:49.080 --> 56:53.320
interesting okay so wimpy you have the 15 and the 13

56:53.320 --> 56:57.800
XPS models what are your thoughts about this continued revisioning even though

56:57.800 --> 57:02.860
it's not a very exciting one from Dell well it's good because you know the new

57:02.860 --> 57:07.240
new line of processors have just come out and they've immediately revved those

57:07.240 --> 57:11.860
two models with the latest stuff so that's really good to see because they

57:11.860 --> 57:17.320
are I mean I don't know this but it outwardly it looks like Dell are trying

57:17.320 --> 57:22.480
to compete with Mac in terms of developer mindshare and high-end

57:22.480 --> 57:26.360
machines for developers yeah high-resolution screen seventh

57:26.360 --> 57:31.800
generation Intel processors yeah and on the XPS 15 dedicated graphics as well

57:31.800 --> 57:37.320
and yeah you know HDMI ports and multiple USB ports is that 15 is that a

57:37.320 --> 57:42.240
Linux pre-loaded machine or is that something you put Linux on I put Linux

57:42.240 --> 57:50.840
on the 15 the XPS 13 came pre-loaded yeah yep my my lady friend just loves

57:50.840 --> 57:56.200
the XPS 13 she for her it's gorgeous it is that that that edge-to-edge display

57:56.200 --> 57:59.840
beautiful it's sitting in the lab she's doing NaNoWriMo it's got a decent

57:59.840 --> 58:02.980
keyboard on it she can do a lot of typing for her it's like a great machine

58:02.980 --> 58:06.760
so it was a real bummer when the hard drive died makes me it makes me want to

58:06.760 --> 58:12.360
just I mean I I I've now lost a hard drive in my Apollo I've lost the hard

58:12.360 --> 58:15.320
drive in the Librem and now I've lost the drive in the explicit what what the

58:15.320 --> 58:19.640
only thing I do that's the only thing I actually whether when I when I replace

58:19.640 --> 58:23.820
them I replace them with Samsung's off of Newegg so that's kind of a common

58:23.820 --> 58:28.000
theme but they're all you know whatever the OEM ships them with the only thing

58:28.000 --> 58:33.000
I do a lot is I reload distros on them constantly that's the only thing I'm

58:33.000 --> 58:37.120
doing that's unusual I don't I don't notice that I mean I'm I'm loading

58:37.120 --> 58:42.720
distros on my machines like every day I wouldn't think it would cause any action

58:42.720 --> 58:47.760
no no the right endurance on modern SSDs now is is pretty significant you're not

58:47.760 --> 58:52.040
gonna be those concerns about or am I gonna you know burn through the right

58:52.040 --> 58:56.560
cycles on the SSD is pretty much a thing of the past now I should get a hold of

58:56.560 --> 59:00.000
Dell and tell them to send me one of these new ones for testing yeah because

59:00.000 --> 59:02.760
I've got my mind's like two years mine's like two models behind it's like three

59:02.760 --> 59:06.680
years old two miles behind but it looks the same as the current model right it

59:06.680 --> 59:11.320
does it's gorgeous that screen is gorgeous that by the build is perfect I

59:11.320 --> 59:15.560
really like the overall feel of it in the hand it's a great little machine

59:15.560 --> 59:19.480
laptop to be proud of it's just a little underpowered and so I don't use it for

59:19.480 --> 59:22.760
anything serious other than when we're watching TV and we want to browse the

59:22.760 --> 59:26.680
web together that's what and it's got a touchscreen so when you're sharing when

59:26.680 --> 59:30.240
you're sharing a computer you know she can she can touch the link and move the

59:30.240 --> 59:33.480
screen and I can move it so it's it's a really nice like shared experience

59:33.480 --> 59:36.840
computer yeah and it sits right there and the battery lasts forever that's all

59:36.840 --> 59:42.680
really nice but because it's a it's a two core slow yeah I don't use it for

59:42.680 --> 59:47.280
you don't use it for any production work yeah I see not anymore but I do use it

59:47.280 --> 59:52.000
for testing high DPI and it's great for that that's green yeah I love testing I

59:52.000 --> 59:55.680
love testing high DPI next it looks good and so recently I've been testing high

59:55.680 --> 01:00:02.720
DPI on the MacBook retina 2013 and the which is a 15 inch screen and on the XPS

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:07.880
13 which is a 13 inch screen and it's you really I didn't realize this and it

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.960
seems obvious I mean it's gonna sound stupid when I say this out loud but I

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.800
didn't realize that high DPI made such a difference on different sized screens I

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:19.440
know that sounds so stupid to say out loud but I just thought like high DPI

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.000
was high DPI but there is a significant difference to look at a desktop

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.920
environment on a 15 inch high DPI screen versus a 13 inch high DPI screen

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.360
yeah well you can see that like right you know your phone may have a very high

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.640
DPI screen but to see that on the 15 inch screen yeah something else yeah it

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.960
was it seems stupid to say it out loud but when I actually started testing this

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.240
is this is something to happen a while ago when I started testing the different

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.200
distros on different screens and just getting blown away by how gorgeous some

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.920
of these things can look so yeah so let's talk about something that sort of

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.680
blows my mind away and that's net data so net data is getting support for

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.120
backend so let's back up what is net data and why do I want a backend on it

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.840
net data is a very handy utility written by the same person who has written the

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.400
firehole IP tables manager that we've covered a little bit before yeah I use

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.600
personally and to great effect and so you know in his operational life

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:12.440
managing service etc he really wanted a something that he could just look at to

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.080
give him the real-time performance information quickly assess you know

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.240
what's the state of the server you know not like a huge history but look you

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:22.160
know see like absolutely what is it doing right now yeah snapshots type

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.400
type stuff what's going on yeah so so net data implements that it's a you know

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.920
just a tiny little binary that you run they've done I think pretty good work

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.600
continually making it so the overhead on the host is less and less you know I

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:36.480
think we've talked about it a little bit on last before too it's a really neat

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.280
tool yeah and it's nice because you just you just throw it right on the server

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.120
yeah and then and then it pops up a nice web interface that you go to it all you

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.360
know it uses the dynamically updates you kind of have live real-time information

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.720
right there in the browser graphs and all of that yeah yep yep and so like in a

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.680
larger picture it's it's useful it's especially useful if you have a couple

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.880
machines I use it on a lot of my machines you know just start the service

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.240
and go but it becomes harder when you really want to you know do you want to

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.720
have historical information or you want to aggregate this information and so you

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.120
can look across your entire fleet and they have added some support so that

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:13.240
like one net data interface can look at other net datas which is really nice

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.560
that's huge ah so this is we start recording on a back end this is where

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:21.240
you started working on like multiple machines and historical stuff yeah so

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.240
like so that works it's kind of new but a lot of places will already have had

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.740
some sort of time series database a popular one is graphite which was open

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:33.400
sourced by orbits right and so you know and and so now net data can interface

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.280
with that they support both graphite and open tstb which are two big players in

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.240
that space and both have protocols that other players support and so this just

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.760
means that like you know either you can use net data as part of your solution if

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.760
you already have this infrastructure or it just makes it really easy to connect

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.460
and then you have the the real-time information of net data and the

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.280
historical trending and other stuff that works with like graphite which has a

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.440
huge community of tools and other stuff to work on hmm so how are you using this

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.880
because I know you started that you're starting to poke at this right yeah I

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.600
have poked at it you know right now I'm just using it for a personal use and

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.280
that's mostly because it didn't have this you know back end stuff and so for

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.480
working on the things we already have graphite infrastructure so this we need

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.600
something that would play along and in the graphite world you have collectors

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.200
that kind of sit on the host in every X intervals collect information send it to

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.520
graphite and then it stores it and gives you graphs right so net data does the

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.440
same thing but before it was kind of its own system often its own which worked

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.360
really well for small deployments really well for you just want to drop something

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.320
you don't want a lot of configuration you just want boom you have graphs it

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.240
can do some like minimal alerting stuff like hey send me an email when my disk

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:44.160
is over 90% or whatever so I think now like I'm I may not actually use it at

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.040
work but I think that for a lot of maybe smaller companies middle-sized things

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.120
people who are building a new monitoring stack it seems like a great tool no

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.920
kidding no kidding man if you were building something today this would be

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.880
such a great way to go and if you look at the the github there's like a pretty

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.960
good amount of activity people are adding plugins so that you can have it

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:10.160
monitor other things besides just that's cool that's very nice and Wes has some

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.440
additional information and links in the show notes you know we should mention

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.880
this if anything we just said went over your head at all if you're not sure

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:22.880
about anything or if you're just sort of lost maybe things feel a little weird

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.840
right now you got a little upset about that you got a little clamp like I did

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.640
Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplug go there to support the show and

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.600
send it for a free seven-day free trial this we can learn all of the basics but

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.040
also all the really cool stuff coming down the pipe the stuff that people are

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.960
making money on basing their careers on getting jobs getting contracts and now

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:46.960
with Linux Academy's public profiles you can brag about what you've done but

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.920
really can also show your employer or your client what you've achieved Linux

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.560
Academy is a platform to learn more about Linux if you're an expert or a

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:59.760
total noob they got stuff for you video courses self-paced in-depth video courses

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.960
on every freaking Linux cloud and DevOps topic labs that give you hands-on real

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:08.960
experience instructor mentoring when you need that human help learning paths which

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.240
are series of courses and content planned by instructors for specific

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.760
types of tracks you might be going down or if you're just going for the certs

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.400
they got courses specifically to prepare you for exams they got a great

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.040
community I can say that cuz it's full of Jupiter broadcasting members and they

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.280
got note cards that are forked by that community that help you prep and learn

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.600
and they have nuggets when you have just a little bit of time available you can

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:31.240
just do a deep dive into a single topic and they have a core scheduler to also

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.400
work with your busy schedule servers that spin up on-demand you need them matching

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.920
the distribution you've chosen Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.920
unplugged go there and check them out and a big thank you Linux Academy for

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:51.220
sponsoring the unplugged program kind of speaking of the basics there Wes there

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:55.440
was a great article over at open source comm by David both I think it is and

01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:01.960
David wrote managing devices in Linux using the slash dev directory and how

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.600
the slash dev directory gives you access to your devices this month I cover some

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.240
fascinating aspects of the slash dev directory now I kind of say in a mocking

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:17.960
tone but this is a super useful tool when you switch from Windows and come

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:24.520
over to Linux or Unix devices as items on your file system is a mind-blowingly

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:30.920
awesome concept paradigm shift it is a total total paradigm shift so I want to

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.080
put this officially in the show notes for episode 173 for all of your friends

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.040
that you have switching over to Linux that are a little bit savvy with Windows

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:41.880
or the Mac and they don't understand how this works give them this article this

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.560
is a great article and I feel like most of time you like you know you interface

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:48.680
you like with slash dev slash SDA what a you know SDA one that kind of stuff

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.960
right but that's as far as most people go you don't get into the details these

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:55.920
days you dev like auto populate slash dev anyway so yeah you don't you know

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.520
most people don't have to deal with this or make you know use make node or

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:03.920
anything like that so I found it helpful I think a lot of new users will find it

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.680
helpful too yeah and it's it's well structured with visual guides and all of

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.880
that too so you can find that over there we'll have it linked in the show notes

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:16.400
but it was at open source comm and it's managing device limit under Linux but I

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:22.800
just I remember I remember when I wrap my head around that how awesome I

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:26.960
thought that idea was and how cool it was the way the kernel does that and all

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.040
of that was it's such exemplified the difference where like Windows you know

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.200
you would anything you'd learned you felt like you would just kind of scrape

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.880
together hack-and-claw to just try to pry this information from this black box

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.680
and there's Linux is just like but you're like boom here's everything that I

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:46.200
know about so I got a lot of crap this I mean it's only Tuesday and I have I

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.040
have I have taken a beating on this particular topic already so yesterday

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:56.920
no two days ago we reviewed Fedora 25 on the Linux action show and in Fedora 25 I

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:02.280
talked about my upgrade from Fedora 24 different toward 25 and I just want to

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.040
play a little bit of that moment from the show right don't wait for it right

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.960
here just jumped ahead let's see what it says

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:17.240
error running transaction on libmpeg123.so from install the mpeg123 conflicting

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:23.800
files oh we have file mpeg123 libs conflicts with libmpeg123 wait does that

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:30.280
mean my entire installation is done uninstall and move on so am I stuck on

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.440
Fedora 24 now the struggle is real and I'm pushing on using the terminal I'm

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.480
gonna do a DNF system upgrade I'm doing dash dash release version 25 and then

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:47.360
tack tack allow erasing that should do what I'm hoping is uninstall stuff

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.120
that's blocking and just move on let's so I want to take a minute and talk

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.880
about upgrade versus nuke and pave and so one of the big pieces of feedback I

01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.440
got is Chris you damn moron why the hell are you using United RPMs garbage that's

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.720
trash you should be using RPM fusion apparently the Fedora community feels

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.480
extremely strong about this so I just wanted to make it clear that the reason

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:14.180
why I was using United RPMs is because we had covered United RPMs as an

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:19.040
announcement in the show and they promised that I would use it to follow

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.520
up on how it went so that's why I was using United RPMs so I got a lot of crap

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:27.160
for that you're espousing or trying to tell the audience what to use but really

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.240
the whole concept of well that's a third-party repo they got all crazy

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.880
kinds of applications you don't know what their standards are how could you

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.520
possibly expect your core distro to upgrade successfully that's that's the

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:43.360
core sort of sentiment that I was receiving I don't know really know where

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.480
to come down on this I used to be a nuke and paver like nobody's business yep all

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:51.200
the time sick every six months a nuke and pave nuke and pave runs better cleaner

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.840
etc etc get to I like resetting things up I enjoyed the process now in the last

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:01.720
year or so I've transitioned to I never want to reinstall kind of guy and I the

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.040
last thing I want to do is set up a new computer I just like it working out of

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.480
the box where do you fall now with a nuke and pave thing and do you think

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:13.220
that I maybe I is this something that distribution should work on this upgrade

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.280
path or is this something that users should let go of and just nuke and pay

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.280
you know it it strikes me that it people seem to fall into and very strongly into

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.120
both camps and I think it depends a lot on how you view your distribution what

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.000
you get out of it so if it is just a tool you know if it is more you view it

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.880
more like a Windows style operating system where you've installed that you

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:36.920
just expect it to work you're not necessarily tweaking it a lot or you

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.400
have made those tweaks but you really don't want to do it again you didn't

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.200
spend if you didn't spend the time necessarily documenting as you set up

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.280
you just you know installing Linux these days is supposed to be easy you it is

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.800
easy you install it it just works so in that regard I think it you know

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:52.520
especially when you feel like that or it's an appliance that you just want to

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.640
be able to upgrade it right like you expect you it performs very well it's

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.240
very stable you expect that same stability in the upgrade process

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:04.880
personally I do like the nuke and pave model I don't have to do that much arch

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.240
is nice in that you know I only really do it when I change machines or if I'm

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.140
doing upgrades or other things but I do think the nuke and pave model helps you

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:17.240
track your personal dependencies helps you understand what things you do need

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.880
what makes a complete system for you that may not be a journey that every

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.400
person wants or needs to go on you know and if you're not changing machines very

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.360
often you're not changing setups or you're you're comfortable with you know

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.480
it depends you like some people if you're not installing a bunch of weird

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.020
packages if you're not making dramatic reconfigurations to your system then you

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:35.920
may not need to nuke and pave or you may not feel the that you want to nuke and

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.520
pave right but yeah sometimes like right now you know I'm downloading in the

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.360
background and I'm upgrading to the plasma desktop I'm like yeah maybe this

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:45.680
would be better as a nuke and pave this might be better as a nuke and pave but and if I

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.480
if I decide I want to switch to the plasma desktop for a little extended

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.280
period of time I probably would nuke and pave and something that I I think the

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.400
nuke and pave does help or can help maybe can help is that it can teach you

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.180
know like make sure that your data is not local to your system yeah you know

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:02.440
that was that was why I was such a big fan of it even like a year ago I was

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:06.360
like I'm a nuke and pave every time because if because to me there was a

01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.360
period of time for a long time West like it for you for years where like I could

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.600
format a computer on a time like if somebody like I got no problem like I

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.440
know I knew I knew persistently everything was synced it was all backed

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.760
up no problem I'll pave it right now and even you know and maybe you use

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.080
something like ansible or something else or you have like well I didn't have a

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.760
bash script that installs all your favorite packages you can that means

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:33.880
that you can go from nothing to yeah you're running just like you were in

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.240
minutes yeah yeah exactly but that's not for everyone and not everyone needs that

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.720
yeah go ahead on our GPU if you nuke and pave when you use the plasma thing if

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.640
you install the plasma desktop you could nuke and pave and install the

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.920
intergos build setup for plasma whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.480
whoa how come you didn't tell me that what a few minutes ago when I was

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.640
installing the plasma desktop what now what can I do what can I do you can

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.680
install the intergos build setup for plasma where you get all the all the

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.600
modifications well what do I do what how do I do that

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.360
intergos dash KDE dash setup are you serious okay I'm gonna try this right

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:15.160
now because I have all my packages so I do a kid integrals what okay give me the

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.440
give me this give me that give me give me the knowledge here rod is a kid

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:22.720
integrals dash KD dash setup yeah all one package name all right I'm doing it

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:28.600
right now let's do it live on the air let's do it let's do it so we'll do okay

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:34.080
yeah like your color terminal thank you look at all this stuff so what is all of

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:37.280
this rotten what is all I'm sorry mr. to know what is all this and it's all the

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:45.200
modifications for all the stuff that you do k3b if you install the key if you

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:50.160
choose KDE and the install for the in century it gives you this this looks

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.360
like a bunch of stuff I would have wanted installed this looks like stuff

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.920
why I installed plasma dash meta right like for example how is KDE base dash

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.120
lib not installed how is Kate that how is Kate not installed like what the hell

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.800
did I install plasma dash plasma dash metaphor if this crap isn't installed

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:12.160
will you ask for the dependencies of everything that's plasma console not

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.360
everything that's KDE console was not installed by the plasma dash meta

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:22.840
package console right yeah that's unbelievable it's it's understandable

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:26.600
because that's what it's for it's a DE you want the entire KD stack that's a

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.880
totally different thing so what should I if I wanted to use console and Kate what

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.160
should I have installed because I thought installing plasma meta would

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.960
sort of cover me there's not really there's there's not arch doesn't have a

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.840
solution for that ah install it like it is big list of installation stuff that's

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:46.640
that's some horseshit I got to be honest with you that's that's really

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.440
disappointing because that makes it seem like the only way I so that so that's

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:52.760
sort of the way to do it that's sort of the way to do it isn't it is install

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.840
that anagros stuff I mean if people want literally everything and they want it

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.480
come modified by the well not literally everything that's that's exaggeration

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:06.040
you want a lot of the vast majority of the KD stack and you want the

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.440
modifications that integrus does with the theming and stuff like that then

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.200
yeah you could use the integrus package content and it is kind of the integrus

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.560
value add on top of arch right like they're picking your defaults you don't

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.560
need to go find all the KDE package right I might want right so it looks

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.760
like it's up and oh it's already it already feels fast I've got it and I've

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:29.200
got it up installed right now it it it feels oh geez oh geez the multi monitor

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.080
setup it's no good West it's no good didn't pick the right default for you

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.760
no it did not but this is exciting so I'm gonna play with this a little bit I

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.840
have a feeling this might develop into a show I could have a show I've now lost

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:47.120
all of my notes yep yep I've lost everything but I do have the plasma

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.720
desktop and what's funny seeing that in the on the video version there you can

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.280
see the windows that I can't see I don't have those on my desktop so those are on

01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:00.560
the monitor across the room from me and I can't I can't you guys can see windows

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:03.720
on the video version of the show right now that I can't see how funny is that

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.280
how can I move okay now I'm gonna try I'm moving it yeah uh-huh where is it oh

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:15.040
haha it's back I got it snake you know this is this is pretty nice this is

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.320
feeling pretty slick you know like not like in terms of like how it's handling

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.560
my dual monitors but it's feeling slick in terms of like how smooth everything's

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.800
moving across the screen which is which is kind of done arch and plasma before

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:33.320
oh yeah oh it's been a while right and every single time I do it I spend the

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.640
first three days thinking about how much I love Kaywin that's really like every

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:42.440
time every single time and then it's great it is really good but then then I

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.160
miss know after a little after a little while okay I'm gonna try unifying

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.520
outputs I'm hitting apply and let's see survey says hey look at that beautiful

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.920
now I have dual monitor setup and so now I've got mirrored monitor setup under

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:58.720
Katie I'm pretty much good to go the world just changed and look I've got

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.240
quake still which nice yeah so I'm pretty much I'm pretty much set I think

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.240
you'll totally switch to your quake eventually yeah or or you yeah you wake

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:12.520
yeah well let's see so here's the question will I well while I have it

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.880
installed right now and I suspect I'll have it installed for the next few days

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.400
will I have it installed by Sunday's Linux action show and will I still have

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.440
it installed by episode 174 that's the big question we will see if you if you

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:32.480
experience all the greatness that is Katie yes thank you mr. to know wow

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:36.360
that's an endorsement right there and now let's see let's get it working on

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.640
Wayland let's just go all in West what do you say yeah let's do it

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.520
Linux actually showed our vetted calm if you want to go all in some of this

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.360
topics show ideas leave us feedback go to Jupiter broadcasting calm slash

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.320
contact if you'd like to leave us some notes also check out my new video series

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:54.140
the ones that just published as we're recording today are yeah all about the

01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:57.800
meat BSD I've left like two weeks ago remember when I was gone that was

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.160
horrible I mean it was nice to see Noah but that missed you Chris I guess you

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.360
youtube.com slash Chris Fisher if you want to see those thanks for joining us

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:11.360
and I hope to see you back here next Tuesday

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:55.840
oh I'm already setting up a K wallet which is the most obnoxious thing ever

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.240
as soon as I have one of Google Chrome and Google Chrome doesn't look right

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.440
that doesn't look good it's got it doesn't it doesn't look like if it

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:05.560
doesn't look like it belongs on the frickin plasma desktop look at that look

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:09.160
how crappy that wasn't really look like it belongs and oh wow even worse though

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.080
yeah boy sure feels good though look at that look how good that moves that does

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.720
feel that that's like that's like KY jelly on your screen right there that's

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:23.640
nice I like that oh oh does it have that option to use like yeah yeah let's go

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:26.280
there let's do that I think if you right-click on the top maybe or

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:33.160
somewhere JB titles calm JB titles calm now we go boat now where do I go to do

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.360
that settings instinctually go to bank suggest calm but it's still that hover

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:43.040
landing page and it makes me sad oh use system titles that seems like oh okay

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.200
that's that's better that's better it doesn't look like it belongs but that's

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:55.200
better there's the if you get the GTK breezed theme it'll blend perfectly

01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:00.440
mm-hmm okay GTK breeze thing mr. tunnel is also there's also breeze dart for GTK

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:06.840
as well I'm gonna go down the deep end will you if you have any like it tips

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.320
for me and you want to drop them in the slack that'd be good because I kind of

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.000
think I might want to do a lass on this and I'd like to give people tips for I'm

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.200
kind of thinking I'm trying it too the first tip is to explore the wonders of

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:23.360
window rules window rules yeah this is what makes K when the best people talk

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.880
about how with you know gnome like you it'll remember where you where you have

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:33.440
your window and bigger area and the size and stuff like that it doesn't remember

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:41.480
workspaces unless you you know install that extension port but there's window

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:47.760
rules allows you to have a whole load more control hmm that does kind of sound

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.400
appealing so like I can set every time so I could say every time mpv opens up

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:57.160
do this or what is it what it was it that it does for me

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:06.240
I think he's I think he laughed it looked like he was he's uh he's red and

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.240
mumble is he talking oh sorry dude oh sorry rotten there was a there was a

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.920
rogue muting of the soundboard go ahead sorry but your answer got cut off no

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.480
problem so basically what it does is you take

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:24.880
mpv and it would say load mpv on this with size this position this when

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:30.280
workspace this monitor whether it has window decorations or not whatever what

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.280
gravity level you want of whether it has it's above all applications or only in

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:42.880
a particular priority whether it has a specific shortcut associated to it let's

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.520
see you can I can be great for playing clips on a filter I remember Dolph there

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.240
was a problem like Dolph there's something wrong with Dolphin versus not

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.160
a lot I can't remember but we thought with playing clips you also choose

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.440
opacity of the window I've done like a little bit of that stuff with like when

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:02.240
I was using awesome a lot but that sounds very nice to have in is that

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:07.440
with with plasma with K when you set the window this like how you want it like

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.000
the size the location the monitor blah blah and then you just go into you just

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.320
start you activate the window rolls on that window and you go in and check the

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:20.920
boxes like okay remember this and we're done nice that's cool all right so I'm

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.520
gonna play with that that's a good one West you see any titles that are like a

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:32.400
super awesome latest Linux updates is kind of has a nice ring to it state of

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:38.920
the snaps it's a snap to run Linux the latest Linux updates it's not bad it's

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:47.920
not great though well Chris get plasma burns oh shoot it's not bad oh great I

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:52.200
don't want you to get plasma burns oh man we got to do a user error cuz Rekai

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:57.800
tried out this plasma desktop on his new machine oh really oh I wish I had more

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.820
time to do user error because that would be a great you know the people crave it

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.040
you know what I mean it's just it's busy these days West it's busy these days

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:11.120
with the holidays and the the double recordings and yeah there's actually

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:19.080
something that KDE does that even gnome can't do GTK like specifically a GTK

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:26.800
thing okay so if you and if you have a program that has weird like let's say for

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.120
example you want to do dark thing like a global dark thing like I like you know

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:36.680
you're gonna do probably yeah yeah there's there are some side effects and

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:40.120
some applications that where you have like some things that are dark that

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:44.760
shouldn't be and the biggest one of the most obvious examples is a Firefox and

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:49.000
Thunderbird do it mmm yeah no is rare that I don't use I don't use Firefox or

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.440
Thunderbird anymore but no it has run into that well I I've figured out the

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.320
best option I'm actually going to make like a tutorial about it but there is a

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:04.800
an environmental variable that allows you to invoke the system T said it's the

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.280
text boxes and that's the biggest problem with that they're all forms

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.760
basically you and you invoke this environment environmental variable for

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:16.080
GTK and you can tell it to load a different theme than your degree global

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:22.320
settings just for that one application hmm so you can fix it by making it

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:28.440
ignore the the globalization of it hmm so do you set that in the in the desktop

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:34.720
file then yeah you do yeah okay so let's see I'm gonna go to audio volume

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:39.600
settings the reason it's it's what the reason I brought it up is because that

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:46.560
if GTK 2 has that environmental variables function and also GTK 3 but

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:52.240
when gnome introduced GTK 3 support for it they broke GTK 2 support so KD is

01:24:52.240 --> 01:25:00.280
the only one that actually still has both hey let's see if audio works you
