WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Are you listening?

00:02.400 --> 00:06.740
Introducing sound beaming you hear the audio others don't without headphones

00:07.320 --> 00:15.320
When you are inside of the bubble you get the sound the volume the immersiveness of it and where you outside of it

00:15.960 --> 00:20.240
You can you cannot get it. Sometimes you can hear a little bit of noise

00:20.480 --> 00:23.880
Sometimes you you hear there's something going on beside you

00:23.880 --> 00:30.080
But you don't get the volume and don't get the immersiveness of the sound experience. You don't need

00:30.960 --> 00:37.580
To tell the device where you are. It's not streaming to like one exact place. It it follows you wherever you go

00:37.980 --> 00:42.420
So it's personally for you follows you place what you want

00:43.080 --> 00:45.080
inside your head

00:46.040 --> 00:51.140
It's sound beaming West and it's just as cool as it possibly could be

00:51.140 --> 00:56.780
It's a futuristic audio technologies from Novito systems and on Friday

00:57.340 --> 01:02.100
They'll debut a full-fledged desktop device. It sits right there on your desk and

01:02.580 --> 01:07.300
Beam sound into your head noodle from wherever you are without headphones

01:07.300 --> 01:07.780
Yeah

01:07.780 --> 01:12.780
It uses a 3d sensing module and locates and tracks your ear position sending audio via

01:13.020 --> 01:15.860
Ultrasonic waves to create sound pockets right by your ears

01:15.860 --> 01:23.340
What's interesting is you can make me heard in stereo or a spatial 3d mode that creates 360 degree sound around the listener

01:23.340 --> 01:29.340
So it's like headphones with surround sound. I think this is something you're gonna have to hear to believe but it it is so Star Trek

01:29.340 --> 01:32.200
It's awesome. You should try listening to Linux some plugs

01:40.520 --> 01:42.520
Hello friends and welcome in to episode

01:42.520 --> 01:47.920
380 of your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

01:47.920 --> 01:54.520
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills hundreds of courses

01:55.000 --> 01:58.620
Thousands of hands-on labs get certified get higher get learning at a cloud guru

01:59.200 --> 02:01.960
Dot-com episode 380 is up

02:01.960 --> 02:07.280
It's fresh and it's another Sunday edition of the show where West and I for the last time for at least

02:07.280 --> 02:13.160
For the foreseeable future are recording ahead and we have kind of a special show for you today

02:13.160 --> 02:17.600
This is one of those episodes where we attended some events and took notes

02:17.720 --> 02:23.320
So you don't have to and we'll come back with a fresh report on some Linux events from over the weekend

02:23.480 --> 02:30.160
We're gonna tell you what's going on with a Mac story and how it impacts Linux users and why it makes Linux the best

02:30.160 --> 02:35.800
OS ever of course and then right here. I've been working on it. Oh gosh, it's big

02:35.800 --> 02:38.400
It's really it's a huge machine, but beautiful

02:38.400 --> 02:45.840
I had to wait until the honeymoon period was over so I could give you the full honest review of the Dell Precision

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
5750 mobile

02:49.240 --> 02:50.240
workstation

02:50.240 --> 02:54.280
People say this kind of stuff all the time, but this is legitimately a Macbook killer

02:54.280 --> 03:01.320
this is Dell going right after the Macbook with chamfered edges and everything and I'll tell you how it stacks up and

03:01.320 --> 03:06.440
What you need to know about it and how much it costs for a configuration like this and while you're distracted

03:06.440 --> 03:09.360
I'm gonna sneak it into my bag. I don't blame you one bit

03:09.840 --> 03:13.240
But before we get into the community news the pics that we have and all of that

03:13.240 --> 03:19.100
I want to say time appropriate greetings to our mumble room. Hello virtual lug. Hello. Hello

03:21.520 --> 03:25.480
We got 14 folks in there today because it's a Sunday and they had a huge

03:25.560 --> 03:30.560
Love blog going earlier today with some jellyfin developers in there and we'll tell you more about that in a little bit

03:30.560 --> 03:34.720
This is like the this is the post show to the love plug this week. Really it is

03:34.720 --> 03:35.200
Yeah

03:35.200 --> 03:40.660
So this weekend and late last week two pretty significant

03:41.000 --> 03:45.680
Linux community events were going on the Linux application summit and

03:46.480 --> 03:49.960
Seagull did you get a chance to go to Seagull much? Yeah, just a little bit

03:49.960 --> 03:53.560
I'll probably check out more talks after the fact. There was just too much going on

03:53.600 --> 03:59.900
Yeah, and Seagull had like a three track thing going on too. So I kind of had to pick and choose constantly

03:59.900 --> 04:02.920
Yeah, a lot of good talks. Yeah, it was nice to see it

04:02.920 --> 04:05.600
You know, they've this has been a which we'll talk more about in a little bit

04:05.600 --> 04:07.600
but this has been a real thing this year is

04:07.680 --> 04:09.680
how the heck to move all these

04:10.520 --> 04:12.520
events virtual and

04:13.080 --> 04:19.280
Various degrees of success for different ones and the Linux application summit has been building and building now for a few years

04:19.280 --> 04:26.480
So this is when we were watching with interest took place November 12th through the 14th 2020 and there's lots of talks

04:26.480 --> 04:28.520
We'll link you to as much as we can

04:28.520 --> 04:34.840
For Onyx also has a rundown but to give you a kind of a taste a sense of the flavor

04:35.120 --> 04:42.880
This is Alexi poll who we have had on the show before. It's the keys the KDEV president and he was he was talking about Wayland

04:43.120 --> 04:47.800
but he's talking about it from not an end-users perspective, but he's talking about it from a

04:48.360 --> 04:55.280
Developers perspective how developers can target their applications and write applications for Linux that use Wayland

04:55.280 --> 05:01.960
Everyone please give a warm virtual round of applause for Alish who will be talking to us about Wayland for app developers

05:02.160 --> 05:09.880
There's no applause. So insert applause here. Okay, thank thanks everyone for the virtual round of applause. It was virtually great

05:10.920 --> 05:14.120
All right. So for the talk today, I thought that

05:15.800 --> 05:17.800
Instead of talking about

05:17.960 --> 05:23.280
Things that are happening, which is what I generally talked about because I am a developer. I thought

05:23.280 --> 05:25.280
well

05:25.720 --> 05:30.260
What will developers care about when they start developing their applications?

05:30.260 --> 05:33.320
And he goes through a lot of the different history and things to consider there

05:33.320 --> 05:36.940
But I think I'm gonna jump right to my favorite talk if you'll allow please do permit

05:37.460 --> 05:43.160
My favorite talk like a lot of these talks did unfortunately, but it's how these virtual events go right now

05:43.240 --> 05:45.640
My favorite talk does start with a bit of an awkward

05:46.400 --> 05:50.180
Introduction. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening and namaste everyone

05:50.180 --> 05:57.780
My name is Dakshit Vaishnavi Dogra and now I invite mr. Greg Hartman who goes by at GregKH on Twitter

05:57.780 --> 06:02.140
I'm definitely sure that is that there is no need for an introduction

06:02.220 --> 06:07.900
So ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for mr. Greg Hartman. All the best

06:10.620 --> 06:12.620
Okay, is that working now I

06:13.700 --> 06:15.700
Hope so

06:15.700 --> 06:20.500
I'm doing great. I have construction happening right below me

06:20.500 --> 06:25.180
So we might hear some drilling in the background, but hey, this is the joy of working from home in the situation

06:25.700 --> 06:31.820
These virtual conferences. They're always a bit, you know, like a zoom meeting and there's no way around that

06:31.820 --> 06:36.060
In some sense you feel a little closer and in other senses, it's a little harder to watch

06:36.140 --> 06:40.900
Yeah, it is. So Greg gives his own introduction, which is probably a little bit better than my introduction

06:40.900 --> 06:46.020
I like to introduce him as the commander Riker of Linux. A little bit about me since they didn't introduce me

06:46.180 --> 06:52.120
I've been a kernel developer for way too long. I used to be a embedded developer before that. I maintain stable kernels

06:52.120 --> 06:54.120
I have done a lot of user space work

06:54.700 --> 06:58.520
But at the low level I also maintain some user space packages

06:59.180 --> 07:01.820
I will make fun of gnome later

07:01.820 --> 07:06.240
But let me tell you I have been an advisory board for them for many years and I'm still a foundation member

07:06.240 --> 07:11.920
And I've worked on lots and lots of different districts. We'll get to that gnome stuff in a little bit because I actually thought it

07:11.920 --> 07:16.720
Was pretty poignant but he wanted to bring lessons that they've learned as a kernel team

07:17.160 --> 07:23.560
To the app summit audience, which is all made up of a lot of developers what you do and how you act on

07:24.400 --> 07:30.620
Creating code depends on who you are and I'll break everything down into about three different groups here. I'm kernel developers

07:30.620 --> 07:37.840
um, this audience is not kernel developers, but since I am one I'll talk about what we've learned and how we've made mistakes and what

07:37.840 --> 07:41.480
We've learned from that and how to apply it again to library developers and application developers

07:41.480 --> 07:45.920
Which is the primary audience here now the full talk has some really good insights

07:46.120 --> 07:49.020
But I think you probably agree with me West because I know you watch this one, too

07:49.160 --> 07:54.440
There was one thing he really wanted to drive home with this talk and that is never ever

07:54.440 --> 08:01.880
Ever break user space whenever possible. It's the kernels number one rule. You've probably heard it before he lays it out a little bit here

08:01.920 --> 08:04.880
So first off kernel developers is easy thing

08:05.240 --> 08:10.820
We only have really one rule and Linus gets mad at this whenever you see rants in the press or whatnot

08:10.820 --> 08:15.960
this is when we do not we break this rule and the rule is we cannot break user space and

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
Cannot break user space on purpose

08:19.040 --> 08:24.160
Um break it accidentally. We'll fix it. Whatever. We break user space if nobody notices

08:24.160 --> 08:29.240
That's fine because we're we take advantage of things that when you don't notice different functionalities or stuff

08:29.280 --> 08:34.640
But you just can't break user space. It's such a developer thing to say we break it when no one notices

08:38.520 --> 08:44.960
So he he's mentioned this before you've heard probably Linus say this or read it if if you've been around for a little while

08:45.000 --> 08:47.040
You know, this is a big rule of theirs

08:47.040 --> 08:54.280
but I bet you may not know why they're why they believe it so strongly and I'll tell you what it wasn't exactly what I

08:54.280 --> 08:59.240
Was expecting and Greg explains and we make this rule and other operating systems have this rules

08:59.240 --> 09:03.560
Well, it's a very solid rule because we always want you to operate

09:04.120 --> 09:06.160
And we want you to upgrade without worrying about it

09:06.160 --> 09:11.880
We don't want you to feel scared if we got a new you see in the release and we say hey this fixes a bunch of

09:11.880 --> 09:16.480
Problems, we don't want you to feel worried about taking that and that's really really important

09:16.480 --> 09:23.400
Especially with security you want people to take all these fixes you want people to be able to upgrade you want them to also take

09:23.400 --> 09:28.760
advantage of the new features and if you have them even hesitate about updating to your latest version

09:29.280 --> 09:34.980
Because they you've broken functionality for them. They won't and that's not okay. So that's why

09:35.560 --> 09:40.360
Because he want they the kernel developers want you to feel confident in upgrading

09:40.360 --> 09:43.280
Yeah, I think he really hits on you know, there's a lot of trust here

09:43.280 --> 09:48.440
You're only gonna keep using something and keep getting the latest versions if it has a history of working and you feel like there's respect

09:48.440 --> 09:52.080
On the developer side for what you're trying to do and not just what's easy for the developers

09:52.080 --> 09:56.200
It's a it's a hard learned lesson for the kernel team, too

09:56.200 --> 09:56.560
I mean

09:56.560 --> 10:03.160
There's only a few Linux users out there and when you have the rapid pace of development that Linux does you really do have to be

10:03.160 --> 10:04.840
thinking about

10:04.840 --> 10:12.240
What makes it safe for the users to upgrade what prevents them from upgrading and you see this in some commercial spaces, too

10:12.240 --> 10:13.600
where

10:13.600 --> 10:18.840
There is sort of this mean that goes around that iOS users always update and iOS's

10:19.440 --> 10:23.340
Users are based or stay current place compared to Android, right?

10:23.400 --> 10:28.720
But the reality is Wes because I seem to recall that actually took quite a hit when they released

10:28.720 --> 10:32.640
I think it was iOS 7. I can't remember. It was a pretty dramatic UI change and

10:33.800 --> 10:36.120
their upgrade rate dropped

10:36.120 --> 10:42.320
Significantly dropped way off and then it's slowly slowly slowly rebuilt over time

10:43.740 --> 10:45.400
Same for me with fedora, right?

10:45.400 --> 10:51.040
I over time after after about 10 releases of having a successful upgrade

10:51.040 --> 10:56.560
I'd pretty much just upgrade immediately now. I feel pretty safe about it. Right? You've built that trust with them over the time

10:56.560 --> 10:59.300
Yeah, and so I connected with what he was saying there

10:59.300 --> 11:05.620
But that just wasn't what I expected the reason for that number one rule of never breaking user space now

11:05.620 --> 11:11.640
What can developers do when they need to make change because sometimes you're in a situation where your users don't want change

11:11.640 --> 11:14.060
But for whatever reason change has to happen

11:14.200 --> 11:15.880
Well, Greg has advice for that too

11:15.880 --> 11:20.840
But what we can do is we can evolve things over time so that nobody actually notices

11:20.920 --> 11:25.920
We can move to different ways things happen. We can do different things how stuff that

11:26.680 --> 11:31.000
Works and we can provide new ways of doing things and we provide new ways of doing things

11:31.000 --> 11:35.760
Hopefully people will migrate over time in reality. They don't they stick to the old stuff, which is fine

11:35.960 --> 11:40.800
but we can provide new ways and this is how we constantly evolve and how we constantly move forward and

11:40.840 --> 11:47.600
This is how you survive because you have to change with the world. So you have to provide new functionality a lot of people

11:47.600 --> 11:53.200
I get this complaint a lot from a number of people have been in the IT and the computer industry for a long time saying

11:53.200 --> 11:58.920
Well, how is Linux succeeding? It's an old model. The old Unix POSIX model is obsolete

11:58.920 --> 12:01.840
We shouldn't be doing this anymore. And the problem is

12:02.520 --> 12:06.880
In one way Linux supports that they support your binaries from 20 years ago from 25 years ago

12:06.920 --> 12:08.920
You can still run really old

12:09.480 --> 12:10.560
BSD

12:10.560 --> 12:15.800
Applications you rebuild them and they work or you can run your application that was built 20 years ago and it still works

12:15.880 --> 12:17.880
So people think Linux is stagnated

12:17.880 --> 12:22.080
but in reality we've created new functionalities right next to the old functionalities and

12:22.320 --> 12:26.840
That you can do different things. You can take advantage of stuff. We have eBPF which is taking over the world

12:26.840 --> 12:31.560
It's a microkernel like architecture. You can run user space programs on the kernel

12:31.560 --> 12:35.820
You can do all this fancy stuff proven that you can't lock up the kernel wonderful stuff

12:35.820 --> 12:42.600
IOU ring is fast asynchronous IO in a different way that has ever been done before and it's again sitting right next to the old

12:42.680 --> 12:45.760
POSIX model so that your old programs can work just fine

12:45.760 --> 12:49.640
But new programs can take advantage of stuff and take advantage of speed increases

12:49.720 --> 12:52.480
Of course Linux now is a real-time operating system

12:52.480 --> 12:54.960
It's been real-time operating system for a while without a tree patch

12:54.960 --> 12:59.720
Those changes are almost all merged. That's something people said could never possibly be done

12:59.720 --> 13:04.160
But yet we did it right next to the existing operating system and nobody noticed

13:04.480 --> 13:06.880
That's how you do it. You evolve and add new functionality

13:07.520 --> 13:12.840
Without breaking anything. I think when I heard this it was sort of triggering a bias in my head

13:12.840 --> 13:19.000
And that is you can't you can't have an old system an old subsystem and a new subsystem and have them coexist

13:19.760 --> 13:21.760
that just adds bloat and

13:21.760 --> 13:26.500
Bloat equals slowdown and security issues and that equals bad

13:27.020 --> 13:33.140
But that's I think a bit of a novice understanding when I when I gave it a little more consideration. I

13:33.820 --> 13:34.860
realized

13:34.860 --> 13:36.860
Well Linux is kind of

13:36.860 --> 13:39.620
Uniquely suited for this you have to get the balance, right?

13:40.140 --> 13:48.140
but the reality is you can have somebody who maintains the current IO subsystem and you can have somebody else that comes along and

13:48.380 --> 13:50.780
maintains the new IO ring subsystem and

13:50.780 --> 13:57.180
There isn't some beam counter saying well, we can't afford to invest in two subsystems at the same time

13:57.180 --> 14:00.740
This is open source development. So it can absolutely happen in parallel

14:00.860 --> 14:06.300
But additionally having two subsystems that do similar things doesn't make one of the other

14:06.620 --> 14:11.340
Slower that code path just doesn't get activated unless somebody writes for it

14:11.340 --> 14:17.140
So there's really not as long as it's maintained. There's not really like a performance hit from it, right?

14:17.140 --> 14:21.540
I mean if you ever call into that code, it's never gonna get loaded and run it just sits there

14:21.540 --> 14:25.940
And so Greg's core point with all of this was is as much as you can

14:26.660 --> 14:34.080
Keep support for existing features and slowly build in new features. If you have to make really really radical change

14:34.540 --> 14:36.760
Maybe it's time to call it something new

14:37.540 --> 14:39.540
And he brought us back

14:39.740 --> 14:46.040
To the good old genome days to really kind of help sink this in for the developers that were listening

14:46.040 --> 14:49.520
The biggest thing to do is don't take away things at work

14:49.520 --> 14:54.760
If somebody's using this feature and using this functionality keep it there. It's that simple

14:54.760 --> 15:00.680
It's being it was there you provided for somebody don't think by removing it. You're doing them a favor

15:01.160 --> 15:03.880
You might be doing yourself a favor because you think it can be done a different way

15:04.120 --> 15:10.960
But don't because it's not gonna work and the biggest example of this and the most public example this happened many many years ago

15:10.960 --> 15:15.000
2011 the big day. A number of people here know what that date was

15:15.000 --> 15:21.240
I have heard it talked to by as this date and this was the gnome 3 introduction

15:21.240 --> 15:26.680
Everybody's system instantly when the distro switched it over it looked totally and completely different

15:27.680 --> 15:34.080
That was a major major break. This was the day the gnome project realized that they had real users

15:34.480 --> 15:38.280
Based on the feedback they got they always thought they had users. They always thought they were doing the right thing

15:38.280 --> 15:41.200
They wanted to make a change. They wanted to do something different

15:41.200 --> 15:47.360
But this was the day that they really broke all their users trust because all of a sudden they impose a totally different model

15:47.640 --> 15:53.960
Onto them on to what they were currently using to do used to doing getting the workflow and it broke them

15:53.960 --> 15:58.680
It just caused a number of major major pain. It was horrible. Um

15:59.680 --> 16:05.240
Then ldn.net review of gnome 3 was actually really good. It was very comprehensive

16:05.240 --> 16:10.120
It was very comprehensive. Um, but and the comments of course were horrible

16:10.480 --> 16:17.040
But read this if you're an application developer and you are considering rewriting how you do everything in a totally different way

16:17.720 --> 16:22.600
look at this you are seeing people mad because you took something that they were using and

16:23.360 --> 16:26.440
Using to get their real work done. Their real work isn't to create a

16:27.080 --> 16:34.240
Interface or application environment their real work is to do something else and you made it harder to get them to do their real work

16:34.240 --> 16:39.720
You broke their trust and that was a long way and the known developers clawed back from that

16:39.720 --> 16:45.000
It took them many many many years to do that. I think they're there now. I know myself

16:45.000 --> 16:51.840
I switched away and came back many years. They've gotten better since 2011. They realize having a clean break doesn't work and

16:52.840 --> 16:57.880
That was not the best idea. Please don't in your application do the same thing. I see this happen a lot

16:59.040 --> 17:00.080
people

17:00.080 --> 17:05.000
Evolve applications to do something totally different different UI. That's not a good idea

17:05.040 --> 17:12.000
Please don't do that. And I I don't know if I completely agree that their reputation has recovered. I mean, I like

17:12.600 --> 17:15.600
Like Greg stopped using it for a while same here

17:15.600 --> 17:18.840
Yeah, and now I'm back on it and I'm pretty dang happy with it

17:19.280 --> 17:23.720
But I think that's also at the same time plasma has gotten gotten really really sharp

17:23.720 --> 17:28.520
He also he does cite plasma desktop as an example of getting it, right, right?

17:28.520 --> 17:33.360
And you know, I'm immediately made to think of the systems we have in the studio and that I have at home running KDE neon

17:33.360 --> 17:35.360
And it's just slow

17:35.520 --> 17:41.760
Evolutionary change and I don't worry even if I'm getting updates every single week that my desktop suddenly gonna change out from underneath

17:41.760 --> 17:43.760
yeah, I remember when I was an IT support and

17:44.360 --> 17:49.480
A new version of Windows came along and it wasn't even a significant change

17:49.480 --> 17:56.480
but it might have been like from XP to 7 or something like that and I was working with people getting them set up and I

17:56.480 --> 18:01.480
I remember the comment that somebody made to me and it just really stuck out and he said to me he said to me

18:01.480 --> 18:06.520
You know, I just don't understand why they keep moving the gas pedal on this thing and that's how he saw

18:06.520 --> 18:11.760
It's like I learned how to drive this Windows XP and now you gave me Windows 7 and they moved the gas pedal on me

18:11.760 --> 18:13.200
I think that's a common viewpoint, right?

18:13.200 --> 18:17.500
You didn't have the problems that the developers seem to think needed to get fixed or changed or you know

18:17.500 --> 18:22.600
Trying to make more revenue with and so why change it? Meanwhile, I'm often like hmm. Where can I stick the gas pedal?

18:22.600 --> 18:26.520
You know, can I put it over in this corner? I want like three of them and I want them all shiny

18:27.680 --> 18:33.960
But he underscores this point by saying, you know, look at the mate and cinnamon projects. They're still here

18:33.960 --> 18:40.800
They're still going this really underscores the size of this change of this event that gnome was as a result

18:40.800 --> 18:45.000
Everybody here knows made in cinnamon sprung up. They fill a real need

18:45.360 --> 18:50.920
These are real desktops that are with lots and lots of users because they were used to before or they're used to that common paradigm

18:50.920 --> 18:57.120
Um, that's fine. But this is an example that kind of shows that what the known developers did

18:58.000 --> 19:03.760
Was major and was really big because there's two separate projects just to fill that void

19:04.760 --> 19:07.640
That's fine. If the known developers want to do that they did

19:08.240 --> 19:13.160
That was their decision to do again. We're writing software for free. You're giving it over throwing it over the wall

19:13.160 --> 19:16.360
I would say that maybe that wasn't the best decision to do

19:16.360 --> 19:21.260
But hey, maybe you should call it a different project gone off in different way, but like software development

19:22.240 --> 19:28.920
Sometimes there is a reason to introduce real change you have to provide enough reason and enough

19:29.720 --> 19:30.640
goodness

19:30.640 --> 19:38.480
To force somebody to take the time to learn to do something else. That's very rare. It happens very rarely in an application space

19:39.280 --> 19:41.280
Sometimes in library spaces as does

19:41.280 --> 19:47.640
Um, I'll call that system D as a good example of how this they did it, right? They provide all the functionality

19:47.640 --> 19:50.800
They solved a real problem that was there that unified all these existing

19:51.000 --> 19:55.640
tools and problems in such a way that it was just so much better to use and

19:55.720 --> 20:02.560
It provided enough impetus that everybody was willing to do the do the work to modify their own stuff and move to the new model

20:02.960 --> 20:06.840
That it worked people still complain about it, but it worked everybody switched

20:06.840 --> 20:12.440
Everybody updated the new stuff the kiddies doing with a system D on how it launches better is very nice

20:12.440 --> 20:18.520
Gnome was integrated with a very from the beginning from very early. It works. Well, it solves a real problem again

20:18.520 --> 20:25.160
That was a example of how you can provide a compelling reason to move on and make the change, you know

20:25.160 --> 20:27.160
It reminds me that

20:27.720 --> 20:31.360
We have some really intelligent people that are running the kernel

20:31.720 --> 20:35.240
And that's one I think Linux is best strengths of the people closest to the core of it

20:35.240 --> 20:37.040
They know what the hell they're talking about what they're doing

20:37.040 --> 20:42.080
well, and you can see that this is really, you know, great got an understanding of being in the open-source space where you know

20:42.080 --> 20:44.520
no one's required to use Linux necessarily like you have to

20:44.760 --> 20:50.280
Work and have a value proposition to your audience to make sure that they use it and don't just fork you and do whatever else

20:50.280 --> 20:54.040
They want to do or use one of your many competitors right in a corporate environment

20:54.040 --> 20:54.960
If I'm writing some software

20:54.960 --> 20:59.280
You might just be told that you have to use it or if I need to make a change I can force you into a zoom

20:59.280 --> 21:01.720
Meeting tell you you got to fix your software by X date

21:01.720 --> 21:08.040
But in the larger world of open-source software, you can't do that. And that is when he cited system D there

21:08.720 --> 21:09.280
You know

21:09.280 --> 21:14.720
You absolutely could have your qualms with system D and many people do and they still love to talk about it

21:14.720 --> 21:18.680
but at the end of the day it was immensely successful in getting adoption and

21:19.360 --> 21:23.120
In a way that we don't normally see with a disrupter in open source

21:23.120 --> 21:27.440
And so it was kind of a rare case because usually it has to be slow progressive change

21:27.440 --> 21:32.680
And maybe it is a good example too in that I think a lot of the folks who you know didn't like system D for

21:32.680 --> 21:37.080
Them that change wasn't as well justified right there are reasons that they didn't have the same problems or that system D

21:37.080 --> 21:43.160
Didn't feel like it was necessarily solving for them. So there was less incentive to move on. So the whole talk is worth

21:43.880 --> 21:48.880
Listening to it's about 30 minutes long and you know, we got you, you know a few minutes worth of clips here

21:48.880 --> 21:50.320
So it's worth checking it out

21:50.320 --> 21:57.600
but at the end in the Q&A he was asked a question about what new technology coming to Linux at the kernel level and

21:57.920 --> 22:02.680
Around it that he's the most excited about and so I'm gonna play that for you

22:02.680 --> 22:04.800
And then we'll quiz West Payne to see if he knows what it is

22:05.360 --> 22:07.760
Any current technology you just pay steps? Yes

22:07.760 --> 22:12.360
I owe you ring you space developers who care about IO should pay attention to that

22:12.360 --> 22:20.680
I know the Postgres developers are you looking at it now database other database developers that is asynchronous. I owe no system call overhead

22:20.680 --> 22:25.560
Very very fast. I owe you can throw things into a ring and you get notified in user space when your data is there

22:26.520 --> 22:29.560
Very very good. If you care about IO, I recommend looking at that

22:30.440 --> 22:32.440
All right, West Payne

22:32.680 --> 22:35.240
For the last chicken little in the kitchen

22:36.200 --> 22:37.600
with cheese

22:37.600 --> 22:44.600
What is IO ring? Well, it's IO underscore you ring Chris and it's a mechanism per for performing

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Asynchronous IO. Oh, oh

22:47.320 --> 22:53.400
Well, that's enough. That's it. That's all you got. Hmm judges. What more did you want? Well, what makes it so special?

22:54.120 --> 22:58.440
It's new and faster and better you heard him talk about, you know less system call overhead

22:58.440 --> 23:05.040
Yeah, it's no one's really been happy with the existing asynchronous IO subsystem options in Linux and classic Unix

23:05.040 --> 23:11.280
IO is inherently synchronous. So this is a new faster method that's becoming very popular. All right, I'm gonna give it to you West Payne

23:13.840 --> 23:17.960
You are correct. Yeah, there's actually one other technologies

23:17.960 --> 23:23.520
He cited two technologies that he's very excited about IO ring was one of them. I owe you ring

23:23.520 --> 23:28.840
Ha the second one though. I'm gonna say you have to go listen to Linux action news episode

23:29.600 --> 23:31.160
163 to hear that one

23:31.160 --> 23:35.160
Oh, you know, there's also some interesting talk about a breaking change coming to system D

23:35.160 --> 23:39.360
Which I think is right on point for today's discussion. Yes, very much. So as a matter of fact

23:39.360 --> 23:44.020
So go check out linuxactionnews.com slash one six three

23:46.440 --> 23:52.700
Linode comm slash unplugged go there to get a one hundred dollar 60-day credit towards your new account

23:52.960 --> 23:59.940
Linode is the largest independent cloud for developers. They are our server provider. Not only do they offer servers

23:59.940 --> 24:05.720
They offer node balancers. They have object storage if you want some static storage up in the cloud and they've been around

24:06.520 --> 24:12.640
Three years before AWS. That's when they got their start. They're like they're in this for like the long haul was that's for sure

24:12.640 --> 24:18.440
And that gave them some very early opportunities in infrastructure and in private networking

24:18.440 --> 24:20.480
They have 11 data centers around the world

24:20.480 --> 24:25.840
They have a crazy fast network that they just recently made a blog post about that. I encourage you to go read

24:25.840 --> 24:30.400
If they're my cloud hosting provider and they host all of our new infrastructure here

24:30.400 --> 24:37.920
They have native SSD storage 40 gigabit connections at the hypervisors a really nice easy to use cloud manager to do all of this

24:37.920 --> 24:40.440
Plus they also plug in with the orchestration management tools

24:40.480 --> 24:46.760
So that's just like a slam dunk plus Linode costs 30 to 50 percent less than the major cloud providers like AWS

24:47.080 --> 24:50.680
They're independently owned like you're like you're humble podcast network right here

24:50.680 --> 24:52.600
And so that that that I really like

24:52.600 --> 24:56.160
but additionally Linode was one of the first sponsors to step up and

24:56.400 --> 25:01.560
Make us make Jupiter broadcasting going independent actually happen and possible there

25:01.560 --> 25:07.400
They were one of the OG sponsors that came in when things were brand new and I was just a few days out from going

25:07.400 --> 25:11.760
On air and I didn't have anything lined up and Linode stepped up

25:12.020 --> 25:18.000
So they they have been they have been part of the community for a long time like they're they're also backers of

25:18.000 --> 25:23.680
Linux fest Northwest they've sponsored projects like Kubuntu and they do lots of hackathons and meetups

25:23.680 --> 25:28.960
Although I don't know how much these days, but I've been going to events for years and seeing Linode there

25:28.960 --> 25:33.420
So I'd always wanted to try them out. So a couple of years ago. I had my opportunity and I've never gone back

25:34.400 --> 25:39.200
See check them out. See what they can do for you. See what you can build Linode calm

25:39.960 --> 25:44.680
Unplugged go there get that $100 60-day credit towards your new account and support the show

25:44.680 --> 25:49.120
See why they're our hosting provider and why we love them so dang much a couple of weeks ago

25:49.120 --> 25:53.460
I did a custom rig that I swear you could only do at Linode because they get it

25:53.680 --> 25:58.040
Unlike entry-level service providers that lock you down and prevent you from being able to do some of the back-end stuff

25:58.040 --> 26:02.380
Let know that you have at it. Check it out Linode calm slash unplugged big

26:02.380 --> 26:08.260
Thank you Linode for sponsoring the unplug program and thanks to everybody who listens and goes to Linode calm slash unplugged

26:08.320 --> 26:11.880
To check them out to support the show and let them know you heard about it here and get that

26:11.880 --> 26:14.560
$100 60-day credit towards your new account

26:17.400 --> 26:22.840
All right Wes this week there was a story that kind of reminds us why a lot of us choose to use Linux on our

26:22.840 --> 26:26.440
Workstation set the scene. It's a rainy Pacific Northwest morning

26:26.760 --> 26:30.000
I've lazily gotten out of bed wandered downstairs

26:30.000 --> 26:35.360
Got the laptop rebooted set up ready to get to work or at least drink some coffee and start going that way

26:35.480 --> 26:37.480
Think about getting ready for work

26:37.480 --> 26:39.480
It's a multi-step process

26:40.520 --> 26:44.720
And I notice you know, I'm using my my work Mac, okay

26:45.760 --> 26:51.200
Apps are taking a while to load. All right, I thought at first that just this must be you know Mac OS doing something

26:51.200 --> 26:58.440
Maybe it's rebuilding some caches in the background or had perhaps done some updates after I'd rebooted it, but it just kept persisting. Hmm

26:58.880 --> 27:06.360
Really and and was it just during application load time just load time the apps would launch eventually and then run just fine

27:06.360 --> 27:10.440
Yeah, I think a lot of people ran into this on November 12th when

27:11.160 --> 27:14.800
Big Sur was released. Uh-huh. Big Sur came out and

27:15.800 --> 27:17.800
hours after the initial release

27:18.120 --> 27:25.560
Somewhere in Apple's infrastructure their online certificate status protocol servers just started crawling and

27:26.480 --> 27:28.760
Part of the problem actually was that they didn't go completely offline

27:28.760 --> 27:34.860
They just got really really slow and what could be happening in your case and some of these other individual cases

27:34.860 --> 27:40.520
is that Mac OS in the background has this gatekeeper technology and it checks to see if the

27:41.040 --> 27:44.720
Developer certificate is valid of the application before it runs

27:44.720 --> 27:50.240
So say you have do you remember one of the apps like slack perhaps? Yep. So slack when they submit to the

27:51.320 --> 27:58.360
Apple app stores all of them part of that process they they they actually like become an Apple developer

27:58.360 --> 28:00.320
They pay for that they get an account for that

28:00.320 --> 28:05.960
They they submit to these different app stores and their build has to be signed with their certificate

28:06.360 --> 28:12.880
Apple signs the application and then they sign it with the developer certificate too and this all happens on the on the back end

28:13.680 --> 28:15.680
the application when it runs

28:16.200 --> 28:21.160
It generally just runs but every now and like if you haven't run it for a while or maybe it's like a fresh boot

28:21.160 --> 28:23.160
it will check to see if that

28:23.200 --> 28:29.260
Developer certificate is active if it's still valid and here's where the drama came in because yes, that means, you know

28:29.260 --> 28:35.480
I'm launching an application. I'm doing stuff on my computer and suddenly we're sending a response to some servers over controlled in Apple's cloud

28:35.800 --> 28:39.360
Checking to make sure that I can in fact launch this program. I've asked it to run

28:39.480 --> 28:44.760
this is something Apple rolled out quite a while ago in Mac OS and they've evolved it over time and

28:45.280 --> 28:49.740
ultimately the idea being that they could revoke slack certificate or anybody and

28:50.240 --> 28:56.080
That application would then fail to launch on Macs or I devices, right? Let's say, you know, I've been publishing stuff

28:56.080 --> 28:59.200
I just put out a new version of my application people are running it and I noticed that oh

28:59.200 --> 29:04.040
I've been compromised and someone put some you know malicious crypto miner in my software and now it's out there

29:04.120 --> 29:06.880
Well, I might not be able to do anything except in this case

29:06.880 --> 29:08.880
I can I can ask I can tell Apple about it and

29:09.240 --> 29:12.800
They can make sure that any new launches from there on won't work

29:12.800 --> 29:15.720
So this is why it's built in there, but it also has the flip side

29:15.720 --> 29:16.960
There's an evil side to this

29:16.960 --> 29:21.880
If you wanted to implement your own app store in your app and Apple decided they didn't want you to do that

29:21.880 --> 29:23.880
They could turn your account off

29:23.880 --> 29:30.860
Additionally it means that these Macs have to check in semi frequently with Apple servers

29:31.080 --> 29:36.000
Before they'll run an application think about that network activity has to occur

29:36.560 --> 29:38.080
Before the application runs

29:38.080 --> 29:44.920
So if you have a bad route if you've got some weird latency if you're on a my fi and it's just going a little

29:44.920 --> 29:51.000
Slow that day you could have a ten thousand dollar Mac Pro tower and it will still

29:51.000 --> 29:56.780
Wait to launch the application. Now. There is provisions in there for if it's offline, but when it's totally online

29:56.780 --> 30:03.100
It won't you know, it'll just launch but when it's actually responding guess what it it slows the entire thing down and I

30:03.580 --> 30:10.820
Really think Apple as this company that positions themselves as a privacy first company needs to be really super clear when they're doing something like this

30:10.820 --> 30:13.740
Because you kind of get a sense of a person's

30:14.620 --> 30:19.780
Basic meta metadata about the use of their machine application launch times IP address

30:19.780 --> 30:23.020
I believe it's also sent in HTTP. Is that true? Yeah

30:23.020 --> 30:29.100
That's a common thing in these scenarios and yeah looking at some wire shark logs that folks have been investigating this from it does seem

30:29.100 --> 30:30.580
Like there's some information

30:30.580 --> 30:32.580
transmitted over plain text now

30:33.020 --> 30:35.940
That seems to be just information about the particular development

30:36.140 --> 30:42.860
developers certificate and usually that certificate could sign multiple apps say in the case of Mozilla for both Firefox and Thunderbird, but

30:43.260 --> 30:45.820
That's kind of a personal choice of how do you feel about that?

30:45.820 --> 30:52.180
And as you say right there's you know, these are associated with time with your activity with perhaps your location. Yeah. Yeah, there's so there's

30:52.900 --> 30:55.820
A couple of issues here the first issue

30:55.820 --> 30:59.220
I'd say is this a system that people are comfortable with?

30:59.540 --> 31:03.140
Because it gives Apple a lot of metadata and it gives them a lot of control

31:03.140 --> 31:06.900
I I would argue if you buy a Mac you kind of already conceding to trusting Apple

31:06.900 --> 31:11.480
And so this that probably doesn't bother you as much but then you have the implementation here

31:11.480 --> 31:18.000
Even though this touches Akamai which is by the way a third party now getting in the mix part of this will touch Akamai's

31:18.120 --> 31:20.320
CDN network part of it goes directly to Apple

31:20.320 --> 31:26.080
I'd like some real clarity on what information is being collected and sent along because what has been

31:26.800 --> 31:28.800
deduced by the community is

31:29.040 --> 31:32.360
Kind of damning. It seems like a lot of information. I wouldn't want out there

31:32.360 --> 31:35.200
Well, and I think a lot of you know, but for for being proprietary

31:35.200 --> 31:37.760
I think there's still a lot of folks even in our community in the Linux users that

31:37.760 --> 31:43.440
You know Apple isn't Google. They're not just trying to sell you ads and necessarily mine all your personal data

31:43.440 --> 31:46.880
And they've tried to build a brand on that but not being clear here

31:46.880 --> 31:52.120
I think is hurting that at least among say the developer crowd and there's that whole privacy aspect of it

31:52.560 --> 31:56.660
But I I think this conversation so far as we've heard it because we're recording this on a Sunday

31:57.680 --> 32:01.040
Hasn't really included the fact that iOS behaves exactly the same way, right?

32:01.040 --> 32:04.200
I think that's this is this is the Apple ecosystem exactly how it works, right?

32:04.200 --> 32:08.080
All right, the same fundamentals and and and in their ecosystem, they're king

32:08.280 --> 32:11.100
Yes, and that may be part of the value proposition, right?

32:11.100 --> 32:16.140
Like how often do you really worry about a bunch of iOS malware? Yeah, I suppose not really ever and

32:16.840 --> 32:22.260
Most users aren't really capable of you know evaluating that do you maintain a list of trusted and untrusted software?

32:22.260 --> 32:24.560
I mean, you know Apple does and they don't get security reports

32:24.560 --> 32:27.760
They have whole teams of people that can monitor and keep these things up-to-date true

32:27.760 --> 32:31.520
I give you that and if you're just downloading some random software and running it who knows what could happen

32:31.520 --> 32:37.360
it also feels like it's potentially surveillance like it could be utilized for surveillance if you had somebody on your network who was

32:37.680 --> 32:44.520
I don't know wanted to surveil you but I think I'm just gonna slow down requests to that specific domain all the time on all my

32:44.520 --> 32:46.840
No, this is the third issue. No, really. I think this is so

32:48.600 --> 32:53.660
You you literally have a system designed and such that it could slow down the operation of a Mac

32:53.660 --> 32:58.780
And if I was using a Mac that day and I was trying to get work done and I was in a rush

32:58.780 --> 33:02.600
Maybe I was trying to get down to the studio really quick or I had to take off. I

33:03.680 --> 33:07.920
Would be very incensed. I I think I would be enraged that

33:08.520 --> 33:15.120
That they designed a network system in such a way that it could slow down my local computer on my LAN, right?

33:15.120 --> 33:16.000
And of course, you know

33:16.000 --> 33:19.600
Like we talk a lot about the various trade-offs and security and I think it just underscores that

33:19.880 --> 33:22.400
They've made the choice of where to fall in those trade-offs

33:22.840 --> 33:27.800
You don't really have a lot of input so many Mac the way I put this in our show notes is it's really about who?

33:27.800 --> 33:34.240
Owns your computer and Linux users. I think are the only ones who can who can really confidently say I own my system

33:34.240 --> 33:38.640
Do you see this like it is is that overstating it? No, I don't think it is

33:38.640 --> 33:44.160
I mean it comes down to these questions. Do I own my computer or does the company that?

33:44.800 --> 33:48.040
Owns the computer. So does Apple own my computer?

33:48.480 --> 33:55.400
Can I do whatever I want with my computer or does Apple decide what I do with my computer and in the end?

33:55.400 --> 34:02.200
We Linux users say or ask themselves do I want that or not and we don't want that?

34:02.320 --> 34:04.520
So we choose another system, right?

34:04.520 --> 34:08.760
And I think the other problem is is it's going to encourage people who are concerned about this

34:09.080 --> 34:14.000
Just to disable all code signing checks and that's not a good user behavior either, right?

34:14.000 --> 34:19.080
Especially for folks who maybe don't know that much about security like most users and can't really weigh the pros and cons

34:19.080 --> 34:27.240
So then there is a yet another wrinkle to this story. It is it's really something is in macOS Big Sur

34:27.920 --> 34:29.920
They have designed it such that

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
certain set of the core system

34:33.320 --> 34:35.320
bypasses VPNs and

34:36.160 --> 34:41.480
Other types of things like maybe you have a popular Mac app as little snitch of an outbound firewall, right?

34:41.480 --> 34:45.280
And that relies on some hooks that the kernel the Apple's kernel provides them to you know

34:45.280 --> 34:49.560
I'd be able to make these choices and they've just said no our programs they do what they want

34:49.560 --> 34:51.640
so that means that Macs are essentially

34:52.240 --> 34:56.280
Leaky on VPNs now out of the box and now this is all provisional as you said

34:56.280 --> 34:59.320
It's it's a Sunday right now, but at least from looking at Twitter

34:59.320 --> 35:04.320
It seems like maybe some other third-party apps can start start taking advantage of that too at least right now

35:04.320 --> 35:08.000
And it is still you know in beta. Yeah, but from what we do see on Twitter

35:08.000 --> 35:12.600
It seems like someone else was able to essentially create a malicious app that took advantage of this new system

35:12.600 --> 35:19.360
And it's it's ludicrous because again there I would expect as an end-user if I'm if I'm establishing a VPN

35:19.360 --> 35:26.420
I would never think that Mike's my kernel and other parts of my OS are sneaky sending data to other servers

35:26.640 --> 35:33.160
Outside my network level VPN. That's why I created a VPN something tells me there'll be some network

35:33.160 --> 35:38.640
IT administrators who are none too happy about this. I hope that's a bug could be a bug. We will see

35:38.640 --> 35:43.400
um the other thing that I I wanted to kind of just know in all of this is

35:43.760 --> 35:49.040
It may not all be bad news there could actually be a little potentially good news here

35:49.320 --> 35:53.760
It seems that there will be a way for users to bless

35:54.160 --> 35:58.280
Their own kernels on these new arm max say what yes

35:58.480 --> 36:03.000
So while yes, there is a secure boot like environment on these arm max

36:03.000 --> 36:05.120
And you have to have a sign kernel before it will boot

36:05.120 --> 36:09.920
We've now found out that there will be a process where you can

36:10.440 --> 36:15.080
Manually sign a kernel and the developer of pongo OS one of the developers

36:15.640 --> 36:22.920
Was getting pretty far on actually getting this to boot and it may actually be possible using the same approach to bless a Linux kernel and

36:23.480 --> 36:31.480
And then potentially boot a second stage bootloader like this pongo OS and then load Linux from that right the pongo OS bits there

36:31.480 --> 36:35.800
Because you're in kind of a weird environment that like say the Linux kernel wouldn't expect to be booted from so you need a little

36:35.800 --> 36:39.960
Shim to get it going. This is interesting right this is kind of on the side of okay

36:39.960 --> 36:44.000
Maybe you do still own it. Yes, we are going to enforce that you do it in a secure way

36:44.000 --> 36:48.600
Yeah, but if you can you know add your own blessed signed systems and boot it

36:49.160 --> 36:50.760
That's a step in the right direction

36:50.760 --> 36:55.320
So maybe maybe it's not totally locked out there you know Apple give it an apple taketh away

36:55.320 --> 36:59.160
But this story when I looked at this. I thought all of this combined together

36:59.160 --> 37:01.880
I thought this is this is why I think

37:03.080 --> 37:07.880
There will be a portion of of Apple users that are in the professional end that

37:08.360 --> 37:14.440
Expect to be able to control their computer the people who noticed these things right they're good candidates for Linux

37:14.680 --> 37:18.280
They seriously are for the Linux workstation like this laptop. We're going to review today

37:18.680 --> 37:25.880
They are they are the exact target demo for this Dell Precision set them up on you know fedora 33

37:25.880 --> 37:31.560
With a nice shiny GNOME setup all right all right you that may be too much

37:31.560 --> 37:35.080
I don't know they may have to go Ubuntu. You know they they need a soft landing

37:36.120 --> 37:41.600
But really like seriously it is it is how when you're talking about the differences between a Linux

37:42.080 --> 37:46.160
Workstation and a Mac workstation how do you quantify something like this?

37:46.560 --> 37:51.020
Because we'll often talk about telemetry or we'll talk about spying and privacy

37:51.020 --> 37:59.180
but this is a this is a multiple layer cake here where you've got the privacy implications of metadata tracking of

37:59.420 --> 38:05.260
When and what developers you're using you've got then the other aspect of this of course that Apple is able to turn

38:05.420 --> 38:11.140
applications off which you may or may not be comfortable with that's a decision you have to make but then lastly you have the

38:11.140 --> 38:16.160
Network effect where because Apple is not particularly good so far developing online services

38:16.180 --> 38:20.300
They've designed this thing in a way where when they release the new OS that day

38:20.300 --> 38:26.980
It can cause all of the Macs all of the Macs not just the Big Sur Macs all of the Macs to slow down

38:27.540 --> 38:31.540
that to me is is a line that should not ever be crossed and

38:32.020 --> 38:35.820
You know these things are never gonna impact your Linux distro, right?

38:35.820 --> 38:37.420
It's just not gonna happen there was a time

38:37.420 --> 38:42.220
Maybe where an Amazon referral search would be conducted when you'd searched in the launcher

38:42.220 --> 38:47.340
But this kind of stuff is just not gonna happen on the Linux box the funny part that struck me too was all the very interesting

38:47.340 --> 38:50.780
Good investigative work going on to figure out just what was sent and what was happening

38:51.220 --> 38:53.380
That's all you know in the Linux world. That's open-source

38:53.380 --> 38:59.020
Just go point me at the GitHub and you have to wonder with this move to arm Apple silicon really? Yeah, right

38:59.020 --> 39:00.740
Thank you. It's true the m1 chip

39:00.740 --> 39:06.540
The reality is is that we they really are closer and closer to a world where nothing runs unless it's signed

39:07.020 --> 39:09.020
Today they allow you to bypass gatekeeper

39:09.580 --> 39:13.340
but why why really go to the effort of having a

39:13.340 --> 39:19.580
Ecosystem and a and a hardware and a software stack that you own top to bottom and you are the sole kingmaker

39:19.860 --> 39:26.580
With if you're not gonna make that move and if you look where Apple is going where they're seeking revenue now is services and these app

39:26.580 --> 39:30.580
Stores they they count them as services for the reports to Wall Street

39:30.580 --> 39:35.740
And it just seems very likely that now that you've got Macs that can run

39:36.180 --> 39:39.660
iOS apps and they're on their own custom silicon and

39:39.660 --> 39:43.700
They have this all the pieces in place like gatekeeper the App Store

39:43.700 --> 39:49.700
It's probably only a few years from now where they flip that switch and everything has to run through gatekeeper and there will be absolutely

39:49.860 --> 39:51.860
Nothing you can do like you can't run

39:52.240 --> 39:58.580
Anything but Big Sur or later on these m1 Macs just can't so there's just do you have no option and I?

39:58.740 --> 40:05.100
Think that also is gonna make Linux more and more of a compelling platform for high-end professionals tech savvy professionals

40:05.100 --> 40:10.380
I'm not saying you know for everybody, but it's just making it fall more and more I think into less and less

40:10.380 --> 40:13.980
I should say in the general purpose computing category and more and more as a niche thing

40:13.980 --> 40:16.980
Maybe you have it for your as your video editing utility

40:16.980 --> 40:20.860
You know it's just a box in the corner that you need because it has the best applications for that purpose

40:20.860 --> 40:25.180
But it's not a general purpose computer. Yeah, I could see that sure. I mean it's that's a pretty expensive

40:26.300 --> 40:29.580
Non general purpose computer when you're spending that kind of money. You'd like it to be able to do everything

40:30.900 --> 40:32.340
but

40:32.340 --> 40:35.380
Yeah, I mean, maybe maybe what happens is if Apple goes crazy

40:35.380 --> 40:40.580
Maybe you'll but maybe you can load Linux on those ARM Macs one day. Maybe it'll happen something tells me you're gonna try

40:42.860 --> 40:47.980
Well let's talk about this Macbook killer that I've had in-house for a few weeks now

40:47.980 --> 40:50.940
I really had to put it through its paces, but first I do have a little housekeeping

40:51.700 --> 40:54.620
You should definitely join the le plug

40:54.620 --> 40:59.940
We have a virtual Linux users group that gets together every Sunday in our mumble room in the lobby

40:59.940 --> 41:04.660
It's really easy to get started go to Linux unplug calm. We have the mumble info in there now

41:06.020 --> 41:12.020
Next Sunday is the jellyfin bug-a-thon the developers will be joining our our lug

41:12.020 --> 41:14.380
they were actually there earlier today to doing a presentation and

41:15.660 --> 41:17.660
we're gonna help them try to just

41:17.780 --> 41:23.660
Stamp out any of the bugs we can find in the 10.7 release jellyfin is a open source Plex alternative

41:23.660 --> 41:30.780
And we want to do anything we can here at the show to push that forward and so the virtual lug has extended an invitation

41:30.780 --> 41:34.220
To the jellyfin developers to join them next Sunday at noon Pacific

41:34.580 --> 41:38.620
And you can get that converted at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and help them out

41:38.620 --> 41:44.340
Hey, I'm excited and I'm a big jellyfin user myself. So the more bugs we find better for me. That's right, man

41:44.740 --> 41:48.700
Also, I want to recommend you grab the Jupiter broadcasting all shows feed

41:48.700 --> 41:54.380
You never know what could be coming up and these days all the shows are really great Coder radios back

41:54.780 --> 41:57.020
West has joined me on Linux action news

41:57.260 --> 42:00.660
It's a nice type production self-hosted be coming out later this week

42:00.660 --> 42:05.860
And if you have the all shows feed you just get it all so you can search in your podcast app or or get it

42:05.860 --> 42:10.260
From the website. I think it's a good way. It's like the pro. It's like the pro user move

42:10.260 --> 42:14.500
Well or the lazy user move where you don't want to bother checking and making sure you got all the ones in the right spots

42:14.500 --> 42:18.620
And in your feeds, that's a really good just one feed that it's the lazy and easy way

42:18.620 --> 42:23.500
But also the pro way see sometimes sometimes the easy way is the pro way. That's right

42:23.500 --> 42:28.520
You know you want to just you want sustainable podcasting West. All right, that's all the housekeeping for this week

42:30.180 --> 42:36.820
So let's talk about this Linux MacBook killer a bold claim mr. Fisher it really is

42:36.820 --> 42:44.180
This is the precision 57 50 and this is this is a really a pretty new beast from Dell

42:44.180 --> 42:47.740
They've they really stepped it up. They manage to get this thing 10% thinner

42:47.740 --> 42:52.380
So if you've seen the old edition, it's kind of got like some big fan gaps on the sides and whatnot

42:52.380 --> 42:54.380
all that's gone with this one and now

42:55.100 --> 43:01.700
With with this is really something I had to double-check this but now Dell can claim the world's smallest

43:02.380 --> 43:08.800
17 inch mobile workstation it is quite a thing to look at. Yeah, really handsome shiny

43:09.340 --> 43:16.600
Professional. Yeah, it's it's that same metal and sort of carbon fiber like mix that Dell uses on the XPS

43:16.600 --> 43:19.800
but brought up to the professional precision line and

43:20.320 --> 43:25.960
They've they've also done another pass at the edge to edge infinity display with just blow

43:26.600 --> 43:28.600
This thing is it's really something

43:29.080 --> 43:31.080
the the screen on this is

43:31.600 --> 43:39.160
Well, it's I mean, it's always tops but it's a 16 by 10 aspect ratio. It has HDR 400 support

43:39.160 --> 43:44.840
It's 3840 by 2400 resolution with touch support and it's edge to edge glass

43:44.840 --> 43:49.880
I didn't even try the touch support and the webcams back up at the top now, which is which is pretty nice

43:50.080 --> 43:55.760
So this precision as it's configured is really meant for a workstation replacement

43:55.760 --> 43:57.280
It's meant to stomp a MacBook

43:57.280 --> 44:03.080
It has the Xeon mobile processors in it that run at a base clock of 2.4 gigahertz

44:03.520 --> 44:10.760
But can actually go all the way up to 5.3 gigahertz Wow eight cores 16 threads

44:10.760 --> 44:17.360
Isn't that something I'm not used to type an n-proc and seeing 16 on my laptop 32 gigs of RAM in this particular one

44:17.360 --> 44:18.720
Although I think you can go even further

44:18.720 --> 44:23.000
This one has a quadro RTX 3000 with six gigs of video RAM

44:23.000 --> 44:28.200
I'll tell you more about that in a little bit as an m.2 one terabyte PCIe MVM

44:28.200 --> 44:30.200
It doesn't have a spinning rust

44:30.640 --> 44:35.160
Sorry, I think you can actually put up to two terabytes of PCIe storage in it

44:35.160 --> 44:38.880
But this is one terabyte 6l 97 watt hour lithium ion battery

44:38.880 --> 44:44.600
So the maximum you could take this thing on a plane with and then they Dell does this and I really like it is

44:44.920 --> 44:48.080
They've done a really beefy USB

44:48.760 --> 44:51.360
C charger a hundred and thirty watts. Yeah

44:51.560 --> 44:57.320
Yeah, so you can really dump power into this thing and it's or you just use any standard USB C charger

44:57.320 --> 45:00.760
I like, you know in any of the ports any of the ports on the thing. It's really nice

45:01.320 --> 45:05.280
So that that I really appreciate it because when you needed to throw power into it

45:05.280 --> 45:10.320
They had such 130 watt, but when I wasn't doing much with it, I could just use like the 65 one

45:10.320 --> 45:12.800
I can whatever you have. Yeah, like I was 65 watt that

45:13.360 --> 45:17.920
Was pretty easy to use this one also features a much larger trackpad

45:17.920 --> 45:21.880
I mean look at the trackpad compared to our ThinkPad trackpads. I mean, it's puny

45:21.880 --> 45:24.680
Yeah, it's if this trackpad is it's MacBook style

45:24.680 --> 45:29.400
It's massive and it's it's got a very nice. It's it's the best

45:29.400 --> 45:35.120
It's the best touchpad I've ever used on a Linux laptop easily, which might not still be saying much but it's pretty good

45:35.120 --> 45:36.880
I really have zero complaints

45:36.880 --> 45:41.400
The other thing that's nice about this laptop is you can load it up with ECC memory if you like

45:41.680 --> 45:45.280
If your workload calls for that, oh and I was wrong

45:45.280 --> 45:50.800
You can get up to four terabytes of PCIe storage and you can get it in raid one or zero options, too

45:50.920 --> 45:53.000
It's I did not see this

45:53.000 --> 45:58.640
Also, they've worked on this to reduce the amount of blue light that the panel blasts in your face to reduce eye strain

45:58.640 --> 46:06.040
This has an updated keyboard with a slightly longer travel distance. I'll be curious for your take on that particular detail

46:06.040 --> 46:10.300
Yeah, I actually don't really find the keyboard much different. It's not offensive

46:10.300 --> 46:14.680
Um, I am I find myself not to be a very good keyboard critic

46:14.680 --> 46:19.040
I'm I definitely appreciate a nice keyboard and the better the keyboard the more I appreciate it

46:19.040 --> 46:23.840
But I I can go on anything between the butterfly keyboard like that. I can't use that right?

46:23.840 --> 46:29.140
That's the upper limit there right and then like a really nice custom mechanical keyboard like I I'm but I liked it

46:29.140 --> 46:31.220
I found that when I did start to use it

46:31.220 --> 46:35.860
It took my brain about a minute to really adjust to the layout and then I had it it was really no big deal

46:36.440 --> 46:40.600
And then there's something that is really special about this laptop

46:41.400 --> 46:43.400
this this laptop

46:43.480 --> 46:44.840
has

46:44.840 --> 46:49.480
What has got to be maybe the future of where where Dell is going on thermal management?

46:49.480 --> 46:56.600
Get ready for this. So Dell wanted a solution where that you could really run this thing GPU and CPU go right and otherwise

46:56.600 --> 47:00.360
But why are you filling it with so much beefy hardware totally doable in a desktop tower?

47:00.360 --> 47:06.000
Yes, not very doable in a laptop in a thin laptop. Yeah, and a really thin laptop

47:06.000 --> 47:09.800
So they've done some secret sauce work. It's patented

47:09.800 --> 47:13.560
So it's not that secret, but they've done some secret sauce work on the fans

47:13.560 --> 47:16.920
So they have these really kind of big special fatty fans in there

47:16.920 --> 47:23.920
But then they also have something called dual opposite outlet where they have a pressurized air chamber and fans to really move the air

47:23.920 --> 47:24.840
in this thing

47:24.840 --> 47:30.680
So this thing manages with a combo of fan upgrades the dual air flow and the pressurization

47:30.680 --> 47:34.520
They do in there to move a ton of air without a lot of noise

47:35.520 --> 47:37.520
in fact, I'll say

47:38.040 --> 47:44.360
Without really any audible noise even under some really significant loads. I know they also

47:44.360 --> 47:48.280
Have done and in the little controller a machine

47:48.760 --> 47:52.720
Learning dynamic tuning technology that actually comes from Intel

47:52.720 --> 48:00.160
But Dell's the first to actually ship with this and it's a code based solution that automatically adjusts the performance based on

48:00.680 --> 48:07.800
Application load what parts of the system the applications are hitting and it also can anticipate based on your previous performance

48:08.280 --> 48:11.800
When like you start a CPU load and it might in the past

48:11.800 --> 48:16.520
Maybe it's gonna attempt to avoid ramping up cooling because it's gonna see it's gonna try to wait as long as possible before it

48:16.520 --> 48:23.640
Ramps cooling, but now with this adaptive workload system if it knows when you run this particular workload that the CPU runs for a long time

48:23.640 --> 48:28.280
Oh, he's training another model. Yeah, it just ramps right up the cooling and it just gets right on it

48:28.280 --> 48:31.800
But here's where they bring it all together and this is

48:32.440 --> 48:33.560
ridiculous

48:33.560 --> 48:37.560
Dell has built in a series of vapor chambers

48:37.560 --> 48:43.240
Which are thinner than heat pipes and they can spread the heat out better and more efficiently and they allow for

48:43.720 --> 48:47.560
Larger heat rejection paths, which is great for like your skin temperature stuff

48:48.280 --> 48:52.040
And it really moves the heat and so they have the they have this thing

48:52.360 --> 48:57.560
The vapor chamber stuff bolted on to both the CPU and the GPU and so you can

48:58.040 --> 49:02.200
Crank this. I mean I'm throwing benchmark after benchmark at this thing for like a solid day

49:02.200 --> 49:07.080
And it's just sitting there quietly chugging right along. Um, and then

49:08.040 --> 49:11.000
I I hope this I hope this makes it into other models in the future

49:11.000 --> 49:16.280
They have a graphite layer between the hot components and the outside of the laptop

49:17.320 --> 49:21.880
So that way your hands and your wrist and stuff like burning my legs. No

49:22.360 --> 49:29.480
Wow, yeah, and so they disperse the heat strategically throughout the system to prevent hot spots from affecting the user's comfort level

49:29.480 --> 49:33.960
Yeah, i'm sold. Isn't that something? Um, so let's be real here

49:34.760 --> 49:36.040
um

49:36.040 --> 49:41.880
As configured. Yeah, what what is this gonna send me back? This is a 4800 review unit

49:42.440 --> 49:45.400
4800 us greenbacks. Okay, but

49:46.360 --> 49:51.880
um, I mean you got to think about really who is this laptop for right? That's the question here

49:51.880 --> 49:57.320
Is this is for a professional. This is not my uh watching youtube on the couch laptop. This is our laptop

49:57.320 --> 50:01.560
Watching youtube on the couch laptop. This is i've been using macs for years

50:01.800 --> 50:06.520
I don't like where they're going and I want something that replaces my macbook

50:06.600 --> 50:10.520
This is somebody who has a very gpu intensive workload

50:10.600 --> 50:14.360
Perhaps they're messing with tensorflow like this is this is a particular type

50:14.440 --> 50:17.320
These are several types, but these are particular types of users

50:18.200 --> 50:22.280
I'd also say also people who like to treat themselves to the very best because

50:22.280 --> 50:27.800
Uh, the reason why I waited so long to do this review is I really wanted to see if there was downsides to this

50:27.800 --> 50:29.620
laptop because I just

50:29.620 --> 50:35.560
Immediately fell in love with it and I knew I needed to like catch my catch my breath balance it out figure it out

50:35.640 --> 50:40.520
You know use it for a while. And so I took an extended review with this one to the grace of dell. Thank you very much

50:40.920 --> 50:44.600
um, and I walked away realizing that even if you're

50:45.320 --> 50:47.800
Not in like this particular professional category

50:47.800 --> 50:53.080
If you like a quiet laptop a fast laptop a beautiful laptop a laptop pre-loaded with linux

50:53.320 --> 50:58.600
And you just kind of like the very best right? You've got you've got money to spare not an object and you just want the best

50:58.680 --> 51:01.080
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because you know, it's got it's got

51:01.700 --> 51:05.000
Thunderbolts, you can hook it up to a dock. You can have a bunch of monitors

51:05.320 --> 51:09.640
This graphics card had no problem powering external screens and internal screens

51:10.280 --> 51:15.080
Um, there is something to be aware of though, and I think this is maybe the biggest caveat

51:15.080 --> 51:22.220
I knew it couldn't all be perfect but in this sentence. Yeah, it currently requires and only fully works with ubuntu 1804

51:22.760 --> 51:25.960
We haven't seen this for a while. So I called up dell and I said like what's going on?

51:25.960 --> 51:31.480
Why why can I only use 1804? I tried fedora. I tried pop os. I tried 2010. I tried 2004, right?

51:31.480 --> 51:32.840
That's kind of the standard thing right anytime

51:32.840 --> 51:35.080
There's an xbs in here really any laptop running linux

51:35.080 --> 51:36.520
Let's throw all the distros at it

51:36.520 --> 51:39.000
See what it does because you know, I figure a lot of people in our audience

51:39.080 --> 51:41.160
They're gonna run whatever they want to run. They're gonna reload it

51:41.160 --> 51:48.040
So the thing is is the thing has some super fancy sound and um that sound max card required a lot of custom work

51:48.680 --> 51:52.360
And they are targeting support for 2004 in january

51:52.440 --> 51:57.000
But don't yet have it and the way this process works is dell is working with canonical

51:57.400 --> 52:02.600
And then when there's an update for hardware support those updates shipped to the dell laptop

52:03.400 --> 52:09.800
Through a canonical repository interesting. So it's part of just the system update process. There is an oem

52:09.800 --> 52:14.600
Repo at canonical that contains the software

52:14.920 --> 52:20.040
And this is how this partnership works is dell engages with canonical to do this custom work for them

52:20.040 --> 52:24.520
So it's not like dell's doing this weird hacky work and then like just dropping a you know

52:24.520 --> 52:27.560
A big blob file on the file system and saying have go at it

52:27.960 --> 52:32.680
They are contracting with canonical who are experts on the operating system and building this out

52:32.760 --> 52:37.480
So they presently are targeting january for rubuntu 2004 support

52:37.480 --> 52:39.480
But you can you're not going to be able to put

52:40.120 --> 52:45.720
Manjaro or fedora or whatever else you might want on here at least if you want to have sound and have sound

52:46.200 --> 52:48.440
Yeah, you can use it. It'll work. Great

52:49.000 --> 52:54.680
Performance is excellent. I have you know that um wireless rrf headset that I have that has a usb dongle

52:54.920 --> 52:59.880
That's what I used for the majority of my usage time anyways, and that works just fine

53:00.440 --> 53:03.000
So I ended up for the most part not running

53:03.000 --> 53:08.620
1804 until towards the end of the review where I put it back on there when you first set up the machine dell asks

53:08.700 --> 53:10.300
You if you want to recreate

53:10.300 --> 53:14.780
Create recovery media nice and so I said yes flash that and so I knew at some point

53:14.860 --> 53:18.540
I might want to go back back and I did and it was simple and it was straightforward

53:18.780 --> 53:24.620
One of the things that is pretty well known about dell but worth reminding you is they have that service tag

53:25.260 --> 53:26.620
system, right

53:26.620 --> 53:31.500
And um the nice thing about that is you just go into the website you put the service tag in and you can redownload

53:31.500 --> 53:35.520
The recovery media as well. It's got all this stuff for your specific model and documentation

53:36.140 --> 53:42.780
But this thing's about the performance. So let's talk about benchmarks a little bit. I put some uh, i'll put some links in the show notes

53:42.860 --> 53:49.180
But I decided to take this dell precision laptop and I decided to put it up against a ryzen

53:49.720 --> 53:56.300
Workstation I decided to put it up against my own workstation and I decided to put it up against the macbook pro 16

53:56.380 --> 53:57.740
I like this competition

53:57.740 --> 54:02.060
Yeah, it was it was a really interesting fight because these are all nice computers in their own right?

54:02.060 --> 54:05.180
I mean my workstations from like 2017 2018. So

54:05.900 --> 54:07.900
You know a little old but the dell

54:08.220 --> 54:13.180
Is a modern precision 57 50 so I expected it to stack up pretty well

54:13.260 --> 54:16.140
But I wasn't sure about going up against desktops like a ryzen

54:16.780 --> 54:18.940
The dell came out on top in most all the tests

54:19.340 --> 54:24.300
As you would expect right because it can ramp up to 5 gigahertz 32 gigs of very fast ram brand new machine

54:24.300 --> 54:29.740
Yeah, yeah, the ryzen workstation pulled ahead a few times, but I decided let's put it up against the macbook pro 16

54:30.140 --> 54:36.220
Because I felt like that was uh, an interesting comparison and this is this is pretty telling

54:36.540 --> 54:36.780
um

54:36.780 --> 54:42.060
I ran a geek bench benchmark on the mac and then I ran geek bench benchmark on the dell because this is a very common

54:42.140 --> 54:48.860
Mac benchmark and the macbook pro comes in with a multi-core score of seven thousand three hundred and ninety two

54:48.860 --> 54:54.700
The dell laptop comes in with a multi-core score of seven thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight

54:54.700 --> 55:01.900
So several so a few hundred at least a few hundred uh higher on the score from multi-core and also faster on single core

55:01.900 --> 55:05.580
Counts and faster on gpu benchmarks not too surprising there

55:05.980 --> 55:06.780
but

55:06.780 --> 55:13.020
When I expect out the macbook pro that macbook pro was almost six thousand dollars. Ouch

55:13.340 --> 55:16.860
Yeah, and of course it doesn't run linux. So there's that too

55:16.860 --> 55:20.460
Um, so I I felt like when you look at it from in that range

55:20.940 --> 55:25.900
It's the the dell stacks up pretty well price and and we've we've seen other laptops that are you know

55:25.980 --> 55:30.460
Should be quite fast, but either don't have the the best thermal management or other issues where you know

55:30.780 --> 55:36.780
A macbook just has those things solved. Yeah, there's that. Um, the dell thermals are they're they're in a class of their own

55:37.020 --> 55:43.740
I decided to also throw the old thinkpad at it. Hey thinkpad comes in with a 3500 score. Ouch. Yeah

55:43.740 --> 55:50.220
Yeah, it really so the other thing that uh going through all these benchmarks that this test really underscored for me is

55:50.860 --> 55:55.980
There is still a pretty clear advantage that a desktop workstation has in some areas over a laptop

55:56.140 --> 55:58.700
even a totally decked out laptop like this precision

55:59.660 --> 56:01.100
but

56:01.100 --> 56:05.820
You can't take the you know, the the desktop. What am I carrying the whole tower? That's awkward

56:05.980 --> 56:09.020
So when you look at those compromises and you look at what dell tried to do here

56:09.020 --> 56:13.020
They tried to come up with a mobile workstation where you can max out the gpu and cpu

56:13.020 --> 56:19.660
And still get reasonable battery life and get and get reasonable cooling and you don't have the thermal throttling effect

56:19.740 --> 56:24.060
Where you run the machine for a bit and then it just starts really eating on the throttling

56:24.220 --> 56:27.260
that's what they set out to solve with this and they realized that

56:28.060 --> 56:33.100
The audience for that were linux users. So while I dislike that it's limited to 1804

56:33.260 --> 56:35.100
It's not really a deal breaker

56:35.100 --> 56:39.500
I think for most people in this class, right especially if you're a professional and want to use a you know

56:39.500 --> 56:45.740
A supported long-term release anyway. Yeah, and you got to remember that this also is because it's a dell

56:46.060 --> 56:49.100
It's an option that's available to a lot of people from a corporate standpoint

56:49.420 --> 56:52.220
And they're not going to be choosing their operating system anyway, right?

56:52.780 --> 56:58.940
The other thing I didn't what they're really the only had really two dislikes with this and my second dislike was that

56:59.340 --> 57:04.700
It seemed like sometimes the screen auto dimming logic was hunting for just the right light settings

57:04.700 --> 57:11.740
and this seemed to persist across all the distributions I tried and it was really only when I was in a situation where there was

57:11.740 --> 57:16.380
a bright light source behind me and my body was blocking

57:16.940 --> 57:22.860
The photo sensor then the system would sit there and try to hunt for the right brightness to kind of a distracting degree

57:23.180 --> 57:25.180
But if you don't sit

57:25.340 --> 57:28.460
Like I was in front of a light don't do what chris does it wasn't so bad

57:28.780 --> 57:31.260
But you know in conclusion, this is a work tool

57:31.260 --> 57:37.500
And it is probably one of the nicest tools you could own if this is the type of system that you need for work

57:37.740 --> 57:42.220
I mean, there's no doubt about it in my mind if I was rolling with it these days

57:42.700 --> 57:47.260
Uh, i'd probably pick that up for myself. This would probably be my machine because it played the games

57:47.260 --> 57:51.740
I wanted to play at high resolution. It did the workloads. I wanted to throw at it

57:51.900 --> 57:57.340
It never complained from a temperature standpoint and i'm okay with the sound workaround for something

57:57.340 --> 58:03.660
That's this high of quality. He's nice with your e gpu. Yeah. Yes, it does. Um, would I like the sound to work obviously?

58:03.740 --> 58:06.140
But if I was really rolling in it and money was no object

58:06.780 --> 58:08.780
For myself, I would get this personally

58:09.500 --> 58:12.460
Clearly if I was in this work field, this seems like an obvious choice, too

58:13.180 --> 58:14.300
and I think

58:14.300 --> 58:20.940
That is a bigger and bigger market the people that need a laptop like this that run linux for tensorflow and other types of work

58:21.580 --> 58:25.020
Um, we decided to also just do a little machine learning testing not just because you know

58:25.020 --> 58:28.460
That's clearly one of the things it's one of the target areas. Yeah, and it's killer

58:28.620 --> 58:31.500
It's just absolutely killer and it's you got to think about it from this standpoint

58:31.500 --> 58:33.500
It's pre-loaded with linux and ready to go

58:33.740 --> 58:37.900
I think this is a bigger and bigger market and it seems like dell thinks this is a bigger and bigger market

58:38.140 --> 58:43.820
And so they've built this linux macbook killer and it's a moniker that has become cliche

58:44.140 --> 58:46.140
It's one i've used myself in the past

58:46.460 --> 58:53.340
But I really truly think this thing is a game changer for corporate linux or for professional developers or high-end game developers

58:53.340 --> 58:57.500
Who want to move over to the linux platform and they want something they can buy from a name brand?

58:57.820 --> 59:03.500
That they know or maybe their corporation already has an account with and this thing is just it's such a winner for those people

59:03.660 --> 59:09.580
You can really see how the platform they started building with the xps has evolved and just it's shiny now

59:09.900 --> 59:11.900
It's really impressive and it makes me happy that

59:12.540 --> 59:16.540
Someone other than apple is playing in this space and making computers that can be this good

59:16.620 --> 59:21.340
That's it is we now have something that is just top top tier

59:21.340 --> 59:26.380
And I hope to see a lot of the awesome tech with the cooling system come down to the xps line

59:26.380 --> 59:33.580
That would be right super nice because that's a little more approachable for me. I also I don't need a quadro, right?

59:33.580 --> 59:37.180
So i'd like to have something that you do some gaming but nothing crazy, right?

59:37.340 --> 59:41.020
So i'd like to have something maybe a little more in a different tier

59:41.100 --> 59:46.300
but I could absolutely understand the people that do want it and um, my time with the

59:47.180 --> 59:48.940
with the dell was

59:48.940 --> 59:55.820
It was tricky because I didn't really know what the approach was for a review for a for a computer this powerful

59:56.220 --> 01:00:00.300
Like I have out in the other room. I have 150 laptop

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:06.140
I know how to review 150 laptop, right? I can tell you if the value proposition is there really easily

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.220
I just don't know how it works with linux yet

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:12.300
But with this when you're talking something that's 47 48 hundred dollars

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.940
How do I come on the air and tell you it's worth your money?

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.500
I can't tell you that right because everybody has a different sense of value but what I can tell you

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.740
Is this is one of the nicer computers i've ever used and it runs linux out of the box

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:27.340
And when I walk away from it, I'd say they've hit it out of the park

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.780
And that's that's what I wanted to come and that's what I wanted to relate to you is what they've done

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:35.500
That's kind of unique and kind of interesting and just the success that we're now seeing with these laptops

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.460
Um, i'm really impressed and I wish I could keep it

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:44.700
You know, but I will now box it up and send it back to dell and then the review will begin on the 150 laptop

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.700
So long you beautiful beast

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:51.980
It was fun while it lasted, uh, and it was a great excuse to load up steam and try a few video games

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.420
Now i'm back to my old system

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:02.300
All right, mr. Payne moving on from the review. What do we uh, what do we have in the feedback section anything this week?

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.700
No, no feedback this week. Well, there is some we just haven't selected it. That's probably in the show

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:11.420
That's probably what it is. Well, then let's plug the feedback so we can get some so we'll do a little more feedback

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:17.180
The next episode go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and fill that form out and send us in your thoughts

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.900
Yeah, we love your feedback, you know, not all of it can make it to the air

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:26.300
There just isn't time and but we still love hearing from you and all the stories the adventures the projects in linux

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.940
That stuff's great. I might have a special request

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.100
Wouldn't it be great?

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.540
just to get like

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:37.580
Somebody's crazy setup. Like do you have a crazy setup? That's like as crazy as this laptop or crazier

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.820
Like what weird stuff are you doing? Like yeah, first of all, tell us. Yeah, we yeah

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.500
So first of all, tell us what you're running

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.340
Like give us an idea of your specs

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:49.020
And then tell us why you need that because i'd like to get an idea of what some of those workloads are

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:51.340
And then on the opposite end of the spectrum

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.580
If you're running on something

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.980
Ridiculously low end and you're making it work. I'd like to hear that too

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.100
That's always like I like both ends of the spectrum

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:06.940
So give us that at linuxunplug.com slash contact and we may just cover it in a future episode

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:12.540
Also, thank you to our unplugged core contributors. You can go to unpluggedcore.com to sign up

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:17.900
You keep the unplugged program independent and you help reduce the ad load needed to make the show profitable

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:23.260
Let us be a little more picky with who we work with but you also get some perks first perk is the limited ad feed

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:28.060
Which cuts down as many of the ads as possible and just gives you the same great show same production

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:33.580
And the second feed is the full show live stream all our screw-ups like one that just happened a moment ago

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.900
Uh all the stuff that we don't make it and we don't put in the show that that's in the live feed version

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.360
And you get either one when you become a core contributor at unpluggedcore.com

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:50.140
Yes, wes yes, it's time for the picks and finally I decided since we didn't have feedback this week

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:57.420
We should have two picks. Look at you first one comes in from a listener of the show and it's called yacht

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:05.100
Yacht yacht is a graphical interface for managing your containers with a focus on templates and one-click

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.540
Deployments and also a dark mode. I like that

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:15.020
Uh, it is early. It is a community member who is making this but it's pretty neat and you could try it out right now

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:19.280
I mean so far you got your basic container management. You got a template framework

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.460
You have an easy approach to updating those templates

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.220
and um

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.900
Centralized settings for volume management similar to qol functionality, which is neat

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:29.020
You know, I like it

01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:33.580
I got it running right here on the laptop and it's already giving me a splendid little dashboard of all the containers

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:39.420
I'm running now. I don't have any templates or anything, but I can see why you'd want that. Yeah, that's pretty pretty nice

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.180
And I mean, can you be in a name like yacht just the nautical theme if it's all right in

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.220
So the other pick we have is the reason why another reason why we did too is because you've heard of this one

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:53.020
But they have a nice new update. We wanted to make you aware of a brand new version of lutris is out

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:58.080
Zero five dot eight now this the lutris gaming platform

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.800
Has been working on importing your steam library and your gog library and third-party libraries into one

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.680
Store one ui one place to manage them all one stop shop

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:15.280
And they've made some nice strides recently and now steam games are loaded directly from the steam api

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.920
You don't have to go manually sync do all that weird stuff you had to do on the website. It just brings it all in

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.080
And game banners and icons are downloaded from the services themselves. It's it's getting really slick

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:32.480
Even bonus content for gog games like manuals and soundtracks can now be downloaded and stored inside lutris

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.440
So if you haven't checked out lutris in a while go do it

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.960
It's a pretty great little app and if you've been doing some gamings gaming on linux just gets better and better

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:46.560
It sure does wes. It sure does. Let's give it on. Let's uh, give it a honorable mention. There we go

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.560
Get the valve bong in there

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.960
Now we'll be back at our regular live time next tuesday over jblive.tv, which is nice because

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760
Just doing it on sunday thing is getting a little old

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:04.240
Right. Yeah, what happened to tuesdays? What a day that is linux tuesday

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:10.160
I know and doing it on sundays is uh, it's a lot because we're also working on linux action news and the same

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.800
It's just it's a lot so back to tuesdays for us. It is you can join us though

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.140
Yeah, we'd love to have you join us over at jblive.tv

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.600
We do the show at noon pacific

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:24.000
We actually tend to get kind of going about a half hour before that all that's converted

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.580
In your local time zone at jupitabroadcasting.com

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.180
Slash calendar links to everything we talked about today at linuxunplugged.com

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.240
Slash 380 the show is at linux unplugged on the twitter. He's at westpane. I'm at chris lass

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.540
I don't know anything else we should mention lots of good shows over jupitabroadcasting

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:42.480
Check them out. Go check them out

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.960
Okay, thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program and we'll be right back here not on a sunday

01:05:48.960 --> 01:06:12.500
But we'll be back here next tuesday

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960
So

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.320
All right, well you were comparing that laptop

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:38.000
Against other laptops, but would you rather have that or for a very similar price a 2006 ponniac vibe?

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.720
Probably the vibe to be honest with you

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:45.680
Yeah, when you start getting those prices you really are getting to use car prices, yeah

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:52.240
Uh over the weekend carl and I were uh, kind of commiserating about a sense of a bit of virtual

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.920
Conference burnout. I kind of implied it there with all they all feel like zoom meetings. Where are you at on it? Carl?

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.040
Yeah, I definitely appreciate it. I mean it's better than nothing right?

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.000
Right if corona is showing us anything we got to take what we can get

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.280
but

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.000
at the same time

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:06.560
I mean

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:11.840
It just cannot emulate the feel of a real conference and you know getting to hang out with friends that live far away

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.920
You know go out for drinks go out for good food

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.920
It's just it's not the same, you know

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.960
So at times it just feels like you're sitting there just watching youtube and some of them are even live streaming on youtube

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:26.640
Yeah, that's just it. It's a lot of good information. I'm valuable, you know valuable time from the speakers and I really appreciate that

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.320
But you're right. It doesn't

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.600
Doesn't hit that human connection

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.400
I know a lot of cons are trying to mix things up and have you know separate rooms for hallway tracks or other methods and

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.080
Chatting in a live stream can be fun. But yeah, and some of these are very

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:43.520
very well attended some of them are very poorly attended and then it kind of looks like a big waste of everyone's time and then

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.040
Additionally on top of that and I just i'm not ungrateful

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.680
I am very grateful that all of these are happening even and that the information is being relayed

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:53.520
but

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.560
As a culture

01:07:54.560 --> 01:08:00.320
We just haven't gotten really good yet about knowing how to have good audio quality and where to position our cameras

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:03.600
and there's still a lot culturally we're learning and so

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.680
So you really kind of get the worst of it when you're watching these virtual events

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.080
They tend to have a lot of audio issues. They tend to have a lot of camera problems. There's a lot of dead air

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.400
Right. There's not necessarily someone, you know being an mc keeping everything flowing, right?

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.880
That's um, yeah can make a big difference. There's sometimes people are accidentally muted all the stuff you get

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.600
In like your worst work conferences

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:30.080
Have been at these events too. And so it's almost like someone needs to develop a platform that allows somebody to

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.240
You mc it and mute and unmute people and kind of

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.240
Be the person keeping the stream going and and then making sure that when like it's west pain's time to talk

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.960
I can mute and unmute west like that's how we do it here, right?

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.440
I don't I don't rely on the individual host to unmute themselves. I mean they can but

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.200
You you know the host can do it and then you don't have this weird thing

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.120
Like I played that clip of of greg's introduction, which was slightly awkward

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:58.000
But his was actually like one of the best case scenarios

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.080
This went smooth compared to almost everybody else and his audio quality was better than almost everybody else

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:08.640
One of the big benefits is that it's really opened up the availability for a lot of people that either can't afford travel themselves

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.880
Or their work won't pay for it and allows going to conferences all over the world

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.000
You know, I missed I tried to attend some of the linux app some app summit, I think

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.320
Um, but a lot of it was on european time

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.960
So I missed all the morning ones. I got to go back and watch those on youtube

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.880
Yeah, but it's just really opened up the availability which is a plus so it's a mixed bag

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.720
Yeah, the timing was tricky on that one. That's why I wanted to grab some of the clips from it

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.240
um, but I also feel like there has been

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:37.200
a gain and so you gotta wonder if there isn't

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.440
some sort of

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.880
Maybe middle ground here carl

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:47.200
I don't know really what it would be because the the in-person track and the going out and eating in the scene people stuff matters

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.120
So you don't want to have something that's only virtual but it could there be

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:57.600
Some kind of virtual hybrid conference where part of it's online part of it's physical. Would that be worth doing?

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.920
I don't know. I mean that's an interesting idea. I think it'd be really hard to pull off

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.400
I mean where everyone that's having to do remote stuff more than they used to now

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.120
Uh is probably can probably appreciate that

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:15.600
There's a golden rule for virtual meetings is that if one person's remote everyone's remote because whenever you have

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.880
You know some people in person you have sidebar conversations going on and it's really just not as not a true a lot worse

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:26.240
Communication so I fear the same thing happening with a mixed conference

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.000
it'd be interesting to try and see see if there's ways we can mitigate that because

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.280
I mean, even if all it is is just that you have the live in-person conference eventually and then you know

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:39.680
It's just standard that you have to provide a live stream of it. Maybe that'll be the compromise

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.160
Maybe I can certainly recall going to conferences and staying in my hotel room and watching the live stream

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.160
That sometimes is the better way to go

01:10:46.160 --> 01:11:14.480
And then still go out for drinks or whatever right you still get that you're still there. You know, you just
