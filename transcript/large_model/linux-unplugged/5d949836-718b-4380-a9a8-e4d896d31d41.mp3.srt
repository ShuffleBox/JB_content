1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So I wasn't even going to share this with you guys.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,240
I'd seen this on the web, and we were

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,320
talking about pre-show material.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,600
But the most interesting part about this new TCP bug

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,240
is the fact that Netflix discovered it.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,280
Yeah, I wasn't really too into it, except for that part.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,640
That is kind of, I guess I'm just sort of getting exhausted

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,400
on these.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,180
But it's sort of like a new version of The Ping of Death.

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:26,760
Yeah, kind of.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,240
I mean, you get some misconfigured TCP packets sent

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,840
your way, and in just the right case on an unpatched kernel,

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,240
well, you might actually have a full blown kernel panic.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,120
So those are always unfortunate.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
Obviously, that can lead to a denial of service attack

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,000
when all your boxes are crashed.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,240
Yeah, and that's not great.

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,000
I think the impact has been a bit lessened

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,760
because most serious boxes in production out there

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
are behind various types of load balancers or other gateways.

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,000
And many of those, typically this is not a protocol flaw.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,760
This is a flaw in Linux's implementation of the TCP stack.

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,520
And FreeBSD is also affected.

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,160
There's several other variants that aren't panics.

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,080
They're just slowdowns.

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,280
Did you guys catch its name?

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,000
Sack Panic.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
Sack Panic.

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,640
I like it.

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,440
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 306 for June 18, 2019.

31
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:28,520
Hello there, and welcome to Linux Unplugged,

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,000
your weekly Linux talk show that's getting its way

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,320
into the 300s.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,520
Feels weird, Wes.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,440
It sure does.

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,240
Feels weird.

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,280
Like, this show can't be 300 episodes long.

38
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,240
We're just hanging out.

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,720
We must be doing something right.

40
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,760
I don't know about that.

41
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,040
Or very, very wrong.

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,240
We're just very persistent.

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,480
We're just very persistent.

44
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,160
Well, coming up on this week's episode,

45
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,440
we have some community news.

46
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,160
But we decided to do something you should never do this week.

47
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,680
We decided to live swap out a FreeNAS

48
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,400
system to Fedora, which we're calling

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,080
from FreeNAS to Fedora our journey of live swapping

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,720
a production system with a failed disk.

51
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,400
We went out into the Jupyter broadcasting server room,

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,240
brought our recording equipment, and documented our journey.

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,440
Not only that, we changed the whole darn network

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,240
here at the studio.

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,000
It's amazing we're here at all.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,120
Yeah, we really did.

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,080
We ripped out the whole network, re-IPed everything,

58
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,320
and still managed to put a show together.

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,760
We actually had a lot of fun doing it.

60
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,520
We'll tell you about that in a little bit.

61
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,680
But before we go any further, got to say hello to Cheesy.

62
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,320
Hey, Chees.

63
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Hey, what's going on?

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,320
Oh, you know, doing a podcast, hanging out.

65
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,680
Yeah, you guys have been hard at work

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,960
with that stuff for the last couple of days, too.

67
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,080
Yep, we got everything back up and on just in time

68
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
to say time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,840
Hello, Mumble Room.

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,400
Good morning.

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,900
Hello.

72
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,400
Hello.

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,440
Good morning.

74
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:44,940
Hello.

75
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,440
Hello.

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,200
Hello, Brent, and Bruce, and Byte, and Neil, and MiniMech,

77
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,240
and Sean, and TechMav.

78
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,120
It's nice to have you all there as we go along.

79
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,120
And we start out with some community news.

80
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,040
And the big item that caught my attention,

81
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
there's many things we could talk about.

82
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,600
This has been another one of those weeks

83
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
where it's sort of like what we didn't put in the show

84
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
is almost as important as what we put in the show.

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,880
And I just thought, let's start with talking

86
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,360
about initial benchmarks of Microsoft's new WSL 2.

87
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,960
We're already starting to see it shipped

88
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,960
for the people that are subscribed to the Insiders

89
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,040
build if you really want to play with it.

90
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Yeah.

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,600
And under some benchmarks, this is, of course,

92
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,560
according to Michael Eberle over at Ferronix,

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,000
he's been testing the subsystem.

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,160
And in not all instances is it actually faster.

95
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,760
It is in some, like with I-O.

96
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,240
Yeah, right.

97
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,840
So it has improved I-O. And that was

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,960
one of the big justifications for this whole re-architecture

99
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
of the subsystem.

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,900
It just wasn't cutting it before.

101
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,920
But unfortunately, in some other areas, we're not so lucky.

102
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,720
Yeah, looking at the benchmarks here,

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,920
there is certain kinds of workloads

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,840
where it's significantly even slower than WSL 1

105
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,480
and obviously slower than bare metal.

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,700
He compared it to 1804 bare metal and clear Linux bare metal.

107
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,580
And all of the benchmarks, as he always has,

108
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,640
are linked over on his site if you want to check them out.

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
I think it just means it's not the Linux killer

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,520
that everybody worries about.

111
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,880
It's just a practical tool to get your work done.

112
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,680
And there are already some interesting use cases for it,

113
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,960
Docker just posted a massive write-up

114
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,440
that we read so you don't have to.

115
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,980
And they write, Microsoft gave us an early build of the WSL 2

116
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,220
so that we could evaluate the technology

117
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,820
and see how it fit with our product.

118
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,400
And then we could give them our feedback about what's missing

119
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,360
or even broken.

120
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
We started prototyping different approaches.

121
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,080
And we're now ready to share a little bit

122
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
about what's coming in the next few months.

123
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,400
Docker Desktop Future.

124
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,240
Yeah, that's the title of this section.

125
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,260
OK, so before they had a Hyper-V based VM,

126
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,560
and that's going to be replaced by what they're calling

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,520
a WSL 2 integration package.

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,560
Which is still based on Hyper-V VM,

129
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,720
but it's like a different, more optimized new version.

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,360
Yeah, exactly.

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,860
So it provides all the same features

132
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,720
as the current Docker desktop VM.

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,420
So you can do Kubernetes, you can do proxy configuration,

134
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,640
you can access the Docker daemon from Windows,

135
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,120
and all sorts of bind mounts, all the usual Docker

136
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,020
sort of stuff.

137
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,280
In the past, that was it.

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,800
You couldn't really mess with the underlying VM.

139
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
You couldn't run additional stuff in the Linux OS

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
that was running inside of it.

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,320
With the WSL 2 integration, you'll

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,800
still experience all the niceties you have from Windows.

143
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
But you can run additional Linux programs inside,

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,740
and they can also talk to Docker.

145
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,160
So you can have the same Docker API running from a daemon,

146
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,240
running on a Hyper-V VM, using WSL 2, all unified together.

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,600
And they write, and a good example, a use case for this

148
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,000
is, a lot of your scripts that you've written on the Linux

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,400
side can just now be used, or on the Windows side

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
can be used to manage the Linux boxes, vice versa.

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
They also have a nice example of using Visual Studio Code

152
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
with that remote connector setup.

153
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,480
So you can go remote into WSL 2, and then use the Docker daemon

154
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,600
inside, build Docker containers, run them,

155
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,560
and then still manage it all from Windows.

156
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,600
That's nice and tidy for those Windows developers that never

157
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,780
want to be bothered with dirtying themselves,

158
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,040
actually installing real Linux.

159
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,200
Now they can use the days of having to manually configure

160
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,080
VirtualBox with NFS shares over the net.

161
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,320
Now they'll just use a Visual Studio Code remote to WSL.

162
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,960
Then package all up in a Docker container.

163
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,480
Good to go.

164
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,320
Microsoft loves Linux, don't you, though?

165
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,040
Good to go.

166
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,560
Good to go.

167
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,080
Never had to actually touch real Linux at all.

168
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,200
That's crazy.

169
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,840
It hurts so much.

170
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,880
I don't know.

171
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,480
I don't know.

172
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,920
It's all about making Linux a bit of a runtime.

173
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
I'm all for it.

174
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
So while we're talking about Docker containers

175
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,220
and universally running applications,

176
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,040
just a quick update from our friends at Canonical

177
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,480
that work on snaps.

178
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,000
First of all, they have new distro-branded landing pages.

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,480
So that way, if you're on Mint, or you're on Arch, or Fedora,

180
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,740
whatever it might be, they'll now

181
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,120
have specific instructions on how

182
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,720
to get up and going with some copy pasta

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
if you choose, which looks pretty nice, pretty simple.

184
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,200
I thought it was a little strange to me

185
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
the way they sort of branched it out per package, you know?

186
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,700
Yeah.

187
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,040
Because most of the time, there's

188
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,000
not that much different, right?

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,920
You kind of, once you've got everything bootstrapped.

190
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,000
Now I get it when you want to land,

191
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,680
like maybe you're trying to install your first snap,

192
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,800
and so everything's there, right there on that page

193
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,080
for the application that brought you there.

194
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,560
True.

195
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,920
But it just kind of felt weird.

196
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
It's like, well, how do you install that?

197
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,440
Like, don't I just use the snap command line wherever I am?

198
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,940
Yeah.

199
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,320
Yeah, once you've got that part done, yeah, you're right.

200
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,280
We'll have to ask.

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,760
Maybe there's somebody who might know.

202
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
Maybe we'll have to ask him.

203
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
Now, while we're talking about snaps,

204
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,600
there's another part to the story

205
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,320
that I think is a good heads up for those of you that

206
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,200
are Ubuntu desktop users.

207
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,880
In 1910 right now, in testing, they're

208
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,660
calling for some feedback on shipping the Chromium browser

209
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,420
as a snap.

210
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,440
They're transitioning from a deb to a snap for the browser.

211
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,320
And they're working on migrating your profile,

212
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,100
the Chrome driver stuff, so that way

213
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,480
they can have video acceleration.

214
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,040
There's several elements to this that

215
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
need to be banged on by end users,

216
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,840
including just general desktop browser integration.

217
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,640
Sounds great, though.

218
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,240
I mean, I think it's a good fit.

219
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,960
You think so?

220
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,200
I mean, I already run, like when I run Firefox,

221
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,320
I install it manually under my home directory.

222
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
Browsers move fast.

223
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,040
Yeah.

224
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,600
Plus, sandboxing is not a bad idea.

225
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
The browser is a dangerous environment.

226
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
Chrome already has its own sandboxing.

227
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,560
It does.

228
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,280
But you're right.

229
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,760
I do agree that the browser is a good candidate for software

230
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,800
that you can update sort of independently

231
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,080
from the operating system.

232
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,780
And when you look at like an LTS,

233
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,360
it makes even more sense potentially.

234
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,240
And they don't have that many capabilities, right?

235
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,920
Like they don't need to reach super far into your file system

236
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,880
and go crazy places.

237
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,840
So I think it would mesh well with the abilities

238
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,360
that SnapD already has to give access when needed.

239
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,520
Here's what we've got to do.

240
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:29,920
You know what we've got to do?

241
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,720
We've got to phone a friend, like millionaire style

242
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,560
right now.

243
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,640
We'll call up a friend who might know about Snap packages,

244
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
and we'll ask Wes's question.

245
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,120
So, Popey, are you there?

246
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,960
Oh, hello.

247
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,760
Hi.

248
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,400
Go ahead, Wes.

249
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
You have 20 seconds.

250
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,240
What was the motivation between the structure

251
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,480
of the distro-specific pages on the Snap,

252
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,720
not one per OS at the top level, but for every package?

253
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,240
Very good.

254
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,200
You got it.

255
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,280
Because the goal is that a normal person who's

256
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,680
looking to install Spotify doesn't

257
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,000
want to know lots of stuff.

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,520
They want to know, how do I get Spotify on the distro

259
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,360
that I'm on?

260
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,360
And the focus for those pages is tell them

261
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,280
exactly what they need to know to get

262
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,840
that application on the distro that they've chosen,

263
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,920
and nothing more.

264
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,240
Maybe a little bit extra if they scroll down the bottom.

265
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,440
But the distro-specific stuff is really

266
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,720
catering to those people who like

267
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,320
to follow blog posts that say, how to do this one thing?

268
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,200
And it tells them how to do that one thing,

269
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
and then they get out of there.

270
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,360
That's all self-contained.

271
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,120
So the first experience they land on, they got everything.

272
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,320
That makes sense.

273
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,080
Mr. Wimper, it's nice to see you here this evening.

274
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,600
Hello, sir.

275
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,120
Good evening.

276
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,680
Hi, Wimpy.

277
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,640
How are you?

278
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,480
Very well.

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,080
Surprisingly, still jet lagged.

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,360
But other than that, fine.

281
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm not surprised.

282
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,480
With as much traveling as you've done,

283
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,800
it's got to catch up.

284
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Eventually, it's going to catch up to you, right?

285
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,920
Yeah.

286
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,760
This is the week it catches up, apparently.

287
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,720
So the Atari VCS is going on sale for pre-order right now

288
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
for $250.

289
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,800
It's going to be a AMD Ryzen R1000 SoC design.

290
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
And this is coming out of details at E3 this week.

291
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,640
What do we think, Wimpy?

292
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,160
Are you skeptical of this box?

293
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,320
Or is it not a waste of my IndieGoGo money?

294
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm very skeptical.

295
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm sorry you've wasted your money.

296
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,920
You think so?

297
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm kind of excited it's going to be a Ryzen box, because I'm

298
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,680
such a fanboy these days.

299
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,600
Yeah.

300
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,760
Is this past due yet?

301
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,960
Is it on time, or is it delayed?

302
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,120
It is delayed, yes.

303
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
It was delayed.

304
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,440
They delayed it a little bit ago because they

305
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,200
said they're going to move to the AMD A1 CPU and a Ryzen

306
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,760
processor.

307
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,880
And so that added delay to the process.

308
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,520
But that seems like it might be worth it.

309
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Yeah, I don't know.

310
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,440
It seems like a lot of money for what it is.

311
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Yeah, yeah.

312
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,980
Well, $250 isn't bad for the base price.

313
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,800
But to get something good that'll do 4K or something

314
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
like that, you start getting close to $800.

315
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,360
Plus, you get the look of the thing.

316
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,280
Ooh, black walnut.

317
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,040
Yeah, that's true.

318
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,080
It's got that nice retro look.

319
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,240
I do kind of like it.

320
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,920
Well, I just wanted to give everybody

321
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,980
an update that they are now taking pre-orders,

322
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,020
and they're talking about it at E3.

323
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,520
And they're saying, well, they're not really

324
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,280
saying specifically when it's going to ship,

325
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,340
but it looks like it will be this year.

326
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,000
If they're taking pre-orders, does that

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,520
mean they're fulfilling backers' pledges at the moment?

328
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,240
That's a great question, Wimpy.

329
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
That's a great question.

330
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,400
Ponzi.

331
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,440
Wow.

332
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,160
Wow.

333
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
Have they shown any footage of any of the games

334
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,560
on the console yet?

335
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,720
There may be some from E3.

336
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,760
I haven't really gone spelunking.

337
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,280
Poby, I'm curious.

338
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,320
If you were going to bet on one, the Librem 5 or the Atari VCS,

339
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,240
you had to pick one.

340
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Which one would you put your money on right now?

341
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,760
Oh, man.

342
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,280
Atari VCS.

343
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,720
Why would you do that to me?

344
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,320
Well, so the price point of the Atari VCS

345
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,360
is not remotely attractive to me.

346
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,640
I think I could probably go and dig

347
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,440
in the deserts of California and find

348
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,680
all the necessary Atari VCS cartridges

349
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,080
I want to for less than $250.

350
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,600
But I'd say the Atari VCS.

351
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,160
All right.

352
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
What about you, Wes?

353
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,040
I got to agree.

354
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,720
I mean.

355
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,680
OK.

356
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,960
All right, well, obviously I've put my money on the VCS.

357
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,760
It just seems like an easier target to hit.

358
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,280
Yeah.

359
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,800
Yeah.

360
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
Plus, you can load other OSes on there,

361
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,200
including they even say Windows now.

362
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,000
And if I could put Kodi on there,

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
it's only a little bit more than I paid for the Nvidia Shield.

364
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
So it's not great.

365
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
We'll see.

366
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,160
Do you still use your Nvidia Shield?

367
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,880
The heck out of it.

368
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Yeah, I have two of them.

369
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,840
Still use them every day.

370
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,920
Oh, I have three of them.

371
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,340
Have you hooked up Steam?

372
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,480
I have done the GeForce streaming,

373
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
but I have not done any Steam streaming.

374
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,520
What's that like?

375
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,400
So this weekend, because I've only ever played the Android

376
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,040
games, because that's all my daughter's been interested in.

377
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,080
But I was going to go back and relook at GeForce now.

378
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,760
And then I noticed that a bunch of the games you see in there

379
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,640
all have Steam written underneath.

380
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,520
And the very first time you click on that,

381
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,960
it stands up a Steam on Windows install on their grid

382
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,560
computing platform.

383
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,240
And you sign in with your Steam credentials,

384
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,120
and it then installs the game that you've just selected.

385
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,360
And you run that over the Shield.

386
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,280
So that has become my new most favorite thing.

387
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,080
That's incredible.

388
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,040
And how would you say the performance and latency

389
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,960
and responsiveness and all that is?

390
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,560
Well, I'm fortunate in that I've got

391
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,280
a reasonable amount of bandwidth.

392
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,680
And I've always been impressed by the lack of apparent latency

393
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,360
that exists on the Shield over that whole GeForce

394
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,600
now streaming solution.

395
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,920
So for me, it's great.

396
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,640
I mean, the screen I have in the front room is very old.

397
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,120
So it's a 720p screen.

398
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
So it's not very high resolution.

399
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
And for that resolution, it's fantastic.

400
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,200
It's a lot of fun.

401
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll have to look into that.

402
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,040
That sounds really neat.

403
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,920
Are you streaming that over wired or wireless connection?

404
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,560
Wired.

405
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,880
So in the front room, that's got a direct line

406
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,640
to the router, which is in the same room.

407
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,480
And then that goes out over the fiber.

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,440
Good setup.

409
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,200
Yeah, I have the one in the studio living room wired too

410
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,160
for that very reason.

411
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,960
Who needs a stadium when you've already got that set up?

412
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,800
No kidding.

413
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,320
No kidding.

414
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,040
I've pre-ordered Stadia as well though.

415
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,880
Yeah, did you?

416
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,920
Did you do the founders?

417
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,420
Yep.

418
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,040
Yeah.

419
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
I did it as well because first, I

420
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
want to be able to talk about it here on the show, number one.

421
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
But number two is it could give me

422
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,320
the ability to run a fully open source stack and have gaming.

423
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,920
All Intel graphics, for example, but still have gaming.

424
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,640
Yeah, absolutely.

425
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,440
And if that makes my workstation more stable,

426
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,160
I'd actually pay a monthly fee for that.

427
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, I've been impressed with what

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,960
the Shield has been able to offer me.

429
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,160
And I was interested to see, well,

430
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,080
what can Google do in this space?

431
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm not buying into the platform necessarily,

432
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,400
but the only way I'll know for sure is by finding out.

433
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,560
And so I've pre-ordered, and I should

434
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
be looking forward to trying it out later in the year.

435
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, if it sucks, I'll say it.

436
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
So I don't have any reason to.

437
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,900
Absolutely.

438
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,840
I don't have any reason to.

439
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,040
Nope.

440
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,440
Yeah.

441
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,520
No, I'm just going to try it out.

442
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,020
And it does seem like if anybody would

443
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,240
need the technological background

444
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
and infrastructure to pull this off,

445
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,200
it would probably be Google.

446
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,720
They've got the scale.

447
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,480
And they've got motivation too.

448
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,080
So let's talk about something that I'd say

449
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,080
was probably the number one submitted, quote, unquote,

450
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,280
story to the show this week.

451
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,360
People are like, hey, did you see this Chris Christie?

452
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,560
And I appreciate that.

453
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,320
I actually kind of like to know what people are tracking.

454
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,880
And this was Linus Tech Tips' video on the System76 Thalia,

455
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,520
which they titled, A Really Weird PC,

456
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,640
The System76 Thalia Review.

457
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,720
It is currently, as we record this episode,

458
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,960
trending at number 44 on all of YouTube.

459
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,200
It has over a million views.

460
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,840
That's a big deal.

461
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,080
That sort of makes Emma's weight in customs

462
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,400
when she was hand delivering this.

463
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,520
That was quite a journey for her.

464
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,480
Yeah, she told that story on the show if you've missed it.

465
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,840
She's been out.

466
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,760
Rumor has it she got hurt.

467
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,120
We'll have to talk to her about that when she comes back.

468
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,880
We miss you Emma, we miss you.

469
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,640
Now let's talk about their review.

470
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,040
So Linus Tech Tips, we'll link to the entire video.

471
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,980
It's an 11 minute video.

472
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,040
We're just gonna play a couple of clips for you.

473
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,600
And it starts with the unboxing as many YouTube videos do.

474
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,960
So let's take a closer look at the box.

475
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,660
Once you get it out of the shockingly nerdy packaging,

476
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,920
the most striking features of the Thalia

477
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,560
are its wood green finish

478
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,300
and it's tantalizing silver power button

479
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,320
and accompanying white LED ring.

480
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,360
There's no sign of any front IO

481
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,240
to disrupt the clean design language they've gone with,

482
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,320
which means it's beautiful,

483
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,900
but also means unfortunately that we're stuck

484
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,680
with what we've got on the rear.

485
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,720
And back here is interesting.

486
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,120
So more of that clean at any cost approach.

487
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,760
The IO is cut directly out of the chassis.

488
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,780
That means no simple motherboard upgrade.

489
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,520
Although again, it does make for an uninterrupted

490
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,640
premium look that really screams Apple.

491
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,000
Even though when we pop the hood with these thumb screws,

492
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,600
we can see that this is clearly

493
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,480
a standard PC motherboard on the inside.

494
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
That power button is very legit.

495
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,300
It's just great.

496
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,800
Yeah, I want to push it right now.

497
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,640
I have a fun story.

498
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,680
So when we went and toured the factory,

499
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,160
I didn't say anything and nobody prompted me.

500
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,560
I just walked up and I started pushing the power button

501
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,800
of the demo unit that was unplugged.

502
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,760
So it was, you know, it wasn't hurting it.

503
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,960
And I just had this, I made this very satisfying, like nice.

504
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,560
And Carl, you know, the CEO, he was listening.

505
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,720
He was perched, wanted to see my reaction

506
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,040
because that power button is a particular point of pride

507
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,880
for them.

508
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,400
And so I liked that they honed in on that.

509
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,560
They do mention that the back plate is fixed,

510
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,960
although I think a motivated person

511
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,520
probably cut it open, but that's, you know, overall,

512
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,240
like it starts like kind of positive.

513
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,520
You're like, wow, this is pretty balanced so far.

514
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,000
As a non Linux user,

515
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,080
I want to poke around Pop OS a little bit.

516
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,880
Oh, now here we go to Pop OS.

517
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,320
How are they going to do this?

518
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,520
You first boot, it is super easy to encrypt your data.

519
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,860
Just enter a password and reboot.

520
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,440
That is pretty neat.

521
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
Then when you come back,

522
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,160
you're given the opportunity to set up your online accounts

523
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,880
for integration into the OS,

524
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,560
including access to your Google Drive cloud storage

525
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,800
right in the file manager.

526
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,960
Now we've actually seen Pop OS before

527
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,240
in our gaming on Linux update video.

528
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,280
And they continue,

529
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,600
and then we're gonna talk a little more about Pop OS,

530
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,680
but they continue.

531
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,920
One of its major departures from its parent Ubuntu

532
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,440
is Pop Shop, a ridiculously easy to use app store.

533
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,280
So it's actually ported over from elementary OS,

534
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,760
but with one key value add.

535
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,260
System 76 curates their own packages.

536
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,680
So if you ever need something basic,

537
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,480
like Steam for gaming or the latest Nvidia drivers,

538
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,040
it's just a click away.

539
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,080
Actually, for your graphics drivers,

540
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,840
it's easier than updating them on Windows.

541
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,920
Now, a couple of things strike me about this video,

542
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,200
because there's even more talking about Pop OS,

543
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,920
is Pop OS isn't going anywhere.

544
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,440
It's not going away.

545
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
It's here now for the long haul.

546
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,760
And I'm curious to hear what your reaction, Poby,

547
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,680
that is to that comparison of the parent operating system,

548
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,520
I believe as they put it, right?

549
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,400
The parent project or something like that.

550
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,740
What's your reaction?

551
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,060
I don't know what to say.

552
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,880
I mean, every derivative of Ubuntu,

553
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
which Pop OS is, has something that stands themselves apart

554
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,120
from Ubuntu.

555
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,360
Otherwise, there will be no point installing it, right?

556
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,240
And so their USP for Pop OS is the design language

557
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,600
they've used on the desktop

558
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,840
and simplicity of installing applications.

559
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,120
And we can learn from that.

560
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,920
And certainly you'll have noticed very recently,

561
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,140
we've talked about how it will be integrating

562
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,860
the Nvidia driver installer directly during the install.

563
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,840
So we've certainly learned

564
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,360
that that's a thing people really, really want,

565
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,640
and we should probably do that.

566
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,840
So, you know, we've learned something there.

567
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,000
That's great.

568
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,680
Wimby, when I heard that,

569
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,780
when they were talking specifically about the Pop Shop,

570
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,680
the thing that crossed my mind is,

571
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,000
I wonder what their reaction would be

572
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,280
to something like the software boutique

573
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,160
that Ubuntu MATE has that comes up

574
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,060
and has an extensive list of curated software.

575
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
What are your thoughts when you hear that?

576
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,880
It seems like you guys really hit on something

577
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,120
pretty important to users a while ago now.

578
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,200
Yeah, I'm really proud of what we did

579
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,520
with the software boutique.

580
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,640
I think we switched things up a little bit,

581
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,140
but I'm not sure what someone like Linux Tech Tips

582
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,840
would make of that,

583
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,400
because they're kind of accustomed to it, right?

584
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,660
If you go into any of the stores,

585
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,400
you have a full catalog of software in front of you.

586
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,160
You know, that's not been a problem.

587
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,880
In recent years, you know, you've got the Windows Store,

588
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,800
you've got the Mac OS Store,

589
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,240
you've got the equivalents on mobile.

590
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,360
It's novel to us on Linux

591
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,200
because we didn't used to have that ease of installation,

592
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,280
and we do now.

593
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,640
So I don't know how much that would resonate really.

594
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,740
Okay, fair enough actually, good point.

595
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,960
I suppose it is sort of become just expected.

596
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,560
You'd notice it more if it wasn't there.

597
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,640
Yeah, maybe.

598
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,080
I still really appreciate it.

599
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,560
They did touch on the open nature of the hardware as well.

600
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,560
The case and all of its accompanying bits and pieces,

601
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,400
open source, just like the operating system.

602
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,240
So there's literally a GitHub page

603
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,000
with the CAD files for everything that you see here,

604
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,720
and for its bigger brothers,

605
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,300
the Thelio Major and Thelio Massive.

606
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,560
But what impresses me overall about their entire coverage

607
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,040
is, again, it's really well shot,

608
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,960
it's really well written,

609
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,560
you should watch the entire video,

610
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,880
but they seem fairly balanced.

611
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,160
They also point out, you know,

612
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,700
the entire thing is an open source.

613
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,560
Now, that's not to say that every component

614
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,340
in the system is open source.

615
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,980
The motherboard, CPU, RAM, video card, storage devices,

616
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,180
and power supply are all proprietary in design

617
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,600
with the IP owned by the individual companies

618
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,440
that made them.

619
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,680
As it is, I mean, that's just how it works.

620
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,140
System76 will open a source as much as they can.

621
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,920
And they touched on something

622
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,480
that we've been trying to figure out internally,

623
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,240
because Wes is co-host on Coda Radio,

624
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,320
Michael Dominic picked up a Thelio station,

625
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,400
and was unable to use it for podcasting

626
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,240
because of fan noise.

627
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,060
And it's something-

628
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,900
We noticed it right away.

629
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,220
He's been experimenting with,

630
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,080
and they may have come onto something that Linus Tech Tips.

631
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,320
What we can also see in here

632
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,680
is they've done a pretty bang up job

633
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,920
with the cable management,

634
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,400
helped significantly by the generous real estate

635
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,480
provided under the main fascia,

636
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,940
which doesn't attempt to seal the computer

637
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,340
so much as it conceals.

638
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,400
There is a bit of concern from our end

639
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,080
about dust accumulation through the side panels

640
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,920
and the potential for noise to sneak out

641
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,760
from under the chassis using the air gap as an echo chamber.

642
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,640
Unfortunately, sure enough,

643
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,220
it does get a little loud

644
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,040
when the fans are running full tilt,

645
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,280
and it's not just whooshing air noise,

646
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,520
something that we generally don't complain about.

647
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,400
Rather, it's a kind of droning whine

648
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,160
that's a little bit harder to tune out.

649
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,560
Honestly, I think a Noctua or a Be Quiet fan swap

650
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
would help tremendously here.

651
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,360
That's a particularly challenging problem, though,

652
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,280
if that is just down to the case design,

653
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,640
if it's kind of making sound channels on the side,

654
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
because it's such a gorgeous case.

655
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,200
It's gonna take them a while to iterate on that.

656
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,560
So that could be why they've struggled

657
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,880
to have a super great response to the fan noise issue,

658
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
in my opinion, that's of course just my opinion.

659
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,040
Yeah, it is so pretty, it'd be such a shame

660
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,840
to have to go stick it in the closet somewhere

661
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,280
and not get to admire it on your desk.

662
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,020
Yeah, and so they also get to the price,

663
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,120
because you could build yourself a cheaper system,

664
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,640
or you could go buy a mass produced system that's cheaper,

665
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
and I think they did a decent job on honing in

666
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,400
on what kind of makes them special.

667
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,040
While the operating system itself may be free,

668
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,640
System76 does have paid staff

669
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,840
that actively develop their OS,

670
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,520
and that's to say nothing of the user support commitments

671
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,120
that come along with that.

672
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,640
Perhaps most crucially, though,

673
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,920
the Thelio chassis manufacturer and final assembly

674
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,640
are both done in Colorado by a team that's about our size,

675
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,800
so no mass production.

676
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,840
System76 says they want to improve

677
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,460
the situation in the future,

678
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,760
but for now, it means that the costs add up really quickly.

679
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,000
The team that's about our size,

680
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,800
which is kind of, that's poignant.

681
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,600
And then last but not least, they wrap it up.

682
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,480
You're paying for the case, US manufacturer,

683
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,960
operating system development,

684
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,920
and support from a small team of enthusiasts.

685
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,400
Now, whether the design and concept

686
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,240
of a well-integrated Linux desktop

687
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,120
is enough to make you pay the extra,

688
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,940
that's a choice I'll leave to you.

689
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,700
But overall, we think it's really cool

690
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,760
and a huge step in the right direction.

691
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,760
It's pretty good coverage for System76,

692
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,440
and it's good coverage for Pop!OS, too.

693
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,600
So we have ourselves another major desktop container.

694
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,440
I mean, they'll get there.

695
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,860
They're not there yet, but they're gonna get there.

696
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,100
It does make me feel a little bit better

697
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,440
about Mike's situation,

698
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,280
because he was having a heck of a time trying to fix it.

699
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,480
It's nice to know, you know,

700
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,080
it's unfortunately a common problem.

701
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,200
Maybe run it with the case off.

702
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
I don't know.

703
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,240
But good for them.

704
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,320
But weren't they also raving about Pop!OS

705
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
in one of their videos just recently,

706
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,520
where they were talking about gaming and stuff?

707
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,800
Yeah, it's a lot of coverage for Pop!OS.

708
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,760
And I appreciate it.

709
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,700
I think I initially was very, very critical of Pop!OS.

710
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,100
I still, I would love, what I would love,

711
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,100
is if Pop!OS was just a series of scripts or repositories

712
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,000
that you would add to a vanilla install of Ubuntu

713
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,040
that would make it pop,

714
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,600
and that would add a couple of things or whatever.

715
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
I feel like we already have too many distros,

716
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,080
but of course, you know what, I'm an old fart.

717
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,260
So of course I feel like that,

718
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,920
because I've seen, in my time,

719
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,160
I've seen so many distros come and go.

720
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,520
However, there is apparently

721
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,000
a pretty, an interested market in this distribution,

722
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,720
and I give them credit for cultivating that

723
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,680
and for adding some value to the OS,

724
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,700
like you hear people constantly talk about the install

725
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,680
or the encryption, the pop store,

726
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,240
the theme, these are all things that matter.

727
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,720
And credit to System76 for nailing those things.

728
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,800
And truth be told, they're just getting started, really.

729
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,340
So I feel, even though I started

730
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,520
fairly critical of the distribution,

731
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,360
and I still don't really see myself running anytime soon,

732
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,440
but I could, I could see myself in the future

733
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,280
if I went back to GNOME.

734
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,200
I'd probably give it a try.

735
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,640
It is interesting to see them actually,

736
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
I think there was some wonder

737
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,880
about how far they were gonna take this.

738
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,360
Was it gonna just be sort of glorified,

739
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,440
a few scripts on top, a custom theme?

740
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,420
But it seems like as they've had time

741
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,560
to develop it more out, they're actively working on it.

742
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,440
So it will be a long time project.

743
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,640
We're gonna see more updates,

744
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,320
and they're gonna continue to ship it.

745
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,200
She was stuck all day, Emma, in customs,

746
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,160
trying to get that machine to them.

747
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,880
She hand delivered that machine,

748
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,040
and then just had to walk away

749
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,120
and hope that the review went well.

750
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,320
And that was weeks ago, that was back during Linux Fest

751
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,160
that she did that.

752
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,040
She did that during Linux Fest and did that.

753
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,840
And now here we are quite a while later,

754
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,040
and that just got posted.

755
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,940
That kind of shows you their time window there,

756
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,960
but that's a lot of weeks of her sitting around wondering,

757
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,880
was it worth it?

758
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,280
Or did I just screw up?

759
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,120
And I think it was.

760
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,960
I think it was, yeah.

761
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,400
It's number 44 on all of YouTube right now.

762
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,880
That's a significant thing.

763
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,480
A tiny little Linux shop.

764
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,560
Yeah, I hope they get some sales out of it.

765
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,400
Absolutely.

766
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,640
All right, you know what we need to do?

767
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,680
We gotta do that housekeeping.

768
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,640
We gotta clean it up in here.

769
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,800
Yeah, we gotta clean up a little bit.

770
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,960
There's a few things to touch on this week.

771
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,960
First of all, first of all, I should mention,

772
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,500
we don't say this often enough,

773
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,880
but Linux Academy is hiring for remote positions right now,

774
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,360
including a Linux training architect,

775
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,000
a machine learning training architect,

776
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,160
a Python development training architect,

777
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,920
but also an Angular developer,

778
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,640
a full stack Node.js developer,

779
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,520
and Ruby on Rails developers,

780
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,680
multiple Ruby on Rails developers.

781
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,140
Those are full-time remote positions,

782
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,440
full benefits, everything.

783
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,960
There's also a position open in the lab platform.

784
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,040
There's a few things happening there

785
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,580
that are pretty interesting.

786
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,120
So if you haven't gone to linuxacademy.com

787
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,320
slash careers in a while,

788
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,480
I really suggest you do it

789
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,200
because there is some great positions open right now.

790
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,240
And I want to pass that along to you

791
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,120
because if you're in our audience,

792
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,080
you kind of have like a leg up in the process.

793
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,240
If you tell them I heard about it on Linux Unplugged,

794
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,920
that's gonna probably move you to the top of the stack.

795
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,740
Oh!

796
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
Yeah, that's a big deal

797
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,840
because that means you're actually interested in this stuff.

798
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,760
I want to also mention the Friday stream this week.

799
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,440
We played Who Wants to be a Millionaire?

800
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,800
It was Wes versus Ange.

801
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,640
I don't want to give it away, but it was tense.

802
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,840
She's a tough competition right there.

803
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,680
Tough competition.

804
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,240
Fridaystream.com slash seven.

805
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,080
It's a really good one.

806
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,280
That was a really fun one.

807
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,900
And then last but not least here in the old housekeeping,

808
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,360
we have a big batch of study group videos

809
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,020
that just got posted.

810
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:04,860
In the show notes,

811
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,720
I have a link to the playlist on YouTube.

812
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,020
This is Linux Permissions 101.

813
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,480
I think it is seven videos, I think, or six videos.

814
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,320
Yeah, we've got it down

815
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,460
to just sort of bite-sized components you can handle.

816
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,720
And it's really everything you've ever wanted to know

817
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,640
about Linux Permissions.

818
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,480
So nice.

819
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,040
It starts at the very basics and then works its way up.

820
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,700
And then by the end, you're doing really cool stuff

821
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,760
with ACLs and with UMass and set UIDs.

822
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,920
It's a good series of videos, six parts.

823
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,200
Each is consumable.

824
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,080
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

825
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
Just something we do to give back.

826
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,360
We have a lot of great opportunities.

827
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,460
We talk not only with training architects at Linux Academy,

828
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,280
but Elle is a networking machine.

829
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,400
And she goes out to events all the time.

830
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
And she meets people who are great presenters

831
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,200
who want to share their knowledge with our community,

832
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
their listeners often.

833
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,500
And so that's where a lot of this has come from,

834
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,140
is people that Elle has met.

835
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,080
She's our ambassador.

836
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,860
Yeah, she goes down, connects with these people,

837
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,800
and then brings them on to do a seminar or a webinar really.

838
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,480
And then we release it for free.

839
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,680
Because we're all about it.

840
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,600
We're all about it.

841
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,320
So check that out.

842
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,680
We'll have a link, linuxunplug.com slash, what is this, 306?

843
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,600
306.

844
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,160
linuxunplug.com slash 306.

845
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,360
All right, Mr. Payne, that abbreviated housekeeping

846
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,200
this week.

847
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,120
So we're going to talk about something you should never do.

848
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,800
Don't do it.

849
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
We just wanted to have something that

850
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,840
was more familiar to us.

851
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,280
We had a problem to solve.

852
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:33,200
And truthfully, we felt a little inadequate with the BSD.

853
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,840
And we had work to get done.

854
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,520
So Wes and I headed out to the Jupyter broadcasting server

855
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,080
room.

856
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,960
We're out here in the studio server room, AKA the garage,

857
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,120
to do something that you should never do.

858
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,000
Don't do what we're about to do.

859
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,920
We're going to take our perfectly functional, totally

860
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,520
fine, FreeNAS server, and we're going

861
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,520
to rip out the FreeNAS part and put Fedora 30 server in.

862
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,160
Yeah, you heard that right, Fedora 30.

863
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,280
Then we're going to try to import ZFS pools that Alan

864
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,680
created under FreeNAS into Fedora

865
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,680
after we get the ZFS support installed.

866
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,920
I know this sounds ridiculous.

867
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,480
Non-standard, maybe?

868
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,120
There's a couple of motivating factors, if you will.

869
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,160
Number one, this is a killer super micro server

870
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,760
with two six-core Xeon processors and 64 gigs of RAM.

871
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,920
And it's just sitting here doing nothing but FreeNAS.

872
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,400
Right.

873
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
Right now, it's just storage.

874
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
And I mean, that's great and arguably probably

875
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,680
the way you should do it.

876
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,800
But why are we going to let this server go to waste?

877
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,440
It's just if you're using that much power

878
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
and you've got to make all this noise, let's put it to work.

879
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,920
So there is one other consideration.

880
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,920
We've also run into an issue where a couple of times

881
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,960
we need to do some repairs.

882
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,080
And Wes and I are just not FreeBSD guys.

883
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,000
Surprise, surprise.

884
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,280
We're Linux guys.

885
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,640
And so we have a disk issue.

886
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,040
We need to swap out a disk and get a new disk online.

887
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,400
And quite frankly, we're just more comfortable

888
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,760
with the Linux command line.

889
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,720
And I think this is actually kind of an important thing.

890
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,360
When you put something in production,

891
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,440
you need to know how to use it, not maybe be so dependent

892
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,320
on, say, Alan Jude.

893
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
All right, we're rebooting.

894
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,000
We've just maybe completed installation.

895
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,960
Yeah, you're going to pop out the thumb drive.

896
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,200
So we use the Fedora server image, which is pretty nice.

897
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,240
Network install.

898
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,120
Yeah, the net install server image.

899
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,480
So it pulls down the packages from the repository

900
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,080
and gives you some options.

901
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,840
In fact, it might be the way I install Fedora from now on.

902
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,480
I mean, honestly, what?

903
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,920
That took all of 15 minutes once we got it set up and going?

904
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,120
It was a tiny image, well, 600 megabytes.

905
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,480
And then you could choose all of the desktops

906
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,400
if you want, from Zubuntu to Cinnamon,

907
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
or just the minimal installs.

908
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,120
It gives you an option.

909
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,560
And then it's off to the races.

910
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,340
So we'll boot up.

911
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,000
And then I think mission one is make sure our Fedora install

912
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,520
is sane and then get ZFS support installed.

913
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,080
And then we've got to go see about importing this pool.

914
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,520
All right, well, it's our first boot.

915
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,840
We'll be back in a moment.

916
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,800
I don't know why, but I just haven't

917
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,560
used a net install version of a distro ISO in, like, 10 years.

918
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,760
I mean, it just feels like it's been forever.

919
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,640
That's the only way I'm doing it from now on.

920
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,400
Seriously, it was so great.

921
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,900
First of all, way quicker to download.

922
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,840
Oh, yeah, very nice.

923
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,000
And Anaconda has this screen that you don't normally

924
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,080
see when you get the live desktop version

925
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,480
or when you get a specific spin.

926
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,080
You don't see this screen that comes up.

927
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,920
And the screen that comes up is the choice

928
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,440
you can install any of the spins of the desktops

929
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,640
right there from Anaconda.

930
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,880
So you can use this as a base ISO for a Fedora server,

931
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,120
for a Fedora desktop.

932
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,360
Yeah, I think we were both pretty impressed.

933
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,240
It was a surprisingly smooth installation.

934
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,760
I was.

935
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,520
I'm not normally an Anaconda fan.

936
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,520
No, and I'm normally not impressed by Grub.

937
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,040
I was impressed at Grub.

938
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,920
So Grub just came up on the first boot.

939
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,660
And one of the things I immediately noticed

940
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,520
is we're already on kernel 5.1, which

941
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,240
does confirm that the net install pulls down

942
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,680
the latest packages.

943
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,600
That's also nice.

944
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,840
Fresh Linux.

945
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,360
And one of the sort of interesting little side

946
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,280
anecdotes about this setup is we're connected to.

947
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,840
It's kind of a rickety setup.

948
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,560
The keyboard is a old Mac mechanical keyboard

949
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,640
because it's just the only one I had laying around

950
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,160
that I'm not using.

951
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,960
It's actually not that bad.

952
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,400
No, it's not.

953
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,880
Certainly better than modern Mac keyboards.

954
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,840
It's just the control and alt and stuff

955
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,280
is a little different.

956
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,480
And then it's connected to the very first LCD screen

957
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,160
I ever bought back in like 2000, 2001,

958
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,760
which I've just held onto all this time.

959
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,740
But there we are.

960
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,440
And look at that.

961
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
It does say web console.

962
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,000
So this does.

963
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,040
Cockpit is already up and running.

964
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,920
All right, I'm going to give it a log in.

965
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,240
You ready?

966
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,040
All right.

967
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,720
Yeah, there we go.

968
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,360
We're in.

969
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,680
All right, well, let's root around.

970
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,360
Oh, look at all them disks.

971
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,440
So it does see the disk.

972
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:40,920
Yep, OK.

973
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, we're off to the races.

974
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,240
Good.

975
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,320
So now what we need to do is we need

976
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,240
to get kernel development packages installed.

977
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,760
And then we have to get the ZFS on Linux official GPG

978
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,720
key installed and the repository installed.

979
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,160
And then we can get this going.

980
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,440
So why don't we take a few minutes?

981
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,680
We'll do that, and then we'll come back.

982
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,600
I wasn't sure, like, would it be in this weird, funky state

983
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,120
because we had a bad disk.

984
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,960
I was sort of like, OK, great.

985
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,200
Yeah, we got Fedora installed.

986
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,480
Great.

987
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,620
Yeah, it can physically see the hard drives.

988
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,120
Who cares?

989
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,720
We've got to get ZFS working.

990
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,200
Well, it turns out we'll have links in the show notes.

991
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,640
That's pretty easy to do.

992
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,280
The ZFS on Linux upstream project

993
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,960
makes it all possible by putting a repo up,

994
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,280
by putting keys up, and then by putting documentation up

995
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,840
on how to do it.

996
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,440
No time at all.

997
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,920
Yeah, it was really, it was one of the fastest

998
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,380
parts of the whole setup was actually

999
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,760
getting ZFS working on Fedora.

1000
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,400
It was completely painless.

1001
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,360
But I wanted to know if we were going to actually

1002
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,200
be able to import that pool since it was created

1003
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,240
with an entirely different operating system using

1004
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,480
a entirely different fork, or at least much older fork,

1005
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,960
of ZFS.

1006
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,640
And of course, we had that degraded disk as well,

1007
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,840
or that dead disk.

1008
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,360
We had a degraded pool as well.

1009
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,920
We just got done installing all of the ZFS packages

1010
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,880
from the ZFS on Linux project.

1011
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,680
You've done the import command.

1012
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,280
How has it gone?

1013
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,220
What's happened?

1014
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,440
We've got our data.

1015
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,240
Now, there is one issue we're going

1016
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,200
to have to solve right off the bat, and that's

1017
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,760
setting the mount point because it's

1018
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,320
defaulting to just the name of the pool

1019
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,760
right under the root directory.

1020
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,880
Previously, it had been under mount.

1021
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,800
So we're going to have to tweak that a little bit

1022
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,300
as we set up the rest of the stuff,

1023
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,280
get things like NFS or SMB set up.

1024
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,040
But otherwise, I mean, it imported with no errors.

1025
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,600
That's pretty great.

1026
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,000
So we went from a up-to-date FreeNAS install

1027
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,800
and replaced that with Fedora 30 server, installed the ZFS

1028
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,480
modules, and we're just picking right up where we left off.

1029
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,120
One command in, and here we are.

1030
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
And I would imagine that, I don't know for sure,

1031
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,760
but I would figure that Fedora 30 could likely

1032
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,920
be using a newer version of ZFS since we just

1033
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,360
got the repository from the project directly.

1034
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,760
I bet you're right.

1035
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,640
And it's still fine.

1036
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,360
It still worked.

1037
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,040
Well, we'll solve that mount issue,

1038
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,640
and then it's just a matter of standing up all the services

1039
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,360
again.

1040
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,080
So there was, I guess, a polite way

1041
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,760
to say this is a unique heritage of this FreeNAS box.

1042
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,560
You have to appreciate some background

1043
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,280
before we continue here.

1044
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,040
Blessed soul Alan Jude was out for Linux Fest Northwest

1045
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,400
and, like a Canadian gentleman, went out there

1046
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,480
and completely set up this killer box.

1047
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,200
It's got two Intel Xeons that are six cores each that

1048
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,440
supports all of the virtualization stuff

1049
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,560
that you'd want.

1050
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,800
And then it's got, what, 13 disks in it maybe?

1051
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,600
Yeah, I think so.

1052
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,440
Something like that, a mix of different sizes,

1053
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,540
probably the smallest being six terabytes.

1054
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,080
And then it has 64 gigabytes of RAM, some contributed by Alan,

1055
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,480
some contributed by a TechSnap listener.

1056
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,280
And it's just this monster of a system

1057
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,920
we're not doing anything with.

1058
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,920
And I looked at this and I thought, gosh,

1059
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,120
if this was running Linux, I would be more comfortable

1060
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,040
with actually deploying containers on this thing

1061
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,920
and running other pieces of software on this.

1062
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,680
But when Alan set it up, he had set it up really

1063
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,880
to only ever be a back-end storage

1064
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,720
box with a fairly complicated ZFS layout.

1065
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,000
As you would imagine, he sub-volumed everything.

1066
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,080
And there's also kind of a funky, like, swap partition

1067
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,280
that went across all the disks for the FreeNAS itself.

1068
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,920
So there's, like, some weird space allocated to that.

1069
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,320
And then we had this mount issue.

1070
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,320
Yeah, I mean, we just had to get it configured.

1071
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,380
And FreeNAS had a sort of non-standard setup.

1072
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,680
And it had been a mix of Alan administering things

1073
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,480
on the FreeBSD command line and some of the FreeNAS defaults,

1074
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,120
especially because this had actually

1075
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,820
been a regular FreeNAS from IX Systems

1076
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,000
that we then ported over to this new box.

1077
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,520
So it was something of a hybrid monster.

1078
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,060
Yeah, it had gone from a FreeNAS mini

1079
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,920
into a super microchassis, which then Alan reconfigured it

1080
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,720
from there.

1081
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,640
And then we, from there, have converted it into a Fedora box.

1082
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,080
But in the process, we sort of redid some things

1083
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,480
to sort of align to how we kind of do things now,

1084
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,560
including how we sort of set up the way the disk is set up

1085
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,800
for the OS and whatnot.

1086
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
So we had to do some stuff, tweak some of the mount point

1087
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,480
settings and play with that.

1088
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,940
There was also one other gotcha that we ran into that took us

1089
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,720
a little bit to figure out.

1090
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,680
I'll tell you about that after this part, though.

1091
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,320
Fast forward a few more hours.

1092
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,800
We have a pretty happy Fedora server right now.

1093
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,200
And it's come down to the task of replacing that failed disk.

1094
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,480
This is actually what started the entire process.

1095
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,600
Yeah, this was the whole point.

1096
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,440
This is the reason we started mucking around

1097
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,000
with the FreeNAS system at all.

1098
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
I mean, formerly FreeNAS system, of course.

1099
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,080
Yeah, yeah.

1100
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,960
Now it's FakeNAS.

1101
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,720
That's what we're calling it.

1102
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,880
So what step are you about to take right now?

1103
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,960
All right, we've already removed and replaced physically

1104
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,600
the failed disk with our new replacement desk.

1105
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,200
And we've applied the same partitioning structure

1106
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,480
that was on the previous desk.

1107
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,240
Now we actually just need to replace it in the pool.

1108
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,360
Right now, it's configured in a mirror setup.

1109
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,040
So really, we're just going to put it in.

1110
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,720
And CFS gets to copy all the data from the one existing

1111
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,000
drive, and we will have two back in parity.

1112
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,600
All right, let's fire it off.

1113
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,840
This is the moment.

1114
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Oh, I love watching all the disk light up.

1115
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,400
That's my favorite part.

1116
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,920
It's like a Christmas tree.

1117
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,600
It's done.

1118
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,160
Well, at least it's returned us the command line.

1119
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,680
Resilver in progress.

1120
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,200
Ah.

1121
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,880
Isn't that great?

1122
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,560
I just love the ZFS management commands.

1123
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,840
ZPool status just shows you always

1124
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,320
exactly what you want to know.

1125
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,520
Yeah, you can see the state is currently unavailable,

1126
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,000
but it's working.

1127
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
It tells you what it was.

1128
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,520
And then I guess we'll have to go in

1129
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,440
and we'll have to pull that one that's labeled as degraded

1130
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,760
once we have this finished.

1131
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,400
No, this will do it.

1132
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,280
So that's going to replace it, and then it

1133
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,840
should be healthfully online as soon

1134
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,280
as that replacement's finished.

1135
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,220
Well, let's toss to future us and see what happened.

1136
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,940
Of course, this bad disk was the reason we even started.

1137
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,280
So where is it at now?

1138
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Is it still resilvering?

1139
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,120
It takes forever.

1140
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,040
Yes, it is.

1141
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,680
We're getting there 98% done, so it'll be done hopefully today.

1142
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,680
Yeah, that particular disk is a Western Digital Red,

1143
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,200
so it's not super fast.

1144
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,560
And it's 6 terabytes, so it's going

1145
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,320
to take a while to resilver.

1146
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,640
There was two curveballs we hit that I was not expecting.

1147
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,000
The first one is not too surprising, really,

1148
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,320
in retrospect.

1149
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,920
That is, we were installing to a USB device that sits on a USB

1150
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,000
header inside the case.

1151
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,360
This is something IX Systems does,

1152
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,080
your OS is on a solid state.

1153
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,160
I think it was, what, 16 gigabytes?

1154
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,400
No, that one was four.

1155
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,520
That was one of the difficulties of our initial replacement

1156
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,020
technique.

1157
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,360
I didn't realize we were, oh, jeez, yeah.

1158
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,400
So we tried to get Fedora Server, which we actually

1159
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:21,600
still got.

1160
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,640
Totally worked just fine.

1161
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,880
We got it within the four gigs on this little solid state USB

1162
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,680
device.

1163
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,800
The problem was, A, we were really low on space

1164
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,580
after we started installing a few packages,

1165
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,520
and B, it got like two megs a second write performance.

1166
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,240
Ouch.

1167
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,380
It was really bad.

1168
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,760
So checking the key signatures on packages

1169
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,000
would just take forever.

1170
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,280
So we started just digging around the studio.

1171
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,500
Because we have some equipment around here,

1172
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,040
we thought, we must have an SSD somewhere.

1173
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,520
So we dig around here and actually

1174
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,760
could not find a spare SSD anywhere in the studio.

1175
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,880
I guess that's good.

1176
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Means we're not wasting it.

1177
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,640
Yeah, we don't have utilization here.

1178
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,680
But I remembered we had an old Hackintosh

1179
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,080
that towards the very end of its production line,

1180
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,680
we put a 10,000 RPM, 320 gigabyte drive in it.

1181
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,880
And then it only ran for like a couple of months,

1182
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,520
and then we shut the system down.

1183
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,520
And we converted off of it.

1184
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,240
So I went in, I tore that machine open,

1185
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,080
grabbed that disk out of the old Hackintosh,

1186
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,160
and we kind of MacGyvered it into the FreeNAS box.

1187
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,000
And so now we gave Fedora a 320 gigabyte, 10,000 RPM spinning

1188
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,120
disk to work with.

1189
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,120
But the system's really set up, and the data's

1190
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,160
all across the RAID or the array.

1191
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,200
So if the OS drive were to pop at some point in the future,

1192
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,000
we'd have to reload it, but we wouldn't lose any data.

1193
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,520
So we had that problem, took a little bit of MacGyvering

1194
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,100
to solve that, because we needed some Molex power adapters

1195
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,040
to convert to SATA.

1196
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,800
And that wasn't so bad.

1197
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,120
The one that really threw me for a twist

1198
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,400
was we ran into essentially this issue.

1199
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,720
And this is, again, I don't fully understand it.

1200
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,440
So if you do, please feel free to write in

1201
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,080
at linuxunplug.com slash contact and correct me.

1202
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,840
But I couldn't use traditional NFS

1203
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,480
to share out the ZFS volumes.

1204
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,520
It would essentially stop at a mount point.

1205
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,400
If you had sub-volumes that were mounted,

1206
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,600
it would essentially stop at that mount point.

1207
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,840
And it took us a little while to kind of root around.

1208
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,360
And it even turns out that ZFS itself

1209
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,240
has some NFS provisions built in.

1210
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,360
And I was completely lost when it came to this aspect.

1211
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,600
Yeah, so we ended up using the ZFS stuff.

1212
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,960
You can just sort of set a property on your data set,

1213
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,120
and then you may have to remount it.

1214
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,600
I'm not clear on that exact particular.

1215
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,760
But after that's done, it just shows up as an export list,

1216
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,560
and you can mount it.

1217
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,840
So we've got not everything's restored yet.

1218
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,960
But I mean, we just need a few more commands,

1219
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,240
and we'll have all your shares back.

1220
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:43,840
Yeah, yeah.

1221
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,040
So that was kind of funny, because the way it works

1222
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,720
is I would mount the NFS share, and the directory structure

1223
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,520
would be there.

1224
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,240
But then I would get to the bottom level

1225
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,340
where it was actually going into a sub-volume,

1226
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,680
and it would just be empty, which

1227
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,200
is where all the shows would be, or all the pictures would be.

1228
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,280
So I'd have the directory structure,

1229
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,080
but none of the data.

1230
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,880
It's like, what happened?

1231
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,600
Such a tease.

1232
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,800
Did we lose it?

1233
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,080
But we got it going.

1234
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,400
We got it going, and it seems to be working pretty well.

1235
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,640
And now, what we're going to do with this rig

1236
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,520
is just have it run some local services.

1237
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,080
We're in the process of finally replacing Dropbox,

1238
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,640
and we're going to run some virtual machines on this.

1239
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,880
And all of the main applications will run inside a container.

1240
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,360
So the host operating system will be fairly unhinged

1241
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,880
from future upgrades and stuff.

1242
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,920
It'll be unimpeded, or whatever I'm trying to say.

1243
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,560
What am I trying to say?

1244
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,760
We just wanted to worry about it.

1245
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,160
Yeah, we're not.

1246
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,720
Most of our stuff will be running in containers.

1247
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,120
This is not a bunch of apps and packages

1248
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,640
we're going to have to worry about.

1249
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,440
It's going to be a pretty clean base.

1250
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,480
It's not that much data.

1251
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah.

1252
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,240
Not impaired.

1253
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,960
Yeah, not impaired, whatever.

1254
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,600
Not entangled, I don't know.

1255
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Not in long-term software commitments.

1256
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,040
And then we're also going to set up WireGuard on that sucker,

1257
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,000
so the host can get remote WireGuard services in

1258
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,680
if they want to remotely control the mixer, things like that.

1259
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,320
So that'll be on there.

1260
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,120
It's already pretty nice.

1261
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,040
Just got NetData installed before the show,

1262
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,200
so I can watch as all the data is shuffling around

1263
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,440
as it's resilvering, which is great.

1264
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,800
It's pretty nice to have.

1265
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,440
It feels like what I was, I'm such a nerd.

1266
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,080
God, I was laying in bed talking to Hadea about the server.

1267
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,240
I can't even believe I just.

1268
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,400
Something tells me she's used to this.

1269
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,800
And I was like, babe, you know, it's like I went out there

1270
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,760
and found out we had a sports car in the garage.

1271
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,360
And I thought it was like this little four-cylinder commuter.

1272
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,640
Because we kind of forgot about the only, like, I mean,

1273
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,400
I think you logged in for some reason

1274
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,520
and happened to see the little blinking red light

1275
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,040
on the Freenaz console, right?

1276
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,200
Telling us like there might have been.

1277
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,520
Otherwise, we just didn't think about it.

1278
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,400
Sat there and ran.

1279
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,640
It did its purpose really well.

1280
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,920
I am kind of a believer in overbuilding your storage,

1281
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,120
so that's what I did there.

1282
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,120
But looking back at it, 64 gigs of RAM,

1283
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,680
two six-core Xeon processors.

1284
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,080
The thing's just begging to do more.

1285
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,920
And not that I couldn't do it with FreeBSD or Freenaz.

1286
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,000
Absolutely, we could have.

1287
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,560
But I know how to do it with Linux.

1288
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,600
It's just faster.

1289
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,120
And we don't, I mean, we're not touching the system every day.

1290
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,960
So it's nice to have something that's easy

1291
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,640
and we don't have to relook up a bunch of man pages every time.

1292
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,160
Yeah.

1293
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,800
So we'll probably, well, eventually, I

1294
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,920
imagine we'll spin up whatever our sync solution is

1295
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,760
in a container.

1296
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,960
We'll spin up a couple of other items

1297
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,280
that I use internally for like processing news

1298
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,640
and whatnot in containers.

1299
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,360
And I'll move some of the things that I

1300
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,200
have on the workstations in the studio now onto that server.

1301
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,920
So that's what sort of the, and I'll just

1302
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,960
do that gradually over time, probably

1303
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,380
with some of the more urgent stuff.

1304
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,320
And then I'll, like the syncing thing.

1305
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,920
Because this new Dropbox has got to go.

1306
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,400
This is just the final straw.

1307
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,540
Dropbox has just crossed the line with this Electron stuff.

1308
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,840
I will say it really did cement just why CFS is a great choice.

1309
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,160
We could just port operating systems

1310
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,800
and hardly had to think about it.

1311
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,760
It's not that many other ways that we could have done this

1312
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,320
and get all the other benefits.

1313
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,520
It's a pretty dramatic switch.

1314
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,160
We went from FreeBSD base with an old version of ZFS

1315
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,560
to Fedora 30 with the absolute most recent version

1316
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,920
on the most absolute recent Linux kernel.

1317
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,320
Some would call us crazy.

1318
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,880
Yeah, I've just really been enjoying Fedora 30.

1319
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,840
You know, it's.

1320
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,640
I would say, I mean, it honestly did feel vindicated.

1321
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,920
It's hard to explain, but I feel like the whole process

1322
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,400
was surprisingly pleasant because we run into several other issues.

1323
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,800
All the stuff relating to Fedora and Fedora 30 server was great.

1324
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,800
And that cockpit was up.

1325
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,320
We've already done a bunch through that,

1326
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,000
which was lovely as we were still trying to get everything set up

1327
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,880
and only had console access.

1328
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,200
It's just been a dream.

1329
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,480
Really, I couldn't really ask for any more.

1330
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,560
And it's funny because I've been running Fedora on the base

1331
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,280
and then like Ubuntu in the containers and in the VMs.

1332
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,720
That's just been my setup recently.

1333
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,640
It's just been working really well for me.

1334
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,600
And other people, different setups work.

1335
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,640
But it reminded me of, I think it was right

1336
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,040
when I first started listening to Jupiter broadcasting.

1337
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,560
And it was before I'd ever used Fedora on the desktop.

1338
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,280
I had, I think it was a Fedora 14, 15 on the server.

1339
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,800
And it was one of my first and favorite Linux servers.

1340
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,960
So it's nice to come home.

1341
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,640
Yeah.

1342
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,960
All right, Neil, I'm curious what you think.

1343
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,320
I know you work a lot in the Red Hat space with ZFS.

1344
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,480
Are we crazy?

1345
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,080
Well, first of all, I thought that was really cool what you just said.

1346
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,600
You were slightly crazy, but it was the good kind of crazy.

1347
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,040
So I was OK with it.

1348
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,880
I told Wes, I said, Wes, you know, I think we're officially

1349
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,200
top gearing this thing right now.

1350
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,880
I don't know, that other one was a pretty top gear event, too.

1351
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,280
But with ZFS on Linux specifically, I think,

1352
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,640
I'm not completely certain on this, that the kernel can't

1353
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,680
see all the subvolumes.

1354
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,560
So when it tries to evaluate all the things

1355
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,440
that it exports through NFS, they won't work properly.

1356
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,760
So that's why you need to use the ZFS built-in.

1357
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,880
NFS share NFS feature on Linux.

1358
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,360
In FreeBSD and other places, I think

1359
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,000
it's all more tightly integrated so they can just do it normally.

1360
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,720
And that makes sense, because when we switched over to that,

1361
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,560
it did start working.

1362
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,480
It just worked, yeah.

1363
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,120
So now, it's not like ZFS has like their own implementation of NFS.

1364
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,120
They're working with the kernel, right?

1365
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,360
I can't answer that question confidently,

1366
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,520
because it's been a long time since I've looked at that code.

1367
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,560
That's just crazy to me.

1368
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,400
That ZFS is huge.

1369
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,400
That's massive.

1370
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,800
And the fact that ZFS works the same way everywhere

1371
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,320
is more of a testament to how much of an outsider file system

1372
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,440
it is in most operating systems.

1373
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,560
So it's developed very independently.

1374
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,080
Right.

1375
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,480
It comes with a bunch of extra stuff

1376
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,180
so that it doesn't have to rely on what may or may not be there.

1377
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:27,680
Right.

1378
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,840
So a lot of these kinds of things have also

1379
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,720
been relevant in macOS, for example,

1380
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,640
because you can't really poke all the things the same way

1381
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,680
that you can in FreeBSD and whatnot.

1382
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, it gave me a confidence.

1383
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,480
It made me feel like, well, in the future,

1384
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,480
if Fedora doesn't work out and we want to go to Ubuntu LTS,

1385
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,480
I'm not going to have any problem getting my data.

1386
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,880
It's just going to connect and import just fine.

1387
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,800
It gave me a good sense of my data is safe.

1388
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,360
Yeah.

1389
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,320
And in respect to ZOL and all of these things,

1390
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,400
Fedora and, of course, CentOS and RHEL

1391
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,120
are first class test targets for ZFS on Linux.

1392
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,080
So if it doesn't work in Fedora, it is pretty much a blocker,

1393
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,240
because that is a problem.

1394
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,920
Yeah, it was dead easy to set up, too.

1395
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,200
It really couldn't have been easier.

1396
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,520
Yeah, so making sure it works in CentOS and RHEL,

1397
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,600
because, of course, enterprise people who want to use ZFS,

1398
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,240
that matters.

1399
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,200
But also using it in Fedora, that matters quite a fair bit,

1400
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,280
especially since Fedora is very close to upstream

1401
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,160
and the upstream kernels and stuff like that.

1402
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,680
So it's a very big important point for that.

1403
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,920
And to be clear, we went with Extended 4

1404
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,520
on the root partition for the OS.

1405
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,240
So the Fedora install is running on Extended 4,

1406
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,080
and it is using a DKMS module to get ZFS working.

1407
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,160
Yeah, well, I would have called you actually insane

1408
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,200
if you had put ZFS on a root file system.

1409
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,360
Yeah, we had some limit, some limit.

1410
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,840
Don't think we didn't think about it.

1411
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,160
I mean, it was a listed option.

1412
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,320
We just didn't choose it.

1413
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,200
Don't do it.

1414
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,320
Don't do it.

1415
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,280
I'm just going to say this right now.

1416
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,200
I have done it enough times.

1417
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:56,880
Don't do it.

1418
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,200
Unless you are running on CentOS where

1419
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,520
you can use a precompiled kernel module that

1420
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,040
works against the kernel API, it gets really unsafe very

1421
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,760
easily.

1422
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,280
Yeah.

1423
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,560
Well, I'm just thrilled myself because I just

1424
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,800
feel like I got a new tool to get work done.

1425
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,640
Not that it wasn't always there, and I couldn't have done it,

1426
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,080
but now I'm actually going to use it.

1427
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:16,440
Yes, right.

1428
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,040
And we were running some stuff on a personal workstation

1429
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,240
of yours or other random machines,

1430
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,960
so it's nice to have a proper place for it.

1431
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,800
Yes, exactly.

1432
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,080
So let me know if you think I'm crazy,

1433
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,720
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1434
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,160
But before we get out of here, I want

1435
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,040
to do just a couple of picks.

1436
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,840
Right off the top, I got a couple command line

1437
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,240
applications I love this week.

1438
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,280
Speaking of command line love, speaking

1439
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,840
of command line love, you should check out the Ubuntu podcast.

1440
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,320
Do it.

1441
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,640
And send them your ideas for command line applications.

1442
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,600
Add Ubuntu podcast on the Twitters.

1443
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,640
Here's a couple, guys.

1444
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,280
You know what?

1445
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,160
You are welcome to share these.

1446
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,520
I share these with the Ubuntu podcast if you want them.

1447
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,000
Because these are so good, everybody's

1448
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,360
going to want these ones.

1449
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,560
RGA is our first one.

1450
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:01,080
It's like grep, but for PDFs, e-books, office documents,

1451
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,000
zip files, tar.gz, et cetera.

1452
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,320
You can grep even docx files, SQLite files, MKV files,

1453
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,080
MP4 files.

1454
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,480
Oh, yeah, all the things.

1455
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,680
It's rip grep for everything or anything, something like that.

1456
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,080
It's based off rip grep, which if you haven't used,

1457
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,880
you really should.

1458
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,280
Ah, OK, rip grep for everything.

1459
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,720
Yeah, it's like a Rust implemented alternative grep

1460
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,120
that's just super fast.

1461
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,120
They've wrapped this here.

1462
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,120
Wait, wait, wait, did you say rust?

1463
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,520
Oh, yeah, of course, of course it is.

1464
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,040
Of course.

1465
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,920
Actually, I mean, the burnt sushi, the author

1466
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,600
is a fascinating human with some really interesting stuff,

1467
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,680
particularly about the implementation of how

1468
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,800
the search engine algorithms work in something like grep.

1469
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,480
So if you want to learn more, it's

1470
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,080
not only a great implementation, it's a good learning

1471
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,200
opportunity as well.

1472
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,080
So this wraps that and lets it search in stuff like PDFs,

1473
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,680
SQLite, all the things that you've been missing.

1474
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,880
That could be really nice, to tell you the truth.

1475
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,320
All right, so maybe searching things isn't your thing.

1476
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,480
And since they're Rust, they're just each a little binary

1477
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,200
you have to download, so no worries

1478
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,920
about a complicated text.

1479
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,600
Is there a way we could put that in a snap?

1480
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,040
Yep.

1481
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:07,720
All right.

1482
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,400
Now, I love the fish shell, talk about it all the time.

1483
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,360
I always encourage people to check it out.

1484
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,800
The thing I love about the fish shell

1485
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,240
is it does autocompletion for frequent commands.

1486
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:18,960
But it's not perfect, because sometimes you

1487
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,720
have different variations on commands,

1488
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,120
or sometimes you have just commands

1489
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,160
you only use very infrequently.

1490
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,840
Wouldn't it be nice if you could bookmark commands

1491
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,320
like you do URLs?

1492
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,720
Well, friends, that's where Marker comes in.

1493
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,360
It is a nice little application for your terminal

1494
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,320
that lets you bookmark commands or entire command templates.

1495
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,960
And here's the best part.

1496
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,040
It lets you easily retrieve them with a real-time fuzzy language

1497
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,520
matcher.

1498
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,120
So you kind of just get in the ballpark

1499
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,440
of what you're looking for.

1500
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,640
It has a nice UI on the command line, again.

1501
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,000
But it gives you a UI to select easily which command you wanted,

1502
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,520
and then it'll execute it for you.

1503
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,200
I could see this being really nice, too.

1504
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,280
Maybe you have a team of sys admins,

1505
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,960
and you have a shared toolkit for working with applications.

1506
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,480
Oh, totally.

1507
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,880
That's a great.

1508
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,120
That would be a great use.

1509
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,320
This is something I'm going to have to play with.

1510
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,620
Yeah, you just need Python, like a semi-recent version

1511
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,600
of Python, and Bash or Zshell.

1512
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,520
And it'll work on Linux or Mac OS.

1513
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,280
So there you go.

1514
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,000
It's called Marker.

1515
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,160
We'll have a link in the show notes for that, too,

1516
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,840
which I feel like that'd be pretty handy for somebody

1517
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,920
like me to have something like that on the server

1518
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,640
that we just set up.

1519
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,360
That's actually what I was saying.

1520
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,360
I was like, oh, man, I could make you some defaults

1521
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,320
for maybe a complicated little command or Python.

1522
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,960
Something I do like once every six months.

1523
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:34,480
Yeah, exactly.

1524
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,320
You know, when the server has to have something done to it

1525
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,400
or whatnot.

1526
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,080
So anyways, check those out.

1527
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,560
When we say the show notes, of course,

1528
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,720
we mean in your podcast player or over at linuxunplug.com

1529
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,240
slash 306.

1530
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,160
Each episode is just slash right there.

1531
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,600
Easy to find, easy to get to.

1532
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,460
Mr. Payne, is there anything else

1533
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,000
we need to mention before we get out of here?

1534
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,920
No, I don't think so.

1535
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:55,400
All right.

1536
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:55,880
OK.

1537
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,520
Easy peasy.

1538
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:56,760
All right.

1539
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,160
Cheesy, is there anything we need to cover before we leave?

1540
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,280
You got anything for us?

1541
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,840
Check out the new Telegram sticker pack.

1542
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,360
Yeah.

1543
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,520
Oh, it's so good.

1544
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,000
Yep.

1545
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,960
Or if you're not in the Telegram group, why not?

1546
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,920
You go to broadcasting.com slash telegram.

1547
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,280
That's right.

1548
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:08,960
You should be.

1549
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,520
You should be.

1550
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:09,720
All right.

1551
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,560
Very good.

1552
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,680
Thank you, Mr. Bacon.

1553
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,720
Now, I also want to thank all of you for listening.

1554
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,520
I appreciate every single one of you.

1555
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
You're the most important.

1556
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,800
No offense, Jase, but they are.

1557
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,480
They are.

1558
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,760
All of you.

1559
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,840
This show has done so well over the years.

1560
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,360
We really just are so thankful for every single one of you

1561
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,960
for listening.

1562
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,200
So thank you so much.

Thank you for subscribing.

1564
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,840
Appreciate that.

1565
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,600
That's really great.

1566
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,200
We have a great community out there.

1567
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,520

Bye.

1578

Bye.

1580

1600
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:23,400
voting rights away mmm so poppy how's the old feedback been on the distro

1601
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:29,800
specific snap pages yeah other than getting for incorrectly using the

1602
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:35,680
fedora go oh oh I noticed I was trying not to be mean about it or anything I

1603
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,760
just said hey can you fix it please you know what I think it's a good idea I

1605
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,680
in a poppy if you did it'd be a miracle worker hey I thought it was good I

1606
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:57,680
didn't say anything awful about it that sentence is it's pretty solid I like

1607
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:01,800
that has my audio gone funny again every now and then I think it's just packet

1608
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:07,120
loss weird I mean from my side it's been everyone's been kind of cutting out a

1609
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,400
little bit which has been odd because that doesn't normally happen

1610
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,120
Leonard oh man that poor guy dude I'm not even talking to you from my Linux

1611
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,240
machine right now because I'm hiding in a conference room are you are you

1612
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,000
permitted to say that I think I think you have to like get clearance or

1613
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,800
something poppy already knows this from the times that I've met him at various

1614
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:35,000
events mainly snap sprints but I was in one OS I was gonna say I've never

1615
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:47,480
actually seen him run Linux oh no no no at the the rally two years ago I think

1616
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:54,480
the one in New York the whole time I brought my Linux laptop with me Noah

1617
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,560
saw it and so did a couple of other people I have witnesses now hold on now

1618
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,440
we're not we're not we're not come on we don't we don't we don't know a shame we

1619
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,800
got a call for an end of this the tribalism you know like I feel like I

1620
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,920
should walk around be like my name is Chris I'm a Linux user and I also have

1621
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,880
an iPad you know like I have to just come I have to come holding your iPad so

1622
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,520
they'll see I have to come clean about it I don't know no more down with the

1623
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:23,840
tribal you see at home I have a MacBook I have I have numerous Linux machines

1624
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,080
running all many different distros here's where I think it has validity

1625
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,880
though like I think if you work in free software and open source or in that

1626
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,680
space like then that should be your primary stack that should be your main

1627
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,960
stack because that's your area but it would be ignorant not to ever try a

1628
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,400
Windows or Mac because then you would have zero insights into how very popular

1629
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,880
very commercial very successful commercial operating systems yeah you

1630
00:59:47,880 --> 01:00:02,120
have to what you have to do that
