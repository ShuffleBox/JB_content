1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Speaking of breaking, how about a little breaking news?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is CNN Breaking News.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,120
Coming in from the beard himself, GetGamesGo.com, never even heard of it, but I guess they're

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,120
known.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,000
GetGamesGo.com is having a 75% off Linux game sale, and some of them are just Steam codes,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,160
some of them are direct downloads, some of them are DRM free, some of them aren't.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,400
Anyways, I'll have a link in the pre-show, I don't know how long it's going on, they

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,560
take Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal, and it's GetGamesGo.com, and 75% off Linux game sale.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Thought I'd mention it.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Check it out.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
See?

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
See what I do for you?

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,560
Now you can go get some gaming going for your 75% off.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
No?

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
No?

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
That didn't work for you?

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
All right, okay.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm just scrolling through the list.

19
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,560
All right, how about this one?

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
All right.

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Nothing's jumping out.

22
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
All right, here we go, here we go.

23
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:59,800
Here's the answer, and you're in the situation room.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,480
Hello guys, I'm here reporting on scene at GetGamesGo.com where I can report there is

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,000
indeed some sort of catastrophe going on.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,160
I believe it is a cyber attack, a glitch in the computer.

27
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,000
All Linux games are 75% off.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,640
Situation, situation.

29
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
That's right, Wolf.

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
This is quite the situation.

31
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,360
We recommend you go over to GetGamesGo.com.

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,360
I've never heard of them before, but holy crap, 75% off.

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Hackers be crazy.

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Do you like that one better?

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,880
Actually, it's gotten me kind of interested to go to that website now.

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,160
So I saw Wimpy posted, or someone posted some screenshots of Marte on BBC.

37
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,640
Yeah, that's pretty popular, isn't it?

38
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Wimpy, what's going on there?

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,600
What the hell?

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
What did I do?

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Oh, PowerPC.

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,160
This is not something that I've had a huge amount of involvement in.

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,520
This is community developments.

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:04,520
So a couple of people in the Ubuntu Marte community have ported Ubuntu Marte to PowerPC,

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,560
and this whole underculture of people that are sitting on PowerPC equipment have suddenly

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,900
turned up, and we've reinvigorated these computers that previously were struggling for a decent

48
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,160
operating system.

49
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:28,600
So there's these guys turning up with PowerPC G4s, PowerPC G5s, and Amiga X1000s, and all

50
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,400
sorts of funky stuff.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
People are just hanging on to these old Macs, and then they're just putting Linux on it.

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,360
Not just old Macs, but other equipment that's based on PowerPC.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,920
Like anything, we all gravitate to something that at some point we really love.

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,040
I still have a real soft spot for the IBM ThinkPad 760, which came out in about 1998,

55
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,820
and it's an old piece of cruft now, but it was the first really decent computer I had.

56
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,800
So I think of it fondly.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,960
And I imagine these guys that have got these PowerPC equipment, they know it, and they're

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,480
able to make it work for them.

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,760
And some of those G5 rigs that they've got are really quite pokey.

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,120
And were very expensive, though.

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,580
Some of those G5 rigs they bought, they may have spent eight grand on some of those high-end

62
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,920
production rigs.

63
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,280
Yeah, and these guys that have got eight core systems with eight gigs of RAM, so back then

64
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,000
this would have been a significant investment.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
And yeah, they've got Ubuntu Mate running on it, with QEMU running, and they're doing

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,400
multiple Ubuntu Mate sessions running within there.

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,340
They've got all the 3D gaming going, the whole nine yards.

68
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,700
So I'm working on it at the moment.

69
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:55,320
So I've actually bought an iBook G4 off eBay, secondhand, to help with the PowerPC testing.

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,200
And last week, or the week before, did the PowerPC enablement in the official canonical

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,400
build infrastructure for Ubuntu Mate.

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,880
So I don't know if we're going to get over the finish line, but we've started to put

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,200
all the bits in places to introduce it as an official architecture.

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
That though, wow.

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,220
I mean, when you go down that route, that is big.

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,760
That's a new arm of the distro.

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Wow.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,560
Although, you know, I think about it, there is an old G4 tower that is kicking around

79
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,080
here somewhere that just, it does nothing because it's worthless.

80
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,480
If I could throw a Linux on it.

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
ISO's available.

82
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,200
ISO's are available.

83
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,960
You could say that it's Wimpressive, I'll say.

84
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Oh, don't.

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,440
This is what all my school teachers used to put on my school reports, thinking that they

86
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,600
were being clever and original.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
What was it?

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
What was it?

89
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Wimpressive?

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Hey Rob, did you hear that?

91
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Wimpy basically called you a dick then.

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Yeah, yeah, he totally did.

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
I'll see myself out.

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It's okay.

95
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:01,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's getting ready to flip some

96
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,280
old power PC equipment on the side to fund its RV ambitions.

97
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
My name is Chris.

98
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
And my name is Matt.

99
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,240
One of these days, Matt, I will be broadcasting this very show from the road.

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,760
I can't even say it's going to happen before episode 100, Matt.

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
One day.

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,520
One day, Chris will be in the Jupiter Broadcasting Mobile Studio, broadcasting the Unplugged

103
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
show.

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,240
And we'll have a real lug meetup with real in-person microphones.

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,040
This week, we're going to have a great show.

106
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,200
A project that you may or may not be familiar with, and maybe not familiar with as well,

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,960
as I should be, is the Arch Linux ARM project.

108
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,880
Now I don't really know what you would use Arch on an ARM device for, but I have a few

109
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
ideas.

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,040
So one of the members is going to join us to give us a little bit of background, tell

111
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,760
us what some people out there use Arch and ARM devices for, and we're going to pick his

112
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,520
brain and we're also going to have the mobile room ask any questions they might have.

113
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
And then in the second half of the show, something we've talked a lot about is delivering applications

114
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
on Linux.

115
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,700
Something where you could make an application and move it across distributions, maybe have

116
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,300
it secured from the rest of the system sandbox, so that way if the application has an exploit,

117
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
it can't really go very far.

118
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Well, this week, we saw the first demo of a fully sandboxed application on the Linux

119
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,080
desktop, thanks to advancements in Wayland, and a lot of other things that we'll get into.

120
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,920
And it was actually a video game, a OpenGL video game that was fully sandboxed, fully

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,800
portable, and demoed this week on Linux, and we're going to talk about that and how far

122
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
out it might be.

123
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,080
It might be closer than you think.

124
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,920
So to get started, Matt, why don't we bring in that Mumble Room.

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

126
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Hello.

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Hello.

128
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Hello.

129
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Greetings.

130
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Hello.

131
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Hi.

132
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Hello from Trinidad.

133
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Hi.

134
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Hi.

135
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Well, hello from Trinidad.

136
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,160
Let's put Poppy right up there on the spot.

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,080
I just wanted to pick your brain, Poppy, on any updates.

138
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,500
Since we talked, the launch happened, the flash sale was very flashy, and I'm just curious

139
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,920
if you got any updates for us on how it's gone, and maybe we're going to see any future

140
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
sales.

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Yeah.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,680
We had a flash sale for the Ubuntu phone, the first Ubuntu phone, the BQ, last week

143
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,640
on Wednesday, just after the show where we discussed it.

144
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,560
Hence all the sales.

145
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Yeah.

146
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,560
They sold out pretty quick in the morning, and so they ran another sale in the afternoon

147
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,360
and they sold out then as well, and I think they sold out in minutes, you know, really

148
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
stupidly quickly.

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,400
I don't think they quite anticipated how many people were going to buy them, but there'll

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
be more flash sales.

151
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,520
There'll be one this week at some point, BQ have said, so keep an eye on the Ubuntu Twitter

152
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,680
account and the BQ Reader's Twitter account for more info.

153
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,400
Any early feedback or responses or anything like that?

154
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,000
You guys just sort of like listening and collecting data right now?

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,880
What's going on right now at Canonical HQ after the phone finally ships?

156
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Yeah.

157
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,360
Or I guess it hasn't shipped yet, but sales have gone out.

158
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
So I guess they're not...

159
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Right.

160
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,320
We don't really have them in consumers' hands until, what, a month or so?

161
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Well some are.

162
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,200
There's 30 of them for the people who came to London, and they've been giving us loads

163
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
of feedback.

164
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,720
You know, some of it we didn't go and ask for, they just started posting photos and

165
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,440
screenshots and, you know, problems that they've had or, you know, things they've liked, and

166
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,040
we've been gathering all this information, like, you know, stalking them all on their

167
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,480
social media accounts to see what they're posting and, you know, gather that feedback

168
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,080
and give it back to the developers.

169
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,440
But also some of them have been filing bugs and giving us log files and stuff when there

170
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
are problems.

171
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,240
So it's been a really useful exercise because they're using it in the real world.

172
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,400
Now Wimpy, you had a question that those of us maybe with a Nexus 4 or Nexus 5 device

173
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
want to know about.

174
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Yeah.

175
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:41,280
So I've got the Nexus 4, which I've just had for a few days because I wasn't successful

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,560
in the flash sales last week, and I wanted to learn more.

177
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,040
So I've noticed there are some differences with what the Nexus 4 ships with versus what

178
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,200
the BQ ships with.

179
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,280
For example, the Scopes implementation on the BQ phone seems to be a little bit more

180
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,440
tightly integrated and it's got this today scope, and I was wondering if Canonical are

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,960
going to bring that same software enablement to the other devices.

182
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
So yeah, they should be.

183
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,800
I mean, the idea is that each manufacturer or carrier or OEM can tailor the experience

184
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,080
and add their little layer on the top and some of what you might see in screenshots

185
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:30,600
and videos of the BQ phone might be BQ specific stuff for Spain or for BQ's customers or based

186
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,400
on deals that BQ have with partners and that kind of stuff we probably wouldn't put on

187
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,920
other devices.

188
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,600
But the generic stuff like the today scope and nearby and other stuff, then that should

189
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,280
go into the store and it should be available to anyone.

190
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,080
It just hasn't yet been done.

191
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,200
I did ask you, you asked me earlier on Telegram and I pinged everyone and they said it's currently

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
in process.

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,920
Yeah, I'm being a bit of a stooge here, but you know, it was topical for me.

194
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,720
I have to say, having played with it, I get the scopes concept and I'm just disappointed

195
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,640
there are not more scopes built in for the core apps, because they're really...

196
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,480
So here's a bit of feedback for you, Popey.

197
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,080
Scopes to me are like a cross between widgets on Android and Google Now, and I don't know

198
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,760
if it's because I live outside North America, but Google Now for me is completely pointless.

199
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,000
It doesn't actually do anything useful, doesn't tell me anything that I want to know, so consequently

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,240
I go to great lengths to disable it on my Android devices.

201
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,400
I have to say, in just a couple of days of using Ubuntu phone, scopes actually deliver

202
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,680
the promise of what I thought Google Now was supposed to do, which was to keep me informed

203
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,520
about the things that I wanted to know about, because I've chosen to follow it, or because

204
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,640
it's geo-located around me and it makes me aware of my surroundings.

205
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,320
I'd like to see more scopes, particularly things like the...

206
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,360
There's a decent text messaging app, but there's no scope for it, and the killer app on Ubuntu

207
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,600
phone as far as I'm concerned is Telegram, because I've moved all of my immediate friends

208
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,800
and family over to it, and there's a scope for that and an app for that, and it's brilliant,

209
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,920
but the text messaging app lacks a scope, and I feel it needs one.

210
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,480
There's a scope for Telegram?

211
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Yeah.

212
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
Oh, yeah.

213
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,800
So it shows you your most recent messages and the people you contact the most, that

214
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
kind of stuff.

215
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,720
But we made a change in the way that apps are packaged so that you can bundle an app

216
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,200
and a scope together at the same time, so when a user or a customer installs it, they

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,600
get both and they share the same data set.

218
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,640
And that Telegram is an example of one of those.

219
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
And I agree with you.

220
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
We need more of those.

221
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
Yeah, that's fascinating.

222
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,440
I can't wait to play with it on an actual device.

223
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,160
And we won't know anything about that until more like June, right?

224
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
That's kind of the word?

225
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160
What, for the US market?

226
00:11:52,160 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, I think Christian Perrino teased to OMG Ubuntu a couple of weeks ago that we hope

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,720
to announce something in June for the US market.

228
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,920
So far away, Bobby.

229
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Sorry.

230
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
That's all right.

231
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
It turns out making phones is hard.

232
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Yeah.

233
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Who knew?

234
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Who would have thought, right?

235
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,120
Okay, so I wanted to kind of spend a moment to reflect positively upon Linux as a general

236
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,240
bit of real time feedback, as an exercise from the chat room and the mumble room.

237
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,760
And I'll start and then I'll have maybe Matt chime in with something that he would miss.

238
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,680
So every now and then, you have to spend a little time away from Linux, less and less

239
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,680
these days.

240
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
But every now and then it happens.

241
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,960
Maybe let's just say for the sake of argument, you're on the Windows platform.

242
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,120
So that way we can all just kind of focus on one thing.

243
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,360
What is it you miss the most from Linux?

244
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,520
I was inspired by a thread I saw a day ago on our Linux and it's a lot of great responses.

245
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,920
And I would like to be curious about your response.

246
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,160
So I'll tell you mine.

247
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,960
Just as like one of the first things I noticed when I sit down at a Windows box that I miss

248
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:06,520
when I'm sitting down at a Linux desktop is that you have to click to focus and then scroll

249
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
in order to get scroll to work.

250
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,760
Like you can't just bring your mouse over any random window and scroll it under Windows.

251
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,960
It has to be a focused window in order for the scroll to work.

252
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,200
It turns out I use that all the time with multiple Windows and stuff.

253
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,000
I always am scrolling Windows without wanting to actually click them.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,440
Like maybe I have my web browser up and I'm also looking through a directory, but I want

255
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,920
my web browser to be the active window, but I still want to be able to scroll the list

256
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,000
of the file directory.

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You can't do that in Windows.

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,200
You've got to click the Explorer window and then scroll it.

259
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,400
That is just like one of the first things.

260
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,640
Like there's a million things, but like in terms of like things that bug me when I move

261
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,400
away from Linux, that's one of the first.

262
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
Matt, do you have one that comes to mind?

263
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,080
I think the most annoying thing to me personally would definitely have to be the fact that

264
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,000
I can't just do a couple of button clicks and get the launcher that I want or even just

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,520
the menu layout in general is just obnoxious.

266
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,280
I mean that's been the big stuff that I've noticed.

267
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,240
Yeah, were you thinking, Popey, what, like KitKat, because there's like a program.

268
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,760
No, I mean years ago I used to do Focus Follows Mouse or Sloppy Focus or whatever you call

269
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
it.

270
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,640
On Windows 2000 there was a tweak for it from...

271
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,680
Focus Follows Mouse though is, I don't know, yeah, I don't know.

272
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,960
I thought that's basically what you, yeah, you can either have it raise the window or

273
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,640
not and if you have it not raise the window, put your mouse over it and scroll.

274
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,000
I mean, yeah, it's not built in.

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,560
It's not easy and it didn't work all the time.

276
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
What about you, Popey?

277
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
I love that.

278
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,000
When you're not on the Linux desktop, what are you missing the most?

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Opening a terminal with Control-Alt-T.

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

281
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,720
Because I just find myself doing that all the time.

282
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,320
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

283
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah, Wimpy, you too?

284
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Terminal?

285
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Yeah, yeah, the terminal is the best hotkey utility ever created, so fire up a terminal

286
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,120
and then you can just ping off and manipulate everything on the system from a few keystrokes

287
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,560
and it's deeply frustrating to not have that on Windows.

288
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,760
Yeah, one of the nice things about it, basically every Linux desktop now is there's a built-in

289
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,960
launcher of some kind and some of them are better than others and then it's nothing like

290
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
that.

291
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
You have the start menu but it's not quite the same thing.

292
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,680
Eric, do you have any that jump out at you for things you miss when you step away from

293
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,680
Linux?

294
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,440
Yeah, well, you mentioned the terminal thing.

295
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:21,180
I also was thinking about, in terms of the terminal, I was just thinking it's nice to

296
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,160
have that F12 for like Yackquake or Guake for the terminals to just pop down.

297
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:35,480
So like if I need to get to the command line, I have to type Windows R to open that up.

298
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,800
So it's just, it gets really aggravating but also being able to tile my Windows where

299
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I want them.

300
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,360
Windows Aerosnap only does the left or the right halves.

301
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,520
It won't do it in quadrants at all and I like that.

302
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,480
You know the big one, I'm surprised nobody's mentioned, the obvious one, package management.

303
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Oh, duh, right?

304
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
How did I not mention?

305
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Oh my God, I feel ashamed now.

306
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Yeah.

307
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,920
And then of course, another big one is the virtual desktops.

308
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,320
The Windows is getting those things as well.

309
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
I mean, 10 is addressing a lot of these things, isn't it?

310
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,280
I believe also the scroll wheel thing is fixed in 10.

311
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,840
It does but it doesn't really properly address package management.

312
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,400
Please feel me as a proper launcher though.

313
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah.

314
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,640
Surprisingly, the thing I miss in Windows is pulse audio.

315
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Really?

316
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Yeah, right?

317
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Really?

318
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Really?

319
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Yeah.

320
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,200
It's a fact that I can send it over the network instead of it just being on one machine easily

321
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
as well.

322
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,440
So, and how easily and how often do you actually take advantage of that feature?

323
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,720
Not often but it's a neat feature.

324
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Yeah.

325
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Yeah, I agree.

326
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,640
Even along those lines, being able to quickly change your input route, output device when

327
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,780
it comes to audio.

328
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,480
You can't do that very easily in Windows.

329
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
You can't.

330
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,280
You have to go into the control panel and mess with a few things and you can't do like

331
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,800
simultaneous outputs or simultaneous inputs or anything like that.

332
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,840
You have to choose one and stick with it.

333
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Very interesting, gentlemen.

334
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
All right.

335
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
So, moving on.

336
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,040
I'll link to the main thread in our Linux.

337
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,280
They had a whole bunch of good ones in there.

338
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Package management was the one that jumped out at me and then, of course, millions of

339
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
other things.

340
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,240
Nobody said wobbly Windows, unfortunately.

341
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm sure...

342
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Oh, oh.

343
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Yeah.

344
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah.

345
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Yeah.

346
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,240
Desktop cube.

347
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,240
Okay.

348
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Very good.

349
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Yeah.

350
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
Burning your Windows when you close them.

351
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
That kind of stuff.

352
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
Yeah.

353
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Yeah.

354
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Not was.

355
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,240
Is cool in my world, Matt.

356
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Is cool.

357
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Hey, you know what else is cool?

358
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Our first sponsor this week.

359
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
That's Linux Academy.

360
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,920
Head over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and get our special 33% discount.

361
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,320
Linux Academy is a great resource to go train yourself up on something.

362
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,480
They have step-by-step video courses with everything you're going to learn, downloadable

363
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,040
comprehensive study guides.

364
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,760
A lot of the materials you can just download and pop in your MP3 player and listen in the

365
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
shower or listen on the road.

366
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,560
As a podcast, it's great supplemental learning material.

367
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,040
They have learning plans so you can set your availability.

368
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,600
They have seven plus distros you get to choose from and all of the courseware will adjust

369
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,000
to those distributions.

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,800
And they have some really good stuff because the thing is is the guys behind Linux Academy

371
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,980
are really passionate about the source material.

372
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,840
They don't run courses on Photoshop.

373
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,680
They don't run courses on AutoCAD.

374
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,360
They focus in on this material because this is their world.

375
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,280
Linux enthusiasts, educators, and developers came together to create Linux Academy.

376
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,160
And it's successful because of that because once you get in there, once you start using

377
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,840
their dashboard and see how easily it is to wrap your head around what you're going to

378
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,580
have to do, how each section is broken out, how they have all of the courseware, how everything

379
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
kept up to date.

380
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,740
If there's changes in Docker, they make those changes in their courseware.

381
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,560
They have live streams where you can ask the educator questions and those educators are

382
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,440
currently up to date.

383
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,600
They're deploying this stuff and you get to deploy this stuff too because they have scenario

384
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
based labs.

385
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
So if you're going to go do an NGINX implementation with like an Amazon S3 backend storage, they're

386
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,400
going to have a scenario that actually has you use those utilities including provisioning

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,540
that storage and setting that up and getting all of that to work with every application

388
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,160
you're going to be using to do that storage and talk to S3.

389
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,760
You actually get to work with this stuff so you have a real idea of how to use it when

390
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,600
you're out in the real world.

391
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,440
And you're ready to go get trained and they have a good community too that constantly

392
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,800
helps lift you up if you slow down a little bit.

393
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,480
And really I think one of the other things that I've liked a lot about it is I can go

394
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,880
in there and kind of jump around and see what's new and interesting to me.

395
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,240
Because I honestly really haven't had a chance to play with some of the stuff as I've got

396
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
out of consulting a little while ago.

397
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
And it's great.

398
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,680
Like when I'm ready to jump into a new language like Ruby or Python, they have courseware

399
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,860
on that.

400
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,480
Including a whole set of courseware on AWS and they've really got some great stuff.

401
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,960
And they're adding stuff like new Live Labs two to three times a week right now.

402
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,680
And they also have accounts for groups.

403
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,640
So if you have a business and you want to have a group of you on there, that's a great

404
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
way to work together.

405
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,120
They've got Python, OpenStack, Android, Linux courseware, Red Hat specific stuff which is

406
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,240
always extremely valuable, PHP, Android, it's really good, DevOps, Ruby and the list goes

407
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
on and on.

408
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,780
I just go over there from time to time and just check out some of the new stuff because

409
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,320
they're always adding stuff and they're really good about updating the community in the news

410
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,760
section when you log in.

411
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
Just go try out the dashboard.

412
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,920
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and go poke around.

413
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,680
It's a great opportunity to take it up to the next notch and they've got lots of great

414
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,720
resources for you to try it out.

415
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,200
And I want to do a little PSA.

416
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,200
So this weekend is scale.

417
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,720
And I don't know how many folks, let's see, anybody in the Mumba room going to be at scale

418
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
this weekend?

419
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,960
It's going to be February 19th to the 22nd.

420
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Nobody.

421
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,120
But one of my coworkers is.

422
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,760
Okay, very good.

423
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,920
Well Noah will be there.

424
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,200
He'll be there this weekend and he'll be there Sunday live during the Linux action show.

425
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
So you can hunt him down.

426
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,240
So scale is the 13th, this is going to be the 13th annual Southern California Linux

427
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
Expo.

428
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,160
It's going to be the Hilton Los Angeles Airport.

429
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,760
And you can bump into Noah and say hi to him and he'll be tweeting from his Twitter account

430
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,880
at Colonel Linux for where he's currently ranting about how much he hates PayPal right

431
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
there.

432
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
Oh yeah.

433
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
You know what I'm going to do?

434
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm going to give that a favorite.

435
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm going to give that a favorite.

436
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I think I might as well.

437
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,440
I've been on that side of it.

438
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,800
Oh, you've done something odd that we're just going to go and hold onto your stuff forever.

439
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,640
So he'll be tweeting if you want to meet up with him and then during the Linux action

440
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,840
show he's going to try to do it live from the floor and if he can get a hardwired connection,

441
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,960
hey if anybody from scale is listening and you want to hook Noah up with a hardwired

442
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,080
connection we here would really appreciate that because he wants to give you free coverage

443
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,120
live from the floor and he's also going to be there conducting interviews so if you are

444
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,280
there and want to hook up with Noah you can email him, noah at jupitabroadcasting.com and

445
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,400
talk with him and he'll probably get you on camera and then so here's, this is a good

446
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,840
time for me to mention this.

447
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,360
So this, because we're doing this, scale is landing during the Beardpocalypse.

448
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,080
I don't know if you guys know about this but we are currently going, starting Friday, Jupiter

449
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,920
Broadcasting goes nearly dark.

450
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
There's a Beardpocalypse.

451
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,380
We are running on a reduced staff.

452
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,180
Reduced staff next week and so.

453
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,160
We need like an evil bumper set for this.

454
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,080
I do have a few things.

455
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,640
I could try out a few things and Matt won't be able to hear them but Erica, here you tell

456
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,560
me if you think, is that appropriate?

457
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
No?

458
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
No?

459
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Okay how about this one?

460
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Next week is Jupiter Broadcasting's Beardpocalypse.

461
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
There we go.

462
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Perfect.

463
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Perfect.

464
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:59,720
It's the Beardpocalypse next week and so there's going to be a reduced show load next week.

465
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,900
You'll hear more about that soon and one of the things we're doing is Linux action show

466
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,560
on Sunday's release.

467
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,140
It's going to be a retro blasted action of the Linux action show where we've gone back

468
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,980
through your best of submissions, dusted off the ones that didn't suck and then we kind

469
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,680
of gave them a massage and then put them in a righteous position of hindsight and then

470
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,920
allowed you to re-watch them.

471
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
You're welcome.

472
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,840
And I show up from time to time with random anecdotes and tell you about people I love.

473
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,400
So that'll be on Sunday's Linux action show that'll get released into the feeds.

474
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,640
We will be live though on Sunday doing scale coverage.

475
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
We just will not be releasing it that Sunday.

476
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,960
It'll be the following Sunday where we do a scale extravaganza and we put all of Noah's

477
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,880
on location live coverage and pre-recorded interviews in one episode and we make it the

478
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,800
master scale episode and that'll be it.

479
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,120
So if you followed all of that, good job.

480
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,920
If you didn't follow all of that, screw you.

481
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
There's nothing I can do about it.

483
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,920
It's complicated.

484
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,720
Welcome to the world of production.

485
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,960
And then let's talk about something that's really going to rock and I don't even need

486
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,000
to ask the Mumble Room because I know every single one of those Mo's in the Mumble Room

487
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,560
is going to be at Linux Fest Northwest in Bellingham, Washington, April 25th to the

488
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
26th.

489
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,960
We're going to try to get as much of the Jupiter Broadcasting crew out there and have as big

490
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,560
of a party as possible.

491
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,720
If you want to party with us, you better show up early because I think we're going to be

492
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,800
partying Friday night and then Saturday and Sunday we'll do a live Linux action show on

493
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Sunday.

494
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,860
Saturday I plan to kind of get up and go around and maybe not sit at the booth the whole day

495
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,440
this time.

496
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
I don't know.

497
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Yeah.

498
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
But, yeah.

499
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,520
And we're going to have, we're going to try to get extra space mats so we can have a good

500
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,720
spot for How To Linux and Women's Tech Radio and we'll be doing some interviews for some

501
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
shows at Linux Fest Northwest.

502
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,920
So that's going to be a big show to go to and most of the Jupiter Broadcasting crew's

503
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
going to be at that one.

504
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,440
So if you want to say hi to people and we'll have swag there of course and all that kind

505
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
of stuff.

506
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,120
We'll have stuff to give away and it's going to be a good show so you can book it now if

507
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
you want.

508
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,880
It's April 25th and the 26th, Bellingham, Washington.

509
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
It's going to be a pretty good party.

510
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,200
And no food illness.

511
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,680
This will be the second year in a row.

512
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
Oh yeah.

513
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
I'm going to make sure it's going to happen.

514
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm going to wear, I'll be the guy in the really weird mask.

515
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
I still remember that one year like it was yesterday.

516
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
Oh my God.

517
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
Yeah.

518
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
All right.

519
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,400
I just, I had a quick question while we have everybody assemble.

520
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Yeah.

521
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I know.

522
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,440
It came in from the subreddit from RDP5008.

523
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,960
Hey guys, I finally decided to try Guake and I'm loving it.

524
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,160
Now if you're watching the video version, boom, that's Guake right there.

525
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Bam.

526
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Bam.

527
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Bam.

528
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
It just drops right down.

529
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
It's a terminal that I just hit with my tilde key.

530
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Bam.

531
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
There it's great.

532
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Boom.

533
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
All right.

534
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
And when I go to drop down terminal and I go to drop down terminals online, is Guake

535
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
the original or are there other worthy alternatives?

536
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Please educate me.

537
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm running Linux Mint 17 cinnamon on my laptop, Arch with normal on my desktop and a bunch

538
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,920
to 14 report a bunch on my HTPC and I want me some drop down terminals.

539
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,880
So he was curious about dropdown terminal alternatives and I realized I'm kind of a

540
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,440
Guake bigot, I guess I've never looked outside of Guake.

541
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Gosh.

542
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
I listen on KDE.

543
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Yeah, right.

544
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,000
I think I'm going to fall into the same category.

545
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,920
All right Wimpy, you know of one, right?

546
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
I know of two others.

547
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Lay it on me brother.

548
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:01,240
okay okay there's one called yeah yeah quake yes another quake right I've not

549
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:11,200
used that there's another and there's yet another one simply called tilde which

550
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,000
has all of the features of quake but it uses more modern underpinnings for

551
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,780
managing configuration and such and it is significantly lighter on memory

552
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:28,000
resources and I've integrated that into Ubuntu mate 1504 so when you install

553
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,960
Ubuntu mate 1504 you zap f12 or tilde and you get a drop-down terminal all

554
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,280
themed and matching the Ubuntu mate desktop well now I recommend Tilda oh

555
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,880
okay so Tilda yeah I saw that also recommend in the subreddit so I will

556
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,440
look into that yeah Tilda a go T I L D a and the site on

557
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,720
the source for it does not seem to be working but I'm sure it's in everybody's repo and

558
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,840
it's also on guess what surprise surprise there's also an arch wiki post

559
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,840
about it everybody shot I know it's oh yeah shotgun stand yeah all right I'll

560
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,480
put a link to the github page oh yeah this is this looks nice this looks

561
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
really nice I'm gonna put a link to that in the show notes for people that the

562
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,600
people that want to grab it only runs in five mix of RAM so I like it for that

563
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,880
reason whoa do you do have a music in the chat room mentions xfce drop down

564
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
terminal and cue terminal has dropped out as well so there's a couple more okay

565
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,400
I know it I mean wimpy do you happen to remember what quakes memory usage was

566
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,320
compared comparatively ah it was several times that it was about 30 Megs because

567
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,320
it's um Python application and it uses the old g-comp for settings and what

568
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,280
have you I'm gonna look right now yeah I'm 28 6 right now are you really eight

569
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,720
megabytes of RAM yeah it bounces in the beat up between that and 30 yeah all

570
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,560
right I'm yeah that's I'm switching that's that tears it that is crazy I

571
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,520
never even thought to look like look at that I pride myself on stripping the

572
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,080
stuff now and I'd love to switch I'm sorry what was that you pride yourself

573
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,360
on I pride myself on stripping it I pride myself on you know running down

574
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,440
hard to the metals again so I think I'm gonna switch this looks really cool are

575
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,680
you still on mate man oh yeah yeah oh man I I've not worked back I've taught

576
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,200
and I I did elementary kind of lulled me over on one of my one of my old laptops

577
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,480
that I had and it barely runs but you know I got it going you know it's like

578
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,160
oh that was cool for about ten minutes and then I kind of you know but all my

579
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:31,160
other computers run mate it just just what I do sure so before we get on to

580
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:37,400
arch Linux arm right arm arm arch Linux did anybody want to touch on the

581
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,760
elementary OS topic I know rotten corpse you mentioned you wanted to bring it up

582
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,920
so I was gonna open the flight up I don't want this to turn into like a dog

583
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,240
pile thing on the project though but if there's any follow-up I'm happy to hear

584
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,360
well I don't want to you know attack him or anything but there was a part in the

585
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,920
interview where Noah asked him do you know how much has been how much of the

586
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,240
money has been updated has been sent to Debbie and in a bun to because they were

587
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,400
talking about the entire operating system yeah and the answer is nothing I

588
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,560
thought it was like a couple hundred dollars or something no they're bounty

589
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,200
source actually bounty source is not really that good of an idea because the

590
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,480
concept is it's good but it's also broken because they you're fit you're

591
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,080
not paying the project you're paying the developer who fixes a particular bug so

592
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,280
if someone just comes in and fixes it that just fixes that one bug and you're

593
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,200
paying for that bug but that that doesn't even mean that that bug is a

594
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,560
really good fix and that the project will even take the fix so not they don't

595
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,160
get the money and they don't maybe don't even get the fix in the first place but

596
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:48,320
there has only been like roughly there's like okay GTK get like 35 bucks don't

597
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,440
you feel like like saying that the poor people aren't donating to people more

598
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,520
like I mean they're they're currently clearly saying they're not making enough

599
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,080
money as it is well no they made well they allow themselves to call other

600
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,640
people cheers for not contribute well also and it's not that they don't have

601
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,320
the money is because they spent $1,300 fixing bugs in my Pantheon files I mean

602
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,960
if they just gave anything at all to Ubuntu or Debian that'd be fine it's not

603
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,120
it's not about the money anyway it's it's the fact that they say that they

604
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,800
don't know when they do know and it's nothing and also that they are still

605
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,160
claiming that for their for one they're claiming that they're asking for money

606
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,760
for the entire operating system which they're not actually putting money into

607
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,320
the entire operating system they're also saying that you're not cheating us

608
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,440
you're cheating open source so implying that not paying for elementary is

609
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,760
somehow cheating the entire open source ecosystem and that's just absurd

610
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,440
www as a user of the OS you want to chime in yeah you can consider me an

611
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,120
ex-user I'm gonna move to kaboom 2 I've talked to the mumble room throughout the

612
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,520
week in depth about this since even before this happened and I've talked to

613
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,480
some devs that have tried to contribute to the project and been spurned away

614
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,600
and I'm just I'm just kind of done with what I what I've seen the how the

615
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,880
community has been managed like Eric has said in the past and things like that

616
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,680
I'm just gonna move on to something else and maybe even think about getting more

617
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,360
technical knowledge on Linux to do my own distro eventually or do contribute

618
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,840
more to other distros so that's actually good so daredevil and I mean

619
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,880
he would love to cap this entire thing off but now some rumor-mongering go ahead

620
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:42,160
there devil good guys it has been a while the problem is mostly the people

621
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,520
apparently the looks are good the technicalities could be improved and the

622
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,760
problem is on the social aspect I see a forthcoming mmm we'll see we'll see I

623
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,280
will see I think this distribution what it is is that what we're watching is can

624
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,560
can can a distribution be led by truly just led by ultimate ultimate design and

625
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,160
if you if that is the distribution's purpose and you fork it and you don't

626
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,680
have those people okay what's the point but we'll see I'd be really I would be

627
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,400
skeptical if I was well one possibility and this is horrible and I hate myself

628
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,000
for even mentioning this but I think one possibility that could happen if someone

629
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,240
forks it and essentially waits for elementary to do a UI update and then

630
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,960
they say oh that's great we take the they take the code they update it to

631
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,520
their fork and they sit there nothing happens and that happens I that's how I

632
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,000
see them overcoming the design thing it's a horrible thing but you know karma's

633
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,360
a beyond becomes the upstream and they start sending it's not sending us the

634
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,680
package of patches and stuff up to them it could happen but the other thing is

635
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,080
it's just one more thing is that people typically are saying that why are you

636
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,920
getting mad at people wanting for money and no one's doing that it's not about

637
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,880
the money if they ask for money great feel free if they sell it for money and

638
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,920
they don't actually give out buying Azure free that's fine there's a lot of

639
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,360
dishes that already do that I don't care it's not about that it's about them

640
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,840
telling people that they are doing something wrong when they're actually

641
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,400
just doing what they said they could do that's a messaging thing that they'll

642
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,240
work on and this is what I point to you when they say we don't need community

643
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,640
managers oh yes you do well yes you do provoke a you had an interesting piece

644
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,520
over at data nation people should go check out yeah take distributions it

645
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:35,160
kind of fits in with this whole thing check out Matt's article over data

646
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,040
nation calm all right well so we gotta let's let's talk about arch and arm here

647
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,360
for a sec I mean this is come on come on this is why we're gathered here today so

648
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,400

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,600
your own cloud server users can get started in less than 55 seconds and

658
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,920
pricing plan started only $5 per month they get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20

659
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,880
gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte terabyte of transfer and digital ocean

660
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,120
is data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and

661
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,280
London but boy let me tell you oh just go over there check this out this is a

662
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,720
masterpiece in design right there speaking a good design it's dat interface

663
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,120
it's intuitive control panel and you can replicate that functionality on a much

664
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,360
larger scale because digital ocean has an API and it's a good API son I'm

665
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,080
saying it's a good one and people are already taking advantage of it because

666
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,420
it's so good you know when something's good people use it like digital ocean

667
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,680
and they're great API so there's a lot of great apps you can just take

668
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,760
advantage of right now that make it even more powerful like command-line stuff

669
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,400
for your Linux box applets for your Ubuntu menu shoot they probably got

670
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,120
scopes who knows go check it out you can write your own you you could write the

671
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,960
first Ubuntu phone scope oh my gosh you should do this actually you should go

672
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,280
over to digital ocean and write a scope for the Ubuntu touch phone thingy to

673
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,640
manage your droplet that would be so awesome because they got a straightforward

674
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,320
API you can do that you can manage your systems you got your DNS management your

675
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,360
snapshots your one-click installations all through this crazy great interface

676
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,600
all sitting on top of Linux powered by KVM all riding on top of SSD drives so

677
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,080
that way you get that IO performance then connected to tier one bandwidth it

678
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,280
is an amazing package and you can try it out two months for free when you use the

679
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,440
promo code do unplugged I love it we're gonna tell you more about our super cool

680
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,200
video conferencing system that we built for last that's all fancy HD great audio

681
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,280
quality high-fidelity all powered by digital ocean droplets we'll tell you

682
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,400
more about it in an upcoming episode and it's like when I go to deploy some

683
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,880
infrastructure on Linux now this is just where I go it's so fast it's so great

684
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,800
the values there and it's all under one account digital ocean comm do unplug when

685
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,440
you check out in a big thank you digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged

686
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,560
program alright so let's bring in warhead here hey warhead welcome to the

687
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,960
Linux unplugged show and first of all start with your first name because I

688
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,960
don't want to just you have you on the internet known as warhead and tell us a

689
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,160
little bit about yourself don't worry I've already been known around the

690
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,000
internet for about ten years as warheads anyways okay my actual name is Jason

691
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,560
plum okay and I'm one of the core developers well Jason I'm really glad

692
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,960
you could make it because this is getting to be a pretty interesting

693
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,840
category and it's one that we want to spend a little more time talking about

694
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,360
from time to time on the unplugged show and maybe we could start could you give

695
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,400
us a little background on the arch Linux arm project like when it's been around

696
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,520
and anything like that the UK to share with us yeah sure so in 2009 before I

697
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,280
was actually involved with the project a little thing that some of you may have

698
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,720
heard of called the Shiva plug came out of the market oh yeah and at the time

699
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,640
the only thing you could get was Debian and a particularly aging version of

700
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,080
Debian at the time as well and then after that a commercial piece called the

701
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,800
pogo plug came out of the market after that and you had a very specific set of

702
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,920
change and everything went out of date rather horribly fast but at the same

703
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,320
time people went this box literally is the same thing as the Shiva box and I

704
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,760
can get it for a reasonable price hmm what if I can run the full-blown Linux

705
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,160
instead of just what they gave me hmm and that's where the original project of

706
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,560
open pogo came along that was where you would have our binaries that would you

707
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,200
would use on that through an originally a mix through IP case so it was sort of

708
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:47,560
in the Debian behavior and then we became plug block plug box in early 2010

709
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:53,440
and that's when we actually became officially a port of arch to the arm

710
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,600
architecture and at the time we only had arm v5 support now this isn't

711
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,400
necessarily so could you help me understand the relationship between I

712
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,480
arch Linux arm and arch Linux it's because it's not officially part of arch

713
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,680
is that correct or am I wrong no you're very much correct we are not the same

714
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,960
distribution if you go to their forums and ask about our stuff they will point

715
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,520
you at us and if you ask us about Nvidia we will point you at them either which

716
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,520
way neither one of us knows how to fix those proprietary bits if we aren't

717
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,280
familiar with it hmm just kind of how it is but we actually got our name as it is

718
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,080
today in early 2011 and before we did that we got permission from the arch

719
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,440
Linux team and everybody involved there to use the name arch Linux appropriately

720
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,880
and contacted arm and got their rights to actually use the arm name and the

721
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,640
logo obviously unaltered so we can actually call ourselves and label

722
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,040
ourselves arch Linux arm so we are a complete port that is separate from arch

723
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,440
Linux but we derive 90% of our package builds directly from the ABS trees a you

724
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,240
are etc and then anything that we do differently we put into our github okay

725
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,640
so that sounds pretty actually pretty clean and pretty manageable really from

726
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,240
like from a standpoint of somebody on my side and wimpy you wanted to kind of

727
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,000
mention something up from the arch developer side yeah when when I was was

728
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,280
first working on the Marte packages for arch Linux I was aware that alarm take

729
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,960
the packages from the ABS tree and cross compile them and build them into their

730
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,240
repository so and I it's still running here I've got four alarm boxes running

731
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,440
in a cluster here that we're doing that initial building work and I built all of

732
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,840
my packages on arm to make sure when I release them into the official repository

733
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,480
they'd build cleanly and just flow into arch Linux arm and I know other

734
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,000
developers are mindful of that and do some testing before they release things

735
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,680
and there's this good bug reporting coming back the other way from the alarm

736
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,280
team into the arch bug tracker if we release something that doesn't build on

737
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,840
on arm very good so warhead what would be so this is when I told a few folks

738
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,760
that we're gonna be chatting with you on the show today they said this so the

739
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,240
response I got is oh why would you run arch on an arm device like what's the

740
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,560
advantage there and so warhead what are some typical use cases for arch on there

741
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,360
okay so what's the biggest problem that you see with an Ubuntu install from

742
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,200
somebody who has used arch and you know that when you install Ubuntu out of the

743
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,000
box what's the biggest difference between an Ubuntu or a fedora 20 etc

744
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,880
so arch install it's not even necessarily the age no it's your amount

745
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,320
of decisions that have been made for you yeah yeah of course sure but couldn't

746
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,640
you say I mean there's other there's a ways of paring that down there's things

747
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,840
coming along yes is it is it not is it not the rolling nature that is appealing

748
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,800
to some people is that not part of it no the rolling nature and the being able to

749
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,520
keep up with upstream packages at the speed at which arch itself can keep up

750
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,480
with those is definitely the advantage of being able to run arch on an arm

751
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,600
device especially where you have kernels that are evolving at a weekly pace right

752
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,200
we have some of our devices that are actually running RC kernels they get

753
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,680
rebuilt every time Linus tags hmm yeah and this area is under you have element

754
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,920
it isn't ridiculously rapid development and now we're finally getting

755
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,280
manufacturers to listen to us and begin doing the mainline work Marvel was

756
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,680
traditionally a problem in that area and they've been kind enough to listen to us

757
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,800
after several years of going please please please can you try and they've

758
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,020
enlisted to help with the guys over at free electrons and it's where you see a

759
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:00,600
lot of the Marvel tree the and the EBU architecture stuff coming in from their

760
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,600
work that's fascinating and so has it been just the size of the community over

761
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,880
time has gotten larger has it been the persistence that you think has made them

762
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,360
start listening to what has changed that attitude on their part as more

763
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,880
consumers get the devices and say somebody gets an older Android tablet

764
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,320
that they've they can now run Linux on now tablets being a really special case

765
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,000
because of the nature of the drivers but the pogo plugs the NAS devices that you

766
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,360
may have floating around the office or have given to one of your clients in the

767
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,280
past the various other things that are available I mean the entire generations

768
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,680
of the Beagle boards the Beagle bones of course the Raspberry Pi one and two the

769
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,600
entire o droid line everything that olem X makes like cannot leave them out they

770
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,720
have created a demand in a market space that didn't exist before and previously

771
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,160
you were as a manufacturer working almost exclusively with corporate and

772
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,120
you're dealing with things that are going to be put in place and then

773
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,280
maintained at their state and then replaced in the near future hmm whereas

774
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,880
now you're getting consumer device who generally speaking these are people that

775
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,800
are technical and they want to go and see hey how well can I make this work in

776
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,680
a low power environment be that from a power usage standpoint or a low CPU

777
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,320
power you know which way do they want to look at that aspect and they're

778
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:29,200
realizing that to really keep up with the Linux world they can't sit in the

779
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,880
dark ages and just plug their ears and I remember if anybody has any questions

780
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,680
for I guess take me mum in the chat room I I guess what I wanted to kind of get

781
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,240
out of you is I'm trying to I'm still trying to place all of this in in in my

782
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,160
world in context in my world and so I'm curious from you warhead what is sort of

783
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,600
one of your favorite implementations of an arch arm powered maybe it's a server

784
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,120
maybe it's a it's powering a combat robot I don't know but could you give me

785
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,520
an example of an implementation where you've been like that is a great use of

786
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,120
that technology I may set the mumble room off but I do know of at least three

787
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:15,240
drones that are running us personally I have a Zeiss L NAS 325 under my desk

788
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,440
that runs the lighting control inside my house runs MPD that streams out to my

789
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,320
chromecasts and is one of my primary sources to feed my chromecasts through

790
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,400
my plex that's pretty neat and rotten curves you had a you had it wasn't me

791
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,280
on ring for noobs yeah is the arch Linux package in early structure in the noobs

792
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,840
for Raspberry Pi is that an alarm build the original images were made by us the

793
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,640
foundation was not able to keep up we issued a new image on a monthly basis

794
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:53,040
and they generally updated the image every three months and at that point it

795
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,400
was a month behind every time so now we are only available through the net

796
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,440
installer type which uses a download to get the tar to actually do the install

797
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,960
so that's why we don't make SD card image files anymore because their CDN

798
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,760
apparently couldn't update fast enough but the there's the news has an install

799
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,520
doesn't it then there is now a net install noobs SD card image yes but the

800
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,960
here's my noobs image that has all the distro bits on it no we are no longer a

801
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,280
part of that image okay okay very good so warhead if I'm listening at home and

802
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,600
I'm thinking okay maybe I want to start playing with this I know I can get a

803
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,000
device that's not too much money I could load Linux on there what's your favorite

804
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,760
what are you recommending people grab the Raspberry Pi what do you tell people

805
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,640
to try with they're gonna jump into this I think it really depends on what

806
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,640
exactly they want to learn what are they already familiar with when it comes to

807
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,400
Linux personally if you want something low power that has all the options you

808
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,000
want to be able to get to the Odroid c1 is an awesome choice if you want to

809
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,500
learn about how all the components interact and maybe can take some of your

810
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:04,640
knowledge from Arduino and immediately apply it over into running with Linux

811
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,240
and having all the GPIO and SPI access that's very direct and has a lot of

812
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:14,920
existing documentation through sites like Adafruit etc then the pie and the

813
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,400
pie two are possible options but if you're looking for sheer capability the

814
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,240
Odroid line currently outclasses everyone on the market except for the

815
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,600
Chromebooks ah yeah I'm noticing in your forums it seems like a lot of people

816
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,320
like the Odroid a lot of people using that in there so yeah well you get a

817
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,120
very performant device and they come with the capability of using eMMC 5.0

818
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:42,600
which is a ridiculously fast storage medium the Raspberry Pi 1 & 2 have the

819
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:48,160
same SD controller that runs at the same speed and also the Ethernet is much

820
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,840
faster on the c1 as well yeah because it's actually attached to a bus

821
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,380
design for Ethernet big difference then yeah a lot of people talking about the

822
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:05,000
c1 c1 on the arch Linux arm dot org form so it looks like that yeah the Odroid c1

823
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,040
hits the price point of the Raspberry Pi and even if you take the direct

824
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:15,480
comparison between the Raspberry Pi 2 and the c1 yeah that had been done all

825
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,680
over the place on the net at this point yeah it definitely comes down to exactly

826
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,600
what you want to do with it there are some things in which the Raspberry Pi

827
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,280
does win unfortunately most of our users would prefer the performance and

828
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,440
behavior that you get out of the c1 yeah that makes sense and it seems like

829
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,320
that'd be a good way a good way to go if you want support from the community too

830
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:39,080
yeah right well again it's all which way you want to go but yeah warhead thank

831
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,720
you for the fascinating insights I mean I then I'll just I'm just kind of

832
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,440
getting you know my head wrapped around all of this and I appreciate any kind of

833
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,800
info is there anything you want to touch on before we run yeah just remember that

834
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,040
it's not arch arm it's not arm arch it is arch Linux arm if you want to

835
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,000
abbreviate it's alarm alarm arch Linux arm or alarm I like it and I'll put a

836
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,400
link to the to the board you were talking about up on your on your site

837
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,240
there well check in with us from time to time and keep us up to date on cool

838
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,280
developments and stuff well the appropriate people know how to reach me

839
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:13,480
yeah very good well and I I one of these days one of these days I'm actually gonna

840
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,560
get around to setting up a Raspberry Pi in here because I have one from the same

841
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,560
person who got in touch with you a little birdie yeah I think you have a

842
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,120
u3 floating around somewhere too yeah maybe so maybe so oh I guess and

843
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,400
mandatory I should ask you where do you want folks to go to find out more about

844
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,760
the project oh that's very simple arch Linux arm org there you go arts Linux

845
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,880
arm org and we will have a link in the show notes I might also put a link to

846
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,880
Jason's blog in there and the team link on the wiki as well all right well

847
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,300
warhead you sir are more than welcome to stick around we're going to shoot the

848
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,720
the breeze on the first actual sandbox Linux application that seems to be

849
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,680
portable but first I'm going to tell you about my cell phone provider and that's

850
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,580
ting go to linux.ting.com right now once you and support this show you also got a

851
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,720
$25 discount off your first ting device or a $25 credit ting is mobile that

852
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,480
really does make sense no more contracts no more early to my name no more

853
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,400
illiterate nation fees $6 a month and then you just pay for your usage they

854
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,160
have an amazing dashboard that kicks every single other dashboard or those

855
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,560
other guys don't even have dashboards so I guess I don't even call them that

856
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,320
they're crappy little slow websites that are horrible and seem like they're

857
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,480
designed for an explorer don't even hold a candle to what ting can do so not only

858
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,240
does ting have the best dashboard out there kicks all their butts they've also

859
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,000
got no whole customer service they got a whole great range of devices they're

860
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,360
unlocked they're adding GSM supports they're gonna have CDMA and GSM support

861
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,560
by the end of the month they're rolling out a beta program right now you can go

862
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,160
pre-order an iPhone 6 or get yourself a fancy one of them I think I think myself

863
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,160
the new moto x2 looks really sweet anyways they got a whole range of

864
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,600
devices seriously I want you to go over to ting and check them out they are an

865
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,000
amazing company and where your money should go because think about this if

866
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,840
they're doing this and they're putting pressure on the big guys and if we can

867
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,640
get them to keep putting pressure on the big guys that's good for the entire damn

868
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,320
mobile industry and one of the things I'd like to recommend you check out from

869
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,160
time to time is the ting blog they have stuff posted up there all the time and

870
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,780
this is really a great way to get sort of insights into the company and they

871
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,320
just recently read refined a few feet of a few details on their bring your own

872
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,300
device program and they have those changes up on their block again no

873
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,440
contract nor the termination fee you only pay for what you use and they also

874
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,440
have an early termination relief program if you're stuck in a contract right now

875
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,760
it's flat six dollars for the month then it's just your usage on top of that no

876
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,320
hold customer service go check them out at linux.ting.com I've been using them

877
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,560
for over two years and I'm even more excited than ever as a customer out of

878
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,520
the rolling out GSM because when I go to events and stuff like that I'm just

879
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,660
gonna use whichever network works best and I know things gonna have that super

880
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,320
dialed in linux.ting.com supports the show and gets you a discount off your

881
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,880
first device thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show and

882
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:50,800
thanks to you guys for supporting our sponsor so the first fully sandbox Linux

883
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,680
desktop app was showed off this week it's pretty exciting has a few

884
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,060
requirements no x11 right there totally impossible if you have x11 cannot do it

885
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,780
it cannot be secured enough got to have Wayland and they also have to have KD

886
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,040
bus which means you got to have a super modern kernel and totally up-to-date

887
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,760
system D to allow desktop integration to port fully be filtered down to the

888
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,280
kernel level so wait recently using the big strides made in Wayland loaded on

889
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,480
fedora 21 we can start to see some true genuine sandboxing and this is over on

890
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,280
Alexander Larson's blog he's a developer and right here he's gonna start on a

891
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,040
fedora workstation a build of never ball running inside an absolute minimal

892
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,820
sandbox it is absolutely independent of the host distribution has no access to

893
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:40,720
any system or user files other than the ones from the runtime and the

894
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,120
application itself has no access to hardware devices other than DRI for GL

895
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,720
render because that's what's been allowed no network access I can only get

896
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,080
input via Wayland can only show graphics via Wayland can only do audio out via

897
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,620
pulse audio and of course all the other benefits of sandboxing like can't touch

898
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,320
other stuff on the file system and as you would expect as he starts it up he

899
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,520
builds the container right here so he's just done he's just done all of that and

900
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,680
now he's about to fire it up and he runs it from the gnome launcher and from the

901
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,120
gnome launcher it starts up in a sandboxed environment and now he's

902
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,240
playing never ball in a sandbox that is so wild and in theory he could pick this

903
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,120
up and move another distribution if they had all of the same things like Wayland

904
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:29,360
KD bus system D and all of that it is so crazy trying to think back to when we

905
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,800
had the whole monkey suit bet and all that and where all things are evolving

906
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,680
to now yeah with Wayland and everything and what Wayland's making possible well

907
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,040
that's what I found really striking about the entire thing is that this is

908
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,920
possible like almost before all of this technology is laid down mm-hmm it's like

909
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,400
it's like here that we're gonna do where we're gonna do KD bus that we I mean

910
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,760
obviously you couldn't ship this today but it's not close up poppy go ahead

911
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,640
you were something it's what do we get wrong something on the details what

912
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,960
what's the matter no no I'm confused as to how this is the first given the unity

913
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:08,240
next desktop ISO that's been around for months has had siloed applications like

914
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,840
this already so I'm confused how this is the first this is the first one of the

915
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,000
this is the first one of the kind of version that we've been talking about

916
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,720
for several episodes like this this whole gnome start with the gnome

917
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,120
application go all the way down to the kernel sandboxing right which we have on

918
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,800
Ubuntu I which is why I'm confused why this is the first fully sandboxed Linux

919
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:33,360
desktop app when it's the only one I mean this is the one this is the this is

920
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,960
what we've been talking about for a few weeks it's gonna be coming and now it's

921
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,280
right I don't I don't know I'm using this implementation yes yes yeah you're

922
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:48,680
using Wayland and under context using all that but I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure

923
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:54,520
Ubuntu's is very nice poppy I'm sure I'm sure lots of people use how does it is

924
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:59,120
it now is the sandboxing under is it Ubuntu is it legitimate sandboxing or is

925
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:04,760
it app armor and enforced profiles it's a palmer so it's not really sandboxing

926
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,040
why not well if you let go through the end go through the steps that he's got

927
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,180
there no access to system files check no access to hardware devices check no

928
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,520
network access check how it's actually done though like the way so so the app

929
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,880
armor is things happen it's checked against a set of rules and then denied

930
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,280
whereas in sandboxing those things just don't even exist for the application I

931
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:27,400
mean it's not really I mean at the end of the day it's kind of the same thing

932
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,080
but fundamentally like the application under app armor can be aware that there

933
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,680
is a device out there it just is denied access to that device whereas a

934
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,180
sandboxed application would be completely unaware that there's even a

935
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:44,240
hardware device to begin with I think you're splitting hairs I mean if you

936
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,000
want to if but if you wanted to if you wanted to say that you could say Sousa

937
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,520
had sandboxing ten years ago when they first shipped that open open Sousa or

938
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,440
when they first shipped Sousa Enterprise with with app arm I mean that's not it's

939
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,080
interpretation of a definition I at the end of the day I kind of leaning with

940
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,680
where Chris is at and that one one's missing these things and another one's

941
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,280
comparing them based on rules that seems like a fairly good thing how we label

942
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,880
them we could label one you know a Pepsi challenge one and then Pepsi

943
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,280
challenge to just kind of put that I'll tell you the difference the reason why

944
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,320
I'm talking about this one because this is the first one where you could see

945
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,120
this this is something you could pick it up and move it between distros right

946
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,480
you don't have to have app armor profiles it's not it's not a boon to

947
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,040
specific this would move you could pick this up and have the same stack on an

948
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:31,760
arch box and run never ball in on the arch desktop and that's kind of the big

949
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,320
piece interesting right yeah so I don't know if now the other question is how do

950
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:41,000
you deliver that but yeah yeah and it's all up in the air who knows I mean a

951
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,600
lot of technologies as well though yeah which need to be there yeah not as

952
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:51,240
widespread yet very nascent technologies right now yeah so I think I think it's

953
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,840
interesting to watch but I think like like you're saying it's not gonna be

954
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,800
probably not even this year maybe because you figure there's no way you're

955
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,920
gonna get out in the next couple of distro release cycles no way so you know

956
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,520
if you think of it in terms of distro release cycles it's a ways out it's not

957
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,240
coming well and this particular implementation is as you put you know

958
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,120
it's a ways out where a boon to his implementation and their vision of doing

959
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,320
essentially you know their vision of it is available to everyone now so that I

960
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,840
mean there's some benefits there too you could go up armor up by your ability

961
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,760
right now yeah you betcha and I you know I I also just from somebody who had to

962
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,200
implement app armor and se Linux I always found app armor to be a little

963
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:34,800
easier to use but yeah I have I actually prefer so and better branding hey one

964
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,040
actually one last story that just because every now that I like to prove

965
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:42,000
that Richard Stallman was absolutely right and we probably should have been

966
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:51,500
listening to RMS all along okay yeah that's cool no I did you hear about the

967
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:57,320
equation group where the Kaspersky Kaspersky labs Kaspersky the Kaspersky

968
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:03,080
labs guys over in Moscow have pinned hard hard drive firmware based malware

969
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:07,960
square on the nose of the NSA and it kind of makes that Richard Stallman's

970
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,880
point that all the firmware in your machine should be free I'm just saying

971
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,320
oh no I agree with his vision that's just the implementation that I have

972
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,960
concerns about but now in defense of his vision he's been spot-on for a while I

973
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:23,760
mean like really spot-on I just wish there was a way to give him another

974
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,240
spokesman maybe in front of him that is more presentable to the company I mean

975
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,080
I mean even Richard Stallman has to use a hard drive how can I exactly can you

976
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,880
how can you like how can we as just regular like just humans how can we

977
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,040
possibly think about the firmware in every single device like can't be done

978
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,520
and that's the problem that's the rub is is you're basically forced into you know

979
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,560
living living in a cabin in the woods and just saying screw everything or you

980
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:56,000
know basically accepting a certain level of it and I say accepting with a shutter

981
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,800
I hate the idea myself but you know there's a certain level of we're here

982
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,920
and unfortunately our ability all we can do is make everyone known know about it

983
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,440
and hopefully folks will gripe enough that something will happen maybe enough

984
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,880
open source projects will get together and create a multi-billion dollar

985
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,080
company that can start reproducing these pieces of hardware without that stuff I

986
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:18,320
don't know I wish it would happen I really do but I just have concerns that

987
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,160
it may be too late I hate to say that but you know I mean there doesn't you

988
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:28,320
want to chime in with something yes one is once it becomes a company and the

989
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,000
off the suggestion might just give it becomes usually tight or to

990
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,160
responsibilities to a government so it may just result into the same thing

991
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:44,160
again that said there is another thing that I sometimes really wonder is we

992
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:50,160
campaign so much because what there was a potential was that campaign an open

993
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,680
eyes an opening of eyes off the actual potential right leveraging that did it

994
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:04,640
did they make them aware of it yes because it's like in like 13 years it's

995
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,000
more than 30 years with this mission and this for example this project is 14

996
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,280
years so it's off it's a baby that's funny that's a good catch I don't think

997
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,680
so I think they're probably pretty clever to figure out on their own but

998
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,400
that is sort of funny like a self-fulfilling prophecy if you had a

999
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,640
time machine the way to prevent massive NSA surveillance would be to make RMS

1000
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:27,480
not out there warning of it that's a big great that'd be a great Linux nerd novel

1001
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,340
right there I think that would be right travel and dinosaurs and you got

1002
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:35,400
yourself a seller dude RMS fan fiction why is this not a thing I think it has

1003
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,040
to become one okay so one last little public service announcement before we

1004
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:44,560
run so as we talked about and I got to tell you I maybe gonna have to go find

1005
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,960
myself some anxiety medications it's gonna be it's dramatic but as we said

1006
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,240
next week is

1007
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:57,520
so your Linux unplugged show episode 81 will be a retro extravaganza of your best

1008
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:03,200
of moments but don't worry see these new these are like it's new in a way it's

1009
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,200
stuff you've seen your favorite moments but now available with the self

1010
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,400
gratifying feature that we've just implemented known as hindsight so now

1011
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,840
you can listen to the things we said with that smug hindsight and nail

1012
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,520
everything we say nails for it so they were just gonna do that next week

1013
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,940
because of the beard apocalypse and then we'll be back in full force with the

1014
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,240
show in episode 82 but it's gonna be good episode because they're all the

1015
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,720
ones that you guys submitted a while ago when we did the best of for the holiday

1016
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,680
season there were so many and we threw out a bunch of they're like wait a minute

1017
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,680
these these are really good we should use these again we're like what would we

1018
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,440
ever use these for we're not gonna do a best of we're never gonna take a week

1019
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,160
off and then we guys like actually yeah I gotta leave and nobody's gonna be here

1020
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,520
to edit and that's the weekend of scale so and I'm like oh you know what maybe a

1021
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,680
best of would be a good idea and so it's not a best of it's a retro look back I

1022
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,280
don't know what the difference is other than it's slightly different wording

1023
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,120
branding yeah yeah exactly Matt so you get to take next Tuesday off but tune in

1024
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,200
and listen to all the crazy things you said as like you know homework or

1025
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,600
something okay sounds good sounds good and I'll go check out Matt's article of

1026
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:12,560
data nation is a great article about the danger or risk I guess of boutique

1027
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,420
Linux distributions as I got totally nailed it totally nailed it and you could

1028
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,800
also comment come over join us live on Tuesdays over JB live TV hang out in the

1029
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,680
mumble room Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar for the local time alright everybody

1030
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,760
thanks so much to this week's episode join us next week for episode 81 when we

1031
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:56,320
have the retro flavored edition of unplugged

1032
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:04,040
we should do we gotta get like a special group of people sending like a runs

1033
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,680
Linux in the field we need more runs Linux in the yes so if that would be

1034
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,600
cool when you're traveling or something and take a picture I'll even accept a

1035
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,600
selfie if it's in front of a Linux machine send it into the Linux action

1036
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,960
show Jupiter broadcasting.com with runs Linux in the subject I'll have to get

1037
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,840
you an aerial picture yeah I need to get up to Ferndale and see I've been meaning

1038
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,400
to do this for a while I need to get up to Ferndale and see Jed cuz he's got

1039
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,720
he's got lots of runs Linux up there yeah that'd be great that'd be some

1040
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,120
really cool stuff a lot of heavy networking armed with ARCH sound the

1041
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,860
alarm those are good JBtitles.com do you see that American prison where

1042
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:42,400
they're learning development on Linux yeah I did that's you know well it's

1043
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,600
shaking more time you don't have to pay for to educate people on the system to

1044
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,080
be able to do something when they get out oh we're paying there you go trust

1045
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,920
me you're paying for it yeah oh no we're paying for them to be there but we're

1046
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,720
not paying to teach them to run an OS they don't have to pay for in the first

1047
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,920
place yeah I'm the open source Regis that's what Regis is about.

1048
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:08,800
yeah that beard pocalypse music is perfect because I did have a small heart

1049
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,400
attack when you played it yeah your heart just drops in your your feet it's

1050
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:18,800
like oh I'm gonna be playing a special edition of women's tech radio today on

1051
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,760
the stream a little bit and you know there's some people they've been

1052
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,480
interviewing some ladies on there that are big-time Linux users like one of

1053
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,880
the one of the one of the gals they interviewed was a big system D fan

1054
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,680
I was like what really oh they start how much system dealing okay that's

1055
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:38,400
interesting that's cool yeah I was just at a play lug meeting last night where a

1056
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:49,760
Gentoo developer was talking about system D oh if it got to the Ubuntu

1057
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,400
project you know it's gonna eventually get to Gentoo those guys that are

1058
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,880
going on if gentoo start talking about system D we're gonna have another system

1059
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:10,600
the flame war they do have it separated out so you can actually replace open RC

1060
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:14,840
at the time yeah to be able to do that now so you can actually replace open RC

1061
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:19,660
or just install system DS binary so that you can manage remote items through

1062
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:24,640
system D journal control machine control etc so I mean they're using bits and

1063
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,560
pieces of it from the user land you can use it as the init you don't have to

1064
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:35,000
etc ZFS for the wins just posted in the chat room about these bloody HP right

1065
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:44,160
that so here's the the final report HP amazing HP are they are I don't have the

1066
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,160
words actually I don't have the the derogatory superlative that sums up

1067
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:55,480
their incompetence sufficiently so after they've done after trying to place the

1068
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:02,960
order four times and and then and then cancelling it twice okay so on two

1069
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,880
occasions they cancelled the order we placed so we were like right enough of

1070
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,520
that nonsense we'll we'll just cancel the accessories order and we'll we'll

1071
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:19,160
find something else my boss has been off in Singapore for three weeks doing some

1072
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:23,240
business down there and of course you've got every vendor imaginable has got

1073
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,800
storefront you know shops down there so he's been able to go around the

1074
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,440
bazaars and have a look at everything and actually touch it feel it play with

1075
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:35,440
it and and he's come to the right conclusion he's he's bought himself a

1076
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,840
brand new think pad x1 carbon yeah that's what he's that's what he's got

1077
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,600
and that's what he's traveling back with and I think this is a very wise

1078
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:52,040
decision and then today we we get an email from Hewlett-Packard saying our

1079
01:04:52,040 --> 01:05:00,360
order has been dispatched and then and then moments later fuck mothering HP 14

1080
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:10,520
Z turns up at the office two weeks after you cancelled the order and the things

1081
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:17,600
just turned up and they've billed us for it this is two and a half weeks after

1082
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:23,400
they dated the last order that they cancelled no as in you said they said an

1083
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:35,160
email sent an email saying it was dispatched that oh moments yeah so it's

1084
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:51,400
really been the gift that keeps on giving
