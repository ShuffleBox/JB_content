1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Wes, did you see that the Fedora 31 beta came out today?

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,560
Oh, no.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,000
That's exciting.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,440
I'm already jonesing for it.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,320
But I was looking at it, something in there

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,320
has me a little nervous.

7
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,800
They're switching from cgroups1 to cgroups2.

8
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,520
Upgrade.

9
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't really understand what that means.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,540
And one of the things they say in there

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,720
is, if your tool expects cgroups1, it may break.

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,560
And I'm thinking, well, what tool is that?

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,200
Is that one of my tools?

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,720
I don't know.

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,340
You're going to have to read the docs, Chris.

16
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm already looking forward to it, though.

17
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,040
I got the itch.

18
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
I got up this morning, and my laptop was like,

19
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,640
hey, can we upgrade?

20
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,480
And I'm like, no, laptop, it's a beta.

21
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
You know how it does that?

22
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,960
Right.

23
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,440
So then I'm moving along, and it's like, hey, Chris.

24
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,280
I'm like, what laptop?

25
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,180
And it's like, I'd like to do an upgrade to Fedora 31.

26
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,520
It's got that new gnome shell.

27
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,260
And I'm like, no, the beta just came out today, laptop.

28
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,760
Stop it.

29
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,640
Calm down.

30
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,160
Yeah.

31
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,240
And then I get to the studio today.

32
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,000
It's like, hey, Chris.

33
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,160
Hey, Chris, you got fast internet here.

34
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,280
You could do the update.

35
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,720
You won't leave me alone, Wes.

36
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,640
You know, I'm honestly very impressed

37
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
you've made it this far.

38
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,800
I don't want to do the beta.

39
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,760
I don't want to run a beta.

40
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,440
But my laptop won't shut up about it.

41
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,520
On your machine.

42
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,020
What?

43
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:14,120
Hello there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 319.

44
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,920
My name is Chris.

45
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
My name is Wes.

46
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,320
Hello, Wes.

47
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:16,880
Hello.

48
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,600
Big show today.

49
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,720
Huge show.

50
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,940
We have not one but two guests joining us today

51
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,240
to explain various things that need explained,

52
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,760
and of course, we have some big community news to get into,

53
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,000
as well as some new releases of one of our favorite tools.

54
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,560
Oh, boy.

55
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,200
That's right.

56
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,760
That's right.

57
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,800
We've got some other community events to share with you,

58
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,680
as well as some pics.

59
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,120
We've got, well, you could say like a whole rack of a show.

60
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,240
Like, it's not like a half rack of a show.

61
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,960
Big rack, yeah.

62
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,680
Yeah, it's a full rack.

63
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,980
So to really help us dig into all of this,

64
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,480
we really got to say hello over there to Mr. Cheese and Mr.

65
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,720
Alex.

66
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,240
Hey, guys.

67
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,160
Well, hello, guys.

68
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,280
Buongiorno.

69
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,000
Hey, make yourself comfortable.

70
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,720
Make sure you grab yourself a cup of water there.

71
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,840
Wes brought in water for everybody.

72
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,800
Of course.

73
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,960
And thanks for joining us.

74
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,000
And sparkling, by the way.

75
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,520
Sparkling.

76
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Oh, really?

77
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,640
Nice, Wes.

78
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,440
Everybody's going to have the burps now, though.

79
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,480
Oh, whoops.

80
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,020
And also, time-appropriate greetings

81
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,680
to that mumble room.

82
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,600
Hello, virtual lug.

83
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,100
Hello.

84
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,080
Hello, hello, hello.

85
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,440
Hello.

86
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm noticing we not only have a nice showing there

87
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,440
in the main mumble room, but we've got a good show

88
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,800
in there in the quiet listening, the low-latency listening,

89
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,000
as we call it, there in the mumble room.

90
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,560
I think it's like one of the best low-latency, low-bandwidth

91
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,320
ways to listen to the show.

92
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,160
Like you're right here in studio with us, basically.

93
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,640
You do get a special studio mix.

94
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
And we're glad to see you there.

95
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,560
That's true.

96
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
That's true.

97
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, let's start things off with some community news

98
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,080
that I'm honestly a little shocked to start with.

99
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,200
Today, as we record, it's been announced

100
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,760
that Richard Stallman has resigned

101
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,080
as president and director of the Free Software Foundation

102
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,240
and from the MIT CSAIL?

103
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,160
Is that how we say it?

104
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,720
CSAIL.

105
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,840
CSAIL department over his comments

106
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,520
related to Jeffrey Epstein.

107
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,440
Huge.

108
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,000
First, in order of events, I saw the announcement about MIT.

109
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,280
And then I saw the announcement directly

110
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,920
from the Free Software Foundation.

111
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,120
They write, on September 16, 2019,

112
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,280
Richard M. Stallman, the founder and president

113
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,920
of the Free Software Foundation, resigned as president

114
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,400
and from its board of directors.

115
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,820
The board will be conducting a search for the new president

116
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,800
beginning immediately.

117
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,040
You can find more details on fsf.org when they know more.

118
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,920
This is huge.

119
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,000
And it's been also something of a bit of a fascination of mine

120
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,880
to watch the mainstream media begin to report this story.

121
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,260
It's connected to a huge scandal now.

122
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,760
And they refer to him as computer scientist

123
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,640
and open software advocate.

124
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,400
Oh, boy.

125
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,320
Wow.

126
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,640
He has resigned.

127
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,300
The scandal tied to Jeffrey Epstein

128
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,040
is related to $7.5 million in donations

129
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,760
that he gave to the MIT Media Lab, which

130
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,680
was far more than what was previously disclosed

131
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,160
than the group inside MIT was discussing this issue when

132
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,060
Richard Stallman made his views about some of the victims

133
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,320
clear.

134
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,080
Parts of that quote were then picked up by the media

135
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,120
after it was blogged about.

136
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,400
And it's really kind of over the last few days

137
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,760
since we recorded, it's turned into quite a firestorm.

138
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,640
Absolutely.

139
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,840
Kind of blew up, right?

140
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,760
We got insight into what seemed like indefensible remarks.

141
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,840
And Stallman has a long history, kind of brought that back

142
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,680
to light, too.

143
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,520
One of the things that I saw was it

144
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,520
was a new group of individuals that

145
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
were learning about his views on certain topics that didn't

146
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,620
previously know about that.

147
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,240
Some of us, we've gone to his website over the last decade

148
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,660
plus, we know what his views are on some of these things

149
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,200
and have considered it to be a little gross for a while.

150
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,720
But a new round of individuals over this last weekend,

151
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,680
really kind of starting the middle of last week,

152
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,520
discovered some of these things.

153
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,600
But I think what I believe is important to take here

154
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
from all of this is we shouldn't frame the conversation

155
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,240
as a reaction to comments that Richard Stallman made

156
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,460
about Jeffrey Epstein's victims.

157
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,400
This is really the end result of a pattern of behavior

158
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,900
over decades that has eventually led to some kind of response.

159
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,840
I think we all kind of knew this was likely

160
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,080
coming for Richard Stallman.

161
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,480
Those of us that have followed this for a while.

162
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,720
Right.

163
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
And I think you're right.

164
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,280
At least in the wider community, he's

165
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,040
mostly known for his fairly extreme philosophies

166
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,600
and ideas about free software, at least viewed that way

167
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,560
by many.

168
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,160
But there is this undercurrent.

169
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,360
And if you've been paying attention,

170
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
this has always been there.

171
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,960
Yeah, you followed this pretty closely for Linux headlines.

172
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,920
And there was a moment where it seemed like something was

173
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,160
going to have to give pretty soon.

174
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,960
Yeah, absolutely.

175
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, over the weekend, both the Software Freedom Conservancy

176
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,760
made a statement saying that Richard Stallman shouldn't

177
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,040
have this position anymore.

178
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,480
And then the executive director of the Gnome Foundation

179
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,900
said that in his view, the foundations

180
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,600
could no longer have a formal relationship

181
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,240
if Richard Stallman was still there.

182
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,920
Wow.

183
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,760
Yeah, they write, we admire the work

184
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
that the Free Software Foundation staffers

185
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,920
and volunteers have done.

186
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,000
But we have reached a point concluding

187
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,120
that the greatest service to the mission of free software

188
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,920
is for Richard to step down from the SFF.

189
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,200
And if this doesn't happen, then they'll look at, as they write,

190
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,520
severing the historical ties between Gnome, Gnu,

191
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,200
and the Free Software Foundation.

192
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,060
And that would be the only path forward.

193
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,520
Wow.

194
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,240
Like, that was, I mean, something had to break here.

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Absolutely.

196
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,280
And when I saw this happen, because this

197
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,600
was before Richard Stallman's announcements,

198
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,840
I thought to myself, the FSF is going to go down with Stallman.

199
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,240
The two are inseparable.

200
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,440
They are linked.

201
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,240
You can't have one without the other.

202
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,360
That certainly has seemed that way for years.

203
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,840
I was really shocked when I saw this.

204
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,840
But I think it's not super surprising.

205
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,040
Richard Stallman probably wants to take

206
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,120
whatever actions he thinks are best for the longevity

207
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,520
of the foundation.

208
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,240
And it's probably better for the community as a whole

209
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,920
if we don't have someone with this history representing us.

210
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,560
So I think Richard Stallman probably

211
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,880
knew that this was the best move he had to make.

212
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,240
There's a famous quote of Richard Stallman's

213
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,600
that I shared with the team when the news was announced.

214
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,920
And I kind of feel like it's appropriate to read it here

215
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,280
on the show, because it's like one of those prescient quotes

216
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,040
from the man himself, where there's that meme

217
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120
that Richard Stallman was right.

218
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,960
Well, he even has a quote that sort of summarizes this.

219
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,240
Geeks like to think that they can ignore politics.

220
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,400
You can leave politics alone, but politics

221
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,960
won't leave you alone.

222
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,000
He's right.

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,020
And that's exactly what happened here.

224
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm definitely along the same lines as you,

225
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,520
as far as it's been a discovery, a week of discovery

226
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,720
for a lot of people, where we knew after reading his blog,

227
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
there are questionable things in his blog.

228
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,780
I always had kind of a weird feeling about the guy myself,

229
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,240
but what he's done for the Free Software Foundation

230
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,360
and that movement has gotten it to where it is today.

231
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm glad that he is willing to just step down and let

232
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,020
the Free Software Foundation continue with, quite frankly,

233
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,400
better leadership.

234
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,600
All right, well, moving on then.

235
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,980
Let's talk about something that's

236
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,320
pretty exciting for owners of the Raspberry Pi.

237
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,320
There is a first fully functional 64-bit OS

238
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,000
for the Raspberry Pi 4, because right now it's 32-bit only,

239
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
even though it's a 64-bit device.

240
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,640
But who it's from is a bit of a surprise, Wes.

241
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah, it's our friends over at Balena.

242
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,960
Now, if you don't remember.

243
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,600
Yeah, the Etcher people.

244
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,560
But it turns out they do a lot more than that, too.

245
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,600
Yes, that's very true.

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,320
OK, so if you don't remember, Balena OS

247
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,680
is an open source, minimal, Yocto Linux-based,

248
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,120
host operating system that's designed for containers.

249
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,720
It enables a fast and modern workflow

250
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,600
for many different embedded device types,

251
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
and now includes the Raspberry Pi 4.

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,640
Basically, they've got a system in place

253
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,040
to take modern workflows that you might be used to

254
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
on the server, building a new container image,

255
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,720
pushing that up to test, and then eventually into production

256
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,280
and make that work on embedded and IoT applications.

257
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,040
So now you can get the 64-bit goodness

258
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,600
and run side-by-side 32-bit and 64-bit Docker containers

259
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,440
on your Pi.

260
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,820
I kind of like this, because I'm using the Pi exclusively

261
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,980
right now to run Docker containers.

262
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,880
And I did kind of pine about not having a 64-bit OS when

263
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,960
I was loading it up to do server stuff.

264
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,200
And one of the things I didn't fully appreciate

265
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,340
when I bought the Raspberry Pi 4 is

266
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,200
I was buying a machine to run Raspbian,

267
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,280
and pretty much only Raspbian.

268
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,760
When you look at some of the things

269
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,480
that they had to overcome to even make this thing possible,

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,560
it's clear that it's going to take a long time

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,840
before most distros are supporting the Raspberry Pi 4.

272
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,740
Yeah, I mean, basically, there's been a lot of hardware changes,

273
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,520
and you're trying to move over to 64-bit.

274
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,240
So they had to improve stuff in Yocto for the board support

275
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,520
package changes, all that stuff for the Funarm platform,

276
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
and work with their bootloader.

277
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,880
Yeah, the bootloader, the way you initialize the graphics,

278
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,560
the way you initialize the PCI bus, all weird and different.

279
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,080
It's all different on the Pi 4.

280
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,480
So I'll be running Raspbian for a while, I think.

281
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,840
However, you and I very momentarily

282
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,160
did get CentOS running on the Raspberry Pi 4.

283
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,920
Yes, we did.

284
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,520
That was fun.

285
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,800
That was fun.

286
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,640
We had to get it working on a Raspberry Pi 3 first, right?

287
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,800
Isn't that what we did?

288
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,720
And then we patched the kernel on the SD card

289
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,160
and then booted it on the Raspberry Pi 4.

290
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,840
Thankfully, some kind of community member

291
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
out there had built an updated version,

292
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,520
but that was what you had to do before.

293
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,320
That's what they did.

294
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Right, right, yeah.

295
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,960
It was kind of awesome, though, to have CentOS on a Pi 4.

296
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,160
But it was 32-bit as well.

297
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,880
So BalenaOS.

298
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,680
You know, it is neat to just see because they're leveraging

299
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,800
open source distributions and a bunch of the open source

300
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,960
Mobi-based tooling for Docker to build

301
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,120
their customized platform.

302
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
Yeah.

303
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,640
Let's talk about Nextcloud.

304
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,760
Nextcloud 17 is out, and there's some pretty nice features

305
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,640
in here.

306
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,840
The one that really jumps out to me is remote wipe.

307
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,560
All right, so if you permit downloading of documents

308
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
by a third party, you can now wipe the documents

309
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
from the devices after you're done collaborating.

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
So maybe you have a few sensitive things.

311
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,560
You want someone to assess a pre-release of something

312
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,160
and they don't need access afterwards,

313
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,720
Nextcloud can make it happen.

314
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,760
It is a little creepy, though, right?

315
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,960
I mean, once I download something,

316
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
kind of want to keep it.

317
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,560
Yeah, I don't see how it could work

318
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,800
without either a Nextcloud client installed

319
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,400
or you go back to the website and next time you revisit,

320
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,240
somehow it could remove those files.

321
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,360
But I think it's got to be tied into the client.

322
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,560
So it's only of certain probably usefulness.

323
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,600
However, definitely had a scenario one time

324
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,320
where a client had Dropbox where it

325
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,300
was one of those random implementations

326
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,080
where the staff just started using it to share files around.

327
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,600
And then they worked with a contractor who took off

328
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
and took off with the folder on their hard drive.

329
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, I mean, really, that's the story here.

330
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,640
This is an enterprise-friendly feature

331
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,000
and might make it easier for some people to adopt it.

332
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,800
Yeah, they've also been trying to make a bit of a showcase

333
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,760
out of some of their larger government installations

334
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,960
and better support for two-factor authentication.

335
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,440
Now, during the initial sign-up and login process,

336
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,240
a user can set up two-factor authentication and more

337
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,640
services than ever are supported these days, like gateways

338
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,400
that use SMS.

339
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,800
Of course, you have your standard one-time password

340
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,520
services for like Google Authenticator or similar apps.

341
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,640
So they're really all in on the two-factor authentication

342
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,320
now with this release.

343
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,000
That's good to see.

344
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,840
It does look nice, because we're using Nextcloud these days.

345
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,500
Guess that means it's time to update, Wes.

346
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,120
I think it is.

347
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
It's time to update.

348
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,600
Well, let's take a moment and talk about something

349
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,780
a little different.

350
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,080
So in our community is an individual

351
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,960
who's an advocate for PowerShell.

352
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,040
DM is active in several communities,

353
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,760
and he's also the individual behind the PowerShell

354
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,920
on Linux website and Twitter account.

355
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
And I love his story.

356
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
And I wanted to share it with you

357
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,240
and why he thinks PowerShell, which

358
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,680
is a topic that's just like, what?

359
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,180
PowerShell?

360
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,680
Linux?

361
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,560
Bash is perfectly fine.

362
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
We talked about it when it came to Linux for the first time.

363
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,120
We knew it was out there, but I mean, I don't use it.

364
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,940
Even today, though, I was in a Telegram group

365
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,440
where he mentioned using PowerShell,

366
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,960
and somebody was like, blasphemy.

367
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,320
But like so many tools, out of necessity,

368
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,080
you discover something's quite useful.

369
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,920
In DM's case, he's a very clever individual,

370
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,180
and he manages a lot of boxes.

371
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,000
I manage over 20,000 VMs.

372
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah.

373
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
That's a lot of VMs.

374
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,280
And so saving time is extremely important.

375
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,520
And there's an element to this that I can really

376
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,760
fundamentally appreciate.

377
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,920
But I think maybe we start with PowerShell itself.

378
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,960
PowerShell's a bit of a different beast, isn't it?

379
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,600
It's not like Bash.

380
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
No, I mean, it comes from a different heritage, right?

381
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,720
It's not really a Unix tool.

382
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,960
It comes from the Windows world.

383
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,640
And you get to leverage a lot of the.NET platform.

384
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,520
So instead of throwing text around, you've got objects.

385
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,120
Yeah.

386
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,960
For me, I like Bash, and don't get me wrong.

387
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,320
But because it's very text-based,

388
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,960
it's the good thing about it, and it's also

389
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
the worst thing about it for me.

390
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,600
Because if you have to work with text,

391
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,760
and you need to figure out all these special commands,

392
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,680
and because PowerShell is, just like Python,

393
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,040
is object-oriented, you can do amazing, simple things.

394
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,160
So easily in one command.

395
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,800
That seems to be the core difference,

396
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,960
object-oriented versus text.

397
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,640
That seems pretty key to using PowerShell.

398
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,080
Well, yeah, right?

399
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
I mean, so imagine you've got a date,

400
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,800
and you want to go grab just the month part of that.

401
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,840
Well, you could probably whip up something

402
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,600
to split by whatever separator you're using,

403
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,480
and then grab the middle field or something.

404
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,120
But if you've got objects, well, there's

405
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,280
probably just a method that you call to get the month out

406
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,960
of it, right?

407
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,400
So it's more structured than text.

408
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,520
Now, there's an aspect to it that I can completely

409
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,480
appreciate as well, as somebody who was a desktop Linux

410
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,000
user managing Windows systems, and having

411
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,360
to deal with user account changes and other things

412
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,960
that just desperately, desperately need

413
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,640
to be automated, and trying to come up with a solution

414
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,520
and even some means to automate them across platforms.

415
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,920
Creating an Active Directory user

416
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,840
used to take 30 to 45 minutes because

417
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,520
of all this special stuff, like this all special configuration.

418
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,440
And using PowerShell, I kept saying,

419
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,400
we would hire 30 people, and then they

420
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,120
wouldn't pass their insurance selling exam,

421
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,580
and then we would fire half of them.

422
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,040
And then I would just spend hours creating these accounts

423
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,600
and then deleting them, which was crazy.

424
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
So then that's pretty much how I started with PowerShell.

425
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,680
I was like, I'm not going to spend hours.

426
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,160
It's funny.

427
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
There has to be a better way.

428
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,080
That is how it always goes, isn't it?

429
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a necessity.

430
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
Yeah, absolutely.

431
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,320
And it's not all just for managing Microsoft systems.

432
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,280
It's not all just about making sure you can

433
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,080
create Active Directory users.

434
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,320
There's a big community out there.

435
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,720
The other day, I found out there's

436
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,880
a FreeNAS module for PowerShell.

437
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,000
Wow, really?

438
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
So now, all of a sudden, I have this FreeNAS box

439
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,120
that I use for my home lab and whatnot.

440
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,200
So all of a sudden, I'm like, I want to create a new volume.

441
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,680
Then I import this.

442
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,080
I download this module.

443
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,360
I import it, and then I have, like,

444
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,400
connect FreeNAS server or something.

445
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,600
I give it the name of the server, the credentials,

446
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
and poof, I'm connected.

447
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
And then I have other simple commands,

448
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,080
like, I don't know, new volume or whatever,

449
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
new FreeNAS volume.

450
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,520
I don't remember the exact command.

451
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,120
Right, but then you can start scripting

452
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,320
your own little environments and handy helpers.

453
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,400
Yeah, exactly.

454
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,880
So then you start at home, and then all of a sudden,

455
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
you take it.

456
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,640
And because the API is very similar between FreeNAS

457
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,200
and TrueNAS, you can use the same.

458
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,040
I think the same library supports TrueNAS.

459
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,440
And then you take it to work.

460
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,440
And then at my job, I have to administer

461
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,880
a bunch of different storage systems,

462
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,120
because the application we build integrates

463
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,320
with different SAN providers and stuff like that.

464
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,960
So I have to administer NetApps and Icelon

465
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,600
and all kinds of weird, like FreeNAS is not weird,

466
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,320
but other weird storage vendors.

467
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,320
So if they have PowerShell support, then all of a sudden,

468
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,600
from my Linux box, it's really easy for me

469
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,600
to automate the deployment of all this stuff,

470
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,800
because I have one interface, which is PowerShell,

471
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,960
and I have all these different modules.

472
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,440
One of the things that seems like it's a key differentiator

473
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,560
is PowerShell has these modules.

474
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,080
Yeah, right?

475
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,200
I mean, it's sort of built right in.

476
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,560
In Bash, you might automate things

477
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,160
by installing additional programs,

478
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,120
and then sort of tying those together.

479
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,400
But PowerShell is more like a programming language

480
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
in the sense that you've got these community

481
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,600
modules you can go find and use.

482
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,560
So whether it's FreeNAS or I know

483
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,480
DM was talking about Selenium drivers.

484
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,980
So if you want to go do a bunch of automating websites that

485
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,440
don't have APIs, well, you can do that with PowerShell too.

486
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,040
Yeah.

487
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,360
Not everything is golden, though.

488
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,880
Not everything is golden.

489
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,680
For example, a lot of the Active Directory modules

490
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,480
don't work on Linux yet.

491
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,680
I took it upon myself.

492
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,880
I keep talking to different people from Microsoft,

493
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,960
from all kinds of places, like, oh, I have this module.

494
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,040
Can you test it on Linux?

495
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,600
So I download it into my box.

496
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,200
And then I think one of the Azure SQL team

497
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,680
member at Microsoft, they have an official SQL server module.

498
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,200
So he said, hey, it works on core.

499
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,800
It should work on Linux.

500
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,120
I already know that's not true because sometimes there's

501
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,160
all kinds of little things that make you break.

502
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,520
So I downloaded the module.

503
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,360
I tried to import it.

504
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
It doesn't work.

505
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,280
It doesn't work because Linux file system is case sensitive

506
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
and Windows is not.

507
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,600
So then all of a sudden, this file

508
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,920
has a lowercase letter in it.

509
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,400
Boom, it doesn't break.

510
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,880
So then I created a PR, not a PR, an issue in their system.

511
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,360
And I'm trying to fix it.

512
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,600
DM makes the case that the more users on Linux,

513
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,280
the more priority it becomes for Microsoft.

514
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
And what's also great about this,

515
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,880
and this is something I really connected with Amon,

516
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,840
is it means fundamentally more people

517
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,800
can run Linux on the desktop.

518
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,040
I'm trying to make the PowerShell experience on Linux

519
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,560
much better so then more people won't

520
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,080
have to go to Windows to do their day job.

521
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,280
And I think that's probably, if Microsoft

522
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,840
was trying to extinguish Linux, there's

523
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,800
no way they would have open sourced this because it's

524
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,120
pretty much the tool that allows you to manage all these

525
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Microsoft things without Windows.

526
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,000
It is really kind of.

527
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,760
I was thinking like, and we have an extended conversation

528
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,640
with DM that'll be out on Jupiter Extras,

529
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,840
but I was thinking when I was talking to him,

530
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,800
like, I would have killed for this.

531
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,640
Yes, right?

532
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
I mean, you can actually go interact with,

533
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,300
leverage a bunch of Windows environments

534
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,240
in a way that's native to them.

535
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,120
I think we're also made a little uncomfortable

536
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,200
because it has this different heritage, right?

537
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,040
Like, it comes from Microsoft, it's using Windows tools,

538
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,840
but it's an open source shell on top

539
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,520
of an open source kernel, right?

540
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,840
Like, what's not to like?

541
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,200
And that cat is out of the bag.

542
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,960
It's MIT licensed, it's out of the bag.

543
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,760
Also of note today, Microsoft open sourced

544
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,080
their C++ standard library.

545
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,320
Actually, it was technically yesterday,

546
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,120
they announced at a community conference

547
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,420
that they were releasing their C++ standard library code

548
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,280
as open source.

549
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,660
The STL code is now up on GitHub

550
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,780
and provided under the Apache 2 license.

551
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,280
Oh yeah, look at them go, more and more open source.

552
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,720
More and more all the time.

553
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,120
They say they hope this move will help developers

554
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,480
continue to keep the library compliant

555
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,280
in the fast-moving world of C++ standards.

556
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,840
And they hope it's a measure of payback

557
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,680
to the developer community.

558
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Isn't that an interesting statement?

559
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,720
The first part's being like,

560
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,520
we're not doing a great job keeping up with the standards,

561
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
will you guys help us keep this going?

562
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,960
It's kind of an admission of that, isn't it?

563
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,480
Right, and then the other half is like,

564
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,320
but also, like here, we can all make this better.

565
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,040
You get to have all the code for the other stuff too.

566
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,960
I don't mind that.

567
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,280
No, honestly, it kind of makes sense, right?

568
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,880
That's part of the open source community

569
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,960
and the interactions.

570
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,160
We're all going to use the tooling

571
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,000
and if it is open, we can all make it better.

572
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,840
Yeah.

573
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,480
We have a few items in housekeeping for the episode.

574
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
It got messy in here.

575
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,680
Yeah, you know, I've been traveling.

576
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,160
Was it an East Washington over the weekend?

577
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,880
Just didn't have time, brought in a whole bunch of dirt.

578
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
I'm sorry about that.

579
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,440
So here's a few things we've got to take care of.

580
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,960
First and foremost, just a reminder,

581
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,720
Texas Cyber Summit coming up real soon now.

582
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,120
Texas Cyber Summit, October 10th through the 12th, 2019

583
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,240
at the Grand Hyatt.

584
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,240
San Antonio.

585
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,280
San Antones.

586
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,320
Wes and I'll be there.

587
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,160
What?

588
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,400
Hey Cheesy, are you going too, Cheesy?

589
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,440
Oh yeah, I'll be there.

590
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,520
Honestly, Cheesy being there, that's a reason to go

591
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,840
if you weren't already thinking about it.

592
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,640
Yeah, that's definitely enough.

593
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,480
Nice.

594
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,320
If you are going to be in the area

595
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,080
and you don't have a ticket, but you would like to go,

596
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,320
join our telegram group.

597
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,040
It's t.me forward slash TCS2019

598
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,240
and you might be able to score a ticket.

599
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,080
What is that again?

600
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,200
T.me slash what?

601
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,200
T.me, T.me slash TCS2019.

602
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,960
TCS, all right, very good.

603
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,400
Texas Cyber Summit.

604
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,440
There's a B new track too,

605
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,240
which if you're thinking about getting in the cyber industry,

606
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,400
that'd be a good one for you.

607
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,240
Right?

608
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,880
Don't forget, we also have the hacker birthday dinner meetup,

609
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,000
meetup.com slash super broadcasting.

610
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's all there.

611
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,240
So also, can we just take a moment,

612
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,640
ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause again.

613
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,720
Two new shows launched on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

614
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,560
Very, very, very excited to say

615
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,600
we are now into week two of Linux Headlines,

616
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,520
linuxheadlines.show.

617
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,360
Great show.

618
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,200
Oh man.

619
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,240
West, you're doing a bang up job.

620
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,080
No, you're doing a bang up job.

621
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,920
Drew killed it.

622
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,760
No, you are.

623
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,600
Drew killed it on Friday.

624
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,440
Drew killed it.

625
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,240
Fridays with Drew are my favorite.

626
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,320
He's so damn good.

627
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,800
How can he be so new and still that good?

628
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,640
I don't know.

629
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,460
We'll learn from him though.

630
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,300
I know.

631
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,160
So linuxheadlines.show, go check that out.

632
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,560
The things you need to know that's going on

633
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,920
on Linux and open source in three minutes or less

634
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,520
every weekday.

635
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,600
Yeah, I said every weekday.

636
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,440
I said that.

637
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,260
I said that.

638
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,100
It's crazy.

639
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,120
linuxheadlines.show.

640
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,440
Also, it's finally here.

641
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,240
Self-hosted episode one.

642
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,320
The first one is out, self-hosted.show slash one.

643
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,240
Alex and I just get things kicked off in this episode.

644
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,280
And then coming up very soon, self-hosted.show,

645
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,400
our episode with Wendell.

646
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,560
Oh boy.

647
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,160
Great chat with Wendell.

648
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,120
It's all ready to go.

649
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,280
We'll be launching it soon.

650
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,240
Every fortnight over at self-hosted.show.

651
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,880
So go get episode one now

652
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,320
and stick around for episode two with Wendell.

653
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,880
Got a great chat, toured his studio, his servers,

654
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,600
his workstations, chat all about it.

655
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,440
It's pretty great.

656
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
So go check that out.

657
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,520
Self-hosted.show and linuxheadlines.show.

658
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,640
Man, so much going on.

659
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
Crazy.

660
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,360
And before you know it, it's Texas Cyber Summit.

661
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,920
Before you even know it, Wes.

662
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,760
All right.

663
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,280
That's the housekeeping.

664
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,120
That's the housekeeping.

665
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,960
Nicely done.

666
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,000
No, you did great.

667
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,960
I don't know, I think we've just come up with a thing.

668
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,200
So you and I had a chance last week to talk to Phil,

669
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,920
one of the co-founders of Mangero,

670
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,520
after they announced the new formation of their company.

671
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,720
Which was great.

672
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,680
Really exciting for them.

673
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,360
And we then thought, well, let's have

674
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,080
kind of like a Mangero celebration.

675
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,920
Stubble down.

676
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,960
And let's talk with Bernard,

677
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,680
one of the other co-founders this week,

678
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,880
because you and I had checked out the community additions,

679
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,780
which is one of the many things that Bernard's involved in,

680
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,920
as well as a few other things.

681
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,200
And just to really kind of recognize the moment

682
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,040
for Mangero.

683
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,720
They've moved into a new echelon of distributions.

684
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,920
There's a legal entity behind them.

685
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,120
They have a community.

686
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,720
They've formed partnerships with commercial organizations.

687
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,400
They're getting recognition on large YouTube platforms.

688
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
It's a big moment.

689
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,040
And so we really wanted to take the time

690
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,120
to both talk to Phil and Bernard.

691
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
Hello, thanks for having me.

692
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
Hello, sir.

693
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,960
So why don't we start off with a little bit of news.

694
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,560
There's a brand new, fresh release of Mangero

695
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,600
that's out just as we record.

696
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,560
What's your favorite thing about the new release?

697
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,440
Oh, it was quite busy for all of us

698
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,440
because we had to get a lot of different additions going.

699
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Of course, the official ones, KD Plasma, XFC, and GNOME.

700
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,440
And I'm also in charge of some of the community additions.

701
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,240
So I was doing i3 and Cinnamon,

702
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,700
and they're all rolling now.

703
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,700
So yes, we have the 18.1.0 release.

704
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,320
Of course, it's just a snapshot,

705
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,520
not a real, I mean, it's not a real thing

706
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,440
with a rolling release.

707
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,240
But of course, we polish everything with the install media.

708
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,480
And so the installer works and stuff

709
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,480
with some new additions, of course,

710
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,920
with the new Flatpak and Snaps support

711
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,480
with Bau, our new tool.

712
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,880
And also Calamares had a recent update,

713
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,120
and we also offered a new Office Suite chooser.

714
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,080
So I want to talk about the community addition stuff

715
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,920
here in a moment,

716
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,660
but we got to do like the human stuff upfront.

717
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,200
So you got a new job.

718
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,320
Yeah, I do.

719
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
I mean, it's basically the job I've been doing

720
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,440
for five years already, but now it's a job.

721
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,720
It just used to be like kind of an oversized hobby for me.

722
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,440
I was doing other stuff.

723
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,080
I was in the music business as a singer,

724
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,440
but my hobby was taking a lot of time.

725
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,800
And so this is finally what I can now concentrate on.

726
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,900
Congratulations.

727
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
You mentioned it as an aside there,

728
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,200
but you're a bit of a known musician.

729
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,880
We did a little Googling, Bernard.

730
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,520
You have a bit of an online presence when it comes to music.

731
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,960
Show research, you know.

732
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,040
Oh yeah, that's true.

733
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,360
Yes, I've been quite active.

734
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,120
How did you end up being also pretty prominent

735
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,160
here in the open source community?

736
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Oh, well, I always liked tweaking and analyzing stuff

737
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,400
and breaking stuff and putting it again together.

738
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,400
I actually started out with Atari when it was still a thing.

739
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,440
And so I found myself quite at home with Linux.

740
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,080
In between, I was of course using Windows

741
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,960
for everything I needed.

742
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,680
And then my main stoppers to switch over to Linux

743
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,680
were especially the music software, like music editing.

744
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,920
I mean, printed music editing and this kind of stuff.

745
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,920
But during the recent years,

746
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,440
we now have really software for everything I need.

747
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,680
So that was finally my opportunity to switch over to Linux.

748
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,480
So you come from a creative angle on all of this.

749
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,960
Yeah, you could say that.

750
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,080
It seems that that has also manifested

751
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,680
in you're one of the probably, I guess,

752
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,560
you're probably one of the prominent supporters

753
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,080
of the different community editions.

754
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,560
You know, I had an opportunity to chat with you off air

755
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,240
about the i3 and Cinnamon editions,

756
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,720
which I think you're the direct maintainer of.

757
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,160
So let's talk a little bit about that.

758
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,400
Is that a creative expression for you as well?

759
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,240
Yeah, it is.

760
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,800
I mean, I've styled the desktops.

761
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,560
I mean, i3 is a good example

762
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,360
because the way it comes from just the packages,

763
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,920
it's just totally naked and ugly and difficult to use.

764
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,840
And so it took quite a lot of creativity also

765
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,560
and tweaking and also about the optics

766
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,760
and theming is also a topic

767
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,160
in all of our editions, of course.

768
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,520
And so I took over Cinnamon

769
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,000
and i3 was kind of abandoned a few years ago.

770
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,280
And so that was really a good opportunity for me to,

771
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,280
yeah, also express my kind of my taste

772
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,320
and I like things to look nice

773
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,160
and to be also accessible

774
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,960
and also pretty on the surface.

775
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,440
Can you maybe go into a little more

776
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,520
about what's different about community editions?

777
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,080
I mean, you know, you're involved

778
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
and you're part of the core project.

779
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,640
So how is that different from one of your major releases?

780
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,400
Basically, traditionally in the Manjaro community,

781
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,000
it was like we had,

782
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,600
it used to be open box originally

783
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,600
where the core team like was maintaining a main edition

784
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,720
and then we had XFC and KDE came after that.

785
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,760
And then GNOME is more recent edition.

786
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,680
And the community editions were mostly just done

787
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,280
by one person.

788
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,080
So if you found a desktop environment that you would like

789
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,280
and then you would like offer it on the forum.

790
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,520
And if you were the first one who presented

791
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,800
then a desktop edition, then it was just your edition.

792
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,120
And yeah, it has also grown, I would say.

793
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,120
And nowadays it's like also the community editions

794
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,240
are maintained by members of the core team.

795
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,160
Oh, that's fascinating.

796
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

797
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,880
I look at the Cinnamon edition

798
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,320
and the i3 edition specifically

799
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,000
and I think they seem like passion projects to me.

800
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But I do kind of wanna,

801
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,440
I wanna kind of examine that question

802
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,800
that Wes had there just a little bit further.

803
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,120
So I kind of, when I picture the Manjaro project,

804
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,960
I picture a default XFCE desktop.

805
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,400
But we were just chatting recently

806
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,320
and it seems depending on the time of month or day,

807
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,160
there's other additions like the plasma edition

808
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,120
that may actually be more popular.

809
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,680
Manjaro isn't necessarily defined by a single desktop.

810
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,280
So I guess, Bernard, in your opinion,

811
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,720
what defines Manjaro, especially for people

812
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,320
that are listening that maybe don't use it,

813
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,240
what defines it apart from Arch?

814
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,320
One important point is the usability, right?

815
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,240
I mean, i3 is a good example because as I already said,

816
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,000
it's very hard to use as it comes originally.

817
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,840
And so I've really tried to make it more accessible

818
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,840
to make it look pretty and run right out of the box

819
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,880
with everything available, all the shortcuts organized

820
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,360
and with a little introduction.

821
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,360
And I mean, Manjaro is mostly about the core system.

822
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,640
And as you can see, it's a huge variety

823
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,640
of just different desktops on top.

824
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,720
So the team, everybody together makes sure

825
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,680
that the core system runs well

826
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,120
and that the system is reliable.

827
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,000
And then it's just a question of putting any desktop

828
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,960
on top, basically.

829
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,360
And over the years, we have like also developed

830
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,640
our typical style.

831
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,160
It was also, we decided that it would be good

832
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,680
that when you open up a desktop on the first site,

833
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,760
you would be able to see, oh yes, this is a Manjaro edition.

834
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,000
So it's like the colors, it's the fonts.

835
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So there is some branding element.

836
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,760
Yeah, you could say that.

837
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,200
It's not actually the same themes.

838
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,360
Yeah, because they don't necessarily work on every desktop,

839
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,840
but then we try to find kind of matching colors

840
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,560
and common wallpapers and that kind of stuff.

841
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,720
So do you feel like it would be a fair assessment

842
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,240
to say the difference from Arch is the brand,

843
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,720
the community, and the intention

844
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,720
that you put into the desktop?

845
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,720
And you can apply that to i3, Cinnamon, XFCE, or Plasma,

846
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,520
because what defines Manjaro isn't a desktop environment.

847
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,680
The mentality of presenting a desktop ready to go,

848
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,760
I would say.

849
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,120
I mean, Arch people are really keen on building everything

850
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,040
and styling everything the way everybody likes personally.

851
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,720
And we offer like one version that you could just start

852
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,960
using on an everyday basis.

853
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,400
And if you can live with how it looks like,

854
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,280
then you can just, you would never have to change anything.

855
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,440
And also, we put together a combination of packages,

856
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,440
like you have an image viewer, you have a music player,

857
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,920
you have an office suite, you have a mail program, a browser,

858
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,240
so that you have everything that you would normally need.

859
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,840
So my question is, now that things are changing a little bit,

860
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,160
it's becoming a real business, it's a full-time gig for you,

861
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,240
will there be some shifts in your priorities?

862
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,120
You've got a lot on your plate right now, especially with the community edition stuff.

863
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,520
Do you see a future where you kind of narrow the list a little bit

864
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,720
of what you're involved with?

865
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
I don't know.

866
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,480
I mean, at the moment, we are just starting out

867
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,640
and looking around a little bit where our direction is really going.

868
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,480
We are collecting ideas and I have the feeling

869
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,840
that the team is extremely motivated by our steps.

870
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,320
And we have a lot of discussions between not just the two of us, of course,

871
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,440
between the whole team, which is about something around 12 people or so.

872
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,520
And at the moment, it's also about finding out who likes to specialize in what

873
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
and where the strengths of everybody lie.

874
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:35,120
And I don't really think that we need to narrow down our offer at the moment.

875
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,120
It's not really what it's about.

876
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,120
I mean, the basic idea is to keep what we have running

877
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,120
and then to add what comes up.

878
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:52,120
It sort of strikes me that Manjaro is sort of the first to make it this far

879
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,120
with something that's based on Arch.

880
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,120
You could look at Arch much like Ubuntu looks at Debian

881
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,120
as a great base to build a product on top of.

882
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,120
And you're sort of first to this real estate. You're the first to this new land.

883
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
What happens next?

884
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:14,120
I mean, Arch has this reputation of being hard to build, hard to use, and hard to maintain.

885
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,120
And so that's somehow where we have grown into.

886
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:26,120
We have built our way of balancing the bleeding edge idea

887
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,120
with usability and continuity.

888
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Of course, it's still a little bit of a balancing act,

889
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,120
but I think we have found our ground here very well now.

890
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:43,120
So that's probably why we are now in a position where we can really say,

891
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:49,120
okay, this is quite reliable and we can look back on several years now

892
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,120
where this has been running smoothly.

893
00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:03,120
And one idea of incorporating was also that, as you can see with other projects,

894
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,120
that at a certain point it really gets very hard to do this

895
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,120
beside everything else you do.

896
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:17,120
As a hobby, it's just you really need to invest a lot of time, a lot of energy,

897
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,120
and to keep it with a certain amount of quality.

898
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:28,120
That's basically our motivation to find a way to really be able to focus on this.

899
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,120
I'm pretty excited about it because I think at some point I had just accepted the idea

900
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,120
that all of the next big distros that were ever going to happen had happened,

901
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:43,120
and now it was just a matter of, well, let's settle in and figure out how to make this work.

902
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:50,120
And then Manjaro comes along and proved me wrong, and I think it's just so fantastic.

903
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,120
I think we have absolutely room for more, and you guys are really committed to the project,

904
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,120
and it's getting recognized for what it's contributing and those paper cuts

905
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,120
that it's solving for end users, and it's just such a great thing to see this next step being taken.

906
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,120
And Bernard, I love the Community Editions.

907
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,120
I had a chance to play with Cinnamon and i3 over the weekend.

908
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
We'll have links in the show notes for those.

909
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:18,120
And I just love that that's even a thing, and that we can have a company where this kind of thing can go on,

910
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,120
and it can be a creative expression for you and all of that.

911
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,120
So thanks for coming on and just answering some of these questions.

912
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,120
It's just something I've been considering, and I don't know, man.

913
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
I'm just super happy for you guys.

914
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Thanks for that.

915
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,120
Jeezy, you've been running Manjaro for a little while, haven't you?

916
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Yeah, so I've got this Dell Inspiron 3000 Series 2-in-1.

917
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:45,120
It was my wife's old computer, and so it just got handed down to me.

918
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,120
The first thing I was going to do is load Linux on it.

919
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Whenever I tried to load any distro on it, I would have a problem.

920
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,120
Because it's a 2-in-1, it has an accelerometer and a gyroscope in it.

921
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:07,120
So by default, and this was elementary, pop, fedora, I mean, any distribution that I tried,

922
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,120
those kernel modules would be enabled by default.

923
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:20,120
So my login screen would be flipped 180 degrees and then inverted,

924
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:26,120
as if it was in tablet mode and you would be entering information in tablet mode,

925
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,120
which, you know, is nothing that you can't with GNOME.

926
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,120
You can lock screen rotation now, and you can do other things that make it a little bit easier.

927
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,120
You can X, R, and R, you know, and set it back to normal.

928
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,120
You can go back in and blacklist those kernel modules.

929
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:47,120
But the one distro that has worked every single time out of the box,

930
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,120
doesn't matter which DEF tried, has been Manjaro.

931
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,120
I've never had those kernel modules loaded by default.

932
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,120
And for me, I mean, that's a pretty significant thing.

933
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:05,120
You know, that takes three steps out of just getting the machine working properly.

934
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,120
And, you know, so I've been using Manjaro off and on on that machine,

935
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,120
just I use it to test other distros, knowing that I'm going to have to rotate the screen,

936
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,120
I'm going to have to do a few tweaks, but then inevitably always go back to Xfce,

937
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,120
the Xfce variant of Manjaro on it.

938
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,120
And man, I really like it. It's been solid.

939
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,120
Like Bernard said, I love the fact that I still get that rolling release,

940
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,120
but I don't have to spend the time to set up Arch.

941
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

942
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,120
I mean, if I've been down that road, I've done that as well, right?

943
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,120
But to have a distro out of the box, bleeding edge, boom, here you go.

944
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,120
Yeah, it helps that they make such nice, you know, choices.

945
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,120
Like the defaults are good, so you don't have to change that much.

946
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
Yeah, it's tastefully done. Absolutely.

947
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,120
The fact that they've gone through and they've tried to mimic, you know,

948
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,120
those themes across all of the DEs and everything.

949
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
I think they've really done a great job.

950
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,120
I haven't tried all of the community additions.

951
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,120
I will now though, knowing that I didn't realize that Bernard was putting those together as well.

952
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,120
So I guess they're official community additions.

953
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Ish, yeah.

954
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,120
I really love Manjaro too.

955
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,120
I'm a diehard Arch Linux user on the desktop,

956
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,120
and my laptop is running Manjaro.

957
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:29,120
And the implementation of XFCE that they have is the one that made me realize that XFCE is pretty great.

958
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,120
You know, I'm getting 10 to 12 hours worth of battery life on a T480.

959
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
The laptop's cool to the touch.

960
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,120
You know, it just works like Chi said.

961
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:44,120
And it's more than Arch for people that can't be bothered to install Arch, I think,

962
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,120
which is what it was always sold as.

963
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,120
I look at it a lot, although I'm going to try not to make this comparison.

964
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,120
But I look at it in some ways similar to Ubuntu to Debian.

965
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Like I could get a decent Debian desktop going if I wanted to spend some time

966
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,120
changing all of the defaults and optimizing things a bit.

967
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,120
I could, you know, it's not much more work really than setting up Arch.

968
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,120
I mean, it is probably a little less, but it's kind of equivalent.

969
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Or you could install Ubuntu and you have a pretty ready-to-go machine.

970
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,120
Like that's very much how Ubuntu started.

971
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,120
It was a refined selection of good desktop packages with some same defaults

972
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,120
synced to the GNOME release schedule.

973
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,120
And so it was a great way to get easy-to-use Debian.

974
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,120
That's what made it so successful initially.

975
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,120
And that fundamental recipe is kind of what they're applying here to Arch.

976
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,120
Well, one thing that I really like too is as an official version,

977
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
they have the Architect Edition.

978
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,120
So if you want to do the same thing you would do with Arch,

979
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,120
you can still do that with the Manjaro ISO,

980
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,120
which I think is cool that they offer that as an official version as well.

981
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Well, congrats to them.

982
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,120
Very happy to see them turn this into something they can do sustainably.

983
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
What am I trying to say?

984
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Sustainably, yeah, right.

985
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
I mean, it's a big deal.

986
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Bernard had a successful singing career,

987
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:05,120
and now he's focusing on this Linux distribution full-time,

988
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,120
and it's cool that that actually exists.

989
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
So we have an app pick we want to get to,

990
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,120
and we have a headline that we pulled out of Linux headlines

991
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,120
to discuss a little bit more here in the show.

992
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
So let's do that one first.

993
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,120
Just one last thing here from the community news is we've got new kernels, Wes.

994
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,120
We've got one that's out now, kernel 5.3 came out this weekend.

995
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,120
And that's always fun.

996
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,120
I also kind of want to talk a little bit about 5.4.

997
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,120
But in 5.3, they added the ACRN hypervisor,

998
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,120
which I was hoping was pronounced acorn.

999
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
Acorn.

1000
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
But I don't think it is.

1001
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,120
Why would you not pronounce it acorn?

1002
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,120
Why do we need another hypervisor?

1003
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,120
What's so unique here?

1004
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Well, okay, so this is actually guest support for Linux.

1005
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,120
So acorn is a hypervisor that's targeted at embedded and IoT applications,

1006
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
but things like real-time and safety.

1007
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,120
So if you've got things in your car or maybe in like factory-managed equipment

1008
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,120
that, you know, people's lives are at stake.

1009
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,120
Where it could be an embedded device and it uses virtualization

1010
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,120
to run different OSs on it.

1011
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,120
Yes, workload consolidation, right?

1012
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,120
You can move lots of things.

1013
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,120
Existing hypervisors, things that you might use in a data center,

1014
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,120
not really set up or designed with those goals.

1015
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,120
So this is supposed to be an open-source implementation of a reference stack,

1016
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,120
basically, all managed by the Linux Foundation.

1017
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,120
Of course, this patch set allows Linux to be booted on top of acorn.

1018
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,120
So, hey, that's great.

1019
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
That means more places that Linux will run.

1020
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,120
I mean, if you're going to run an OS on your IoT device,

1021
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,120
I'd rather it be Linux.

1022
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
And I'd rather it be updatable and supported.

1023
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,120
And if it's baked into the kernel, that means it actually might be possible.

1024
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,120
Now, this is only bare-bones support, so we'll see what happens.

1025
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,120
There's another patch in 5.3 that I thought didn't get enough attention.

1026
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:42,120
You know, I don't know about you, Chris, but sometimes you have a high DPI screen,

1027
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,120
and then you go and you, like, boot.

1028
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,120
You boot Linux, and you can't read it, right?

1029
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,120
You can't read anything, especially what happens if it doesn't boot up all the way?

1030
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,120
Right.

1031
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
There's a fix for that now.

1032
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
Yeah.

1033
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,120
Prefer a bigger font for high-resolution screens.

1034
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,120
That's the name of the commit.

1035
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,120
And, I mean, like, why would you not want that?

1036
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,120
Everything you need to know is in the name of the commit.

1037
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:05,120
So it will prefer a console font that is larger on high DPI display

1038
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,120
so you can actually read it.

1039
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
Yeah.

1040
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Now, for, like, 1920 by 1080 and below, nothing changes, no effect.

1041
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,120
But if you're above that, there's a different font that's used.

1042
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:18,120
So it seems like this should have happened ages ago, but as a terminal user, I'm glad.

1043
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,120
I actually didn't supermind it.

1044
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,120
Sometimes we get a little janky on how it would update on the screen,

1045
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,120
but I kind of like fitting more stuff on the screen, you know?

1046
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,120
I want more screens, and I want to fit more on them.

1047
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Yeah, but I don't always have my microscope right next to my display.

1048
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,120
That's true.

1049
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,120
Yeah, on the XPS 13, it was kind of ridiculous.

1050
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,120
It was getting pretty bad, actually.

1051
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,120
Well, so it's not out yet, but I kind of wanted to talk about something

1052
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,120
that I thought was interesting about the 5.4 impending release.

1053
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,120
So this next one has a bunch of neat stuff.

1054
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,120
But what I think we're now seeing is, you recall just a few weeks ago

1055
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,120
when the news came out that Microsoft was changing their positioning

1056
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,120
on exFAT licensing and said, all right, have at it.

1057
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
You can whip up some exFAT code.

1058
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
You can submit to the kernel.

1059
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,120
We will not pursue any patent infringement litigation.

1060
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Great. Hoorah.

1061
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,120
And then there was this sort of side story about, oh, it turns out somebody

1062
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,120
created some exFAT code.

1063
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,120
It's not of great quality, but it will probably make it in the kernel pretty soon.

1064
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,120
Who could that be?

1065
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,120
Well, now we got a name on a commit, and that name ties back to Samsung.

1066
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,120
Samsung.

1067
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,120
So Samsung whipped this up for their Android devices, likely.

1068
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,120
Of course.

1069
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Of substandard quality, which... You know, you just hack it together.

1070
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,120
It's fine. Who cares?

1071
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,120
They're just putting it on a cell phone that's going to millions of pockets.

1072
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,120
It only costs $800.

1073
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,120
Who cares, right?

1074
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:43,120
And so that should be landing in its early quality status

1075
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,120
in the 5.4 kernel, exFAT like that.

1076
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,120
I'd love to see that land in Fedora 31.

1077
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,120
Now, has there been time for quality improvements, or is this still...

1078
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
No, no, no.

1079
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,120
I mean, maybe.

1080
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
You know, maybe.

1081
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,120
I mean, honestly, if I were them, as soon as Microsoft made that announcement,

1082
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,120
I would have been like, all right, get that guy back over here.

1083
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,120
Get him working on it.

1084
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,120
That's what I would have done.

1085
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,120
I don't know.

1086
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,120
But you're right.

1087
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,120
I mean, it's nice to see, and now we can all use it finally.

1088
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,120
It's out there.

1089
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,120
Not that I needed it done.

1090
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,120
I just had that experience.

1091
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,120
So what happened was, is during our team sprint in the summer,

1092
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,120
we had a bunch of great pictures, and I'm like,

1093
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,120
well, let me pop in the old SD card here that's built into my ThinkPad.

1094
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,120
Right, it's great.

1095
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
Take advantage of that.

1096
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Because hashtag port options.

1097
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,120
And I pop it in there, and I look like a fool

1098
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,120
because my operating system, which was Fedora 30, could do nothing with it.

1099
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,120
Nothing.

1100
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,120
And I had the realization that, oh, yeah, I got to go install Fuse,

1101
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,120
and I got this whole song and dance.

1102
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,120
It sounds silly, but it's almost like being pulled back to old Linux.

1103
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,120
You know, like these days, things just mostly just work.

1104
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Well, yeah.

1105
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,120
And this is suddenly like, oh, right, Linux is like this sometimes.

1106
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,120
Yeah, and so it would be kind of a remarkable thing

1107
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,120
if in the next release, if in 31, it just worked.

1108
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,120
Even if it was just read-only, I'd be fine with that.

1109
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,120
Don't get me right.

1110
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,120
Just let me import my damn pictures, please.

1111
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,120
I want to stash them in my file system like a squirrel.

1112
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,120
It is cool.

1113
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,120
I mean, right, open source.

1114
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,120
And now you know that if improvements are needed,

1115
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,120
we've got the kernel infrastructure and development staff in place.

1116
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:18,120
Well, I think this only helps the creatives that use Linux from day to day,

1117
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:23,120
like Brent, you know, constantly pulling images from large SD cards

1118
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,120
or creating video content, drone video.

1119
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,120
I mean, anything like that.

1120
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,120
I think this is a win for us for sure.

1121
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,120
So tell us about ClipGrab.

1122
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:37,120
Jeezy brings us an app pick this week that could be useful for those of you

1123
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,120
that like offline media like I do.

1124
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:45,120
Oh, so, yeah, I was digging around actually in the Manjaro repos last night,

1125
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:51,120
and I came across ClipGrab, which is essentially a GUI version,

1126
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,120
not necessarily a version of YouTube DL.

1127
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,120
It's its own thing, but it's super nice.

1128
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:04,120
I use it to pull down tutorial videos for different Adobe products and stuff like that

1129
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,120
so that I can offline those and watch them separately on another device

1130
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,120
while I'm actually going through them.

1131
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
I love it, man.

1132
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,120
ClipGrab, check it out.

1133
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,120
It's worth the download, and it's super easy to use, dead simple to use.

1134
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:23,120
You can pull down MP4, MP3, OGS, all different various formats.

1135
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
Oh, this is just an app image.

1136
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
Hey, Andy.

1137
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,120
Yeah, it's an app image, and you can just download and run it, and yeah,

1138
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,120
it can convert videos to MP3s if you want to like pop it on a podcast

1139
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,120
while you're driving and you don't need the visuals.

1140
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,120
That's pretty great.

1141
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
Thanks, Jeezy.

1142
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:40,120
There's so many options out there now for that kind of stuff.

1143
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,120
I don't know how YouTube feels about it, but it seems clear that there's a need

1144
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
and a demand for that kind of thing.

1145
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,120
Absolutely.

1146
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,120
You can find a link to that as well as everything else we've talked about

1147
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:56,120
and the news stories and all of that over at linuxunplug.com slash 319.

1148
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,120
And Wes, did you know we do this here show live?

1149
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,120
Oh, yeah, every Tuesday.

1150
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,120
It's probably a good thing you knew that because if you didn't,

1151
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,120
we'd need to have a separate conversation.

1152
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Yeah, that's true.

1153
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
It would be really awkward.

1154
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,120
It would be weird.

1155
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,120
How has my timing been so good all this time?

1156
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,120
It's just lucky, I guess.

1157
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,120
Go get more Wes over at TechSnap.systems, him and Jim Salter doing their thing.

1158
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,120
That's right.

1159
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,120
Over at TechSnap program.

1160
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,120
Loving that every single week.

1161
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,120
And do join us live.

You can also just follow us on the Twitters.

1164
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,120
Oh, yeah, we tweet about it.

1165
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,120
Yeah.

1166
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
That's for sure.

1167
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,120
I'm at Chris Elias.

1168
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,120
I'm at Westpane.

1169
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,120
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1170
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,120
So go check that out.

1171
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,120
Also, go check out our buddies' Ubuntu podcast.

1172
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,120
Go check them out.

1173
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
Oh, yeah.

1174
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,120
Why not?

1175
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,120
Always cutting out a good episode, those guys, every single week.

1176
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,120
So go check them out.

1177
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,120
And join us next time, linuxunplug.com slash 319.

1178
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Thanks so much for joining us.

1179
00:50:49,120 --> 00:51:18,120
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1180
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:36,120
It's an episode of transitions.

1181
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,120
Think about this.

1182
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
No kidding.

1183
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,120
So we talk about Richard Stallman resigning.

1184
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,120
We talk about PowerShell on Linux.

1185
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,120
What?

1186
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:50,120
And Manjaro becoming a legitimate business and like the top tier Linux distributions

1187
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,120
shifting.

1188
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:58,120
Like this episode really reflects a really kind of massive amount of change going on.

1189
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:06,120
And it's like part exciting and part somber because it's, you know, the somber side, it's,

1190
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,120
you know, seeing somebody like Richard Stallman who is so well known in our community and

1191
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,120
the technical contributions he's made have been so important to...

1192
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,120
I mean a passionate free software advocate and shaped their discourse for a long time.

1193
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,120
Yeah.

1194
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:27,120
And then also yet undeniably a troublesome personality for a long time that there was

1195
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,120
going to be some kind of reckoning.

1196
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:36,120
And it's just to see that thing, to see all of that go down while also seeing the nature

1197
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:43,120
and basic use of free software and open source radically shifting with Microsoft and just

1198
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,120
the massive, massive deployment of cloud infrastructure and all of the people that are

1199
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,120
writing software for that.

1200
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:57,120
And also at the same time Manjaro becoming a company to me seems to be a clear indicator

1201
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,120
that there is still a market for desktop Linux.

1202
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,120
Like I thought we were done with this.

1203
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,120
I thought we were all done with this.

1204
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,120
We'd had it, you know, everybody gave their shot.

1205
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,120
The people that could make it work had usually other commercial backings to them like obvious

1206
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,120
reasons why they were in the market.

1207
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,120
And then Manjaro came along.

1208
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,120
It's like an unexpected little bright star in the Linux constellation.

1209
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,120
And it seems to validate the market a little bit.

1210
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,120
It's not necessarily like a foregone conclusion.

1211
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,120
It's not.

1212
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
But it's a data point.

1213
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,120
It's a signal.

1214
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,120
Yeah.

1215
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,120
It's exciting to watch too.

1216
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,120
I mean it's not all that surprising Chris.

1217
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:35,120
If you think about projects with their own self-commercial backing like elementary OS

1218
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:40,120
being a thing and there's a number of other ones like I mean Endless is one of those

1219
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,120
that are closer to the failed state than a lot of other ones.

1220
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,120
But they're all almost every single desktop Linux distribution project that has existed

1221
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:54,120
has either pivoted some other way or refocused or even pivoted back or something like that.

1222
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:00,120
It's the fact that desktop Linux still exists today after almost what 20 years of ragging

1223
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:05,120
and attempts and stuff like that I think kind of proves that there is some degree of staying

1224
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:11,120
power but we probably just don't quite understand where the pieces fit just yet into making

1225
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,120
it like broadly successful.

1226
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,120
I think that's fair.

1227
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,120
Yeah.

1228
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Yeah.

1229
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
We'll keep trying.

1230
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:24,120
I mean everyone from Red Hat to Endless to you know Manjaro and all the rest of them

1231
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,120
will all keep working at it and we'll see what happens.

1232
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,120
I think Manjaro too.

1233
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:34,120
I think it's fascinating about it is it's not sold as super approachable for new Linux

1234
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
users out of the box.

1235
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,120
You know get mom and dad started using a computer.

1236
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:44,120
It's a little bit more of a more sophisticated user's desktop.

1237
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
Right.

1238
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,120
Yeah.

1239
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
You're a Linux user.

1240
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,120
You want like a good solid desktop machine that you can use without a bunch of limitations.

1241
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:56,120
Even the concept of how it does its updates is more of an advanced user's concept than

1242
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,120
what people are used to when it comes to commercial operating systems.

1243
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:02,120
I have a bit of a theory here and this is the rise of DevOps.

1244
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:08,120
This is the rise of people using Linux at work and then thinking hmm this is quite good

1245
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,120
on the server.

1246
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,120
Why don't I give it a try on the desktop?

1247
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,120
What's the worst that could happen?

1248
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,120
Right.

1249
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:19,120
And there is some nice advantages to the desktop being rolling because if you want fresh user

1250
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,120
land applications.

1251
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,120
I do.

1252
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,120
I do.

1253
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,120
And you want fresh whatever like for me it would be Gnome Shell if I was a Gnome Shell

1254
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
user.

1255
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Such a sucker for that.

1256
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Got to get the latest XSE every four years.

1257
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,120
You know there's some advantages.

1258
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,120
Really what it is about getting fresh Chrome and fresh Firefox and new Thunderbird and

1259
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:41,120
getting all of these applications that are just in a repository automatically updated.

1260
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,120
When you come from Windows or Mac OS that's all luxury.

1261
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,120
It's a yearly thing where you got to upgrade your operating system on Mac OS.

1262
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,120
They do that every year.

1263
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,120
Oh you mean it works just like the Play Store?

1264
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,120
Yeah right.

1265
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:59,120
So the advantages of rolling for somebody who's just using it as a workstation as long

1266
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,120
as it doesn't break anything are pretty appealing.

1267
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,120
They're hand holding in the right places.

1268
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,120
Aren't you Mr. Fedora that wants to upgrade every nine months?

1269
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,120
I think Fedora is a better cadence because you still get fresh applications but it's

1270
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,120
not like rolling constantly.

1271
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,120
And that to me is just a little bit slower and that's just the preference I like.

1272
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,120
But I can totally appreciate the appeal for the desktop still.

1273
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,120
I kind of miss it sometimes.

1274
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:31,120
So the other thing on the flip side of this with the pure rolling environment, then the

1275
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:37,120
major difficulty that you'll start having is how do you make sure everything stays working

1276
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,120
more or less forever.

1277
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,120
One of the reasons why most distributions have a cadence is so that they can have a

1278
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,120
choke point or a break point in which they can make changes.

1279
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,120
My experience with working in OpenSUSE of Tumbleweed and other rolling distributions

1280
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:56,120
is that it gets extremely hard to make major changes without breaking people unless you

1281
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,120
have those kinds of release points.

1282
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:07,120
And so one of the challenges I'm watching out for to see how Manjaro handles it is that

1283
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,120
how are they going to handle when they need to make a major change and then they have

1284
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:18,120
to make sure that that works and it upgrades and it handles cleanly and as they grow as

1285
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,120
a business because that's what they're going to do.

1286
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:27,120
There's going to be people filing bug reports expecting some kind of assistance or help

1287
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,120
or fixes or things like that.

1288
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:34,120
You get into an interesting mess that you don't typically have as a community project

1289
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,120
that doesn't have a commercial sponsor.

1290
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,120
I don't know how they're going to handle this and I'm kind of playing the wait and see to

1291
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:44,120
see how this will shake out.

1292
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:49,120
So one of the reasons we don't really see rolling do this is because this is really,

1293
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:55,120
really hard to do right in that commercial-ish context, even for home users, especially for

1294
00:57:55,120 --> 00:58:02,120
home users who don't necessarily have that same level of patience that maybe enterprise

1295
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,120
users can be pushed back into.

1296
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:12,120
I also feel that when people pay money, they feel like entitled and then if a rolling release

1297
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:18,120
breaks after they paid for it in some way, shape or form, then the backlash is going

1298
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,120
to be much bigger.

1299
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:24,120
Well, maybe that's a market opportunity to sell us a service support contract.

1300
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,120
I mean, maybe it kind of depends on how they set the expectation.

1301
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,120
I think it's fascinating because it's not your typical distro to go for this kind of

1302
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
thing.

1303
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,120
Clearly, there's a community behind it.

1304
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:40,120
And also of note, we're talking a lot about workstation, but a big part of the community

1305
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
there is clearly gaming, too.

1306
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,120
That's what's got so much attention on YouTube.

1307
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,120
It's something to watch.

1308
00:58:46,120 --> 00:59:12,120
As I say, the end of summer is always interesting in open source land.
