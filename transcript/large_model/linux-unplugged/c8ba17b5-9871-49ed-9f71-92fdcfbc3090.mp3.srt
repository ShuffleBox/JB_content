00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 22, for January 7th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,400
Hi, everyone, and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's still airing

3
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,640
out the studio after a power supply failure.

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,880
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
My name is Matt.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,440
And when I say failure, I mean of the most dramatic kind.

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,800
Last night, I was repurposing an old studio Hackintosh, which is a pretty nice rig, Core

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,800
7, has about 16 gigabytes of RAM, SSDs, and I swapped out an ATI, like 590, something,

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,640
and I put in a GTX 780, and I was going to wipe it, pave it, and make it a dedicated

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,000
Linux workstation for trying out a bunch of stuff with the Nvidia card and whatnot.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,600
And I get it all hooked up, and it's running pretty good, and I go to reboot it, because

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,520
I'm going to go Integro, so I figured, I've got the Integro ISO burnt to my DVD, I put

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,360
it in the drive, it boots up, and I notice the lights in my room start to flicker a little

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,720
bit, I'm like, geez, this thing doesn't have that much power, so I shut off some gear,

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,100
lights are still kind of flickering, I'm like, gosh, that's really strange.

16
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,600
And then, all of a sudden, I start hearing this kzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,720
And it almost sounded like water, and I look over the back of the PC, and because of where

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,760
the fan was positioned in the power supply, the smoke is just billowing out, and it immediately

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,300
starts stinking in here just horribly, right?

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,540
So thankfully and this isn't my first time I've seen a power supply fire before so I I don't I don't panic or anything

21
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,740
But I I try stupidly tried turning off the PC by hitting the power button

22
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,560
That ship sailed already. Yeah, so oh yeah dummy

23
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,640
so then I just reach over and I kill the power at the at the

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,580
Search protector, but the problem is the smoke is just going now right the components have melted

25
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,840
They're going like crazy, and so I sit there from I have a moment of hesitation

26
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,040
I'm like well do I just let this I know it's not on fire anymore

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,900
but there's gonna be a lot more smoking do I leave it in my office and close up all the doors and then just say

28
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,900
goodbye to my office for a couple of days or

29
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,380
Do I rush this thing through the house smoke and tail and put it out on the front porch?

30
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,220
And I opted to go that route because this because I was just like I gotta have my office back to do the show

31
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,180
I and I rushed it out and put it on the front porch

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,680
And then I like had to abandon the office for the rest of the evening cuz it was just so strong

33
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,460
And it's funny cuz my son's coming down the stairs and the first thing he says and it cuz I'm talking to Angela about what?

34
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,660
Just happened it all happened so fast, and he's coming down the stairs, and he goes oh it smells really good in here

35
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,660
I like that. What are you cooking dad?

36
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,780
And then by the time he gets to the bottom of series like oh that smells horrible

37
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,720
It was kind of a crazy and so now I'm out my I was gonna build this awesome Linux workstation

38
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,640
Because as we're as we move to the new studio in March

39
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,460
We're gonna be redoing all the computer layouts, and I thought okay well

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm gonna get myself set up with a nice Linux workstation at the new studio

41
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,020
I'll get it all loaded up with arch and steam and all that kind of stuff

42
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,260
And I'll have an HDMI feed to the live stream so I can do some you know

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,100
Let's plays just on the stream when I want so I'm getting this thing all configured like with all these hopes and dreams and then boom

44
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,140
Fire happens and now all of the components of the computer just reek in the brand new

45
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
GTX 780 I got

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,380
Totally smells to high hell and and this was like one of these purchases I get where I'm like well

47
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,620
You know what it's it's 2013 if I buy this right now. I'm gonna use it in the new studio

48
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,580
This is gonna be a tax write-off right you would think yeah, yeah, so now

49
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm now I'm worried like when I fire up that graphics card if it still works after a power supply freak out like that

50
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,500
You know the components could be damaged, and that's a really high voltage piece of equipment

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,300
So that's if anything's gonna get damaged. It's gonna be that and so it could be totally fried now

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,180
I don't know, but I don't want to plug it in anything

53
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,980
So I'm worried it's gonna fire it up and make the whole room stink all over again

54
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,500
So well, that's when you take it to a Starbucks. You know and you just set yourself up on a table

55
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,820
I'm a real jerk you can tell yeah, you go to somewhere

56
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,700
You don't really have anything invested into it. You know this is whatever and then just act all surprised when it catches on fire

57
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,160
Yeah, no a chair and think there's integros is fault

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,580
No what it was it was probably switching a tea out in video. It was putting the

59
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,420
Yeah, you know probably the video cards pulling more power

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,780
Although this is a high-end

61
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,280
Thousand watt power supply because I got a really good one because it was the wire cast machine and it ran

62
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,460
24-7 and it was our production machine

63
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,860
So I put like I went high-end components in all of it and wonder if it's still under warranty because that sounds

64
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,580
Maybe but you know how we were having problems with that hackintosh. Oh, yeah

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,380
Yeah, this might mean this power supply might have been failing for a while now that I think about it. Oh that one

66
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,780
Yes, okay. Yeah, that could be why yeah, so I'm wondering and and so I think what happened was is when I put the blank

67
00:04:54,980 --> 00:05:00,300
D or when I put that was gonna burn a DVD and I put it in the drive and I think just spinning up the optical

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,020
Media was just the straw that broke the power supplies back and there you had it. Jeez. Jeez. Well, I'm glad no one was hurt

69
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,340
And yeah, just a stinkiness nothing a good call on taking it outside opening up windows a fast track to getting the fire department called

70
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,340
I know

71
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,580
I've been there myself. I actually had that happen once all the all the smoke detectors here are connected

72
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,580
So I was a little worried. Yeah

73
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,540
The whole house would start buzzing like crazy and didn't want that either

74
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,780
Yeah, usually there's like a thr- I think it's like a three second delay and then it's like I've wasted ours

75
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,740
Anyway, it's the same thing and then it's like after three seconds. It's all over. They're all going off. Yeah, I wanted to play Steam

76
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,240
All right. Well, I got some feedback to get to Noah wrote in

77
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,300
So with some follow-up to our predictions episode that we had a ways back now before I get to this

78
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,840
I want to just mention for people who maybe have just started listening to Linux unplugged

79
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,860
One of the things that we do here on this show is we do follow up to the big show Linux action show which gets so

80
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,340
Much email that we just simply cannot get to it all

81
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,460
So a lot of times in this follow-up section will cover

82
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,880
We'll pick up on threads that were started in the last and this here from Noah's is one of those exact threads

83
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,720
So Noah writes in he says in the predictions episode you talked about the death of Microsoft

84
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,360
Let me start out and say I do not believe this will be happening anytime soon

85
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,540
I think Alan Mulally will become the CEO of Microsoft and will think the open source closed argument is similar to the two nerds is

86
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,640
Similar to two nerds sitting in a room debating Batman versus Superman

87
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,720
I think Mulally will make a new structure for Windows

88
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,480
The basic version of Windows will be based on an open operating system that relies on a central server to operate the machine similar to how

89
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Chromebooks rely on Google for services, then

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,240
I think Microsoft will release a pro version of Windows that really will be closed and have all the goodness badness Windows currently has

91
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,360
Here's the twist in an enterprise environment basic workers will have the basic version of Windows

92
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,600
Why IT admins will have top and top level execs will have the pro version this pro version will give them tools to control and monitor

93
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,240
the basic versions of

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,840
Windows everything from version various levels of access to automatically generated reports on productivity based on time spent on certain apps

95
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,480
This will give Microsoft a competitive advantage over their newest business enemy Google

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,960
this is all this also allows Microsoft to further push office into the subscription service because basic users will have to pay to have an

97
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,200
Advanced feature not offered in web apps. Don't get me wrong. I'm far from a Microsoft lover

98
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,840
I deep down which LibreOffice and openSUSE could make this happen

99
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,240
And ultimately the Linux user space is more concerned with defining what is good and what isn't good for the Linux community

100
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,880
Who knows maybe I've just had one too many bottles of New Year's cheer anyway

101
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,880
Thanks to you and Angela the rest of the JB team for bringing the highest quality content any nerd could hope for just remember every

102
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,160
Week you make a nervous Windows user a little less scared of switching to Linux happy 2014 nice nice

103
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:44,320
Yeah, I actually agree with them for two reasons one. They they are basically pushing my argument for

104
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Microsoft's remaining an enterprise

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,140
Situation that's true. They're excellent for that and I would say that they will continue to own the American

106
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:57,700
Enterprise situation they will not under any circumstances be doing wondrous things overseas

107
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,580
I I just don't I can see that I could see that yeah, but American yeah

108
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,500
I think that's true

109
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,100
So one thing that is really prevalent right now not talked a lot about is a lot of our apps that we use on mobile

110
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,180
Devices have in some cases literally Google Analytics, but in a lot of cases

111
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,020
There's a lot of different analytics companies that are really actually tracking all your activity in these apps to a great extent now it varies

112
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Of course depending on the app and the developer

113
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,540
But they can get down to how much time you spend in a particular function of the app what other apps you switched from

114
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,820
The location the geolocation you ran it from the Wi-Fi network all these things the time you spent doing different things in the app

115
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,420
Wouldn't it be interesting like like he's saying here wouldn't it be interesting for Microsoft to say well

116
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,940
You know what we're gonna. Do we're gonna

117
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,740
We're gonna take those kinds of analytics and because we're appifying the desktop

118
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,220
We're gonna apply that kind of analytics at the enterprise space

119
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,340
And just like where you go into group policy

120
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:54,420
And you set enterprise wide policies for Windows machines and active director where you set enterprise level access controls and the event log

121
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,920
Where you can have well not really centralized logging like you get with this log

122
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,900
But you can have a logging an event log this could be one more thing that sits on top of that

123
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:09,680
Microsoft active directory stack is these in these analytic tools pointed back in at the user and provided to the company

124
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,720
Instead of provided to some sort of third party

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,180
And I think that would be compelling for places that are horrible draconian places to work for yeah

126
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,900
You know this would be great for the office space type corporation however

127
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,340
I don't first of all believe it's gonna be Malaly he's currently working at Ford

128
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,020
And he's definitely at retirement age and second of all I think that would require

129
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,180
Such a level of insight and vision into the computer industry it would that I just can't I mean

130
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,940
I just can't see it happening unless there was somebody that

131
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,460
Brought this forward from within Microsoft to Malaly and he then gave it the okay

132
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,020
But well I think and if you look at something like Yahoo

133
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,540
Here's an example if they took a superstar from Google dropped her in very very talented amazing talent amazingly talented person who?

134
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,820
Despite having all this amazing talent has really done

135
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,080
Not been able to do squat to really turn Yahoo around that Yahoo still doesn't know if it's a search engine or directory or what?

136
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,200
The hell they are there's still a media company or a media company or an AOL yeah

137
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,780
I think I thought well thing going I mean they're all over the map so I think Microsoft suffers from the same thing

138
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,780
I think their stuff is so deeply rooted down to the core that bringing in a new talking head isn't gonna solve any problems for

139
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,540
Them at all yeah, yeah, and they just don't unfortunately

140
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,220
They're a company that has been ran by us by a sales team for a very long time now

141
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,900
And they would do good to get some engineers behind the reins

142
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,340
And I don't I mean Malaly is an old-school engineer

143
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,700
I'll give them that but I just I don't see it

144
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,860
I think the big problem they've suffered from is somebody who doesn't have great insights into the industry as a whole right

145
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,340
That's it. So I have I have some more feedback to get to let's see here

146
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,580
Well, we had a lot of stuff on the gnome on the on the gnome in the home thing

147
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,860
Yeah, I think what I want to do is I want to cover a bit of late breaking news

148
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,900
We don't normally cover breaking news on the Linux unplugged show

149
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,580
but this just happened about an hour ago, and I it's it's huge so I want to talk about that because

150
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,420
We'll definitely cover it more and last but since it just happened

151
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,260
I just want to let I want to get people aware of it, but before we get to that

152
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:11,200
I want to thank ting.com sponsor of Linux unplugged ting is mobile that makes sense and

153
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,300
Ting also offers you some great devices with some amazing rates

154
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,620
You only pay for what you use with ting at six dollars a month for a phone

155
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,900
And then it's whatever usage your minutes your megabytes and your messages on top of that

156
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,820
Ting is my mobile service fighter ting is Matt's mobile service right and you know

157
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,060
I don't know if you were called Matt, but a few weeks back. I think was December

158
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,980
They were doing a survey where if you're on AT&T or Verizon, and you took a survey and did their savings calculator

159
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
It wasn't even a survey. It was just their savings calculator

160
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,740
You would be entered to win a free cup of coffee

161
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,100
Oh, I remember that that was that was actually really popular so ting is a very transparent company

162
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,060
and this is one of the things I like a lot about them as I'm

163
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,580
I really pride myself on trying to research and understand the companies that I I spend my money with and so I

164
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,540
Really like this aspect of ting and one so they're sharing some of the data they got from those

165
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:09,420
Savings calculator from the from the coffee survey and here's here's what some of the results are

166
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,640
92% of participants would see some savings in their monthly bill

167
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,820
87 would save more than three hundred and fifty dollars over two years

168
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,780
Enough to basically pay for a Nexus 5

169
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,980
82% would save more than six hundred dollars over two years

170
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,860
now here's what's really crazy is when you are a small business say like around ten devices a

171
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:38,100
Hundred percent of the small businesses with ten devices saved money on their monthly bill with ting

172
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,420
That's crazy. So it literally now ting is validated from two different companies that

173
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:50,540
that 98% of the people who switched to ting save money and this is something as we move forward with computing devices that are in our

174
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,020
Pockets, I we are really going to enter an age where companies are going to try to take advantage of us

175
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:01,420
We already are seeing this with the existing incumbent carriers who are big maybe you know duopoly cut type situations here in the u.s.

176
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,620
And it's really not in their interest to be customer focused where it is

177
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,780
Specifically by the way ting is structured as an MVNO that is in their core business DNA to focus on customer service

178
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:19,780
And as an end result it really shows from the dashboard from the fact that if you call them at one eight five five

179
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:26,060
eight four six four three eight nine anytime between 8 a.m.. And 8 p.m.. A real person answers the phone

180
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,220
Usually like on the first ring

181
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,180
Resolves your problem is empowered to solve the issue gives you their numb their name their number right then and there and this is also

182
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,420
Why ting makes their savings calculator available to you?

183
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,860
They're just gonna put it right up front plug in your minutes use your text message your megabytes your total bill before taxes and they'll

184
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,060
Calculate what your savings could be with ting and to help you switch over to ting they have an early termination relief program over

185
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,620
At ting comm slash ETF check this out you pick your ting phone you port your number over

186
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,900
And then you submit your ETF claim to ting and they'll give you up to seventy five dollars per line that you have to cancel

187
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:02,620
That eases that transition over to buying a device that you own outright. It's not something you're financing from the carrier

188
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:09,060
It's your phone you own it when you're only paying for what you use. This is why I literally I literally went from about

189
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,300
$120 a month on my phone bill to I average around twenty five thirty dollars now

190
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,780
It's it's amazing and that is enough money that it actually makes a difference for me every single month

191
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,740
So here's how you get started go to Linux dot ting comm that'll take

192
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:29,180
$25 off your first device or if you already have a sprint compatible device and you want to bring it just check their compatibility page

193
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,180
And if you've got that device they're gonna take

194
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:37,020
$25 off your first month that might just pay for your first month of service over at ting so Linux dot ting comm to get started

195
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,860
And a huge thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux

196
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,900
Unplugged all right before we get to any more of the feedback. I want to cover this big story that just broke

197
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:53,300
CentOS is joining forces with Red Hat. It's it's through acquisition of talent

198
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,860
It's it's gonna be core members of the CentOS team joining Red Hat now

199
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,140
They're not gonna be working for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux division interestingly enough and as they put it

200
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,980
The new initiative is going to be overseen

201
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,240
by a new CentOS governing board the initial board will comprise of the existing CentOS core team members and

202
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,800
Also, they're gonna add new members one nominated from the community and three members that were nominated by Red Hat directly

203
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,800
Which I thought is kind of interesting they said further further down the road

204
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,480
The CentOS Linux platform won't be changing the process and methods built around the platform

205
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,860
However are going to become more open and more inclusive because now that they're working directly with Red Hat legal. They're gonna be able to

206
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,580
Clear some hurdles like doing Q&A out in the public and things like that

207
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,800
so there's a lot of good interesting things there are some things that are gonna be changing, but I

208
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,380
Think I think this could be a real stepping stone for him

209
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,040
I think this could definitely be kind of that someone said legitimizes them

210
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,040
I think it's more it adds to their credibility, but and just expands on what they're already doing. That's awesome

211
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,900
You know I don't know if legitimate legitimize might be a little strong, but yeah, I agree

212
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,580
I watch CentOS from the beginning and

213
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,540
Scientific Linux and other ones too

214
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:08,860
And I know early on when I had a customer who had Red Hat Enterprise Linux there was

215
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,540
Selling on my part to convince them that it was even okay to try CentOS on the testing machines

216
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,120
Then let alone a whole nother round of selling I had to do to get them to try it on production

217
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:24,540
Where now everyone who made a bet on CentOS and for some of them there might have been just a little

218
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,060
Wiggle of doubt in the back of their mind. Oh, this isn't a legitimate copy of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or whatever

219
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,060
Which even though it's you know?

220
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,980
Technically exactly the same

221
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,580
That doubt now is completely washed away

222
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,580
Everybody who had made an investment in CentOS on their server farms right now all of the hosting companies all of the small businesses and large

223
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,980
Businesses that have CentOS deployed. This is a huge validation for that deployment and that just gave them a huge peace of mind

224
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,900
I would think if I was still running a bunch of CentOS servers. I would be very pleased with this news. I

225
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,260
Would think so. Don't be curious to see where it goes. We'll follow follow this story throughout the week

226
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,420
And if there's further developments, we'll cover it on Sunday on the on the Linux. Yeah, I think it's still pretty early

227
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:11,500
Yeah, we'll definitely kind of have to see where it all yeah translates into literally just happened. Yeah, so it is very early

228
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,620
Okay, so we talked about Gnome 3 on Linux action show on Sunday and oh jeez reddit isn't working right now

229
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,820
Lots of feedback lots of feedback in the reddit thread that we do every episode of Linux action show gets tossed in Linux action

230
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,260
Show.reddit.com where people can comment and give us feedback on it. There are so many good ones in there

231
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,220
But you know what reddit is totally down right now like a clown. Oh, there it goes

232
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,540
I should say I got it running

233
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,340
I was getting that I was getting the pile that dude gets piled on you know I'm saying

234
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:45,300
No, it's like too many upvotes reddit alien had a fit reddit get your crap together. Gosh. I'm sure he's cloud stuff

235
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
I I'm sure yeah

236
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,620
All right, so there's so many in here

237
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,940
I'll link to the whole thread in the show notes

238
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,920
But I did pull out a couple a weem wham wrote in he says my main problem with gnome 3

239
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,940
Which it's always which has always been is removing core functionality and then expecting it to be implemented as a user developed extension

240
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,980
This is bad. I'm sorry. It just is this is a point

241
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,500
We heard a lot

242
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,420
I don't know if I agree with it, but a lot of people made this point

243
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
And he just summed it up really good, so I highlighted his

244
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,980
So for example like the minimize button right or certain things that have been taken out that you then have to go back through

245
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,660
Some other third-party method to get that functionality back. What's your take on that Matt boy?

246
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,420
You know I don't know I'm

247
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,900
Gonna really kind of have to wait and see where everything ends up in the long on the long haul

248
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,180
But right now. I just feel like it still needs a little more time in the oven

249
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,580
I like I like the overall aesthetic direction

250
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,740
They're going but I feel like there's just certain little bits of functionality that

251
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,440
While extensions do address them and so did a great tools like the configuration tools they offer

252
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
I just feel like that

253
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,660
You know I don't want to rush to judgment, but I definitely feel like I'm not ready to make that permanent

254
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:53,180
I think that's fair. I think it's kind of early days and for me. I like riding that that that early wave of these desktop stuff

255
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,420
It's always kind of been one of the one of the most entertaining aspects of using Linux for me is being right there on that

256
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,540
Edge and so I see it where it's at now, and I saw I've kept using it

257
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,880
I thought maybe I might go back to KD, but I kept using it after the Linux action show and

258
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,060
gosh, I'm

259
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,420
See I can really like it

260
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:16,540
I can use no over Katie because I mean there's other desktops out there of course you know that I that I enjoy

261
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,000
But so I would say at this point. I could see myself using gnome over Katie, but at the same time

262
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,820
You know yeah on an older machine. It's still bloated. I'm sorry it is

263
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,300
I mean just factually speaking if you run it on an older machine. It definitely feels bloated

264
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,340
Here's a new machine. It's fine, but what do you think of this one?

265
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,020
so

266
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:42,380
Obermeiser was writing says working working dual displays across four virtual desktops and then apps remembering size and position for me is a serious

267
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,260
requirement for integrations and productivity I find it annoying that opening up six to twelve apps across virtual desktops

268
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,420
It's it's annoying and unproductive

269
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,540
I'm surprised by it being a non-issue with the user base out there what he's talking about is like under

270
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,820
Kwin or Kde it will remember the position of a window whereas

271
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:05,540
I know I'm in GTK take the point that well this is up to the application to store the position and then restore itself to

272
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,620
That position well and see for myself

273
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,540
It's like okay, so you have your virtual desktops

274
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,300
And then of course you often times a lot of people have dual monitors or maybe even more than that

275
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,980
I run everything full screen

276
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,820
And so you know I'm doing side by side with whatever I'm working on one in one

277
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,220
Workspace and then if I need to switch to another virtual desktop

278
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,660
I do no big deal you know I've and so I just full desktop

279
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,500
I just it's just never been a thing for me one of the one of the bits of feedback

280
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,980
We got on the gnome 3 stuff is if you want a tip for working with gnome 3 is every time you decide to start

281
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,820
A new task or open a new window put move it to its own virtual desktop

282
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,420
So don't think of virtual desktops is just a spot to store a new window

283
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,380
But every time you begin a new activity you you you instead of opening a new window you move it

284
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,140
You open it to it in a new virtual space

285
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,140
And so I've been trying this even like with with like multiple web browsers

286
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,980
So I had I have the email up and when but one web browser, and I have the dyslexia pastebin

287
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,820
and

288
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,300
Site up in another browser

289
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,780
And so I I highlight the email in one and I just I slide down and I paste it and it actually has been working

290
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,380
Quite well for me

291
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,340
So I'm gonna continue to try that out instead of having a bunch of windows on one virtual desks

292
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,620
What I've always done before is this is my web browsing virtual desktop. This is my email and I am virtual desktop

293
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,860
This is my terminal virtual desktop, and it's always been very structured in my mind

294
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,420
And now I'm gonna do it more just based on hey

295
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,300
I need a task so I'm just gonna create a creative virtual desktop because he pointed out in gnome 3 you can you can create and

296
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,260
Destroy virtual desktops at whim just like you can open and close windows, so there's no real disadvantage to doing it

297
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,620
Yeah, exactly. That's that's really it and I mean a lot of people think well

298
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,420
Why the hell would you run everything fullscreen? I mean for myself personally just comes down to usability

299
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:41,460
I don't I'm very very easily distracted, so I don't want a lot of crap on the same on the same

300
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,860
Notice I can't deal with that. It is easier to focus

301
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,980
Especially for videos and chat rooms like that

302
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:55,060
All right, well one little bit of news that just broke too, and we're gonna be covering it way more in Linux action show on Sunday

303
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:00,880
We'll be covering all the best of Linux. It's already first day of CES. It's already been a blowout for Linux there

304
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Web OS made a made a comeback

305
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,260
Intel has an amazing SD sized x86 PC that runs Linux and

306
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:15,620
Valve has demonstrated showed off some of their new steam boxes and Matt we're seeing steam boxes from Alienware

307
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Alternet I buy power cyber power PC, and they are looking amazing

308
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,340
Well if you think about it, especially with Falcon Northwest and Alienware those are probably my two favorite examples

309
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,460
These are people that are being told over and over all the desktops gonna die, and it's all about mobile

310
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,900
This is their bread and butter

311
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,980
So they're they're not only embracing this right as an opportunity to show folks that it's not dead that they can in fact

312
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,740
Adapt adapt and evolve, but in the fact that it can actually be really awesome

313
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,140
And I think I think it's gonna be really exciting to see how some of these machines perform

314
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,340
Gigabyte is showing one that does use iris graphics, so that might be a limiting factor

315
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,300
But it's like sure I think they're talking four hundred dollars or something. Yeah, I mean

316
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,820
But great yeah, I think a little bit high

317
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,460
But I mean they got the lower end machines to the crazy what one was like between 17 and 6,000 yeah

318
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,420
Yeah, you can go real hardcore. Yeah, and I love that one. Yeah, oh, man

319
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:16,200
I'll tell you what I have seen so one that I thought was really compelling is one that actually mounts behind the TV

320
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,500
And it has it has a rack and it slides out

321
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,780
There's there's been some really interesting steam boxes showing off so pretty

322
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,700
Is that video card right there in the picture is the one I installed in the computer last night to cut on fire someone needs

323
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
To Photoshop fire on that yeah, no kidding

324
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,060
so

325
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,220
Really so far. It's been a great CES for Linux, so I'm looking forward to I see yes chat

326
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,980
I want I like the variety

327
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,740
I think that's like my number one thing that I'm really most excited about it even if you're not a gamer you have to appreciate

328
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,420
The fact that they are bringing back the desktop at some level yeah

329
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,860
You know various forms

330
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,460
And it's it's so cool to see these different takes on it like

331
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,940
Falcon Northwest is doing like a very cool paint job on the side of the case and there's so many different

332
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,420
Approaches to this problem. I I think this is gonna be awesome. I think it's gonna be really cool to watch great opportunity

333
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:12,460
Yeah, no, I just want one valve yeah, right trying to remind valve that Matt and Chris are within a couple hours at Matt

334
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,860
And not even that of driving distance. Just we will drive to you guys. Let me put that out there

335
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,740
We will literally we will bring you lunch. Yeah, whatever you want

336
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,940
We will dress up like butlers and serve you I mean whatever you need just let us hook up with one of these and you're always

337
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,540
Throwing the dress-up stuff. I know yeah, it's like I got like valve cosplay, right?

338
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:35,180
I don't know how that works don't dress it like a PC one more bit of feedback or follow-up

339
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,340
I want to get to is we talked about the AC or you see you see

340
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:45,660
Pi the turnkey Raspberry Pi based internet search engine that q5 systems started a Kickstarter for he's got 44 backers as

341
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,940
We record this episode and he joins us right now in the mumble room mr.. Q5

342
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,340
How would you say the Kickstarter is going? Are you pleased? I am very pleased I at no point

343
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,900
Expected to be at almost 25% within three days the response has been fantastic

344
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,100
So I think you know that reason is because I would guess the reason for the same reason you started doing this

345
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,060
Why did you want to make?

346
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,020
You see more accessible to people. What's your motivation there?

347
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,540
As you've talked about on on Linux action show and with an analytics unplugged about bringing

348
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,400
These services that we've kind of allowed other people to take care of for us to bring them back into house

349
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:29,720
That's been something that's you know been of a lot of interest to me and also just the privacy aspect that it gives a user

350
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,480
To be able to do searches locally and not have you know Big Brother or Google or Bing?

351
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:41,240
Sitting there cataloguing everything your every single thing that you're searching sure sure and now so why make it turnkey

352
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,200
Just so that it's the simplest possible

353
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,520
Implementation for someone who's not extremely technical oriented

354
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,400
To set up Yasi it takes some configuration. You've got to work find what the best settings are going to be and

355
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,320
There's a lot of people that I know would like to use software like this

356
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,800
But don't have the technical prowess to be able to set it up themselves this way everything's done

357
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,920
They get the item they plug it in they're good to go now

358
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,160
They may have to set they may have to set a port on their local router

359
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:15,080
So that the actual unit can talk out to the rest of the network, but that they can do just in their basic router settings

360
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:21,640
I guess my first question when I saw this is is the pie powerful enough to pull this off. Is it got enough juice?

361
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,960
To do searches. Yes, it has enough juice to do searches and also crawl and index the web. No it doesn't

362
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,960
The raspberry an image, which is what most people have been using for running Yasi on pies in the past

363
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,360
Respirant is a great release. It's a great distribution

364
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,240
But it has a lot of overhead because it's intended to be a full-fledged OS for everything

365
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,040
So you can get it and you can run an entire full-built

366
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,440
Linux distribution on your Raspberry Pi what I am doing is I've built a custom puppy Linux ARM release

367
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:01,760
Specifically for the task of running Yasi so it does not have any of the extra overhead or anything else that it doesn't need

368
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,040
It's as trim and as slim down as possible so that it can achieve the goal and nothing more very nice

369
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,600
And so I've got this picture up on the stream of your little Raspberry Pi cluster that you're testing different images on

370
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,960
And what are you kind of doing to to test the performance of it here?

371
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,720
I've got several different builds of the ARM release of puppy Linux itself

372
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm testing different variants of you know compiling busy box and seeing okay

373
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,880
Well, can I get better performance if I use if I compile it with certain options and not other options?

374
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
using the Debian RML

375
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,880
binaries just kind of picking through which ones are going to be the best for what I need and then once that's set up

376
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,080
Testing, you know just basic one job implementation and seeing okay, which of these, you know

377
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,680
OS setups works the best and then the next deck I'm going to go to is to figure out what's the best Java choice

378
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
To use because there are several that we can do

379
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,560
And then once that's chosen then take the next step of okay

380
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,040
What's the best way to configure the actual settings within Yasi?

381
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:09,640
So that the performance is the most stable wow, and so do you I mean are you hoping to sort of raise awareness of the?

382
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,400
Yasi project with this too, because I think a lot of people are seeing this and they're going well

383
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,640
Maybe I'll just roll this myself. Are you okay with that outcome?

384
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,680
Actually, I am perfectly fine if the campaign because of failure it does not bother me

385
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,880
This gets word out about the Yasi network and it gets people interested in it and it gets people actually deploying

386
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,200
It whether it's on laptops their home, whether they get like a digital ocean VPS, you know a little five dollar a month instance and throw it up

387
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,760
As long as it brings higher visibility to the project. I will be happy. This is probably a great

388
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,680
Digital ocean VPS wouldn't it? Yeah, I think it is. I know have you have you considered

389
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,280
Reaching out to the you see project and saying hey you guys cool with this or have they talked to you?

390
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,280
I've actually was contacted by a mic guy

391
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:02,400
I've actually was contacted by a Michael Christian who is the maintainer of the I see project

392
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,340
We got a message from him today had a couple emails back and forth. He is totally on board with it

393
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,640
You know, he said, you know, I hold on let me see if I can actually pull it up real quick

394
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,380
Hold on a second. So that's actually in the middle of emailing back

395
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,800
I wonder if you must have you know, maybe he was watching the last maybe he's a viewer then you never know

396
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,920
Hey, possibly you never know. Well, hello fees. All right

397
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,080
So we got 44 backers. There's 42 days left to go folks if you want to to pledge

398
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,680
We'll have a link in the show notes to this and or you could go over to a Kickstarter and search for why a CY pie

399
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,880
And I have the email up right now

400
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,000
Um, it goes on and in part of any was there's already been discussion if you know

401
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,860
Yasi pie my project is good or bad for the asses, you know network

402
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:56,260
And if a production of commercial Yasi type products are liked or disliked by me or the other developers

403
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,460
He said let me clear this out right now

404
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,100
I like the Yasi pie project and I am happy to support you awesome

405
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:08,120
And I responded back to him. I said look my goal is not to actually start producing these commercially and selling them

406
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,900
The Kickstarter campaign is to help defer the development costs of actually being able to do this once that's done

407
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,200
The SD card image will be completely released freely

408
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,840
Um, they will have a copy of it. It'll be on source forage. I'll have it on the actual website

409
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,600
So anyone can then at that point go get the SD card image burn it onto their own SD card if they have a raspberry

410
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,840
Pie and go that's awesome. My goal is not to make money off of this

411
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,920
It's to raise awareness and to get the tools into people's hands so that can actually be used. Well, you are a gentleman, sir

412
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:45,560
I I have been I've been borrowing quote-unquote. I keep a really nice not just the raspberry pie

413
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,180
But also an HP doc that was made for the atrix

414
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,720
I think it was like way back in the day

415
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,520
And so I've I've been experimenting with different uses for the raspberry pie

416
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,200
And I think if you know if you get that performance spot in there that is perfect for a device like this

417
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,460
It's essentially a search appliance for your house. Yeah

418
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,160
Awesome. All right. Well, mr

419
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,840
Q5 sister anything else you want to share with us before we go back on to other business?

420
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,660
Not really just I hope that you know anybody who is listening to this or is you know?

421
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:21,080
Considering it if you don't have the money to donate that's okay. Just instead help spread the word

422
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,320
Well good work, and I think it's awesome

423
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,200
You'll be releasing the image if we if we reach that goal too because then other folks who already have the pie can take advantage

424
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,180
Of it so and there are there are also if you don't have a pie yet

425
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,860
He's got backing levels which will get you like a complete solution and you just take it and go so well good work, sir

426
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,780
And stay stick around if you'd like and join us for the rest of the discussion here in a moment

427
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,980
Yeah, congratulations on the progress so far. That's really awesome. Yeah. Yeah, that is really great

428
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,660
So I want to take a moment and thank our second sponsor this week and that speaking of digital ocean

429
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
We were just talking about them is

430
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:59,020
Digital ocean digital ocean is simple cloud hosting dedicated offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server

431
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,900
You can create a server in 55 seconds and pricing plans started only five dollars per month

432
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,920
512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer for that five dollars a month

433
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,380
digital ocean has data center locations in New York San Francisco and

434
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:21,420
Amsterdam the interface is simple and it has an intuitive control panel which power users can replicate on a large scale with an API and

435
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:29,100
Digital ocean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community section and the users can submit articles and if digital ocean publishes that piece

436
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:32,300
50 bones folks you get $50 from digital ocean

437
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,380
You can get the link to it more info about that in our show notes now. Here's the thing

438
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,540
You guys get to be part of the hip club. We got a special thing

439
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,360
We still we're still using the special promo code from last month now. I know you're gonna think but Chris

440
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,300
This is January trust me dear viewer listener

441
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,520
I know that but I like every now and then to get you guys in on the club

442
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,540
You know we like to sometimes stick it to the man right well guess what you can still use Linux unplug

443
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:04,580
December when you're over digital ocean, and you'll get a $10 credit you can try out that $5 machine for two months for free

444
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,940
When you use the promo code Linux unplugged December, I want to recommend you do it, and you know

445
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,720
Q5 sis kind of inspired me

446
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,680
I kind of want to go throw you see on my digital ocean droplet, or maybe spin up another one

447
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,900
Hey, I'd pay five dollars a month for my own totally private

448
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,240
Completely self-controlled search. I think that's totally worth it. Oh definitely

449
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,760
Uh geez I think I'm gonna do this. I mean, I think that's a great idea so digital ocean has all kinds of great

450
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,440
Technologies KVM for the virtualization SSD hard drives for the speed

451
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,360
amazing hardware

452
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,880
Flexible API great bandwidth and of course they also offer incredible pricing you can get a

453
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,800
$5 a month machine 512 makes about RAM a cool one core processor 20 gig SSD one terabyte of transfer you go up to

454
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,560
$10 then you get a gig of RAM you get 30 gigs of storage and two terabytes of transfer you go up to

455
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,360
$20 is two gigabytes of memory two cores of CPU 40 gigabyte SSD and three terabytes of transfer and on and on and on

456
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,360
They also offer hourly pricing if you just need to do a little testing if you're working on a web app and you want

457
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,520
To have your client take a look at it

458
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,760
You want to have a few folks just to do some Q&A or maybe some critiquing for you you could toss it up on

459
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,220
A digital ocean droplet turn it on and then just pay by hour and the rates are absolutely I mean nobody beats these rates

460
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,220
It's awesome. So go over to digital ocean

461
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:23,140
Dot-com and use our special limited time promo code Linux unplugged December to get that $10 credit and a big

462
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:27,420
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplug. Oh, definitely. Those guys are so awesome

463
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,200
I love the fact that you can just basically run it any way you want

464
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,500
You know, they don't treat you like you don't know what you're doing. You just get a blank box and you have to go for it

465
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,380
Absolutely. I love I love the droplet and I love having root access on my machine. I mean, that's a huge deal for me

466
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,620
All right, so I want to open this up to discussion here with the mumble room last week

467
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,240
I asked the question does does open source governance by

468
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,540
Consensus of the community

469
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:55,520
Inhibit innovations and where I'll point this I'll point out a couple of things what we're watching happening right now

470
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,620
For me seems to be a great example of this with Debian

471
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,700
They are down the path now of choosing something besides systemd primarily because they are concerned about

472
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,340
Portability to the BSD's even though according to the voluntary

473
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,420
Survey hardware software survey for Debian users only

474
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,580
0.8% of Debian users would be affected or it might even be less than that

475
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,740
It is it is an infinitesimal small portion of the Debian community

476
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:34,320
It would be impacted by the switch to systemd but the switching of to systemd would be I would see the positives of that would be

477
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,780
Much more interoperability with Linux at a large at a larger scope

478
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,540
So I look at this and I think if this was for example if they had a Mark Shuttleworth or they had a Steve Jobs

479
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:49,900
Or they had a who uh, you know a Larry Page whoever sitting at Debian who was responsible for making these decisions

480
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,940
He would look at this and he would say hey, you know what portability is great

481
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,620
It's something to aspire to but let's be practical and let's get real here

482
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,660
We have to make a competitive product that a lot of people can use that'll you know, it'll stay relevant

483
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,580
It 2015 2016 and beyond let's go this direction

484
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,860
And I feel like that would be I actually feel like that's the most it is so blatantly obvious

485
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,020
that's the way to go the only reason we're not going that way is because

486
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:20,100
the way community works is a small minority if they push the right buttons and if they're vocal enough can influence the herd into

487
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,980
A certain direction where all of a sudden it it becomes a sacred cow to sacrifice portability

488
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,340
You that's that's Debian's core vision. You can't sacrifice portability

489
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,700
you can't do that and if really if you took a rational look at it and if somebody who was a leader a

490
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,380
Dictator if you want if you will or a benevolent overload looked at and said come on, this is just not practical

491
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,660
It's not tenable. Let's get real here. I feel like I feel like that's what would happen. Yeah, go ahead. I

492
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,940
Beg to disagree there do it because first

493
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:56,700
It might seem a bit weird that Debian has such a strong feeling about its principles

494
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,780
but that's just it principles openness diversity and

495
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,620
Nobody knows what the future will hold. Is it principles or is it almost like a well?

496
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,580
We don't want to we want to tell ourselves ego crap

497
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,820
To me it feels like we don't we don't want to we don't want to say even though it's not true

498
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,420
I feel like a little bit as well

499
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,780
We don't want to bet the whole farm on Linux because maybe ten years down the road

500
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,360
Linux is gonna die and we want to be able to we want to be at this portable system that will move to whatever becomes the

501
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,240
New king like it's almost like enough a fear to commit to Linux in a sense, even though it sounds ridiculous

502
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,160
That's almost what it sounds like to me when I look at it. I

503
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,160
Don't know what this printing is

504
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I feel like principles is a way to cover up that fear unless they can cite something concrete concrete besides ego stroking

505
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm just not buying

506
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,280
Stuff is already coming through on yeah and testing. So I mean we all know that they're gonna go system

507
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,080
Well, I don't actually know it's not looking like they are gonna go with system D

508
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,440
I think they're gonna do up starter. Well, I'm not

509
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,680
Yeah, I mean I don't know what they're gonna go with but now it's looking like according to what I read on the Linux WN

510
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,400
Over the weekend. It looks like they're not going the system D direction. I think it's interesting that when you introduce this you said

511
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,960
You know, maybe if Debian had a Mark Shuffleworth type person or a benevolent dictator that this might not happen

512
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,680
But then the fact is that even the Ubuntu project has a technical board and they have discussions like this and mark doesn't swoop in

513
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,080
And you know kick everyone to one side and say nope

514
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,640
This will be the way it happens take for example and a discussion happening just this week about whether we should re-enable

515
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,120
Suspend to disk on Ubuntu and the whole technical board are weighing in on the pros and cons of re-enabling that thing

516
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:49,980
So and I so I think all Debian are doing is the same kind of thing that the Ubuntu technical board would do which is

517
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,580
Evaluate all the options given their principles and make a decision based on technical and other merits. That is true

518
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,320
However, what mark has a very public thing

519
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,600
Public mark and they don't have timescales like like, you know, they don't have a release date like we do

520
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,780
I think but see mark can set the tone right mark and say

521
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,140
Convergence is the future and then that frames the conversation that everybody has from that point and just that ability is

522
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
huge because it you you

523
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,860
fundamentally alter the state of the conversation that the group has when you set the cadence like that and Debbie doesn't have that

524
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,660
Some degree but they they have their free software guidelines. They have their principles

525
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,420
They they have a long history of you know doing the right thing

526
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:37,620
And I think they want to continue doing the right thing whether that means it system D or upstart

527
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,980
Yeah, they want to do the right thing

528
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:46,660
and I I think their influence is just not one guy or a set of contracts that canonical may have with OEMs its

529
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,200
principles I have I could agree it see

530
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,140
at what point do you reevaluate the principles because it almost seems like

531
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:03,140
Insanity to me to make this level of sacrifice just to maintain compatibility with BSD when in reality

532
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,780
You know anybody that runs Debbie and BSD in large-scale production. No, it doesn't happen

533
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,100
It is it's a it's a it's it's it's a dream

534
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:17,260
It's it's a hope that the Debian project could get utilized for something that the BSD guys have already got covered

535
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,900
They're pretty happy with their package management. They're going off doing their own thing

536
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,380
Anyways, it seems like Debbie ins principles drive them to aspire to something that is ludicrous

537
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,100
Well, you know, I don't know it's gonna be interesting to see how it turns out

538
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:38,540
I at this point unless I can actually see a working table citing exactly what the hell they're dragging their feet with and why

539
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:46,300
Because for just the average guy looking into this it's it's just it's mind-boggling. It's just like oh my god make a decision already

540
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,220
You know, I mean seriously, I feel like this isn't this isn't the first time that the Debbie

541
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,860
But it does kind of get old after a while though

542
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:00,060
Well, the problem is they are not just five guys

543
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:05,140
They are several hundred guys and they just have different opinions and they need to talk about it

544
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,780
By the way, it's absolutely fine by the way

545
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,580
It is good because I I don't mean to keep cutting you off

546
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,780
But I want to you I want to respond to each point you're making it that is true it to an extent

547
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:21,780
but it also allows for stagnation and it allows for a

548
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:28,700
Washing down to the lowest common denominator and instead of making something amazing and streamlined

549
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,780
You can make something that makes everybody happy and I talked about this with gnome

550
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,940
on the Linux action show is when you have

551
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,780
Designed by community you really get something that's not that great. And when you have designed

552
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,460
I didn't say it. So you but you are making my point for me is exactly that

553
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:53,700
I feel like you could apply that that scenario to Debian is

554
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,660
They would as the larger the community gets the more discussions that happen

555
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:03,840
It actually turns out that the more arbitrary aspects of the community are able to wield a larger

556
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:10,700
Influence and you I think if if this could be streamlined the pace of innovation would be a lot higher

557
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,720
It slows us down a lot. It really weighs things down

558
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:20,100
Well, Chris, wait, wait, wait, wait, the first thing you need to remember is either way it really does not matter

559
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
How the outcome is in this?

560
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,320
discussion

561
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:28,660
System D is already in Debian as is upstart and open I see

562
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,900
I don't know if open RC is in it

563
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,540
But it doesn't really matter how the outcome is because both in its systems are already in Debian true

564
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,180
So you can choose whether you want it or not

565
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:44,900
But we do know the discussion is just a yes. The discussion is just about the default, right?

566
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:49,100
And I but I think that's as good as that is just as good as only having one. Yes

567
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,340
so and also don't forget the the

568
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,220
what you're what we're all navel-gazing and

569
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,060
Bike-shedding about

570
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:07,340
This same thing will have will have been happening on that mailing list over the years and nobody would have been looking at it

571
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,540
There would have been no Twitter. There would have been minimal podcasts

572
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,100
There wouldn't have been you know

573
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:19,340
Everyone sharing on Twitter links to oh so-and-so said this on the Debian project mailing list because nobody cares

574
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:25,700
Or the people who do care are the people who are already on that list and having those discussions, right?

575
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:31,240
It's the sharp focus of you know, the 24-hour news the the Twitter generation of people who are

576
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:37,180
You know having an opinion and want to express that opinion rapidly and in 140 characters

577
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,900
When in fact, that's not how Debian works and I don't think Debian should work

578
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:46,540
I think what it what it is is we are reaching an influx point in Linux where I was just talking about this in Coda

579
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,440
Radio where the the the core between the distributions with systemd and a lot of other things

580
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,900
You know big changes in the kernel too is becoming less and less chaotic

581
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:04,380
It's actually becoming we could see a future where developers don't look at Linux as this crazy wild west of all of these different

582
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,060
Fractured I mean you talk about Android fragmentation. Let's talk about distro fragmentation for a minute

583
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,900
But that is kind of coming together

584
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,900
it's kind of cajoling a little bit and

585
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:19,060
Debian is now at a crossroads where they could choose to go down that path or they could choose to be fragmented and different and

586
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,580
The the hope is because Debian is so important to all the people built off of it and because Debian is such a critical

587
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,580
distro to Linux itself. I

588
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:33,420
Want to see more great development come into Linux and I feel like the more consistency we have there in in the middle of these

589
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:38,300
Distros the better the better time and we're gonna have from our dev, you know, the better applications

590
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,500
We're gonna get the more applications

591
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,700
We're gonna get the more people that will target Linux and the more fractured we are the less likely that's gonna happen

592
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,040
You're gonna continue to see software that only works on Red Hat or software that only works on Ubuntu

593
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:55,420
Laundry list of reasons why it's a benefit right? It's great. It's awesome and all go all this choice

594
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,160
Yeah, sure. We can't get any two things to run. It's the same way and same

595
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,480
That's such a critical thing, you know if we have if we have a future in which we can start to

596
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,640
Smooth some of those differences out. I am I I I don't want to I don't want to you know

597
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,460
Sacrifice something important to get there

598
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:18,560
But I also want to make sure that if we don't go that direction we have some damn really good reasons like I mean really good

599
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,320
Good

600
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,840
I think people are just making this out to be way more of a big deal than it is

601
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,160
Is remember when our to switch the system be everybody just went insane?

602
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,000
Two months later. It was like, oh, yeah that happened

603
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,420
Remember when we move the buttons over to the left hand side

604
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,920
Yeah, yeah or remember when skies opened up when we switch to pulse audio

605
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,440
Well, that was kind of crappy first so but I think this the stakes are a little bit different in this one because it's more

606
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,800
about what future Linux is gonna look like and how

607
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,400
compatible each distro is gonna be with each other and you know if skills learned in one distro like how to stop and start services are

608
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,920
applicable to another distro and those small little things like all to us

609
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,460
Those of us who use Linux on a regular basis

610
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,920
They seem trivial but people who are maybe like a Windows admin for their whole career and now they just got Linux boxes

611
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,760
These are the little details that make night and day difference for them and anytime, you know

612
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,800
We can reduce the differentiation between the different distros the better

613
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,560
it's going to be for all Linux adoption as a whole and and I just I

614
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:41,480
Appreciate that there they have a lot of technical requirements and principles to follow and that's what makes Debbie and as good as it is

615
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,480
But I guess I have to wonder again if you took out the community element of the decision-making process and you just put a CEO

616
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,800
In there, I think he would come down pretty handedly on the system D side of the discussion

617
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,640
Dictatorship and to import this corporate Borg into Debian really? No. No, I mean I wouldn't want that. No

618
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,460
thing is not a problem like people look at group thing as horrible and it's it's great and also it's it's it's it's got a

619
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,580
Massive flaws, but if you had like say a board of three people that were

620
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:22,540
In control of the group thing and saying this is the direction we're looking at and then they have like a mediation situation

621
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,600
Then you could get input from everyone

622
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:30,440
but at the same time and and you get any you give input but you also get like

623
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,460
Do you give everybody who's putting their input as a valid, you know?

624
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,460
They have the same amount of input or the same

625
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,220
Their their merit is the same

626
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,500
They don't have any kind of skewed if you have a CEO

627
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:46,860
Then everybody's just gonna listen to the CEO and then they're the opinions are gonna just dwindle. Yeah

628
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:50,780
I mean the technical board is I think probably the right answer I guess I

629
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:57,700
Just look at this. We actually got a really good email in on this that really kind of I thought did a good job

630
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,700
it came from Kyle and

631
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,620
You guys can you can feel free if you think Kyle is off the rails to interrupt

632
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:09,140
But he wrote I'm writing in regarding your question in this week's a Linux unplugged about whether Linux has too much endless

633
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:16,180
Squabbling and consensus decision-making that inhibits innovation versus a top-down organization like Apple or canonical that can follow a singular vision

634
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,180
Oh, don't get poppy started again

635
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,780
Essentially your question comes down to an argument of the merits of democracy versus dictatorship

636
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,180
While I appreciate you raising the question

637
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:31,860
I have to say the implication the implications of your argument seem to distinctly be negative in the freedom dimension. Oh, hold on

638
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:37,900
There we go dimension he says I got it I got it busted out

639
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,380
I think your question doesn't just have to do with innovation

640
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:44,980
But also the common argument that Linux is bad because debates within the community are too heated

641
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,180
I'm sure many others will write in with technical or practical opinions on this question

642
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,940
But I thought I'd bring it a little bit of political theory since I have a liberal arts background that others might not I would

643
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,180
Argue the Linux community is like a Roman is like the Roman Republic

644
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:04,220
It has its own sorts of dictators consuls tribunes and any number of other competing powers

645
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:10,660
It has an armed citizenry just like Rome did where users are largely free to contribute code and start projects and it is driven

646
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,380
by a chaotic political structure that leads to competition and

647
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,020
expansion

648
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:19,940
Like the Spartans Apple is careful in its expansion plans choosing to occupy

649
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:26,740
particular upscale segments of the market and it certainly has a lot of success with that like the leonians or

650
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,340
leonians the

651
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:36,100
300 Apple elite has elite Apple's elite of workers could be said to punch above their weight in terms of innovation

652
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,840
But when you look at the big picture in terms of install base and not just the direct market value

653
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,220
Apple is dwarfed by the chaotic Hydra like

654
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,620
Expansion of Linux and open source our Liberty is the condition for our success

655
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:54,400
We are positive in the size dimension because we are positive in the freedom dimension

656
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,260
So just as Romans occasionally found the need to elect dictators to lead them

657
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,900
We may occasionally find the need for executive powers to get things done

658
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:08,420
But let our envy of Apple not lead us to expand these islands of tyranny to the point that they crushed the Liberty that makes

659
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:10,420
Linux so great. I

660
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:16,980
Agree with a lot of what they said. I really cringed when he used Romans an example because I for one enjoy myself my Roman citizenship

661
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,060
Oh wait, that's right. We're not because it collapsed, you know

662
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,420
I like some of the I like some of the things he said but man

663
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,780
I was just cringing the whole time with the whole Rome thing because it's like bad example

664
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,780
Maybe this is why Debbie wants to keep that BSP competitive

665
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,780
Oh, horrible, horrible

666
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,780
Rome was moved to Byzantium

667
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,780
to

668
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:40,420
Over to Byzantium the capital Rome was moved to Constantinople by Constantine and it's just proper

669
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,820
basically propaganda

670
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:49,540
By Roman Catholics or whatever that it's been collapsed, but it lasted for a long time before

671
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,060
It lasted for a long time and it had

672
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:57,780
It brought forth amazing successes as did Greece and a lot of other other things but empires fall

673
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,780
I mean at the end of the day, that's

674
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:08,060
The parallel Kyle was drawing there is that the the essentially chaotic and sometimes competitive nature of the political structure of Linux sort of

675
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:13,940
Leads to it's always growing expansion in new areas and new territories agree with that. Yeah. No, I agree with the points

676
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,380
I just the whole realm thing just really rubbing the wrong way

677
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:23,180
I think you're missing a bigger point here to is Linux is not bigger than any one dish show. It's

678
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:28,180
Colonel so it doesn't matter what one dish show back. There's always another

679
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,300
Places. Yeah, and I'll tell you the other thing

680
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,620
I've really noticed over the years of doing these shows is the things that seem like the biggest

681
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,740
Biggest technical upsets or the you know, the thing we really got to be concerned about

682
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,300
Have yet to ever actually be that

683
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:48,940
You know, like I look back you remember the amount of upset around Novell signing that deal with Microsoft

684
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:55,740
We did like three weeks of coverage on the Linux action show back to back to back discussing that issue because it was so red

685
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,940
hot right or you know a lot of other things that

686
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,020
Has happened in the past always seem like these X

687
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:08,020
Lend. Yeah, everything right and then like so so say say Debian doesn't choose system D

688
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:11,260
Hey, somebody will just figure out a way to still make things compatible and work

689
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,960
I mean we all that's what happens right every time but it is interesting to sort of look at this and think that

690
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,940
Every now and then I wonder how much further would we be if we had a few more?

691
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,500
benevolent dictators in these communities because I think where you do see real progress made in open source is

692
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:33,840
These little fiefdoms we have of like, you know, here's Camp Apache over here. You know, here's Camp Ubuntu. There's Camp fedora

693
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,960
There's can't you know or even more even more granular that there's camp system D

694
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,820
And they have their they have their sort of appointed

695
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:45,180
Chiefs that sort of push them forward and then as a collective whole we all benefit

696
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,860
But it's kind of like in a way the body all works together

697
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,940
It's sort of this weird organic creature that has some

698
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,820
Some ugly spots that we all get to just look at and watch because it's all happening out in the open

699
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,700
I've awesome

700
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:04,940
I've often made the point that if these these types of discussions happen at the Microsoft's and at the Apple's and the Oracle's of the world

701
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,860
But they're all done behind closed doors. So we have no idea where the way those conversations went

702
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,020
This is true. This is true. I also think that the

703
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,620
Open way of doing things is more holistic. Sure

704
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:22,380
It may not be as fast, but it's definitely more holistic and the way it grows. Hey

705
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,220
Yeah, I wanted to shift gears why we got the mumble room here

706
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,900
What do you guys think about the cent OS team joining Red Hat? What do you think that means?

707
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Nobody

708
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
I

709
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,820
It's it's also the way they say they talk about it

710
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:46,800
It sounds like it's going to be a front a backing of the center was not necessarily an overtake on

711
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,460
gonna make it for

712
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,060
sale and

713
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,500
Kill the cent OS team in the process

714
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,220
It's a good thing yeah, it's a complete redo of their initiatives

715
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,260
It's it's gonna turn the project something else. They made it sound like it's gonna keep going as is

716
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:10,140
but the part I'm wondering is what what we kind of what I talked about during the fedora 20 review is the fedora project is

717
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:11,400
Redoing, you know

718
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:17,340
They got fedora next and they're talking in that proposal about potentially having a server spin of fedora

719
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:22,340
And I at the time I looked at and go that sounds like a cent OS competitor and I wonder if maybe there's some

720
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,500
Some sort of collaboration that might happen there, but I just don't know is it more of a

721
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:31,440
Ubuntu server competitor in the cloud space not so much the service base with the cloud space

722
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,620
That's what they like this is this red hat buying themselves into that space

723
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:42,040
That's what I'm wondering right because cent OS has huge deployments in a lot of the cloud services and cloud hosting

724
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,460
It's like I use into us

725
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:52,320
So I don't think fedora will ever directly compete with cent OS in the server market just because they target different

726
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,480
Different areas, I mean, I guess fedora could work well as

727
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,120
as

728
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,760
in the cloud space

729
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,240
But sent to us is a much more concerned distribution than fedora is right

730
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:10,400
And so it will act more like an abutu LTS or rail itself because I've been in companies where we're still using

731
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,840
rail 5 and it's still support or sena was 5 and it's all supported and

732
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,340
You're not going to upgrade versions because it's such a huge effort to do so

733
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:24,320
And if you're on fedora if they have the current release cycle and they're releasing every I guess they release six months, right?

734
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,280
It would be impossible to support that

735
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:34,160
Yeah, I think so the way they're working this in fedora next is they're gonna have like rings where the first ring will be

736
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:40,280
Like the cloud version fedora that sees more conservative changes and then there'll be the set of stuff on top of that

737
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,600
That's the next ring. Maybe it's like more network services and there's a third ring

738
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,520
which is like the desktop services that sit on top of that and the idea is is you could pull out just that middle ring and

739
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,920
You would have just a very minimal core

740
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,960
Literally gonna call it fedora core again

741
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,080
And then that could be their hope I think is to have that be

742
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,160
server ready to make that make that core not change that much and

743
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,380
That would be what people deploy like on digital ocean VPS's and and other places

744
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,040
and it it is kind of like

745
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,400
You got a figure

746
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,520
Red has been sitting back and watching Ubuntu eat its lunch on like a lot on EC2 and a lot of racks based

747
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,560
deployments, I mean

748
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:29,140
Red Hat is has a presence there, but they're not staying competitive with the LTS is with the LTS Ubuntu releases

749
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:36,280
So I think the big picture is is it's probably to compete there, but I don't see exactly how it's good news for the CentOS

750
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,560
team, I think

751
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,560
It's gonna be interesting and it's one of these things where I'm not quite sure if the audience is that interested because it's all server

752
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,960
stuff so it yanks my chain because I used to be a server guy and I don't know if it really if

753
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,520
CentOS becomes a

754
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,760
you know a really

755
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,720
popular option in the cloud space then

756
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,960
Red Hat have an upsell there

757
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:05,040
Pretty easily to go in the same way that Oracle upsell from my SQL to Oracle database

758
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,920
You can upsell from CentOS to rail licenses. Yeah, totally. It seems a no-brainer for them

759
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,680
Yeah, I really that that aspect of it totally makes sense. That's exactly what it is

760
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,040
And yeah, that's probably gonna work. Red Hat's gonna make more money surprise surprise everybody

761
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,840
Yeah, right

762
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:27,080
Red Hat doing this is actually interesting for CentOS too because the Red Hat was making it harder for CentOS to make their

763
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:31,040
using the Red Hat source code to make it they modularized everything and

764
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,920
They made it like piece by piece that CentOS had to get best the legal issues. They had to kind of

765
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,440
Put a lot of effort into making each release

766
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:48,320
So now maybe CentOS could actually improve like how fast they do things so they can make it make it easier

767
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:56,120
Thanks to Red Hat funding it then so CentOS could actually improve a lot of and a lot of ways very quickly

768
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,380
I wonder so in a post NSA

769
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:04,480
revelations world where we know there's distributions out there like isn't red Linux that Chinese Linux distribution that's based off CentOS and

770
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:10,680
They wanted a distro that wasn't attached to a US company. That's why they spun that I wonder how that impacts stuff like that now

771
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,400
Work, maybe yeah, maybe yeah, maybe a fork. Yeah, they could just fork it and maintain it

772
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,080
Maybe the maybe it's not a big deal. Yeah, but CentOS was just a hack

773
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,480
Well

774
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:30,120
It was it it didn't it wasn't compatible with Red Hat and anybody I know that was running it in production

775
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,120
I told them absolutely not

776
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,220
What are you talking about? It's not compatible. Yeah, it's entirely binary compatible

777
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,600
But what way have you found on that? It's not compatible

778
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,840
mostly upgrades and packages that were

779
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,000
critical to

780
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Red Hat EL

781
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,560
and trying to run some

782
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,720
applications that were

783
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,420
Suggested for Red Hat EL

784
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,920
Trying to run in CentOS. It was just a nightmare. I haven't experienced something

785
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,360
I know I've actually had been pretty fortunate. I have I've even gone as far as taking like I can't I'm gonna get the numbers

786
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:08,520
Wrong, but I took like a CentOS 5 installation

787
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,240
Or I'm sorry

788
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:17,020
I took a Red Hat 5 installation and repointed the repos over to CentOS 6 and I actually upgraded

789
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,060
The release of that installation of CentOS 5 to Red Hat

790
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:26,400
I'm sorry from Red Hat 5 to CentOS 6 like I went to a whole new version and switched from Red Hat to CentOS

791
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,200
It's not recommended, but I there was the server where there was just absolutely no option other than that

792
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,400
And I did it and it I was like amazed to me

793
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,320
I was stunned because I went from Red Hat 5 to CentOS 6 and I changed repos and all that kind of stuff

794
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,880
So there I was been quite successful

795
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:47,360
But I suppose you could always have an application that would maybe double-check to make sure it's on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

796
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,120
And then just kick you up a refusal to operate. Is that what you ran into Don?

797
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:58,560
I don't think it was anything in the app itself. It definitely had something to do with libraries that were

798
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,240
renamed and you know we

799
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,840
Real kind of thing. Yeah, maybe to take out the branding or whatever in like a file name or something

800
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:13,620
Huh? Plus I had a major problem trying to go from five eight or whatever up to six something

801
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:18,240
There just wasn't an easy way to upgrade. There you go. There you go

802
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:23,960
I that's a little good a good little piece of feedback and thanks to the jack-in-the-box to for voicing

803
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,000
Yeah, a good descent there because you know

804
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,560
I mean you were I brought good points in defending Debian and and my only I guess my closing my closing army would be is

805
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,060
Debbie's got to do what's good for Debbie and whatever the end of the day

806
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:40,500
I don't know enough about what they do to make any broad judgments

807
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,720
I just I just would like to see them kind of pick their direction and embrace it and then continue to

808
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:51,280
Crawl along at a snail's pace as usual. I would love to see them choose something that makes Debian work better with Linux

809
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,040
Yeah, and I would love to see them not make a bad decision just because they're not questioning principles from time to time

810
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,680
But as long as those things aren't happening, I'm happy. Hey, they're happy. I'm whatever they go with right sure

811
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,920
I yeah, I had something to say about that too because I come from the Unix side. Mm-hmm

812
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,580
You know, I'm all for system D. I use it in arch and everything. It's something new

813
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,860
I don't see why Debian should be

814
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,300
You know holding back

815
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,100
My problem is that now

816
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,860
Linux is sort of getting away from the init RC world, right and

817
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:34,520
You know now I'm I'm in the Unix side doing RC and now I got to come up with a whole different. Yeah

818
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:40,300
There is that there is a big change and it's a lot different but all right guys

819
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:44,620
Well good show and thank you very much for all the inputs. That was a good discussion and we'll have links to the stuff

820
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:49,440
We talked about like a q5 sys a yasi pie. Yeah, or you see pie turnkey solution

821
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,440
Maybe go back him if you like the idea and we also have a link to that CentOS news

822
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,500
We'll have further discussion about all the stuff that happened at CES Matt coming up on Sunday

823
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:03,020
I think box stuff steam box stuff will just be part of our overall coverage. So should be a great show assuming

824
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:08,740
Chase's flight isn't delayed. He'll be joining us to cover what he saw. He's on the floor right now at CES

825
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:13,900
So we'll have a great wrap of that following all that if you see some good CES stories that are Linux related

826
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,980
Please link them up in the Linux action show subreddit. I'd love to go through that as we're preparing our coverage

827
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:22,860
So Matt have a great weekend. I'll see you on Sunday. Okay. All right. See you then. All right, everyone
