1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,460
pre-ordered me a PinePhone.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,620
The Braveheart Edition.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,300
That's exciting.

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,420
Did you get one, Cheesy?

5
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:05,980
I did.

6
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,020
I did, in fact, get one.

7
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm really looking forward to it.

8
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,500
What about you, Wes?

9
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,260
No.

10
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:11,860
What?

11
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,660
No, it's OK.

12
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,300
You know, I'm going to let you guys deal

13
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,060
with all the first-run defects, and I'm

14
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,700
going to pick one up later after they've solved all those issues.

15
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,100
So what you're saying is you don't have a Braveheart.

16
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,740
Yeah, that's right.

17
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,780
He's going to geek vicariously through us, Chees.

18
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,460
It's OK.

19
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,900
I'll be fine with that.

20
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:38,660
Hello, friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 328.

21
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,340
My name is Chris.

22
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,180
My name is Wes.

23
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,300
Well, hello, Mr. Wes.

24
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,540
Hello, things feel different today, but still the same.

25
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,260
Yeah, a little fresher.

26
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,780
I think so.

27
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,340
Yeah, I think so.

28
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,100
Energetic.

29
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,800
Well, and it might just be that we have a great panel.

30
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,460
Hello, Cheesy and Alex.

31
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,100
Hello, hello.

32
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,080
Hello there.

33
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,580
Hello.

34
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,420
Hello.

35
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,980
We have a really fun show today.

36
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,480
So we have some community news we're

37
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,540
going to cover right here off the top.

38
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,980
And then we're going to jump into Chees' experience

39
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,140
at the System76 Superfan event.

40
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,340
And it's like Chees Unplugged this week,

41
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
because on top of that, Chees has been rocking

42
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,020
the Pine Book Pro full time.

43
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,660
So we're going to get his take on that and what he thinks.

44
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,980
And to sort of round all of this off,

45
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,940
the Pine64 community manager, Lucas,

46
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,940
is going to join us to chat about the status of the project,

47
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,140
where things are going, a little bit about this,

48
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,520
a little bit about that.

49
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,100
And then we're going to wrap it all up

50
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,700
with some cool pics and all that kind of stuff

51
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,580
that we always do.

52
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,700
It's how we roll.

53
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,280
Absolutely.

54
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,480
I mean, we may not do a pic.

55
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:33,980
We may.

56
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:34,820
We may not.

57
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,940
Sometimes I just sneak in there.

58
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,060
Something I've been thinking about, adding to the show,

59
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,940
and so I'm soliciting emails now,

60
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,980
is I think I want to make a follow-up, a reoccurring

61
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,120
thing for a little while, like a follow-up sprint.

62
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,580
I mean, we've been doing this long enough, right?

63
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,900
We should take advantage of it.

64
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,300
As we round out 2019, I want to hear what the folks have

65
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,620
to say, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

66
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,500
If we get some emails, keep an eye out, Wes.

67
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,580
If we get some emails coming in that are like follow-up items,

68
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,100
in that segment, what I'd like to do

69
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,420
is cover people's follow-up to what we've talked about.

70
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,940
But also, if we have any additional notes to add,

71
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,300
I want to talk about in that segment, too.

72
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,580
Maybe we were running something for a little bit

73
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,620
after we talked about it on the show,

74
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,860
and we discovered something additional.

75
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,260
That'd be where we'd slip that in.

76
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,420
Something we might try, we'll give it a go.

77
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,340
But it all depends on what you send us at linuxunplug.com

78
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,540
slash contact.

79
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,180
So let's kick things off with the news.

80
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,900
But before we do that, we've got to say time,

81
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,300
appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

82
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,140
Hello.

83
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,640
Hello.

84
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,140
Hello.

85
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,980
Hello.

86
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,480
Aloha.

87
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,700
Happy Linux Tuesday, everyone.

88
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,820
Wow.

89
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,340
You know, a big thank you to Brent, Byte, Neil, DM, Jill,

90
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,300
Colonel, MiniMech, Stefan, and TC for joining us on a new time.

91
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,900
New time.

92
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,020
Noon Pacific over at jblive.tv on Tuesday.

93
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,780
Same day, though.

94
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,820
We won't leave you Tuesday.

95
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,580
And also, we have an awesome IRC showing, too.

96
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,820
I'm getting good first impressions.

97
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,300
I was super nervous about this.

98
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,100
All right, so let's talk about the news,

99
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,780
starting with the good folks over at KDE.

100
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,340
KDE EV, the corporation, or the entity, I guess I should say.

101
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,900
The legal entity behind KDE.

102
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,140
Is looking for a project manager to help them reach their goals.

103
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,980
It's a PDF we have linked in the show notes.

104
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,560
And in there, Wes, they say what their ideal candidate is.

105
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,900
Yeah, well, hopefully, the ideal candidate

106
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,340
is able to help the community in achieving its goals

107
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,500
by being a reliable support system

108
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,320
for all organizational matters.

109
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,300
I mean, that includes delivering reports to the board,

110
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,700
sort of being the person who's keeping track of all the things

111
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,660
and making sure the projects got everything they need.

112
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,820
You could really see how they could probably

113
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,580
use somebody like that.

114
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,940
That would improve communication.

115
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,860
It would probably improve cross-project collaboration,

116
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,180
help them unify some of their efforts.

117
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,060
So if you think you might be a candidate that

118
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,580
could help take the project to the next level,

119
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,800
go check it out.

120
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,780
I've spent the weekend again with Plasma just recently.

121
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,820
It really is great.

122
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,060
You know, I thought, I thought, boy.

123
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,540
I can tell.

124
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,620
I mean, you're glowing.

125
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,500
I kind of.

126
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,060
I just rediscovered just how wonderful it is,

127
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,860
because I've been spending a lot of time with Gnome Shell.

128
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,520
Because I need to do these things.

129
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,060
I need to try it out.

130
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,460
And so I had an opportunity to try out

131
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,060
mangero Plasma Edition.

132
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,460
I'm very impressed by what they've done.

133
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,780
They've pre-installed some really great fonts.

134
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,900
They're not necessarily all turned on or selected

135
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,700
by default.

136
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,340
But they are available for you to customize.

137
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,660
Like some of my favorite editor fonts, my code editor fonts,

138
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,020
and my favorite UI fonts.

139
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,100
They're all there.

140
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,660
It's such a great experience.

141
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,620
And I'll tell you.

142
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,660
You put it to me earlier, like that you avoided

143
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,580
like a whole day of tinkering just because.

144
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,060
Mangero just had such a great out-of-box.

145
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,100
It's really nice when you see a good preset of Plasma.

146
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,780
When you install just the Plasma meta package

147
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,020
on a distribution like, say, Fedora,

148
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,680
you get all of the bits and pieces,

149
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,820
but maybe not all of the right default applications are set.

150
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,940
And the UI is certainly atrocious.

151
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,420
And it's just a very different experience.

152
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,420
It's not living up to the potential of Plasma.

153
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,940
And then you see something like mangero, and it's remarkable.

154
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,620
And I'll tell you, what got me kicked off

155
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,420
on this whole Plasma thread, other than I

156
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,300
thought it was probably time I just gave it a fair check

157
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,580
again, I don't know if you recall,

158
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,260
but years ago on this show, I challenged

159
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,260
you to get Linux working on a MacBook Pro.

160
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,180
How could I ever forget?

161
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,700
It was like a late 2013 MacBook Pro.

162
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,780
It's one of these MacBooks.

163
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,020
It's got a retina screen.

164
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,420
It's got an i7 processor.

165
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,020
It's got like a 512 gigabyte SSD.

166
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,180
It's from the Narrowwind MacBook Pro, so nice.

167
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,460
It's got ports, right?

168
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,300
It's got all these things, and it's still a very nice machine.

169
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,300
And mine happened to get a replacement battery

170
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,100
a couple of years ago.

171
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,620
It says the battery, when I ran a test, is at 94% capacity.

172
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,740
Not bad for a 2013.

173
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,660
However, it's not the greatest machine around,

174
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,220
and Linux on a MacBook had some limitations.

175
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,120
I mean, it's never the best experience you're going to get.

176
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,740
And so it just really didn't get used much.

177
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,580
It got put on a shelf, and about a year went by.

178
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,540
And then we had our team sprint, and we cleaned out everything

179
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,620
in the studio, and it got set out in the living room.

180
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,580
But a mixer got set on top of it,

181
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,180
and some cables got set on top of a small mixer,

182
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,820
and it just got buried.

183
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,540
I was going through the stuff Friday,

184
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,420
and I see this old MacBook, and I'm like,

185
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,140
is this the MacBook that's got Linux on it?

186
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,020
And I pull it out.

187
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,820
Literally, I have to dust it off, right?

188
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,060
It's that dirty.

189
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,460
I open it up, and it's dead, dead.

190
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,780
So I plug it in, it boots for a second, and then dead.

191
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,180
OK, I got to let this one sit for a while, which I knew.

192
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,020
It's just I didn't.

193
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,740
I don't care.

194
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
So I plug it in, I let it sit for a couple of hours,

195
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,580
open it back up, turn it on, and Arch boots up.

196
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,020
Now, this Arch install, it says it's from 2016.

197
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,220
Does that sound right to you?

198
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,260
Is that possible?

199
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,420
Yeah, maybe.

200
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,300
2016?

201
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,900
It feels like it was just a year ago I challenged you to that.

202
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,060
Oh, my god.

203
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,460
So anyways, I mean, the install says 2016.

204
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,500
But it had been updated several times since then,

205
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,860
so it had a rocking kernel 4.16.

206
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,780
The current kernels we record this as 5.3.11.

207
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,740
So it hadn't been updated since before the merger with Linux

208
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,220
Academy.

209
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,180
It had been a long time.

210
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,540
I was opening up a time capsule.

211
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,220
That's wild.

212
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,340
It was really weird.

213
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,260
So I didn't have any of my credentials logged

214
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,620
into any of my Linux Academy accounts.

215
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,940
I'm like, how am I going to work on this thing?

216
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,260
And so I think to myself, is there any way

217
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,420
this thing will upgrade?

218
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,940
You mean you didn't reinstall it?

219
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,020
I thought, no way, right?

220
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,900
Because it's literally every single package

221
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,540
has to be upgraded.

222
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,780
And I thought, if I can run this upgrade,

223
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,580
and it takes this install from over a year, maybe two years

224
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,180
ago.

225
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,220
Three years ago?

226
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,740
Well, yeah.

227
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,140
But I mean, the last update was probably two years ago.

228
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,780
Maybe a year and a half.

229
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,220
If it can successfully do that on a fricking MacBook,

230
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,140
I will install Arch on my workstation.

231
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,460
Because that's the ultimate benchmark.

232
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,620
That's quite literally your forever install right there.

233
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,620
You're done.

234
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,620
So I ran it.

235
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,160
I had to answer a bunch of questions

236
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,980
about replacing packages and resolve some conflicts.

237
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,180
But once it got up and going.

238
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,780
Scrolling back through the Arch Linux main site for a while.

239
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,980
Yeah, and even just going through my history,

240
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,440
like, how did I solve this before?

241
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,860
That kind of going through your Bash history.

242
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,340
It took all day.

243
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,960
But at the end of it, I rebooted that sucker.

244
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,980
And it rebooted and logged in without a single error message

245
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,060
to the latest plasma kernel 5.3.11,

246
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,980
the latest graphics drivers.

247
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,760
No big deal.

248
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,740
Everything.

249
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,260
Wow, dude.

250
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,380
Everything was done.

251
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,820
Not a single error message.

252
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,620
Like, no plasma pop-up that says this can't load or anything.

253
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,020
And I've been using it since, well, Friday evening,

254
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,260
Saturday morning, as my work machine.

255
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,660
And so I was like, well, all right,

256
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,220
I'm going to put managerial plasma edition

257
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,780
on my workstation here at the studio.

258
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,420
And I did that.

259
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,500
And just a reminder, there's so many great choices out there.

260
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,380
And as part of this process, I've

261
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,820
made a pledge to sort of document,

262
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,780
like, if I hit any rough edges or bugs,

263
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,980
I'm going to take the time now.

264
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,600
Because I've gotten so fast now at setting up these desktops,

265
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,860
I'm saving days of time that I used to spend.

266
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,180
So I'm going to take some of that time

267
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,860
to actually sit down.

268
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,860
If I hit bugs, I'm going to go file a bug report.

269
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,620
So I'm going to kind of do that part

270
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,140
and try to get more out of this process than I normally do.

271
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,060
But it has served as a good reminder

272
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,260
that we have some really, really great options.

273
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,980
And the KDE folks are really on to something.

274
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,460
I don't know if it'll be my daily driver forever,

275
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,820
but I really enjoy it.

276
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,540
And so if you think you could help that project,

277
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,420
we'll have a link to the show notes on how to apply.

278
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,340
I'd love to see them take it to the next level.

279
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,020
Absolutely.

280
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,700
So fun.

281
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,180
So speaking of great desktop environments, Gnome Shell,

282
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,700
or Gnome Shell, they're starting something

283
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,300
that I think is a brilliant public PR strategy.

284
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,420
And a lot of projects should consider this.

285
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,980
It's really kind of explaining their thought process

286
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,980
on why they do what they do, what decisions they've made,

287
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,900
and where they're going.

288
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,220
They've launched a new blog, the development blog

289
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,780
for specifically Gnome Shell and Mudder.

290
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,340
They've just launched it.

291
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,820
But they say on here, for a long time,

292
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,540
the development of Mudder and Gnome Shell

293
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,020
was surrounded by silence.

294
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,060
This blog is a humble attempt to bring

295
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,300
those two critical components of the Gnome Desktop

296
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,460
to the spotlight, even if only a tiny bit more.

297
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,700
They do go on to note that it would

298
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,500
be naive to say that posts will be published

299
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,820
in a consistent frequency.

300
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,060
But the initial goal is monthly development reports

301
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,980
and eventual one-shot deep dives into various bits and pieces

302
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,300
of both components, which I'm really looking forward to.

303
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,900
Yeah.

304
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,660
I love learning the thought processes behind the decisions

305
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,420
developers make.

306
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,060
And it often, I think, leads to a much more informed

307
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,020
conversation around those changes, where

308
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,980
a lot of times when the project announces a change,

309
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,820
it's met with strong reaction.

310
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,340
Right.

311
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,980
I mean, it may be something that developers

312
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,060
have been thinking about for a long time,

313
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,600
but the community has no way to know.

314
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,660
And now there's a blog to check out.

315
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,140
Yep.

316
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,720
So we will link to that in the show notes.

317
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,300
But more importantly than that, we're

318
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,020
not keeping an eye on this.

319
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,900
So I'll watch this for future developments.

320
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,020
And if they have something really interesting,

321
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,500
I'll try to do a breakdown here on the show.

322
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,820
And then, of course, like we always do, source link it

323
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,060
so you can find out more.

324
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,340
That's how we do it.

325
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,540
Links for this episode, linuxunplugged.com

326
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,060
slash 328 for everything we're about to talk about.

327
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,300
I think it's time to talk about cheesy going to Denver.

328
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,900
So Mr. Cheese Bacon, you were our representative

329
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,340
at the System76 Superfan event, an event

330
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,980
I've attended in the past.

331
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,860
And it's always a unique insight into a company

332
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,500
that we talk a lot about in this space.

333
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,280
They play a bigger and bigger role as their market grows.

334
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,060
And so I'm really curious to hear some of your takeaways

335
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,020
from the big Superfan event.

336
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,220
Yeah, so the event was wonderful.

337
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,020
And before I really get into any of that,

338
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,100
I just wanted to give a couple of shout-outs to Carl, Emma,

339
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,660
Mariah, Josh, Thomas, Aaron, Ian, Nate, Jeremy, Kate.

340
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,540
I'm sure there's another 20 or 30 or so that I'm forgetting.

341
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,780
But everyone there is so awesome.

342
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,160
And it's so cool to be surrounded

343
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,700
by people that are so passionate about what they're doing.

344
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,100
And every single person there has that passion.

345
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,180
So it's just great getting to meet everybody, for one.

346
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,860
But yeah, I mean, there were some great takeaways, really

347
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,460
three big ones.

348
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,380
I was lucky enough, obviously, to be

349
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,860
able to go and represent Jupiter Broadcasting and Linux Academy.

350
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,900
And they ended up giving us all a Thaleo, which was phenomenal.

351
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,860
You're kidding me.

352
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,020
Totally unexpected.

353
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,060
Absolutely unexpected.

354
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,780
You're talking about a computer, right?

355
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,940
I'm talking about the computer, yeah.

356
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,520
Wow, that's incredible.

357
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,020
It's great.

358
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,260
And AMD donated all the chips.

359
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,980
And Samsung donated all the NVME drives.

360
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,660
And this is their revised version

361
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,420
of the case, which is one of the takeaways.

362
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,060
So there was a little humbub about the Thaleo

363
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,700
having this resonant noise with the fans and stuff like that.

364
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,100
So what they've done is, on the bottom of the case

365
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,060
now, they've stretched the bottom of the case a little bit

366
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,820
and included this flange that goes up

367
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,980
along the side of the chassis itself, which

368
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,620
reduces the decimal level.

369
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,580
And under load, it's supposed to only be 33 decimals now.

370
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,280
And to kind of put that into perspective,

371
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,700
a whisper is about 30 decimals.

372
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,780
So it should be considerably quiet.

373
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,220
They've also adjusted the fan curves.

374
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,860
And they're doing that with the IO board, which is pretty neat.

375
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,980
So they're able to push different fan curves to that.

376
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,720
And one of the things they told me was, whenever you get it,

377
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,540
you need to update it so that you get that new fan

378
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,700
curve in there.

379
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,780
I think I'm not going to update it at first,

380
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,060
just to see what it's like.

381
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,860
And then update it to see if there's

382
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,020
an audible difference there.

383
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,820
That's a pretty remarkable thing.

384
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,340
They custom laser engraved them, too.

385
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,900
But that wasn't the only surprising announcement.

386
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,620
Sounds like they have some huge plans for GNOME Shell.

387
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,620
Yeah, so moving on, they have PopShell,

388
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,780
is what they're calling it.

389
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,980
It isn't yet on their GitHub.

390
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,060
But it's supposed to be released with 2004.

391
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,560
And essentially, what it is is it's a GNOME extension

392
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,020
to create a tiling window manager experience in GNOME.

393
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,540
i3-like experience?

394
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Very much i3-like.

395
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,500
And while they wouldn't let us necessarily film that or take

396
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,860
pictures of that, we did get kind of a sneak peek.

397
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,460
And it's super-duper slick.

398
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,020
Really?

399
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,460
Something you'd be interested in trying?

400
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,260
Absolutely.

401
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,780
They're calling it PopShell, though.

402
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,300
Mm-hmm.

403
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,020
Yep, PopShell.

404
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Oh, man.

405
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,620
That's a bold move.

406
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,660
Wow.

407
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,580
You had me at Tiling.

408
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,260
I don't know.

409
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,380
Yeah, if you're used to working without necessarily having

410
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,000
to move your mouse around and stuff,

411
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,300
and you're used to i3, I think it's

412
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,180
going to be just one of those things that's

413
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,660
going to be a natural extension for everyone

414
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,780
to pick up and start using.

415
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,260
Or if you just want to get into kind of a tiling window manager

416
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,560
experience, I think that'll be a great place to start.

417
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,060
Sure.

418
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,140
And on the heels of that, so within the next couple

419
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,340
of years, one of the other things they revealed

420
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,540
is that they're going to start making their own laptops.

421
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,260
So they had a big roundtable of what everyone would kind of

422
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,540
like to see in a laptop.

423
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,840
And of course, by the time it got round-tabled

424
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,460
by all of these Linux nerds, the laptop

425
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,540
would have cost about $8,000 to make.

426
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,300
But it sounds like my kind of machine.

427
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,480
Yeah, but I mean, it was everything, right?

428
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,860
They really wanted to know what users want

429
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,700
and what the fans would like to see in a laptop.

430
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,540
And whenever I say they're going to make a laptop,

431
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,340
yes, they already do make laptops,

432
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,580
but they're actually going to use their new laser

433
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,260
cutter, which you can add additional tooling to.

434
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,740
So they will really be making their own chassis

435
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,300
and putting this inside of there.

436
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,500
There's even hints of maybe including a little touch

437
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,220
of wood accents like they do with the Thaleo.

438
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh, that'd be sweet.

439
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,580
Yes, so they're really thinking about all of that.

440
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,100
And I think with the Nome, with the Popshell,

441
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,020
paired with a new laptop really makes sense for them.

442
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,940
And I think it's the next logical step for them.

443
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,860
Their new laser machine is called the, I love it,

444
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,780
it's called the TruMatic 1000.

445
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,800
So I'm really looking forward to what

446
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,420
they have coming down the pipe.

447
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,580
If there's one company that could do amazing things

448
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,300
with the laser cutter, it's System76.

449
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,420
I've been a customer for 14 years,

450
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,020
and they don't sponsor us.

451
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,740
They haven't been a sponsor since last.

452
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,300
And I still recommend people go to System76

453
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
and check out what they have, because the culture

454
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,580
behind those products is one that it's going to endure.

455
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,820
I mean, they're users themselves.

456
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,420
They care a lot about what they make, and it really shows.

457
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,780
The thing I've noticed, and this, I think,

458
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,660
tells you something, over that 14 years

459
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,660
is I'm still talking to a lot of the same people

460
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,580
I was talking to back then.

461
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,540
People, they stick around, and they really

462
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,380
become part of that company.

463
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,420
And what I've been fascinated with,

464
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,660
and it really comes across in Brent's brunch with Emma,

465
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,540
that was just released, I think, this morning,

466
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,380
is how she has been able to build new roles

467
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,340
and grow while staying with that family and that company.

468
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,400
And that's also a really unique opportunity.

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,780
So you get a really great insight into their company

470
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,500
culture with that extra that just came out.

471
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,660
If you're fascinated at all, I really recommend it.

472
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,580
Extra.extras.show slash 33.

473
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,980
This company is an important part of the Linux ecosystem.

474
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,660
And Brent, your chat with Emma, I think,

475
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,860
really gave us a new level of insight

476
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,060
into what somebody, we talk about Emma,

477
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,300
who's been on the show a lot, does day to day.

478
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,020
Well done, sir.

479
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,780
Well, thank you.

480
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,180
Yeah, I mean, her and I had a great fun chat,

481
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,940
but there's also a lot of really cool transparency

482
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,860
about stuff I learned about System76,

483
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,740
all the stuff that happens behind the scene about making

484
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,020
people feel amazing about the work they do, which is great.

485
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,300
I mean, she's the happiness manager there.

486
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,220
I think she's onto a few life secrets, to tell you the truth.

487
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,620
She's got a few things figured out.

488
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,700
Yeah, there are some true gems in there, for sure.

489
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,940
I think the audience might recall,

490
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,240
if you've been listening to the show for a little bit,

491
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,400
that she had quite the medical situation

492
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,700
at the beginning of summer.

493
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,660
And that's why she had been absent for the show

494
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,740
for a long time.

495
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,620
And that's covered in there, too,

496
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
now that she's on the other side of that.

497
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,980
It's good to hear.

498
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,020
Extras.show slash 33.

499
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,580
Well, how about that?

500
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,340
Mr. Cheese breaking the bacon there with the news,

501
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,800
with the i3 tiling window manager and the laptop

502
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,380
prototypes.

503
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,780
Like, there you go.

504
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,020
It was smart of us to send our best person over there.

505
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,420
Yeah, Mr. Bacon will have to keep us

506
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,220
apprised on all future Denver things that develop

507
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,980
as our correspondent over there.

508
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,100
And maybe some follow up about how that Thaleo

509
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,940
ends up performing.

510
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,660
Oh, yeah, that would be good.

511
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,500
Yeah, well, yeah, good thinking, Wes.

512
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,140
You know what?

513
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,060
You know what else is a good idea?

514
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,460
A little housekeeping.

515
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,140
You got to do it.

516
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,020
You got to do it every now and then.

517
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,700
Keep things clean.

518
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,020
We got a new Showtime we want to let you know about.

519
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,420
You probably already knew, but it's worth mentioning again.

520
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,220
Repetition is the key to success.

521
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,020
We're now doing it noon Pacific time.

522
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,700
You can get that converted to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

523
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,500
It's not a calendar.

524
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
jbliv.tv is where you watch it.

525
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,580
irc.geekshed.net pound hashtag Jupiter Broadcasting.

526
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,300
Yeah, join us live.

527
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,980
It's a whole other level of experience.

528
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,740
It's a lot of fun.

529
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,860
I mean, there's probably a show on each end of this

530
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,780
that doesn't make it out on the recording.

531
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,980
I also thought I would tease a little something something.

532
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,340
Coming up soon in the actress' week,

533
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,380
we were just mentioning the interview with Emma.

534
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,060
Right.

535
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,020
Brunch with Emma.

536
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,260
Brunch with Emma.

537
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,540
Cheese and Popey sat down and talked about ThinkPads.

538
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,900
We've all been waiting for this.

539
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,220
If you want to hear Popey in his truly happy place,

540
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,460
it's when he's talking about ThinkPads.

541
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,660
I'm really nervous, because I just

542
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,560
pulled the trigger on a gift for a family member,

543
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,100
and it's a used ThinkPad.

544
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,900
And I want to make sure I got the right one.

545
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,420
So I will be listening carefully to that extras,

546
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,620
in case I got to return it.

547
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,540
So that'll be at extras.show.

548
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,420
That's coming up probably later this week.

549
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,980
I say probably like we don't already know.

550
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,580
Stay tuned.

551
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,420
You got to wait, expectantly.

552
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,860
I'm just like, if I say it, then it really has to happen.

553
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,700
So I'm like, probably, even though we already

554
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,060
have it scheduled to launch.

555
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,780
That's how I play it sometimes.

556
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,980
So extras.show for that.

557
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,740
And I'm really, really looking forward to the ThinkPad thing.

558
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,500
And that brunch was fantastic.

559
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,940
You got to go get that.

560
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,020
All of it's available probably by about now,

561
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,940
as you're listening to this.

562
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,600
And that's the housekeeping this week, because it's not much.

563
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,260
We got to talk about Pinebooks and Pine phones.

564
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,660
On this trip to the System76 superfan event,

565
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,260
Mr. Bacon took only one machine with him,

566
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,020
and it was his Pinebook Pro.

567
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,260
How's that been living with?

568
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,300
I mean, honestly, a pretty nice machine.

569
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,540
But let's be honest, you got nicer computers

570
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,820
you could take with you, cheese.

571
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,220
You got nicer machines.

572
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,260
Yeah, I mean, I definitely have more powerful machines,

573
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,780
and machines that might be considered nicer, per se.

574
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,060
But the Pinebook really is a solid device.

575
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,300
Yeah, maybe nicer is not a fair way to say it, is it?

576
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,700
It's almost maybe powerful.

577
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,620
But design-wise, feel-wise, is it pretty nice?

578
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,140
It is.

579
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,780
It's a really solid little machine.

580
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,180
I think a lot of people could get behind it.

581
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,460
The Chromium OS build that I was using for just YouTubing

582
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,980
and the likes worked out great.

583
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,260
I was able to actually bring the device to System76

584
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,340
and put it in front of Carl and Jeremy and Emma

585
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,460
and let them kind of nerd out on it a little bit.

586
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,820
And they all appreciated it and where it's going.

587
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,300
So it was really cool to kind of cross

588
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,540
bounds between one hardware software vendor

589
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,140
with another hardware software vendor

590
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,940
and put these pieces in front of these other people.

591
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,620
So I've had pretty good success with it so far.

592
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,500
I haven't had really any major issues with my sole device.

593
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,820
So it's about, what, two pounds?

594
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,140
That makes it pretty nice for travel.

595
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,180
Yeah, super lightweight.

596
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,980
How'd the old battery do on the flight watching

597
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
the videos and stuff?

598
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,940
Oh, it did great, man.

599
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,980
It really did wonderful.

600
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,820
Averaging six to eight hours of battery life.

601
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,940
I only charged it up once while I was there.

602
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
And that was with everybody else tinkering with it

603
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,300
and playing with it and the commute on the flight

604
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,780
and all that sort of stuff as well.

605
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,060
And it felt pretty solid in the bag,

606
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,860
like it wasn't going to get bent or dinged up or anything?

607
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,980
No, absolutely not.

608
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,620
Absolutely not.

609
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,140
All right.

610
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,940
And no fan while you're watching the videos?

611
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,180
No.

612
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,700
So it's passively cooled so you don't

613
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,300
have to worry about any fan noise or anything like that.

614
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,180
I will say you probably want to use some headphones

615
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,820
because the speakers are down firing

616
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,140
and they're just not that great.

617
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,900
It's rare to find a laptop that that's not true for, really.

618
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,740
Hey, Cheese, how's the monitor on that thing?

619
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,660
I know you and I were talking about it.

620
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,700
It's really great, man.

621
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,020
It's a 1080p IPS display.

622
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,540
Viewing angles are solid.

623
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,260
4K video playback, 60 frames a second.

624
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,780
I think you can even bump.

625
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,740
The screen is even rated at 120 hertz.

626
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,900
So you can bump it to 120 hertz.

627
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,900
I mean, it works great.

628
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,700
It's a pretty reasonable price as well, right?

629
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,940
Yeah, $200.

630
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,740
You could make it a Chromebook if you want

631
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,100
using builds that are available.

632
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,340
Or you could run, for example, we'll

633
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,220
have a link in the show notes, Manjaro just

634
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,660
released a third preview of their Pinebook Pro Spin, which

635
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,940
you can use Plasma or XFCE.

636
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,820
And I've been working with Fred from the Manjaro team that's

637
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,540
been helping with these builds.

638
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,700
And I've been testing it out since the first preview.

639
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,860
And each iteration, it just gets better and better and better.

640
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,900
So it's definitely a distribution

641
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,660
I think a lot of people would gravitate to just because

642
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,540
of the Arch64 support.

643
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,020
Well, and they have a great Plasma experience.

644
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,500
I can testify to that.

645
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,540
But that's sort of what appeals to me about the Pinebook.

646
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,660
$200, great travel machine.

647
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
It could be as simple as a Chromebook or as advanced

648
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
as a Manjaro workstation.

649
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,140
So the question is, where is this at as a project?

650
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,900
Where are they at in the pipeline?

651
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,620
Well, Joe and Cheese had an opportunity

652
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,740
to sit down with Lucas, the community manager

653
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,260
over at Pine64, and talk about that and many other things.

654
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,940
So hey, Lucas.

655
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,780
How's it going, man?

656
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,260
Good.

657
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,180
Hey, what's up?

658
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,100
Oh, not much.

659
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,540
Glad to have you on here.

660
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,300
So Lucas, I know that you guys have been

661
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,660
shipping a ton of Pinebooks.

662
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,380
I believe I was in the second batch.

663
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,860
But what exactly is going on with the batch numbers?

664
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,740
And where are we at right now in the process of shipping

665
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,340
that hardware out to people?

666
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,900
So we're currently on the third batch.

667
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,820
It also happens to be the first batch which

668
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,740
ships with a choice of both ISO and ANSI keyboards.

669
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:35,060
So that's for our UK and US end users.

670
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:40,580
And starting from early next year, we're going to take a break.

671
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,900
There's the Chinese year coming up.

672
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,060
And then next batches will follow in March of 2020.

673
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,660
And that's the ones that are being ordered at the moment?

674
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,500
Those which are being ordered right now

675
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,100
should be shipping in December and January.

676
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
All right, cool.

677
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
One thing that I was curious about,

678
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,220
I know that there's been a few hardware issues reported,

679
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,340
namely the trackpad, and that you guys are currently

680
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,820
working on some firmware patches for that.

681
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,460
Can we expect when that'll be fixed?

682
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,180
And are there any other hardware-related issues

683
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,740
that you've seen now that these are

684
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,340
landing in the hands of people?

685
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,820
So in terms of the trackpad, we have

686
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,460
been now aware for a couple of weeks

687
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,820
that there is an issue with it.

688
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,380
So there are two sort of separate aspects

689
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,420
to the trackpad problem.

690
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:31,140
One is more of a luxury problem, which

691
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,940
is that it's not very precise at this point in time.

692
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,940
But then there is a more serious problem

693
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,140
that it cuts out the functioning of the keyboard.

694
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,340
Now, we already have solved the core problem,

695
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,220
which is that it cuts out people when they're typing.

696
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,100
So when your palm touches the trackpad,

697
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,180
as you type on the laptop, it basically

698
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,820
cuts out the keyboard, preventing you from typing.

699
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,900
So we have that done, but we still

700
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,620
are working at improving precision of the trackpad

701
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,900
because this is something we know people also want.

702
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,900
Now, because you are effectively flashing an SPI chip that

703
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,380
is on the keyboard itself, we don't want people

704
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,060
to do this too many times.

705
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,060
So now that we have the fix, we're

706
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,620
going to work for a little bit longer,

707
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,620
for a couple of days, maybe a week or so,

708
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,980
to improve the precision of the trackpad.

709
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,820
And then we're going to think of a way

710
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,140
so that it could be bundled in some simple way

711
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,580
across different distributions and pushed to end users.

712
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,980
So I'll vaguely say it should be out there within 10 days.

713
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,740
But this isn't an actual hardware problem.

714
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,220
It's just a software problem, right?

715
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,420
It's specifically a firmware problem.

716
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,940
Right, so it can be fixed.

717
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,780
Oh, absolutely.

718
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,700
And we have, as we promised, the flashing utility

719
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,620
has been open sourced under MIT license.

720
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,380
It's already available, compiled,

721
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,620
and we know that it's working.

722
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,500
So it's just a question of getting the firmware right.

723
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,700
And I'm very confident we'll be able to get

724
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,300
the correct firmware working at its optimal

725
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,780
within a couple of days.

726
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,260
So moving on from the Pine Book itself,

727
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,500
I know a lot of our listeners are extremely

728
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,140
excited about the Pine phone.

729
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,260
And I know that dev kits have been going out,

730
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,060
and you guys are starting to ramp up production for that.

731
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,760
Who currently has one of these development devices?

732
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,580
And when can the rest of us expect to get one?

733
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,020
So currently, there are a handful of developers

734
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,420
from the core projects.

735
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,380
That would be Ubuntu Touch, from Post Market OS,

736
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,700
Sailfish, who have the actual finished phone prototypes.

737
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,380
More developers will be getting their phones within a week

738
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,300
or so from now.

739
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,580
We expect to have them all shipped

740
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,380
by the 20th of November.

741
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,100
But development has been going on.

742
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:04,340
We have had development kits out for about half a year now.

743
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,660
So development has been ongoing.

744
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,180
There have been some changes from the dev kits

745
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,460
to these dev phones, and therefore, we

746
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,740
need to provide developers with hardware which

747
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,300
reflects these changes so they can adjust the software.

748
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,540
As for when end users can get their hands on it,

749
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,580
in general, in March of 2020.

750
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,940
But if you are one of those people who enjoys beta testing

751
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,780
and giving feedback to developers,

752
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:42,980
want to be a part of the process, then on November 15,

753
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,980
the Braveheart Edition, as we call it,

754
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,340
so this is an early adopter edition,

755
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,140
is opening with a limited amount of phones.

756
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,460
I don't know exactly how many, but about 4,000 phones.

757
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,780
And we expect those phones to ship by end of January 2020.

758
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,700
So that was the end of last week as people

759
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,820
are listening to this.

760
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,820
So it's already available to order,

761
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,100
except that it might be sold out if you've only

762
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,020
got a limited number of them available then.

763
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,460
I expect that it probably is sold out now in the future.

764
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,460
Yeah, in the future of when this goes out.

765
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,460
So what's the default OS going to be on these phones,

766
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,420
and what kind of state is it going to be in?

767
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,660
Are you asking specifically about the Braveheart Edition

768
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,140
then?

769
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,660
Yeah.

770
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,300
There won't be an OS default on these phones.

771
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,020
I mean, we expect that those people who

772
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,740
will be getting these phones are, first of all,

773
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,020
capable enough to interact with the developers,

774
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,860
find the builds, and flash them themselves.

775
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,980
So as I said, this is for enthusiasts

776
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,700
who know that they want this phone months

777
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,020
ahead of everyone else.

778
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,540
And there is no such thing as a finished OS

779
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
at this point in time.

780
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,500
They're all lacking something.

781
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,900
So I think that currently, perhaps the most polished

782
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,820
operating system that I've seen is probably

783
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,780
either post-market OS with the KDE Plasma Mobile

784
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,140
or Ubuntu Touch.

785
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,700
But they are not daily driver ready by any means then?

786
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,660
As of today, I probably wouldn't advise anyone

787
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,940
to use them as daily drivers now.

788
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,100
But they're not far off, to be fair.

789
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,900
Their performance is very good already.

790
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,180
And most of the key functionality is there.

791
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,100
I think that as of today, the one thing that is not

792
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,180
functional is the front facing camera.

793
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,100
Now, core functionality will differ from one distribution

794
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,380
to another.

795
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,580
But there are at least two distributions

796
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,420
which have the modem working.

797
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,500
And I think that voice calls have

798
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,540
been activated at least in one, specifically in Ubuntu Touch.

799
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:02,260
So in March, when these ship out to the rest of the world,

800
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,700
what default OS?

801
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,180
Are you just going to wait to see how they all

802
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,060
start to flush out and what's ready to be a daily driver?

803
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,180
This is one possibility.

804
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,420
We said some time ago that what we want to do

805
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,340
is run these OS-specific campaigns where

806
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,820
we would customize the phones ever so slightly,

807
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,500
maybe use the partner project's caller or something

808
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,580
to this effect, and ship the phone with that OS on it.

809
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,660
So if we were to ship post-market OS,

810
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,300
it would have a green back cover.

811
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,500
If it would be Ubuntu Touch, it would

812
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,980
be coming with an orange back cover

813
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,500
and Ubuntu Touch pre-installed.

814
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,660
And then a portion of the money from those shipments

815
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,500
would be going to these developers.

816
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,740
So we're exploring, if it will be possible,

817
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,180
we hope to ship with one of these bigger

818
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,340
OSes from partner projects.

819
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,540
But by and large, it's up in the air.

820
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,340
We'll see how it all shapes up at this point in time.

821
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:15,540
You went into this phone project presumably with your eyes

822
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,180
open, knowing how difficult it was going to be.

823
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,220
But has it proven even more difficult

824
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,980
than you thought then?

825
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,140
That's a good question.

826
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,860
I think the answer is both yes and no.

827
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,820
I always thought that software is

828
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,460
going to be, in effect, harder because people, regardless

829
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,220
of the price tag on this thing, people

830
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,460
will want to have relatively good performance.

831
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,500
But developers have really stepped up the game,

832
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:47,660
and things run as well as they'll ever run on this hardware.

833
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,540
It's really good.

834
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,180
I don't want to say that it rivals a modern day Android

835
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,220
phone, but it's absolutely smooth enough for testing

836
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,940
and trying out Linux on a phone.

837
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:07,260
And I can conceivably see people using this on a daily basis

838
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,780
now.

839
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,380
This is how good these distributions have gotten.

840
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,580
Now, we knew that hardware is going to be difficult.

841
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,980
But if you haven't made a phone, you just

842
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,460
don't realize the complexity of it,

843
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,900
even if you're told how complex it will be.

844
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,580
It's extremely difficult.

845
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,180
I'm just really happy that we didn't go in a route where

846
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,140
we would make some really complex and difficult phone,

847
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:38,220
which would definitely prove to be an unimaginable challenge.

848
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,140
How free is this phone going to be in terms of drivers

849
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,100
and binary blobs and stuff like that?

850
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,900
How open source is it going to be?

851
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,620
So everything on the root file system is completely free.

852
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,820
This includes the graphics driver.

853
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,620
So that's running Lima.

854
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,980
On the phone itself, the modem is running proprietary firmware.

855
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,260
There is some code in the out-of-focus

856
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,580
of the rear-facing camera that is also proprietary.

857
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,540
The firmware for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, not the drivers,

858
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,180
but the firmware is proprietary.

859
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,100
And it is my understanding that a part of the boot ROM

860
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,940
firmware, which lives actually on the SOC,

861
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,500
is locked down as well.

862
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,700
And that's the extent of it.

863
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,980
So some of this can conceivably in the future

864
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,540
be freed, such as the camera.

865
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,740
And if somebody decides to take a crack at the Bluetooth

866
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,820
and Wi-Fi module, then presumably it's possible.

867
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,340
In respect to the modem, we know that it is running Linux.

868
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,540
But it's locked down.

869
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:55,180
And this portion of the first stage bootloader,

870
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,980
it's a part of the SOC.

871
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,100
It can be freed.

872
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,900
Well, that's just pretty much how it goes with any sort

873
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,060
of mobile hardware, right?

874
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,380
You can't expect it to be completely free.

875
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,300
No, absolutely.

876
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,780
And if there would be alternatives

877
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,580
that we could choose that would be easier to free or otherwise,

878
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,780
then we would obviously have gone that route.

879
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,180
But this is the reality of things.

880
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,620
This is our first sort of step in understanding

881
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,540
how phones are made.

882
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
And this is a very ambitious project.

883
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,460
So in the future, there's also room

884
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,260
for us to try out different things and different modules

885
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:44,460
and alter the existing PinePhone maybe a year or two

886
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,500
down the line.

887
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,860
Well, thank you very much for coming on the show, Lucas.

888
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:52,660
And you'll have to come in and update us as things progress.

889
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,180
If people want to find out more about what you're up to,

890
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,460
where's the best place?

891
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,700
So we do run a monthly blog on pine64.org.

892
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:08,380
And we also have a Twitter and Masternode account

893
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,500
at the pine64.

894
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,940
So you can find out what we're up to on there.

895
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,420
Great.

896
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,140
Well, we'll put some links in the show notes.

897
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,380
Thanks a lot for joining us.

898
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,700
Thank you so much.

899
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,420
You can tell it's an ambitious project.

900
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,980
But they're matching that ambition

901
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,500
with a genuine level of transparency.

902
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,580
You really know what you're going to get, right?

903
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,860
At the start of the show, we talked a little bit

904
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,180
about the PinePhone.

905
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,300
And they're very clear even there that, hey,

906
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,140
this is an early issue of the device.

907
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,860
And that's true for all their devices.

908
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,180
So you're not going to have bad expectations.

909
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,180
So Cheesy, you've talked a lot about the pros of the PineBook

910
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,500
Pro.

911
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,580
Is there some cons to using this device?

912
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,940
There must be some drawbacks.

913
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,180
There must have been a moment you were missing your main rig.

914
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,500
Yeah, I mean, there are a few drawbacks, right?

915
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,100
Like, no piece of hardware is perfect.

916
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,460
Or I've not found a piece of hardware that's flawless.

917
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,740
So like we mentioned in the interview,

918
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,340
the trackpad does have some issues with palm rejection,

919
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,460
which can be extremely frustrating when you're

920
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,140
using it.

921
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,540
So what I've found is that I turn it off

922
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,180
with the hardware key.

923
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,460
And then once turned off, I just use a USB mouse.

924
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,060
And it works great that way.

925
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,100
They are working on some firmware patches for that.

926
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,380
In fact, they already have a patch that's out.

927
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,600
And it's currently being worked on.

928
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,660
So your mileage may vary.

929
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,260
They've been working on it really hard.

930
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,760
I think there's a team of eight people

931
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,700
working on getting it patched.

932
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:44,220
And that will be essentially a SPI flash to the keyboard.

933
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,940
And you'll have to reboot the machine.

934
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,440
And then once you reboot the machine,

935
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,180
the trackpad should be operable, and everything

936
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,940
should be better.

937
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,700
That's nice.

938
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,620
So I've yet to try it.

939
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,980
But after the show today, I'm sure I'll jump in there

940
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,220
and chat with Lucas and give it a go myself.

941
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,420
It ships with Debian 9.

942
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,580
So you've got an older kernel.

943
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,100
You've got the 4.4 kernel.

944
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,180
And along with that, you've got Debian, which I love Debian.

945
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,140
In our previous episode, I talked

946
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,880
about how much I love Debian and all of its variations

947
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,140
and spins and everything.

948
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:21,140
But you don't really have a huge repository of software,

949
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,900
especially compiled for the Arch 64 ARM platform.

950
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,300
Or I suppose another way to put that

951
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,900
is you don't have a huge selection of desktop software

952
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,740
that you need.

953
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,580
Right.

954
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,820
Because it probably has plenty of server side packages,

955
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,820
very large repos.

956
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,320
Absolutely.

957
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,900
But let's say you want Telegram or Quossel

958
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,100
or something like that.

959
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,980
You're probably not going to find it there.

960
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,860
I do want those things.

961
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,360
Exactly.

962
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:44,860
I do.

963
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,460
Exactly.

964
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,980
But one way to kind of extend that,

965
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,300
and you can extend that on the default Debian 9 build,

966
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,140
or there's some Ubuntu Mate builds and stuff like that

967
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,340
for it out already.

968
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,040
And to kind of get a little more extensibility

969
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,920
from the software, you can install SnapD.

970
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,960
So you can install Snap packages on the default Debian build

971
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,460
or the Ubuntu builds to kind of get you

972
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,780
over the hump with some of that stuff, say Telegram,

973
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,180
for example.

974
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,100
So you can extend it a few ways like that.

975
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,980
The Manjaro build that we've talked about

976
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,700
is one that's going to be, I think,

977
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,700
fantastic because you're pretty much going to find everything

978
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,380
you need there.

979
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,380
It's going to be bleeding edge.

980
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,100
I think a lot of people will gravitate toward Manjaro

981
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,700
once they get everything dialed in.

982
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,300
It's bright days for them there.

983
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,860
Absolutely.

984
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:37,260
Now, Cheese Wes and I have a Rock Pro 64

985
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,620
here in the room, which is essentially

986
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,260
what the Pine Book is built around, a slightly newer

987
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,260
version.

988
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,460
So I want to talk about this.

989
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,880
In Mumble Room, if anybody has any questions about the Pine

990
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,980
Book for Cheese, I'd like to give you a moment

991
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,820
to get your questions right.

992
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,300
Tag me in IRC.

993
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,020
Just mum tag me while I tell everyone

994
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,020
about Locka, which is our pick of the week, which I think

995
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,700
will turn that, if you've managed

996
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,540
to get yourself one of those Pine 64 boards like I have,

997
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,820
this one was $60, doesn't come with a dang power adapter.

998
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,320
I might note, just so you know, you'll

999
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,540
need to get a power adapter.

1000
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,620
And it's a barrel plug.

1001
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,780
But once you get it set up, load Locka on this thing.

1002
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,860
They've talked about it on Choose Linux before,

1003
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,420
but it's a lightweight Linux distro from top to bottom

1004
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,860
that turns your Pine 64 into a retro gaming console.

1005
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,180
Yeah, it's like running RetroArch,

1006
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,500
but they've got images for all kinds

1007
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,380
of different single board computers out there.

1008
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,900
So whether you've got basically any version of the Raspberry

1009
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,980
Pi, or you've got one of these Rock Pros like we do,

1010
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,940
you can get this up and running.

1011
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,460
MiniMech, you had a question about the Pine Book.

1012
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,260
Yeah, yeah, I do, in fact.

1013
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,820
What about GPU performance?

1014
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,540
So, cheese, as I understand, you had ChromeMOS on it running.

1015
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,540
Did you run any Linux distribution on it?

1016
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,780
And how was the GPU performance when it comes to composites

1017
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
and video and something?

1018
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,460
Yeah, so I mean, it ships with the default Debian 9 build.

1019
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,500
I was able to play back 4K 60 frames a second

1020
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,180
on that Debian 9 build on YouTube.

1021
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,860
It was a little stuttery whenever

1022
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,220
I was streaming through YouTube.

1023
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,460
But whenever I pulled down Big Buck Bunny

1024
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:23,780
and ran it in a few variations, the 1080p, 60, 30 frames,

1025
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,860
and then the 4K 60 and 30 frames,

1026
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,540
there was a little stuttering there.

1027
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
But it wasn't, I felt that it was just.

1028
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,340
The gold standard.

1029
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:30,900
Yeah, exactly.

1030
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,620
I mean, it's not a test.

1031
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,900
He just really likes that one.

1032
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,460
Yeah, it's my jam, dude.

1033
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,660
Oh my god, I've seen that video so many damn times.

1034
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,540
I know, me too, me too.

1035
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,020
I'll note, though, the fact that it can play 4K content

1036
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,140
may be a bit irrelevant since the screen is 1080p.

1037
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,340
So if it can successfully play 1080p content,

1038
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,820
you're good to go.

1039
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,100
Can I ask a dumb question?

1040
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Go ahead, go ahead.

1041
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,660
Does it charge over USB-C by chance,

1042
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,340
or is it a barrel connector?

1043
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,500
So it has a barrel connector and type C.

1044
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,580
You can charge over type C, and you

1045
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,700
can put display out through type C, which I've yet to try.

1046
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,700
I will say that using my, I think

1047
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,300
it's a 45-watt MacBook Pro charger, type C charger,

1048
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,420
doesn't work very well.

1049
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,060
It basically flickers back and forth.

1050
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:21,820
So I think it has to be 5 volts is the max.

1051
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,700
And don't quote me on that.

1052
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,460
That's how the Pine 64 board works is it's 5 volts.

1053
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,140
Right.

1054
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,500
But for an example, I have an anchor battery

1055
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,340
that I carry with me whenever I travel.

1056
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,420
And I was able to use that same type C cable

1057
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,940
that I was charging my phone with,

1058
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,460
plug it right into the Pinebook Pro

1059
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,300
while I was on the airplane.

1060
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,780
That's it.

1061
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,260
Just to get a little bit of juice.

1062
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,780
So I mean, I think it's like a 14-watt, 5 volts.

1063
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,460
So another one that worked was my Pixel 3a charger

1064
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,740
worked great with it.

1065
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,580
I note, too, that it has a 10,000 milliamp battery.

1066
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,120
So that gives the audience a little bit of perspective.

1067
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,100
One thing I'd like to know more about down the road

1068
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,300
is the PCIe 4x slot, which requires an adapter, they say.

1069
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,620
But you could use it to load an SSD in there

1070
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,420
or other things.

1071
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,100
That seems like it has some potential, too.

1072
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,620
Yeah.

1073
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,940
So they're working on the adapter.

1074
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,140
They had a little bit of an issue with it.

1075
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,140
And I think really what it came down to is the ribbon cable

1076
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,220
was a little too short.

1077
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,620
But you can buy an adapter, an NVMe PCIe adapter,

1078
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,260
for I think it's like $5 or something like that.

1079
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,060
And then you can hook up an NVMe drive to it.

1080
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,100
I know that some of the NVMe drives

1081
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,860
are a little different in their height, which

1082
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,900
can cause the trackpad to kind of shift and stuff.

1083
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,200
But I think, like I said, they're redesigning that adapter.

1084
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,700
And I believe that they're going to bring that profile down

1085
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,200
a little bit.

1086
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,700
So you shouldn't have any problems.

1087
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,380
Now, do note that if you do add an NVMe drive,

1088
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,940
depending on the drive, and you need

1089
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,100
to double check this if you're going to do this,

1090
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,540
depending on the drive, you could get a significant more

1091
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,180
power draw.

1092
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,340
So you could reduce your battery life.

1093
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,580
So there's kind of a trade-off there

1094
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,580
on what you're wanting to do with it.

1095
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,300
The age-old thing, performance versus battery life, GV.

1096
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:07,820
Exactly.

1097
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,900
Well, keep using it.

1098
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,860
Now, not only are you our Denver correspondent,

1099
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,220
but you're our Pinebook Pro correspondent now.

1100
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,260
Also, again, thank you to Lucas for taking time

1101
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,220
to join us on the show today.

1102
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,960
We'll have links to the Pinebook Pro in the show notes

1103
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,300
if you're interested.

1104
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,260
And I was researching up, just familiarizing myself again,

1105
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,180
with Pine64.

1106
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,460
I didn't realize one of their co-founders created the Popcorn

1107
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,820
Hour media player.

1108
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,460
Really?

1109
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,060
Which, for people that have been around for a very, very long

1110
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,060
time, I used to talk about quite a bit on last.

1111
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,060
It used to be like my go-to media solution

1112
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,980
before the days of Ambient Plex.

1113
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,420
And really, Cody, I was really impressed by that.

1114
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,660
That's a good lineage.

1115
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,020
Really love that device.

1116
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,900
Another device that they created,

1117
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,740
and I believe they're still selling,

1118
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,740
is the Rochambeau retro console, which is, I don't think,

1119
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,500
super huge here in the States, but it's

1120
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,980
pretty big over in Asia.

1121
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:04,820
Looks really cool.

1122
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,420
Yeah, that does look like a neat device.

1123
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,840
All right, well, let's wrap it up there.

1124
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,380
We have something in the post-show

1125
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,100
that I want to get to.

1126
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,060
I know that's a weird thing to say

1127
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,100
that I want to get to the post-show,

1128
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,500
but I got something special.

1129
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,780
Go get more Westpane along with Jim Salter

1130
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,060
over at TechSnap.Systems.

1131
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,780
Great episodes these days.

1132
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,460
You guys are hitting your stride, and it really shows.

1133
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,820
I was really enjoying Jim's thoughts on Microsoft, too,

1134
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,420
after going to Insight recently.

1135
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,460
So check out TechSnap.Systems for that.

1136
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,900
Also, Cheesy goes on a little bit more

1137
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,140
and gets nerdy about single-board computers

1138
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,860
on a recent episode of Choose Linux.

1139
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Oh, that's a great one.

1140
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,380
ChooseLinux.Show for that.

1141
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,140
And of course, the one, the only Brent with brunch

1142
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,940
over at extras.show.

1143
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,180
If you dig around, you go to the tag,

1144
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,500
you may just find an RSS feed, and you

1145
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,540
can get just the brunches, if you like.

1146
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,340
It may be possible.

1147
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,340
That's an exercise for the listener, though.

1148
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,660
I'm not saying it's possible, but I am just hashtag saying.

1149
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:02,660
You know what I'm saying?

1150
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,700
Oh, yeah.

1151
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,140
I'm at ChrisLAS.

1152
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,980
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1153
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,620
The show is at Linux Unplugged.

1154
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,260
And just one last reminder, we'd love

1155
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,500
to start incorporating some of your feedback and follow-up

1156
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,980
as the year wraps up, linuxunplugged.com

1157
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,180
slash contact, and that new time, noon Pacific.

1158
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,820
See you back here next Tuesday.

1159
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,820
Bye-bye.

1160
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:59,740
All right, we've got to go pick our titles.

1161
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,060
JBtitles.com, if you're watching the live stream,

1162
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,140
it is your duty.

1163
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,660
Before you go check, maybe just go

1164
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,660
throw four or 10 title suggestions in there.

1165
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,380
You know, just do your duty.

1166
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,180
Is the noon crowd?

1167
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,660
Well, I mean, we have 14.

1168
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:12,540
We've got 14 titles.

1169
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,300
They're new, Wes.

1170
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:13,780
I know.

1171
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,020
And we didn't really recap the whole titles, though.

1172
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,140
It's a complicated notion.

1173
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,100
So you still have time.

1174
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,220
Bang suggests a great title, and then we

1175
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,900
will go vote here in a moment.

1176
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,060
In the meantime, though, guess what, Wes?

1177
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:25,580
What?

1178
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,100
Little surprise for you.

1179
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,820
There was some extra discussion between Joe Cheese and Lucas

1180
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,980
about future products they're working on, like the time.

1181
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,260
Oh, the PineTime.

1182
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,620
And I thought maybe we'd include that here in the post-show.

1183
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,300
So you've teased a few other devices.

1184
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,860
Let's briefly touch on those.

1185
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,180
I'm aware of the watch and the tablet,

1186
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,640
and even possibly a router, as Americans would say.

1187
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,820
So what's going on with those three?

1188
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,140
So the development kit for the PineTime,

1189
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,660
so that's the smartwatch, have gone out.

1190
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,620
And there is an extraordinary amount

1191
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,220
of work happening within this sub-community.

1192
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,780
I'm absolutely blown away.

1193
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,300
I mean, I've already seen pictures

1194
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,620
of watch faces, and all sorts of different operating system

1195
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,380
pop up on Twitter.

1196
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,300
So there's clearly a lot of interest in this.

1197
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,540
And we have been contacted by both educators

1198
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,220
and people who just like to tinker

1199
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,700
with these low-powered arm devices.

1200
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,540
And we've recently reached the decision

1201
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,820
that this is just one of those things

1202
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,220
that we probably want to have in the store

1203
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,180
so that anybody who wants to have a go at it

1204
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,900
can have a go at it.

1205
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,220
So that's the PineTime.

1206
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,740
In respect to the PineTab, which is the tablet which

1207
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,080
we're doing, it is taking a bit of a backseat right now.

1208
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,380
Getting the PineBook Pros shipping and Pine phones

1209
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,860
into production has proven to be a lot of work.

1210
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,740
So we had to put one project to the side for now.

1211
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,660
But there's a lot of interest in the PineTab.

1212
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,100
We get asked about it constantly.

1213
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,900
So we recently made the decision that we're

1214
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,500
going to start a very small production

1215
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,900
batch for people who are very interested in this.

1216
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,420
This will be akin to the Braveheart edition

1217
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,380
for the PinePhone.

1218
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,740
So only for enthusiasts, in other words.

1219
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,620
We haven't decided on when it will be available.

1220
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:36,820
Definitely next year in 2020, sometime in Q1.

1221
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,940
But we're still waiting for one of the partner projects

1222
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,920
to deliver an operating system that would

1223
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,700
be viable for the tablet.

1224
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,980
And the router, then?

1225
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,220
The router is something that I guess

1226
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,540
I can talk about it broadly.

1227
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,440
I really wanted to do a router for quite some time.

1228
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,700
I actually pitched this as an idea sometime back.

1229
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:03,020
But then everything else took precedence.

1230
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:07,260
And then completely coincidentally, somebody

1231
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:10,300
posted a question on Reddit.

1232
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,180
Would it be possible for Pine64 to make a router?

1233
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,860
And this gained a lot of traction.

1234
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,220
And so I responded.

1235
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,740
And I was clear saying that it's probably not going to happen.

1236
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,980
But if we were to do it, what sort of stuff

1237
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,220
would you want to see in it?

1238
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:31,340
And I've spoken to both a hardware networking

1239
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,980
engineer and a software networking engineer.

1240
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:38,840
And at this point in time, it appears to me

1241
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,940
that we do not have the right SOC for the job.

1242
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:47,340
It would just be, it wouldn't be the best router that can be.

1243
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,860
I actually was even contacted, and a huge shout out here

1244
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,940
to PFSense, who have been so lovely.

1245
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,740
They contacted me and said, do you want to talk?

1246
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,380
And we talked.

1247
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,380
And they were just really good.

1248
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,820
And the audience, a real gentleman,

1249
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,060
just having a chat with me and trying

1250
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,740
to figure out if we could possibly take a stab at it.

1251
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,180
But as of today, the decision is no, we just

1252
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,180
don't have the right SOC for networking.

1253
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,300
And it would be silly of us to try

1254
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,020
to compete with the existing propositions, which

1255
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,500
are simply much better.

1256
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,260
I love that realism.

1257
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,940
It's like, it'd be nice to do.

1258
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,340
We don't have the tech right now.

1259
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,340
Yeah.

1260
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,860
It's not a big flashy show.

1261
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,740
It's not NeoApple.

1262
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,540
It's just.

1263
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:33,900
Well, and I think that that's one

1264
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,900
of the things that's really cool about the Pine64 crew

1265
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,580
is that they're interested in providing

1266
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,740
the best product they can based around the ARM platform.

1267
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,580
And so if it's not going to work and the hardware isn't there

1268
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,340
yet, then they're not going to put out something that's subpar.

1269
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,420
Because quite honestly, they know

1270
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,700
that we'll all tear it apart.

1271
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,180
It's perfect for a guy like me who

1272
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,420
I am perfectly happy to sit back and watch

1273
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,640
ARM devices get better and more sophisticated and more

1274
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,140
capable.

1275
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,760
I don't really have any skin in the game

1276
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,500
because I'm pretty happy with my x86 laptops.

1277
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
But I could see where.

1278
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,580
But all your Intel stock.

1279
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,340
Yeah, well, I can see where this.

1280
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,540
I wish.

1281
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,460
Maybe not, actually.

1282
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,580
I could see where this trend line's going, though.

1283
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,300
I can see where this trend line's going.

1284
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,660
And I'm like, I'm really glad folks like Pine are doing this.

1285
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,780
Another one I'd love to see, just keeping

1286
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,860
it on theme for this episode.

1287
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:30,260
Man, I'd freaking love to see an ARM laptop like the Pine

1288
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,980
Book Pro from System76.

1289
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,860
That would be neat.

1290
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,740
Absolutely.

1291
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,620
That's got to be in the back burner up there.

1292
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,340
They've got to be tinkering with that in their R&D area.

1293
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,260
Pop Book Pro?

1294
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,980
Well, it's something that I've, it's

1295
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,740
something I might have mentioned to you at the roundtable.

1296
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,020
But did you call it a Pop Book Pro, cheese?

1297
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:48,580
Because that's.

1298
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,100
I didn't.

1299
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:49,780
But I should have.

1300
00:52:49,780 --> 00:53:08,880
So please check it out.
