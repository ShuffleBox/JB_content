1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Wes, it actually happened? We all made it to Denver.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,360
I wasn't sure we would.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,520
I wasn't sure you would actually, ya terrorist.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,560
What happened? You got held up in security.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,900
Oh boy, yes, it was an early flight,

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,020
let's say boarding at 4.35 a.m.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,640
I get to the airport, I'm walking to my gate,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,920
I got a TSA pre-check, not too worried,

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,320
except I see a giant crowd.

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,160
Uh-oh.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
I did not budget for this.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,920
Not at four in the morning.

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,160
No, right, I checked the app and it said there was no line

14
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,000
like five minutes or less, okay.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,240
Okay, no, no, that's just a bunch of international people

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,360
waiting for their own flight,

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
and for whatever reason, the security check

18
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,880
is passed all of these people with their bags.

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,560
I'm going through lines, going through,

20
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,320
and I decided to bring a microphone.

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,880
You know, we did the show.

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,720
Yep.

23
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,920
We needed to do the show.

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,040
Are we using that mic right now?

25
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,880
I'm using that mic right now.

26
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,240
Okay, all right, so it may have been worth it.

27
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,680
I got it through.

28
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,100
I anticipated knowing from your experiences

29
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,380
that there was gonna be a little bit of trouble

30
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,880
with the old TSA and their scanners.

31
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,040
It just happens that the RE320

32
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,240
kind of looks like a pipe bomb on the x-ray.

33
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,440
So here I am thinking about that.

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,320
You know, I know that's totally fine.

35
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,840
So I expect this.

36
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,400
I see them start looking at my bag

37
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
and I hear them debating.

38
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,480
Like one of them thinks part of the stand

39
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,840
is an extendable baton.

40
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,900
So they're kind of debating,

41
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,560
but another of the TSA agents thinks,

42
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,600
no, no, that's a microphone, that's a microphone.

43
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,960
So they're like betting each other.

44
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,740
Yeah, and then they come over to grab the bag

45
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,880
and I'm like, yeah, yeah, it's a microphone.

46
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
She's like, oh, I knew it.

47
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,200
Tells me, you know, you gotta wait for your other bags.

48
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,480
I'll be over here looking for things.

49
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,160
Now, I knew this might happen.

50
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,200
So the microphone right at the top of my bag.

51
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,160
Oh, good thinking.

52
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,880
Turns out though, they're also very interested

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,120
in the very dense pieces of the stand.

54
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,000
I didn't think about that.

55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,340
They're just dumb pieces of metal, right?

56
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,600
There's no complicated electronics.

57
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,480
There's no electronics at all.

58
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,400
All right, so they're rooting around.

59
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I see she's kind of looking through my bags

60
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,000
and eventually gets to the bottom

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,280
where the big, heavy base of the stand is,

62
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,440
pulls that out, checks it.

63
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,520
I thought that'd be it, but no,

64
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,720
she keeps looking, keeps looking.

65
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,360
And that's because there's this little extended bit

66
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,440
that actually joins from the microphone to the stand part.

67
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,740
I mean, it is the stand, right?

68
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,580
But what could it be?

69
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,520
It looks so weird on the x-ray.

70
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
And I'm trying to be helpful.

71
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
Oh, I think I rolled that up.

72
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,360
I think I rolled that up in a shirt.

73
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
And she's like, oh, okay.

74
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,840
You know, she offers me to come closer

75
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,600
and like, you know, help look for this thing.

76
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,880
She gets a look of confidence.

77
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,180
Oh, I think I found it.

78
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,200
She reaches in to pull it up.

79
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,160
It's wrapped in my underwear.

80
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Hello friends.

81
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,160
And welcome to your weekly Linux talk show.

82
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
My name is Chris.

83
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,160
My name is Wes.

84
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,220
Hello, Wes.

85
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,160
Yes, we are live from a very toasty sound booth

86
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,560
at System76 in Denver, Colorado.

87
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
And we have a very special show coming up for you today.

88
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Old and new friends are joining us here in the booth

89
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,840
to chat about various different things.

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,060
It's gonna be a great show.

91
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,700
I can't wait to get into it.

92
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,120
I wanna say thank you to a Cloud Guru

93
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,200
for sponsoring this episode.

94
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,080
They are the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

95
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,160
and other modern tech skills.

96
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,600
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

97
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,240
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

98
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,940
Yeah, so just like we said, coming up on the show today,

99
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,760
it's a totally different format.

100
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,720
We made the trek out here

101
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,900
and we're gonna chat with our friends about all of that.

102
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,660
There is so much to get into

103
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,640
that we're gonna kinda do this a little bit differently.

104
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,880
So right here at the top,

105
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,360
I wanna say thank you to our friends at Linode,

106
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,080
at linode.com slash unplugged.

107
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,340
You go there to get $100 in 60-day credit

108
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,760
on your new account and you also support the show.

109
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,800
It's a way of letting Linode know,

110
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,860
hey, I heard about this here service

111
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,700
on that Linux Unplugged podcast.

112
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,960
That was worth your time.

113
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,380
That was worth your efforts to sponsor them.

114
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,160
So we appreciate you doing that as well.

115
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,800
Linode is our hosting provider as well,

116
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,960
so we enthusiastically recommend them.

117
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,280
Everything we've built in the last couple of years

118
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,720
has been on Linode.

119
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,520
And this week, right now as we are here,

120
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,660
marks the very prime moment in negotiations

121
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,480
before Jupiter Broadcasting with Independent.

122
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,520
We are one week away from the year anniversary

123
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,240
and Linode was one of the very first companies on board

124
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,040
helping us go independent.

125
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,360
When I contacted them,

126
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,540
they were enthusiastic about joining us

127
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,540
and that has held true the entire time.

128
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,840
When I reached out to them

129
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,960
and started brainstorming about this road trip,

130
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,940
I expected to really kind of have to convince them

131
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,240
of the value and they were 100% on board.

132
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,160
They got designers involved, they got web people involved,

133
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,960
they got people on their marketing crew involved

134
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,500
so we can do giveaways and all kinds of stuff.

135
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,240
They really enthusiastically embraced the community

136
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
and that's because they started there.

137
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,440
In 2003, they got into cloud computing

138
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,800
before it was called that because they saw the features

139
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,520
that were landing in Linux itself.

140
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,080
They were developers, they were geeks using this stuff

141
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,480
and they realized there was a way to build out Linux at scale

142
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,140
like nobody had done before.

143
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,720
Now, you flash forward 18 years later,

144
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
yeah, yeah, Linode's old enough to vote now,

145
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,920
you fast forward 18 years and they have refined

146
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,500
and focused that strategy to a T.

147
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,080
It is so impressive what they can do

148
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,120
between the dashboard, the performance,

149
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,460
11 data centers around the world

150
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,280
and they have a lot of options for those of you

151
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
who maybe have never set up a server before.

152
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,960
One click deployments from their marketplace,

153
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,400
easy tutorials and guides and they're always working

154
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,640
with people out in the community to create videos

155
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,280
and tutorials to help you as well.

156
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,560
But you have to get started, you have to go try it yourself,

157
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,520
you have to see it with your own eyeballs.

158
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,840
Go hook your peepers on it by going to linode.com

159
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
slash unplugged, get that $100 for your new account

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
and try this stuff out.

161
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
That's how you learn, that's how you experience something,

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,800
go build something, go try something,

163
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
maybe go performance test your network

164
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
because they've got crazy fast servers

165
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
and you can really, really push things.

166
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,040
There's a lot of ways and a lot of different companies

167
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,000
to host something, there's a thousand options out there.

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,140
But Linode strikes the balance between performance,

169
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,000
price, the best customer service out there

170
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
and their community support.

171
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,360
So go shop local, support the show

172
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,280
and go to linode.com slash unplugged.

173
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,800
Well, I just arrived in Denver today,

174
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,080
but Brent, you've been journeying with Chris

175
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,840
and really the whole clan this entire time.

176
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,080
I think you need to catch me up.

177
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,360
Where do we start, Chris?

178
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,640
Well, you're Uncle Brent now.

179
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,560
Well, that's true, I think just yesterday,

180
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,500
Levi confirmed that status.

181
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,860
I've been sleeping on the sofa in Lady Jupiter, the RV,

182
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,960
and yesterday I wasn't there

183
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
and Levi wouldn't have any of it.

184
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,980
Yeah, he noticed, he protested,

185
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,740
he was searching the whole RV nonstop.

186
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,000
I mean, Brent's been with us for 2,000 miles,

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
about I think a little over.

188
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,800
How many states is that?

189
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,640
Something like that.

190
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,160
So we didn't count, but I went to a bunch of states

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,440
that I didn't realize we were going to be going through.

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,880
One of those was Wyoming, which was beautiful.

193
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,160
I really appreciate that.

194
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,680
We kind of cruised through most of the,

195
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,840
I guess, southern part of Wyoming

196
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,040
and then we ended up in Nebraska as well

197
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,560
and I had no idea we were gonna end up there,

198
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
so I've added that to my list of experiences

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
and we found a beautiful spot to stay there

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,180
and watch the stars and the sunset.

201
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,800
It was your first time to Utah as well, right?

202
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
You're right.

203
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Yeah, so we've done Idaho, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming,

204
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,300
and Nebraska.

205
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,140
Washington.

206
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,040
Of course, Washington, and then we came down

207
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,680
Highway 76 into Denver, which was rough as hell

208
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,200
on the rig, really bad.

209
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,400
I mean, that must be a big new part of this.

210
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,480
Obviously, Brent, you kind of travel all over.

211
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,040
Who knows where you are at any one point,

212
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,080
but I don't know if you've traveled exactly this way before.

213
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,800
I have not, and I will say it's my first

214
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
sort of somewhat cross-America road trip.

215
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,160
Typically, I'm sort of jetting in somewhere

216
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,720
and having all these great experiences,

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,800
but this time, the trip was the experience.

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,000
This time, you saw the real America, didn't you?

219
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Yeah.

220
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,760
Hot holes and all.

221
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,520
The stuff that's outside the cities

222
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,680
that just goes on and on and on forever,

223
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,280
and we had different challenges to solve along the way,

224
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,960
generally related to the temperature.

225
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,880
That was always intense,

226
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,240
and Brent just became part of the crew.

227
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,880
We just kind of, we treat it like a low-key submarine

228
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,040
kind of earth vessel is what we do,

229
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,840
because when those slides are in, it's a tight space.

230
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,680
Pressurizing.

231
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,200
Yeah, and there's things, there's certain operations

232
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,760
to cool things down,

233
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,560
and just even moving through the hallway in the RV

234
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,160
is kind of a system you have to adopt.

235
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, really.

236
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
I mean, okay, so there's the adults,

237
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,280
but then there's the children and the dog,

238
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,640
and they're kind of all climbing all over the place.

239
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,000
And we're trying to do the shows on the road,

240
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
which Brent was able to join me for a couple of them

241
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,560
and watch me scramble to get technical problems solved

242
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
at the last minute.

243
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,960
Oh, yes, that guest appearance

244
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,480
in the most recent self-hosted.

245
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,880
Yep, yep, yep.

246
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
So what, I don't know, Brent,

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,400
what's your big takeaway from the trip?

248
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,560
Is this a crazy way to get to places and do shows?

249
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,720
Because in some ways, it's kind of torture.

250
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,120
I mean, in some ways, it's very enjoyable.

251
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
I think it's a big balance.

252
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,960
The number one thing that stands out for me, actually,

253
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,160
I think would be how wonderful your family is.

254
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,720
I'm just gonna put that out there.

255
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
Aw, geez.

256
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,640
You know, I knew that before, but now I really feel that.

257
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,800
Gonna make me blush, Brent.

258
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,720
No.

259
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,040
Blush on a podcast.

260
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,200
But it's true.

261
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,800
You were kind to say, hey, my kids are coming on the trip

262
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
now, are you sure you still wanna,

263
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,760
it's okay if you can back out?

264
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,240
And I thought, no, no, this is gonna be great.

265
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,720
And it's even been better than I've expected.

266
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,840
Aw, that's nice to hear.

267
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,800
I mean, the kids love you.

268
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,040
Which kid are you taking back with you?

269
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Levi.

270
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah, no kidding, right?

271
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,600
I think some of my favorite moments

272
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,920
were watching you fight with the kids in the pool.

273
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,160
Pool battles for hours.

274
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,120
I think I lost that one.

275
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,560
Everybody does, we all lose.

276
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,320
And then there was the pool noodle battle

277
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
out at the golf course.

278
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,400
Well, there was no pool at the golf course,

279
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,280
so we just made it work.

280
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,480
Yeah, just the noodles.

281
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,440
That was a lot of fun.

282
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,760
And it was great to have you on board

283
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,400
to help solve problems as they came up.

284
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,880
Of course, we had all kinds of little challenges

285
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,720
here and there.

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,840
And that really, I think, is the quintessential thing

287
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,960
about a road trip is the bad moments actually matter, too,

288
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,800
because that's when we kind of come together

289
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,240
and have to problem solve and get outside our comfort zone.

290
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,160
And that happens both with relationships

291
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,680
in an emotional way, but also in a technical way.

292
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,600
And then we're problem solving driving, too.

293
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,920
You and I were tandem driving, so you were chasing us.

294
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,040
And we're solving traffic issues,

295
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,960
and we're solving all those kinds of problems

296
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,880
at the same time, too.

297
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,920
And that's a fun way to drive, especially

298
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
if you enjoy driving.

299
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,220
It's a different kind of driving that you don't normally

300
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,760
get to do where you're driving in twos, basically, in pairs.

301
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
I mean, yeah, you're a team, and you're

302
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,160
sort of actively scouting out and reacting to a new area

303
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
you've never been to.

304
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
And there was some times where Brent would scout for us

305
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,160
or that kind of stuff.

306
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,920
It was great.

307
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,440
I was taking possession of lanes, as well,

308
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,240
because I could tell, oh, I know we're

309
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,640
going to need to do this soon.

310
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,360
And I knew.

311
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,320
I would look in my mirror and see

312
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,840
you getting over preemptively from, attaboy, Brent.

313
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Yeah, because I could tell you need some space in that thing.

314
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,280
You do, don't you?

315
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,000
Man, so now we part ways here in Denver.

316
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,920
It's an adjustment, because Brent's no longer on board.

317
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,520
You're losing one of your own.

318
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,040
Yeah, and the family is having to adjust to it.

319
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
The kids don't like it.

320
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
Levi doesn't like it.

321
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,600
There's just always like, thank god.

322
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,880
There's always that sense of loss.

323
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,920
You have to acknowledge the change in your crew.

324
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,280
Yeah, yeah.

325
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,400
And it was fun, because Brent and I, we

326
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,240
recorded recaps and clips along the way of the trip

327
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
while memories were fresh.

328
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,240
And then we would organize and store those up

329
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,400
on our Nextcloud instance.

330
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,880
And so we're going to put together, after the trip,

331
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,080
a couple of episodes of the experience itself,

332
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,560
the best and worst moments.

333
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,840
And there are some.

334
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,360
Yeah, I think we're going to do some technical highlights,

335
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,080
some of the equipment.

336
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,480
Some of the tech we used for the trip and all of that.

337
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,720
So that'll all be coming pretty soon.

338
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,960
And we'll have more information about the feeds for that

339
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,720
and all of that.

340
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
But Brent, it's going to be sad to see you go.

341
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,300
I'm glad we still have a few days in Denver before we part

342
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,640
our ways.

343
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,160
It's true.

344
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I think I might see you in Colorado Springs at some point

345
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
before you head south, right?

346
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,280
Yep.

347
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
Then I head down after Colorado Springs.

348
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,640
We're going to leave Denver.

349
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,360
We'll do another round of shows from Colorado Springs

350
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,200
and do some micro meetups there.

351
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,000
And then I'm off to Tucson, kind of off the books,

352
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,400
to go get Lady Joops' slide finally fixed.

353
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,520
Oh, that's the other thing.

354
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,160
Oh, yeah.

355
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,360
Brent had to do this entire trip with the entire family

356
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,840
with a broken living room slide.

357
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
We didn't have a living room slide.

358
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,840
This is the first time I saw it this morning.

359
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,760
And I'm used to seeing Joops in her full glory slides out,

360
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,000
you know, set up to party.

361
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,560
Tight.

362
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,080
It's, yeah, it's a bit different.

363
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,920
It's tight.

364
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,800
It's, you know, it's the-

365
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
Your living room is gone.

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,640
Yeah.

367
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,960
Yeah, the whole room is gone.

368
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,760
And when you have an extra person on board,

369
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,480
you kind of need that.

370
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,920
So congratulations to you for not only surviving,

371
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,280
but thriving on the road trip.

372
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,000
Well, thank you.

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,560
It was such a treat to be a part of it.

374
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,920
Mr. Cheese Bacon, welcome back to the show, buddy.

375
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,320
Hey, thanks for having me, guys.

376
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,400
It's great to be back here.

377
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,080
And now an employee at System 76.

378
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,360
Yeah.

379
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,680
So that's pretty great.

380
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
Yeah, really, we're back here.

381
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,520
Yeah.

382
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,120
Yeah, it's kind of awesome that the first time we got

383
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,880
to come back in two years, you're now here.

384
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,360
And, you know, we get to hang out.

385
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,040
Yeah, absolutely.

386
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,120
Well, it's great to see you guys,

387
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,360
you know, especially after the pandemic and everything.

388
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,400
And, you know, the stress and things

389
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,320
that go around when, you know, go on when you can't kind of

390
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,200
cohabitate and meet space together.

391
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,680
So it's finally nice to be back together all

392
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
vaxxed up and sitting in this hot box.

393
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,360
And having fun, though.

394
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
Having a lot of fun.

395
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,360
Yeah, after this, we're going to all run over

396
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,840
to the JB AirBB.

397
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,240
And, you know, I don't know what's going to happen.

398
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,680
Probably something crazy like naps.

399
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,320
Naps?

400
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,400
I think a big cuddle puddle in the living room, right?

401
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,560
Yeah, that's possible.

402
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,040
I think first, there's going to be lunch.

403
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,560
Yes.

404
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,040
So lunch, and then likely naps after lunch.

405
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,520
Yeah.

406
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,480
Especially if it's a high carb lunch.

407
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,720
Maybe we get some brats for lunch.

408
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,280
I mean, that's the thing, when you visit a place

409
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,760
and if there's a cheese bacon there,

410
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,000
you're going to find some tasty eats.

411
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,360
Yeah, you know cheese is making sure, like, we only

412
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,160
go to the good places to eat.

413
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,680
So.

414
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,120
But I'm new here, so I can make no promises.

415
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,680
I know, you've tried a few places.

416
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,320
Yeah, a few.

417
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,000
You and I were chatting yesterday, though,

418
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,400
about how things have really changed

419
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,560
in how you troubleshoot and look things up on Linux.

420
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,720
Not to sound old, but when a lot of us started using Linux,

421
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,400
the only way you could look something up

422
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,440
was really the man page.

423
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,920
Right.

424
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,040
And you kind of had on system documentation.

425
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,340
And that was like this resource that was invaluable.

426
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,840
And today, more and more, you see things like flat packs

427
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,800
and snaps and other software projects that just

428
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,480
don't even bother with man pages or update them at all.

429
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,220
And the on system local manual that

430
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,760
doesn't require an internet connection

431
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,160
is starting to slowly become either un-maintained or even

432
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,840
just a thing of the past, depending on how

433
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,600
the software is distributed.

434
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,260
And I'm wondering how that sits with you guys,

435
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,560
because it struck me as maybe we're losing something here.

436
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,960
For me, too, it kind of started with a physical book, right?

437
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,720
Before I knew how to use man pages,

438
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,560
whatever distro that you purchased

439
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,080
came with a manual that you could then

440
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,720
learn how to use man to look up other tools and information

441
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,440
on other tools, but also gave you a little bit of insight,

442
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,980
maybe a little more in-depth information

443
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,400
than just a man page would give you, like man pages.

444
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,480
You're going to say, TAC-T is this vague thing.

445
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,320
And you're like, well, what is that vague thing?

446
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,200
And back in the day when you were looking up man pages

447
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,880
and stuff like that, it was a little bit more difficult

448
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,120
because if you did try to ask that question, like, hey, guys,

449
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,960
what is TAC-T?

450
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,320
Can somebody kind of spell that out?

451
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,800
Can somebody kind of give me a little bit more detail

452
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
on what this is?

453
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
So the majority of the time, you get RTFM.

454
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,840
And I'm like, I'm literally RTFM-ing.

455
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,600
It's not in there.

456
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,560
It's not in there.

457
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,040
Can you give me a little bit more information?

458
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,320
So then it was very primitive.

459
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,760
You would go try to look at the project maintainer site,

460
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,320
wherever you grab the tarball from,

461
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,720
if it was some application that you would try to dig

462
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
through their documentation, hoping that their documentation

463
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,480
was up to date.

464
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,280
But today, it's different, especially

465
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,520
with the container world.

466
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Should they be in there?

467
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't know.

468
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,240
A lot of that stuff is obfuscated away from you

469
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,080
anyway.

470
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,440
So it's not like the days of going in and building out

471
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,560
a stack for something or creating this kind of ecosystem

472
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,240
for something.

473
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,000
You don't really necessarily do that anymore.

474
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,440
Here's a package that has all the stuff,

475
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,640
whether that be a container, a snap, a flat pack, any app

476
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,000
image, whatever.

477
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,400
You're generally only going to get what is there.

478
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,760
And so a lot of the stuff that happens behind the scenes

479
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,600
is kind of obfuscated away, which I think

480
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,200
is another question.

481
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,680
How are you going to learn the stuff if you can't

482
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,160
have an opportunity to really look and dive into it?

483
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,360
It kind of makes me think of IRC in the sense

484
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,040
that what's actually happening, the interaction, the core of it

485
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,920
isn't going away.

486
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,600
We still have things like matrix or Slack these days.

487
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,360
But we're switching how it is.

488
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,360
And man pages, they use weird tools to put them together.

489
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,940
You might not understand the structure

490
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,840
of how to actually navigate and what do these numbers mean?

491
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,800
What are the different sections?

492
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,000
How do I get to them?

493
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,120
How do you actually read through compared

494
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,880
to just looking at a Markdown file or some online

495
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,740
documentation that you're linked to?

496
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,240
It's accomplishing the same purpose,

497
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,920
but in very different means.

498
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,640
And then you have wikis, right?

499
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,440
So ArchWiki, generally a great place.

500
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,520
Ubuntu's forums and support, generally

501
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,040
a great place.

502
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
Their knowledge base, generally a great place to go.

503
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,280
And I would say probably easier to keep updated than man pages.

504
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,080
I would say so.

505
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,480
And I would say easier to maintain,

506
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,360
because then you don't have to push the man page to a package

507
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,440
and a package update.

508
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,200
Right, the only way you're updating that manage,

509
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,740
or the only way you're updating that man page

510
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,760
is by updating the package, which has to make it

511
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,200
through the distros repo.

512
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,760
And for some distros, that's going to be a long time.

513
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,940
That could be a process.

514
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,320
So it's much easier just to take 40 seconds

515
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,260
and push that update to a wiki.

516
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,680
And it also, I think, also creates

517
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,760
an opportunity for the community to actually get involved

518
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,680
in documentation and help out a lot more.

519
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
That's a good point.

520
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,220
Because you don't necessarily have

521
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,760
to be a maintainer of a package or be

522
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,980
involved in the package itself, and you can still

523
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,440
contribute to documentation or things

524
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
that you may have learned.

525
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,980
Yeah, really.

526
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,080
And we seem to keep reinventing these things.

527
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,900
I know there's a ton of different projects,

528
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,280
but PyCrash over in our IRC just linked us to TLDR, right?

529
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,680
And here's another tool that you can use as an alternative to man

530
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
pages that kind of gets the same thing across.

531
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,000
But this one often has a lot of examples,

532
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,560
which some man pages sorely lack.

533
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,200
That was my favorite thing in a man page.

534
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
And when they didn't have the examples,

535
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,080
I was like, well, what good is this?

536
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Yeah, I need my real world use examples, right?

537
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,520
And I mean, that makes all the difference.

538
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
I think there's an opportunity, too, for somebody

539
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,840
like a site similar to TLDR or something,

540
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,340
and I haven't looked at it myself,

541
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,520
but to be able to show typical normal commands

542
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,280
and how they can be used and how you can use TAC whatever

543
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,920
to kind of help you navigate that application

544
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,880
or get more out of it and make it clearer for that process

545
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,000
to happen instead of, like I said,

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,800
some super vague, like a developer put

547
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,760
in this super vague sentence.

548
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,800
And you're like, what the?

549
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,520
I don't.

550
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
OK, it changes the variable.

551
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,680
After we've talked about it, it kind of makes me feel like it's

552
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,940
man pages time, like they're still valuable,

553
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,080
but their time in the sun has sort of passed.

554
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Like we have so many forms of real time communication

555
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,560
from IRC to matrix to Discord to all the things.

556
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,180
And you've got wikis.

557
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,680
It kind of does feel like maybe we've just

558
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,280
sort of outgrown the man page.

559
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,480
Like it's not, like you still, like when you got to get

560
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,120
a box piece of software, you'd love

561
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,780
to still see a manual in there, and from time to time,

562
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,000
it's very useful.

563
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,840
But it's not the difference between getting like Samba up

564
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,040
and running or not anymore.

565
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,360
Right.

566
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,760
No, I mean, it's definitely not.

567
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,680
And for me, back in the day, whenever

568
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,520
I would struggle with man pages and getting told to RTFM

569
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,080
or whatever, I would oftentimes push to like a nutshell book.

570
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,000
So a command line book or, you know.

571
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,120
Yeah, that's really where the books were useful, right?

572
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,360
Absolutely.

573
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,160
With the examples.

574
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,500
Yeah, because that's what gave you that example, right?

575
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,360
So for a lot of us, that was really starting out.

576
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,000
That was kind of our foray into like, well,

577
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,200
if you're interested in SQL, get a book on SQL.

578
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,720
If you're interested in firewalls,

579
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,440
then get a book on IP tables or whatever.

580
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,080
And because firewalls was especially

581
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,000
one of those ones that was just a tricky pain in the ass,

582
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,840
to be quite honest.

583
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,360
Yeah.

584
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,280
It was bad.

585
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,400
And it took just getting the syntax right

586
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,640
and getting everything right.

587
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,960
I still don't know how to configure IP chains.

588
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,160
But it was just such a struggle.

589
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,440
So having that documentation was crucial back then.

590
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,320
And I still have some of those nutshell books

591
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,560
and command books and stuff like that that hang around

592
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,720
that I will forever have.

593
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,880
Because a lot of those, some of those programs don't.

594
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,560
Some of it is still relevant.

595
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,160
LS isn't really going to change.

596
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,080
I mean, yeah, it may be iterated on a lot.

597
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,960
There's also just something, I don't know,

598
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,520
it's a bit of history, too, those books.

599
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,840
They're a little bit of history.

600
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,400
You know, when I was in my very first, well, no,

601
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,480
my second IT job.

602
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,960
My second IT job, the IT crew, I don't know,

603
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
once a quarter, maybe a little more frequently than that,

604
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,840
would take, like all of us, would take a long lunch.

605
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,600
And we'd get food.

606
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
And then we would go to the bookstore.

607
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,000
And we'd get the books we need for the software

608
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,800
we were working with for that period of time.

609
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,960
And we'd come back with five or six books.

610
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,620
And we had bookshelves in the IT department

611
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,120
with all of the information on it.

612
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,480
And everybody would kind of get a different book.

613
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,280
Because each book had different examples

614
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,320
and different kind of scenarios or whatever, you know?

615
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,040
So like people would kind of intersperse and get

616
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,440
different books so that you could swap books or still

617
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,520
grab that book or get something out of that book.

618
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,560
And you had the nutshell books, which

619
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
were known for certain things.

620
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,640
Then you had the books that were known for helping

621
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,080
you cram for a CERT exam.

622
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,560
And it was just very focused on that.

623
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,200
And then you had the really technical books, and then

624
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
the more theoretical stuff.

625
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,920
And you just had to know what kind of book guy you were

626
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,360
and get the right one.

627
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,680
And now they're just, well, now it's just, you know.

628
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,160
She's just asking what TAC-T does on Stack Overflow.

629
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,400
And someone answers that.

630
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,240
Yeah, that's it, right?

631
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,840
You know, I've got to admit, like it's been a long time

632
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,600
since I've gotten an RTFM.

633
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
It's been a really long time.

634
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,280
It has gotten better.

635
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,800
It has gotten better.

636
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,760
So the community as a whole has gotten better.

637
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,920
I think the documentation is getting better, especially

638
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,720
with the advent of wikis and stuff.

639
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,240
But then, you know, one day if we ever

640
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,400
get thrust in some sort of apocalyptic scenario,

641
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,080
I guess we're all going to be scrambling

642
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,960
for man pages in paperback books or something again.

643
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
Well, on that note, Cheesy, what do you say we go scrounge up

644
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,760
some lunch?

645
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,640
Thank you for coming back on the show, sir.

646
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,080
Hey, thank you guys for having me.

647
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,920
It's good to see you.

648
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,200
Good to see you.

649
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,240
Alex, it is so good to see you in person.

650
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,960
My buddy from Self-Hosted is here in Denver with us.

651
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,720
How you doing, man?

652
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,320
Hello.

653
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,440
How was the trip in?

654
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,280
It was smooth, with a sprinkling of bumpy

655
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,040
as we went across the tropical depression.

656
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,680
That's a good way to put it, actually.

657
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,640
Well, we were thinking like there's a million things you

658
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,720
and I could catch up on.

659
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,560
Really?

660
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,760
But one of our favorite topics that we

661
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,260
talk a lot about on Self-Hosted but don't talk about very much

662
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,720
on this show is one of my favorite free software

663
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,360
projects of all time, and that's Home Assistant.

664
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,880
Yeah, yeah.

665
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Who would have guessed?

666
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,440
I know.

667
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,320
And they recently had an update that

668
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:52,440
adds a feature that both you and I are extremely excited about.

669
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,040
I can't even imagine the possibilities.

670
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,680
Once I start pulling in energy information

671
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,080
in Home Assistant, the kind of automations

672
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,420
I can build around that are going

673
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,560
to change my life because I'm running off solar in that RV.

674
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,840
So it's energy monitoring.

675
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,440
It's here, it's real, and it's built

676
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,720
into Home Assistant with a new release.

677
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,280
And you've had a chance to look at it.

678
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,840
Yeah, with the August update, so 2021.08,

679
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,240
Home Assistant have added energy monitoring, as we just said.

680
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,640
And out of the box, there are several integrations

681
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,480
that will just work.

682
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,640
And luckily for me, Frank, who is

683
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,720
one of the main Home Assistant developers,

684
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,160
has a solar system with exactly the same integration as I use,

685
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
which is the solar edge one.

686
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,200
So for me, it just works.

687
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,960
That's so great.

688
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
Yeah, so after the update, I thought

689
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
that's the Home Assistant lottery right there.

690
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,560
You know how to pick a project.

691
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,800
Yeah.

692
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,040
So after the update, I ran through a little wizard,

693
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,280
which said pick a bunch of sensors.

694
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,400
For me, it was just a couple of solar edge sensors.

695
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,280
It then does a bunch of smarts on its back end

696
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,920
and integrates with the solar forecast.io plugin

697
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,880
to generate a little graph of what it thinks

698
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,800
the UV power is going to be or whatever.

699
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,480
Oh, that's great.

700
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,640
With my azimuth, with my dangle of my panels

701
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
and all that kind of stuff.

702
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,120
So what that would mean for me is

703
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,680
I could kind of plan how we're going to energy

704
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,520
manage for that day.

705
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,800
Because right now, I'm kind of like,

706
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,080
I wait for the sun to come up.

707
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,920
How cloudy is it?

708
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,400
And I just kind of guess as the day goes on.

709
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,960
You're doing it yourself with whatever basic heuristics

710
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,840
you've learned, but you don't have the data.

711
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,640
And now, so yesterday, Lady Joop's got up

712
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
to 107 degrees inside.

713
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,640
Yeah, that's hot.

714
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,960
And it was just unbearable.

715
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,720
And I didn't want to run the generator here

716
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,120
in the system 76 parking lot to run the AC.

717
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,400
Because when you run both ACs, you're

718
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
looking at almost a 3,000 watt when you also

719
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,720
add in battery charging, a 3,000 watt draw consistently.

720
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,240
And that generates heat.

721
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,120
And when you are already 107 degrees,

722
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,600
you don't want to generate much heat.

723
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,400
You're going to start killing your equipment.

724
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,240
And so we moved in the middle of the morning,

725
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,400
I guess is the way to put it, very early in the morning,

726
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,200
we moved to a spot with shade.

727
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,780
But now, I'm dealing with the fact

728
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,040
that I am sitting around 60% charge.

729
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,440
And I really don't know how long I can stretch that out.

730
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,520
And so something that would give me the ability

731
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,480
to even just forecast like that.

732
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,080
But to take it to the next step, Alex,

733
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,680
I could actually monitor the actual power generation

734
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,760
of the solar system, right?

735
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,360
So not only would I have the forecast,

736
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,140
but I could see what I'm actually

737
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,280
making in Home Assistant.

738
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,200
And that becomes like a source of sensor information

739
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,000
that the system can build automations around.

740
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,560
Have you experimented with that at all?

741
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,680
There's a bunch of stuff, actually, that you can do.

742
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,280
And I'm going to show you in person.

743
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,860
If you want to know what we're talking about,

744
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,840
have a look at the release.

745
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,680
We'll put in the show notes for this.

746
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,800
And the solar generation, you can see there

747
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,640
what the weather forecast has predicted

748
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,720
I'm going to get at my location.

749
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,840
And then what you actually got, right?

750
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,280
Yeah, so you can see the orange underneath, the dotted line.

751
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,920
There's a bit of a delta there.

752
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,500
So at the top, there's like a energy usage panel.

753
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,320
And there's a few bars that say how much you've actually

754
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,080
used versus how much you're returning to the grid.

755
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,160
And then when you are returning to the grid,

756
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,240
you could do some smarts to say, only run my AC unit

757
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,480
when I've got spare capacity over a kill or whatever.

758
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
That is brilliant.

759
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,920
OK, so how much of this stuff with this update,

760
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,120
is it just the connection to existing tooling?

761
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,560
Or is it also some of that support

762
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,340
at the dashboarding and the actual software level too?

763
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,800
I was pleasantly surprised.

764
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,320
I opened the GitHub issue on the Solar Edge integration.

765
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,520
And Frank came in and changed a couple lines of code

766
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
because some of the templating of the sensors

767
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,120
of that particular integration were a little bit

768
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,640
wonky on release day.

769
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,280
But now, as you can see, it just works just fine.

770
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,240
And the wizard that they walk you through,

771
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,520
when you first do this 08 update,

772
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,800
that wizard says which sensor is the input, which

773
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,200
sensor is the output, all that kind of stuff.

774
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,240
And it takes a minute or two.

775
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
And then it adds a new tab on the left-hand side.

776
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,060
Or you've got overview, map, whatever.

777
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,360
There's now an energy tab on the left.

778
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,840
And it just works, yeah.

779
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,920
Jeez, I'm going to have to try that soon.

780
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,840
That's great.

781
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,040
I'm really kind of impressed with the direction

782
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,400
they're taking that stuff because they consistently

783
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,120
come up with new ways of building automations off

784
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,520
of information that I'd never even thought of before.

785
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,720
And if I could just impart one bit of advice

786
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,040
from this episode is if you haven't tried out Home Assistant

787
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,800
yet, throw it in a VM and let it look at your network

788
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,000
and just see what it finds.

789
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,480
And maybe just start playing with that

790
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,560
because you'll be surprised at how many things it

791
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,040
might detect.

792
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,320
If you've got a Chromecast or an Apple TV on your network

793
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,800
or a Plex client and server, it will automatically

794
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,100
figure that out and say, hey, I could integrate automations

795
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,880
around that.

796
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,880
For some reason, let's say you had a multicolored light bulb

797
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,420
in your lounge and you wanted it to turn red every time that

798
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,840
someone was streaming something from your Plex server.

799
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,600
You could do that.

800
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,160
And these are devices that are in totally different

801
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,960
ecosystems.

802
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,960
A Hue bulb talking to a Plex server

803
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,340
doesn't really compute in normal people land.

804
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,920
But in Home Assistant land, you can do it because it

805
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
has tendrils.

806
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,960
It has fingers in every single pie of what's

807
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,280
going on on your network.

808
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,400
And it can figure out, oh, this sensor just changed state

809
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,640
from this to that.

810
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,100
And then you write an automation that

811
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,760
says, if this threshold's been exceeded

812
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,240
for x number of minutes, then do this.

813
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,480
So it's essentially it's if this, then that on your LAN

814
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,360
on total and utter steroids.

815
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,160
Right.

816
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,120
And under your complete control and all that information

817
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,460
about when you're doing stuff and when you came and left

818
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,220
and when you turn stuff on, it's not

819
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,440
going out to some cloud provider who's

820
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,640
building a profile about you.

821
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,140
It's staying on your LAN, on your box.

822
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,660
And that, to me, is the ultimate win.

823
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,080
It's amazing how far this has come

824
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,680
and it's kind of lifted the level that you can do.

825
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,080
You can write an easy automation that maybe three years ago,

826
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,960
I'd be rigging something up on a Raspberry Pi

827
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,640
by hand with a custom Python script.

828
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,660
Totally.

829
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,160
Well, Alex, I'm looking forward to going

830
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
and doing a little cookout soon.

831
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,360
Yes, me too.

832
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,640
Got any ideas of what we should cook?

833
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,440
Well, we can cook in here.

834
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,400
This room is hot as anything, isn't it?

835
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,880
I'm very grateful they have a sound booth in their factory,

836
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,680
obviously, because it makes this possible.

837
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,680
But there's no ventilation because it's a sound booth.

838
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,100
Have you seen the eye in your thighs?

839
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,440
Now you know why.

840
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,360
Oh, wow.

841
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,080
Aaron Honeycutt from System76 joins us.

842
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,280
Aaron, I think you were on the show like 100 years ago.

843
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,320
I think it's been a while.

844
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,620
I think we have chatted before.

845
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,920
I think I took over a podcast for somebody

846
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,640
at Self in the before times.

847
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,760
OK, OK, all right.

848
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,200
Yeah, in the before times, exactly.

849
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,940
Well, just like a quick recap, what does Aaron do at System76?

850
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm a happiness engineer on the support team.

851
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,840
So to anyone who's outside, it's technical support, basically.

852
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,080
Right, OK.

853
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,200
Well, I noticed you have a PineTime on your wrist.

854
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,720
I do.

855
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,040
And I haven't talked to anybody who's actually

856
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,200
using one on the daily.

857
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,040
So I'm curious to get your thoughts on the PineTime.

858
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,120
And how much was it for that watch, too?

859
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,320
It was around $40-ish USD with shipping and everything.

860
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Wow.

861
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
I don't even understand how it can be that cheap.

862
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,780
I mean, that's Raspberry Pi money.

863
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,280
Is it worth $40?

864
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,760
So far, I just got it yesterday.

865
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,360
So I can't make solid conclusions.

866
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,160
But I think it's very much worth it,

867
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,680
because I wanted a spiritual successor to Pebble.

868
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,920
I've had Samsung watches.

869
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,440
And I hate having to have all of this Samsung crap on my phone

870
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,760
since I have a Pixel.

871
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,340
I don't have a Samsung phone anymore.

872
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,600
I'm like, I don't want all this crap on my phone, just

873
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,400
notifications.

874
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,120
Yeah.

875
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,800
And has it done the job of replacing

876
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,840
what the Pebble gave you?

877
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,760
So far, I think it's pretty good replacement for it.

878
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,200
I don't know whether I would have.

879
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,440
I had both the e-ink non-color and color Pebble.

880
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,920
So I can't say whether I would prefer one or the other.

881
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,640
But I think it's been a good replacement.

882
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,960
And $40, too, it's worth experimenting with, right?

883
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,460
It's like.

884
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,320
Yeah.

885
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,520
Whether it's going to be good or not is kind of two lunches

886
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,320
right there.

887
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,520
I always wonder with Pine, though,

888
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,720
is the plan to just really put the prices low

889
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,480
and just keep expectations low and keep it that way forever?

890
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,120
Or are they going to eventually start creeping the price up?

891
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,160
Yeah.

892
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,840
I don't know.

893
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
It was, it seems like it was in the same price point

894
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,680
when it was non-sealed and dev kit

895
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,720
potential versus the sealed one, which this is the sealed one.

896
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,400
So I don't have access to any programming interfaces

897
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,120
or GOPI pins.

898
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
So more consumer version.

899
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
Consumer focused version, I feel like.

900
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,800
Which is where they're going to have to take it, right?

901
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,280
Eventually.

902
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:58,560
So.

903
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,240
Yeah.

904
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,440
I just actually did a firmware update for the first time

905
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,720
earlier because it shipped with 1.2.

906
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,920
So is there like an app on your phone that does that?

907
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,120
I have GadgetBridge.

908
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,160
And then you download the.zip file from GitHub

909
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,080
and then click it to open it on Android.

910
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,200
And then you can choose to open with GadgetBridge.

911
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,080
And then it does the firmware update for you.

912
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,440
And that's progress bar on the app and on the watch.

913
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,120
Nice.

914
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,600
Yeah.

915
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,440
That's not too bad.

916
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,160
That's nice.

917
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,880
I mean, as long as you're comfortable doing those things.

918
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,200
But anybody buying a PineTime?

919
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,440
Probably.

920
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,520
I mean, you wouldn't buy one of those.

921
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,200
But you're also just used to, some people

922
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
just download APK files and just install them.

923
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,760
So.

924
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,800
That's true.

925
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,920
So the other thing, you get labeled as a gamer

926
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
when I come in here.

927
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,080
Like, oh, yeah, you want to talk about gaming.

928
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
I want to talk to Aaron.

929
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,800
Are you a big gamer?

930
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,320
Is that true?

931
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
Yeah.

932
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,640
I have a guest stop at home just for work, pleasure,

933
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,000
and gaming.

934
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,440
Multi-purpose, I'll have that.

935
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,800
How have you done in this part shortage drought?

936
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,000
I had everything set up before the drought.

937
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,920
Oh, lucky you.

938
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,440
I have an RX 580.

939
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,760
So I had everything set up with the 8 gig model.

940
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,560
So I was already set up for.

941
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,080
Nice.

942
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
You lucky devil.

943
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,240
See, the reason why I ask is people suggested,

944
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,060
people said that we should talk about the Steam Deck

945
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,120
and Wes and I have got a million thoughts on the Steam Deck.

946
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,840
But I'm curious what your first impressions are,

947
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,800
both from a gamer's perspective, but also your personal opinion

948
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,960
as a System76 employee who watches a company produce

949
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,400
hardware on the regular.

950
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,680
You must have some thoughts in both regards.

951
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,840
I love it as the idea.

952
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,640
The first thing that kind of threw me off

953
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,640
was if you look at the HTC Vive, the Vive Index,

954
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,320
on their page, it has its own separate page on steam.com

955
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,560
or steam.com.

956
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,800
This is a whole other website, which is a little bit weird.

957
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,440
What do you take from that?

958
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,480
Like it's outside the ecosystem almost?

959
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,320
It's hard to tell.

960
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,980
I think they're kind of just figuring out

961
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,040
whether they want this as a main thing.

962
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,600
Right, is that a lingering hedge from getting

963
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,480
burned by steam machines, perhaps?

964
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
I see, yeah.

965
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,040
And what do you think of it from a hardware standpoint?

966
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,320
I, particularly the hardware, looks really good.

967
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,000
I mean, a lot of gamers, and myself included, my rig

968
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,920
is all AMD.

969
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,560
So I'm like, I'm all in on just AMD hardware

970
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
from the get-go.

971
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,060
Yeah, I mean, as a Linux user, it makes things a lot easier.

972
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,840
Yeah, because I don't deal with the pro driver from AMD.

973
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,400
The one from the kernel works perfectly fine for everything.

974
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,600
I've been playing, oh god, playing everything

975
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,040
that I don't need to deal with.

976
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,440
Yeah, I've never needed to reload the pro driver.

977
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,360
People say you've got to have the pro driver.

978
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,760
It doesn't even load on, last I checked,

979
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,360
current Ubuntu anyway, because they're

980
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,280
trying to hit older kernels, and Ubuntu

981
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,560
is too new of a kernel for it.

982
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,000
And they don't want to deal with it for something.

983
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,520
Yeah, I think it also, I honestly

984
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,760
think it has potential as a little portable workstation

985
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,320
for me.

986
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,800
I could see using it to do work.

987
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,680
A coworker brought up that the Nintendo Switch does

988
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,400
720p while mobile, because the screen's on.

989
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,120
A docks turns off the built-in display

990
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,640
to get the 1080 performance difference.

991
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,520
All the videos show that the screen's fully on.

992
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,480
So I'm just wondering how very powered

993
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,520
it's going to be, if you use a desktop placement.

994
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,600
Do you think it's going to be doing double duty,

995
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,640
run the internal screen and an external monitor?

996
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,880
Would it be pushing it too hard?

997
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,320
I'm wondering if they're going to change that later on

998
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,040
and just make it powered off.

999
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,160
It'd just kind of be weird looking at it from just screen

1000
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,080
off, though, and it's just docked.

1001
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,280
The Nintendo at least covers the front screen up

1002
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,320
when they do that, so you don't really notice it.

1003
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,880
Yeah, that is a clever way.

1004
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,440
I never thought that's why they do that with the dock,

1005
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,880
but that's totally wise, so you don't expect that screen there.

1006
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,920
Yeah, Valve seems to be really embracing this.

1007
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,720
It's a PC, so if a PC can do it, the deck's going to do it.

1008
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,240
And that's part of that philosophy, I think.

1009
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,680
I kind of want a hybrid model here,

1010
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,840
like a game where I can SSH into my servers,

1011
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,560
but then I'm actually shooting zombies

1012
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,960
that are rogue processes.

1013
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,800
That might be a thing.

1014
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,840
We should look into that.

1015
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,960
That'd actually be pretty great.

1016
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,400
I'd like that.

1017
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,640
Now I'm just thinking of use cases

1018
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,720
if they leave the screen on.

1019
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,640
Yeah, I mean, for Steam chat, for one thing, it would be nice.

1020
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,920
Or just watching the CPU resources and whatnot

1021
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,520
could be handy.

1022
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,440
What if you stream from it on Twitch

1023
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,760
and then you just watch chat on it?

1024
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,240
Yeah.

1025
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,760
The ways you can abuse this thing, it's going to be great.

1026
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,280
It kind of makes you kind of think

1027
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,360
of the ways that you abuse some of the laptops that

1028
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,280
have a little split screen above the keyboard.

1029
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
How do you use that?

1030
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,440
I don't know.

1031
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,520
Yeah, I'm always looking for more screens.

1032
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,320
So if there's a way, I'll go for it.

1033
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,280
And the only problem for me for total portability

1034
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,520
is, of course, I'd have to have a dock, an external monitor,

1035
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,920
and all that.

1036
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,480
And so then a laptop just becomes more pragmatic.

1037
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,120
But I could see it around the house.

1038
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,280
It's kind of interesting on those portable displays

1039
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,720
and weather, because Nintendo just limits the spec,

1040
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
and their dock does the rest with type C.

1041
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,320
But if they're following the spec correctly,

1042
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,480
you won't really need a dock.

1043
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,200
You just get a cable and lay it flat on the desk,

1044
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,760
and a portable monitor would work.

1045
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,800
Yeah, that's true.

1046
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,320
That's true.

1047
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Yeah, I could see it.

1048
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,880
I also could see it as a decent kids' workstation as well.

1049
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,280
Give my kids a deck, and then they plug it

1050
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,040
into the dock at home, and they have a full desktop.

1051
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,520
And they still have that gaming rig

1052
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,960
they've been begging you for.

1053
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,120
Well, Aaron, thanks for coming in and chatting with us.

1054
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,160
It was good to chat with you.

1055
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,280
Yeah, thanks.

1056
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,920
Ian, welcome back to the show.

1057
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,760
And it's great to actually do this in person.

1058
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,120
I know.

1059
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,880
It's been a while.

1060
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,080
It has.

1061
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,520
It's been a long time, I think, since you've been on, too.

1062
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,200
And there's been a lot of things happening in desktop land

1063
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,920
for System76 since we've chatted.

1064
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,560
So I'm really excited to talk about that.

1065
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,120
And I got to start with a thing that's on my mind.

1066
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,960
And when I asked other people, I said, hey, what should I ask Ian?

1067
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,720
This is the question they suggested.

1068
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,760
Everyone's curious about Pop OS's transition to GTK4

1069
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,240
and what that looks like and how it's going.

1070
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,160
Because I imagine there's a lot of work that

1071
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,760
has to be done to get things, especially

1072
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,000
with the theme and whatnot, to get things working with GTK4.

1073
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,400
That's most of what I'm doing with it right now,

1074
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,920
is just working on doing the GTK4 port of the theme

1075
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,880
to make sure the style sheet is working

1076
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,440
and stuff's not falling back on Oddwaiter or anything

1077
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,680
like that, because it looks a little strange if you're

1078
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
expecting your system to look one way.

1079
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,040
And all of a sudden, you boot it up,

1080
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,000
and one application looks off.

1081
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,720
It can be a little jarring if that's.

1082
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
But it does fall back, though.

1083
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,680
That's kind of interesting.

1084
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,480
Oh, yeah, no, it's kind of like Flatpak.

1085
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,280
If you don't have a Flatpak theme for your current theme

1086
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,240
installed, it will fall back on whatever is available.

1087
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,000
And it'll always fall back to something.

1088
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,600
You won't ever end up with an unthemed, clear, transparent

1089
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,360
thing.

1090
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,200
I mean, that's reasonable, I suppose.

1091
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,960
Good defaults.

1092
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,840
Yeah.

1093
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
Now that I think about it.

1094
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,160
It's better to fall back on something that

1095
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,320
doesn't match than to fall back on something that doesn't exist.

1096
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,920
No kidding.

1097
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,560
It's just impossible to see.

1098
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,360
I'll take an ugly UI over a broken one.

1099
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,960
Yeah, at least one you can use, right?

1100
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,640
Well, and Adwaita isn't even ugly.

1101
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,280
I mean, it used to be a little, it needed some help

1102
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,760
at one point, but they've brought

1103
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,500
in some really good designers, and now it looks really good.

1104
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,120
So I mean, the pop theme now is actually basically just Adwaita

1105
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,480
with some colors changed around and stuff like that.

1106
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,280
It's very close, and that helps maintain the compatibility

1107
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,360
and stuff as well.

1108
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,400
Right, I would imagine the closer you can keep it

1109
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
upstream, the, well, I guess one way to put it,

1110
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
is easier your job is.

1111
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

1112
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,360
And that's another nice thing about it,

1113
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,500
is it makes doing the GTK4 port very easy,

1114
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,280
because I can just take the upstream Adwaita theme

1115
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,040
and apply our modifications onto it,

1116
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,680
and hopefully that translates over pretty nicely and stuff.

1117
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,720
How's that going so far?

1118
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,760
Pretty good.

1119
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,720
So I've been working on it now for a couple days,

1120
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,080
and there's pretty good progress.

1121
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,800
I'd say it's currently in a this is a usable pop theme right

1122
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,300
now.

1123
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,920
It looks more or less correct.

1124
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,600
There's some weird visual glitches

1125
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,680
working on check buttons right now, check boxes and stuff.

1126
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,120
I'm so glad someone is.

1127
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,080
Yeah, right?

1128
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,440
Somebody's got to do that.

1129
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,120
I imagine, too, that the transition to GNOME,

1130
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,280
or sorry, GNOME 40, must be on the back of your mind

1131
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,160
as well with this.

1132
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,280
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1133
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,200
They don't necessarily go hand in hand.

1134
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,320
More of the GTK4 stuff is more just

1135
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,680
to make sure that it's available for applications that

1136
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,840
use GTK4 as it stands.

1137
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,560
If you install a GTK4 application on pop today,

1138
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,680
you'll get an auto waita theme, and that's not

1139
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,440
the best situation from our perspective.

1140
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,940
Yeah, from a consistency standpoint.

1141
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,440
Right.

1142
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,320
So we're trying to make sure that for impish, that's

1143
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,880
not going to be a huge problem.

1144
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,560
And then with GNOME 40, people are probably

1145
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,360
aware that with 21.04, like Ubuntu,

1146
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,360
we sat out on the initial GNOME 40 release

1147
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,200
just to help make sure that everything got stabilized there.

1148
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,080
We've got our UX designer here works with the GNOME design

1149
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,680
team and stuff like that to help make sure everything's good.

1150
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,880
And she was basically just working

1151
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,220
with us as a liaison between us and the design team there.

1152
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:41,340
But we wanted to gain some feedback about GNOME 40

1153
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,640
and all that kind of stuff.

1154
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,080
So we held off on 338 for largely similar reasons

1155
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,880
that Ubuntu did.

1156
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,700
And as Ubuntu plans to move forward with,

1157
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,080
I think it's going to end up being 41 or 42, not GNOME 40

1158
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,520
because then they'd be behind.

1159
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,480
But we're working on moving that forward as well.

1160
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,920
And we have quite a bit of stuff that we

1161
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,440
have to work through on that.

1162
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,640
Obviously, we have Cosmic, which is our desktop shell extension

1163
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,120
stuff that does some relatively large scale

1164
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
tweaks to GNOME that are tailored more

1165
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,600
towards our specific user base, like different target markets,

1166
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,680
different products, that kind of thing.

1167
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,600
And we're working full steam ahead.

1168
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,120
I know that Ian Scott, one of our other developers,

1169
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:38,000
is doing a lot with porting Cosmic to GNOME 40.

1170
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,680
Jeremy's doing a lot of that kind of stuff.

1171
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,000
So we want to make sure that everything is set up

1172
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,920
and ready to go once we're ready to make the switch over

1173
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,200
and all that kind of stuff.

1174
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,240
So you're saying it's going to be a while until I

1175
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,160
have a pop OS based on Plasma.

1176
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,880
Yeah.

1177
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,720
It's just a dream of mine.

1178
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,760
Let's do it.

1179
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,600
Let's go.

1180
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,800
Easy for us to say, right?

1181
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,480
Yeah, very easy for you guys to say.

1182
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,400
The entire infrastructure is built on GNOME.

1183
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,160
I mean, Cosmic is a GNOME shell extension.

1184
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,600
So it seems like this is kind of a test of that model, right?

1185
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,440
Of you kind of doing the dance of, well,

1186
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,400
how much can we just lay on top in an easy way?

1187
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
And how much do we really have to keep up with the changes?

1188
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,360
Is this hard?

1189
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,040
Right, right.

1190
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,520
And luckily, with the extension model, it's not too bad.

1191
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,800
Most of it translates over pretty easily.

1192
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,680
And if there are problems, it doesn't cause the entire shell

1193
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,120
to just bug out and crash, especially going

1194
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,200
with the GNOME 40 stuff right now.

1195
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,080
Cosmic's in kind of a weird state,

1196
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,080
and stuff doesn't work right.

1197
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,240
But that's the nice thing about doing it that way,

1198
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,160
is the base OS is still usable, because it's just an extension.

1199
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,960
You just unload the extension, and it works fine.

1200
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,680
And then once you get the extension working,

1201
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,840
you can load up nicely, and everything works well there too.

1202
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,680
And nicely, if you don't like Cosmic,

1203
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,440
you can just disable the extensions,

1204
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,040
and you get a plain stock GNOME desktop.

1205
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,520
Can we talk a little bit about Cosmic?

1206
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,360
Absolutely.

1207
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,520
Why don't we just start with why Cosmic?

1208
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,200
So people might be aware that we, a couple releases ago now,

1209
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,800
we introduced PopShell, which was a tiling window manager

1210
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,160
extension.

1211
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,520
Basically, we wanted to kind of elaborate on that,

1212
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,000
and what we would kind of be going

1213
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,440
for if we were doing our own desktop shell from scratch.

1214
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,760
The extension framework in GNOME Shell

1215
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,840
allows us to experiment with that in a way

1216
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,320
that it saves development effort on our end,

1217
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,880
because we don't have an enormous team.

1218
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,280
We're adequately spread.

1219
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,240
We know what we can take on, and where we should probably

1220
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,720
try to, you know,

1221
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,760
Utilize upstream.

1222
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,560
Exactly, right.

1223
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,560
Don't reinvent the wheel when you don't have to.

1224
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,040
Right.

1225
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Utilize existing stuff when you can.

1226
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,160
And if there's something new that you

1227
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,600
want to do on top of that, build on top of it.

1228
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,480
Collaborative development is a, that's open source.

1229
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,760
That's the whole point.

1230
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,800
And so when looking at our customer base,

1231
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,840
and our pop OS user base, we wanted

1232
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,280
to make something that was tailored specifically

1233
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,640
for the kind of person that uses pop OS by default.

1234
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,880
And so we would look at, well, what's the kind of changes

1235
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,520
that people that run pop OS make?

1236
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,200
You know, what kind of things can we

1237
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,960
do from a UX perspective to help that type of user?

1238
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,560
And we found a couple of things that

1239
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,240
were different from the UX goals that GNOME has.

1240
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,880
And that's fine.

1241
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,480
It's just a different target market.

1242
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,960
But we wanted to tailor the experience with your desktop

1243
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,480
towards that specific type of user.

1244
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,000
And so we started working on Cosmic as a way

1245
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,280
to bring those changes about and help cater

1246
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,560
to that type of person who's curious about those sort

1247
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,240
of specific modifications that make their particular lives

1248
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,480
easier using their computer for the things they use it for.

1249
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,240
And is it also a bit about maybe being

1250
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,080
able to offer a set of consistency to your customers?

1251
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,640
Because the Upstream project can change pretty radically,

1252
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,840
as it did between 38 and 40.

1253
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,800
And there's sort of a layer of consistency

1254
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,640
if the shell they're using is Cosmic.

1255
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,280
I'm not sure that that's the primary goal.

1256
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,120
I mean, I think that you're definitely not

1257
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,640
going to see as big of a shift going from Cosmic on 338

1258
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,720
to Cosmic on GNOME 40 whatever, just because we're

1259
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,720
trying to maintain a certain set of Cosmic experiences.

1260
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,280
But at the same time, we don't necessarily

1261
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,080
want to hold people back on something if it's not as good.

1262
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:41,560
And if we find a radically different UX pattern that

1263
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,560
helps tremendously with usability or discoverability,

1264
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,920
something like that, we're not necessarily

1265
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,700
going to shy away from implementing that,

1266
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,040
even though that's a big change.

1267
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:51,920
And you might otherwise have more consistency

1268
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,600
going with the one Upstream to the next Upstream release.

1269
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,380
But I guess that could be a nice benefit

1270
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,000
for this particular release.

1271
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,680
It's going to smooth the transition from 338 to 40

1272
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,600
a little bit more.

1273
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,520
I would imagine, yeah.

1274
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:12,480
But it's not necessarily the end goal.

1275
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,140
We want to make the best experience.

1276
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,160
We don't necessarily want to make

1277
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,960
experiences that are stagnant or that stay the same.

1278
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,120
Consistency can be really good for UX and discoverability.

1279
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,240
But sometimes there's a pattern that works better.

1280
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,080
And we shouldn't be afraid to deviate from existing norms,

1281
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,840
because sometimes you want something better.

1282
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,160
And if you never change what you're at,

1283
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,920
you're never going to get anything better.

1284
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,760
Well said.

1285
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,160
Well, Ian, thank you for joining us.

1286
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,860
And also, thank you for hosting us here.

1287
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:41,800
This has been great.

1288
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,280
Absolutely.

1289
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,120
This is the first show I've done in weeks with ethernet.

1290
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,620
Yeah.

1291
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,120
So thank you.

1292
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,640
Oh, no.

1293
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,160
Yeah.

1294
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,880
Nice to have you guys.

1295
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,040
And always, always a pleasure.

1296
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,400
Cassidy, welcome back to the show.

1297
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,880
It's just been like a couple of days,

1298
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,560
it feels like, since we shared it last.

1299
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,140
Well, yeah, just one week, I guess, huh?

1300
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,240
How has the post-Elementary OS 6 release gone?

1301
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,960
It's gone well.

1302
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,720
It's been hard to like, I don't know what time is anymore.

1303
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,600
This last week, I've put in so much time just

1304
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,680
combing through social media and emails and issue reports.

1305
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,120
And it's fun when a new release comes out,

1306
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,400
because you get this flood.

1307
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,200
Yeah, I bet.

1308
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,160
Because it's just new and fresh and different.

1309
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,600
But then also, it's like, oh, my gosh, there's so much stuff

1310
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,360
to take in and address.

1311
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,880
It must be a lot to churn through, too,

1312
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,720
as you're actually trying to weigh out

1313
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,000
what's first impressions versus things that we really

1314
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,160
want to focus on later.

1315
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,660
Yeah.

1316
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,520
Yeah, and it's a huge flood of new users, too.

1317
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,320
So it's people who either have never used Elementary OS before

1318
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,680
or haven't used it for years, and they're coming back.

1319
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,360
And so then these are people who aren't,

1320
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,000
they don't know what issues have been filed already.

1321
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,120
So they're filing tons of duplicates.

1322
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,160
And we're doing our best to hold their hand

1323
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,200
to help them file in the right places and stuff.

1324
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,800
But inevitably, it's just like a flood.

1325
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,440
Noobs.

1326
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:57,840
Yeah.

1327
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,720
It's a good problem to have.

1328
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,880
It's a great problem to have.

1329
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm super proud that that is, on release day,

1330
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,600
we get all these people who email us.

1331
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,840
They reply to their receipt.

1332
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,680
So when you buy it on the website,

1333
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,080
you can reply to your receipt.

1334
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,160
So that's one of the little perks you get for paying.

1335
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,160
And we'll do our best to help you out or point you

1336
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,200
in the right direction.

1337
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,160
And so they'll be like, hey.

1338
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,080
So I discovered after purchasing this

1339
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,040
that it's based on this thing called Linux.

1340
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,880
And we're like, yes, you're the best.

1341
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,560
Wow, how do you suppose they found you?

1342
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,360
That's incredible.

1343
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,080
I don't know.

1344
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,720
We have articles in Ars Technica and stuff and Wired.

1345
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,560
So I think there's some of that.

1346
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,560
There's the tech enthusiast bubble that's like,

1347
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,040
Linux is a small bubble inside of that bubble.

1348
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,660
And so we're kind of leaking out into the more mainstream,

1349
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,280
I guess, which is always cool.

1350
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,040
I felt like I saw a lot more people in our Telegram channel

1351
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,000
talking about it and trying it out this release.

1352
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,360
It seemed like people were ready.

1353
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,960
And some of the stuff really resonated with them.

1354
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,160
Yeah, a lot of curiosity.

1355
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,400
And I think especially the Flatpaks speak

1356
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,320
to folks who maybe are experienced Linux users

1357
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,040
but haven't dabbled in elementary for a while.

1358
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,680
Yeah, yeah.

1359
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,120
And it's such a great, one of the biggest things

1360
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,520
we've heard as feedback is because we've decided to stick

1361
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,960
to the LTS basis because of the stability.

1362
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,800
People are like, oh, Ubuntu apps are outdated.

1363
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,520
So Flatpak kind of solves that.

1364
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,120
You've got your development libraries,

1365
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,680
which if you're doing web development,

1366
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,600
every web development library has

1367
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,680
you install their own package manager anyway.

1368
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,560
So you're not using the repo ones anyway.

1369
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,360
That's so true.

1370
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,600
It's something we don't talk about.

1371
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,920
Nobody acknowledges that, really.

1372
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:27,160
Yeah, it's like you've got every single programming language

1373
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,160
has its own packaging manager.

1374
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,680
So at that point, it doesn't really

1375
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,800
matter if those languages aren't totally up to date

1376
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,320
in the base.

1377
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,280
And then you've got your Flatpak apps on top.

1378
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,680
And so you've got a stable base and bleeding edge apps.

1379
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,360
And it's kind of a great world to be in.

1380
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,600
Yeah, with a nice, clean UI sitting on top of all of it.

1381
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,120
Yeah.

1382
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,960
Yeah, Wes and I, we gave it a go for Linux Action News.

1383
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,120
And we both walked away.

1384
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,920
We hadn't talked about it.

1385
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,560
And we both walked away from it going,

1386
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,800
this is like professional grade now.

1387
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,360
It's a professional workstation OS.

1388
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,200
With that combination that you just

1389
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,680
touched on with the base of LTS, but the freshness

1390
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,200
of the user land, and the cleanness of it,

1391
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,800
and also some of the work you guys did with notifications

1392
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,420
in the terminal, and that kind of stuff.

1393
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,680
It just makes all of that a little bit smoother.

1394
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,160
Yeah.

1395
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,600
Yeah, there's been lots and lots of new little quality

1396
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,080
of life features and things we've put into this release.

1397
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,320
So that's been really fun to get to that point

1398
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:11,920
where we can do that.

1399
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,760
We're going like, we know how to build an OS now.

1400
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,960
We've got the basics down.

1401
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,920
And now we can work on those quality of life things.

1402
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,440
Yeah.

1403
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,320
So have you been running it on your framework laptop?

1404
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,280
I have been running it on my framework laptop.

1405
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,040
Yeah, cat's out of the bag there.

1406
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,640
The framework's out, so I can talk about it now.

1407
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,280
I've been testing a, it's technically

1408
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,400
a pre-production model.

1409
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,440
So I can't share exact impressions

1410
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,360
of that specific fit and finish, but it's really cool.

1411
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,160
It's a really cool project, really cool product itself.

1412
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,680
Yeah, the hardware is way, it's super nice, super rigid.

1413
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,640
Fit and finish is really good.

1414
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,200
That's great.

1415
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,400
I have one major complaint, though.

1416
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,720
The screen resolution is wrong.

1417
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,160
OK, so remind me, I seem to recall

1418
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,880
it was like an interesting aspect ratio, right?

1419
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,160
It's 3 by 2, which is fine.

1420
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,640
I actually kind of really like that now.

1421
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,760
Yeah, I think I would too.

1422
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,200
I've seen people kind of whatever

1423
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,640
who are like die-hard fans of like the 16 by 10

1424
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,800
or like the 3 by 2 ratios.

1425
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,760
It's like, yeah, whatever.

1426
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,720
Like, OK, now I see it.

1427
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,720
I don't actually watch that much video on my laptop.

1428
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,440
I do a lot more coding and web browsing.

1429
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,600
I want some height.

1430
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,400
Yeah, it's actually, that's fine.

1431
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,000
No, the ratio's fine.

1432
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,760
The resolution is like 2,256 by 1,504 at 13 and 1 half inches,

1433
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,000
somewhere around there.

1434
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,920
So it's like native resolution, everything's tiny,

1435
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,240
way too small.

1436
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,160
2x scaling, everything's Fisher-Price giant,

1437
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,600
huge, chunky, chunky giant.

1438
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,560
1.5x scaling, if you've ever followed me on the internet,

1439
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,360
half pixels are a lie.

1440
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,740
They don't exist.

1441
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,200
Even if your software supports it, well, best case scenario,

1442
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,240
you have a one pixel line that's drawn by an app,

1443
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,900
and it has to decide if that's drawn over one pixel or two

1444
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,160
pixels, and it ends up being blurry.

1445
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,840
So by having a higher than 1x ratio, but not quite 2x,

1446
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,560
you end up actually with blurriness at the pixel level.

1447
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,200
So.

1448
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,920
This is the exact problem I have on my ThinkPad,

1449
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,760
and it drives me crazy.

1450
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,480
It's so, yeah.

1451
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,960
And like you can work, 1.5, like fractional scaling

1452
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,680
is a hardware workaround.

1453
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,240
And I understand that it has to exist for that reason,

1454
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:13,940
but it shouldn't.

1455
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,120
If you're making a new computer, you

1456
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,960
don't choose a resolution where you need fractional scaling.

1457
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,840
So that's my big downside on this laptop,

1458
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,300
but I've worked around it.

1459
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,340
Elementary OS doesn't natively support fractional scaling

1460
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,720
at this point, because we're on X,

1461
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,160
and there are some ways to do it, but it's kind of hacky.

1462
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,960
What we could possibly do is somebody

1463
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,080
could spin a framework image that includes some of the hacks,

1464
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,480
whatever, as out of the box and supported.

1465
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,960
Curious about those modules, though.

1466
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,920
I mean, as far as the OS thinks, they're just like USB C

1467
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,480
devices, right?

1468
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,120
Brilliant.

1469
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,600
I want to see everybody adopt the modules.

1470
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,280
Like, System76, if you're making a laptop,

1471
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,960
adopt those modules, because they're freaking brilliant.

1472
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,320
They're USB, I think they're USB 4, and it has four of them,

1473
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,480
and they're all full power.

1474
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,120
They all support the whole protocol.

1475
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,800
They all support the whole display input or output

1476
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,200
and power input and everything, fast charging.

1477
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,000
It's not like some of them are limited.

1478
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,840
You can put whatever.

1479
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,680
It's all mix and match.

1480
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,200
That's great.

1481
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,920
So the cards that I got, they just

1482
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,760
sent me were like a full size HDMI, just a USB C pass

1483
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,240
through, a mini SD card slot, which I think is interesting,

1484
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,880
and a, what was the last one?

1485
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,720
Oh, and a storage card, which I think

1486
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,400
is actually probably the most brilliant.

1487
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,920
It's just like a flash drive that

1488
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,040
embeds into your laptop.

1489
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,960
So it's a 250 gig flash storage that you can just pop out,

1490
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,160
and it has USB C on the end.

1491
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,800
So then you can plug it in your phone or any other computer.

1492
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,400
Wow.

1493
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,960
And that part, I was like, I've probably

1494
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,920
used that one the most, because I'm like, oh.

1495
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,400
I hadn't even thought about the phone thing.

1496
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,760
Yeah, or I've used the HDMI one to plug into another laptop

1497
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,040
to get an extra HDMI output, because it's over USB C.

1498
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,600
So it's like a display port, whatever.

1499
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,800
So it's like dongles, but built in.

1500
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,160
As stupid as that sounds, it's kind of brilliant.

1501
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,080
If you're going to do the dongle life, that's the way to do it.

1502
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,960
That's just really embracing.

1503
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,520
Wow.

1504
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,800
I never thought about using them on other systems like that.

1505
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,480
That is great.

1506
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,920
So now I always have these four USB C dongles, basically,

1507
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,720
with me, because they're built into my laptop.

1508
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,920
But I can plug them into other devices.

1509
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,280
I mean, just today, Ryan, we're scrambling here at System76

1510
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,480
to try to figure out recording.

1511
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,080
And we had to figure out some dongles

1512
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,080
to get hardwired ethernet.

1513
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,520
Yeah, they talked about doing one ethernet.

1514
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,960
It's thin enough they'd have to do the flip down door thing.

1515
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,320
But that's why, if you don't need ethernet,

1516
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,280
you don't buy that card.

1517
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,520
If you need ethernet, you can build it into your laptop.

1518
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,520
I think it's so smart.

1519
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,240
I just want to see a laptop with six of these.

1520
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,600
Just give me six freaking full-powered ports,

1521
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,880
and I can put whatever ports I want in them.

1522
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,040
And half of them will probably be USB 3.0 for me.

1523
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,320
But when I want to swap in whatever port, I can have it.

1524
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,160
So rumor has it Westpane may eventually receive one.

1525
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,720
It's sort of bad timing, because he's on the trip right now

1526
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,200
when they would be shipping it to him.

1527
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,520
Yeah, it's a little dicey receiving the package.

1528
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,080
We'll see.

1529
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,360
We'll see.

1530
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,600
But I can't wait to hear more people's thoughts on it.

1531
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,980
I was concerned that this was kind of like a Kickstarter

1532
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,640
scammy kind of thing, although it felt pretty legit.

1533
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,520
But I was just a little concerned.

1534
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,720
It felt like it came out of nowhere in some sense.

1535
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,720
Now, if you follow the people behind the project,

1536
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,040
you realize they've been doing some of these things

1537
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,800
for a long time.

1538
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,120
But just being a layperson, it was like,

1539
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,600
these are lofty goals.

1540
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,720
You're really trying hard.

1541
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,160
And you're trying to speak my language.

1542
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,360
Who can do this?

1543
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,200
And we've seen other companies that

1544
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,620
are bigger and well-known do similar things.

1545
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,240
There's the whole Project Aria, or whatever

1546
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,800
it was, at the modular phone.

1547
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,080
Motorola did their Motorola phone mods.

1548
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,000
And these are big companies.

1549
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,200
Because I think the Aria was Google, I think.

1550
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,400
But these are big companies who have

1551
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,780
tried this whole modular approach,

1552
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,600
and it basically never panned out.

1553
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,280
And I think if they would have said,

1554
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,840
oh, the CPU itself is on its own modular platform,

1555
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,080
I'd be like, yeah, that's probably not going to pan out.

1556
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,780
But even just the expansion cards,

1557
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:55,040
and then being able to easily access

1558
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,480
the RAM, and Wi-Fi, and storage, and stuff,

1559
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,480
and making the physical design of the hardware

1560
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,480
super easy to open with captive screws and magnets,

1561
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,720
there's a lot of smart decisions that even if they went,

1562
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,280
like, upside down today, this laptop is still useful.

1563
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,200
You could still upgrade it over the years.

1564
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,280
And I think that's really cool and important, too.

1565
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,480
Cassidy, thank you, sir.

1566
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,280
Yeah.

1567
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,740
Carl, welcome back to the show.

1568
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:22,280
It feels like it's been a couple of years since we've talked.

1569
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,960
It's been way too long, that's for sure.

1570
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,520
It has.

1571
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,160
And the last time I was here, there

1572
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,680
was not nearly as many people or things.

1573
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,920
Where are you fitting everything?

1574
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,560
It's changed.

1575
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,000
Well, we're not.

1576
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,720
That's the thing.

1577
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,320
So I think it's changed a lot since, well,

1578
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,760
but since you were here.

1579
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,440
Yeah, we were both back here.

1580
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,560
The Thaleo launch, I think?

1581
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,560
2018 fall.

1582
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,040
Yeah.

1583
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,960
Wow, really?

1584
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,720
Yeah, so time is moving at a different rate now, isn't it?

1585
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,160
It's kind of confusing.

1586
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,400
I think of things now with pre-COVID, COVID spike one,

1587
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,000
things are going to be great, COVID spike two.

1588
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,760
Yeah.

1589
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,320
That's how I measure where I am in time.

1590
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,440
And we still don't even really know quite if we're, well,

1591
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,440
we're not through it yet.

1592
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,400
So we still don't really know where it's going.

1593
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,840
Has that impacted the business pretty significantly?

1594
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,040
It did.

1595
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,760
The one thing I could say is I was really

1596
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,600
proud of our entire team for how we adapted so quickly to it.

1597
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,720
We were pretty used to the engineering way

1598
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,800
of communicating through Slack and GitHub

1599
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,400
and those type of things.

1600
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,020
And so by the time we all moved to our homes to work,

1601
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,120
we realized we weren't actually talking to each other in person

1602
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,600
anyway.

1603
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,800
You're already using the tools.

1604
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,300
Right.

1605
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,040
Right.

1606
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,200
So we were building stuff that way anyway,

1607
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,960
even though we were much closer together.

1608
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,420
There are things we missed about it,

1609
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:39,640
but some teams really thrive remotely.

1610
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,720
The product engineering team is just doing fantastic.

1611
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,680
Then we learned that the technical support team,

1612
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,180
who I thought this whole time really

1613
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,480
needed to be very close to the lab,

1614
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,400
could actually thrive working remote

1615
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,560
if they had support from the QA team who had lab.

1616
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,840
So that ended up working really well.

1617
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,840
And so we learned a lot as a company because we

1618
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,200
used to hire people, and everyone

1619
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,200
had to come to Colorado.

1620
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,400
And then we started just hiring anywhere in the United States.

1621
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,520
And all of a sudden, it was a lot faster

1622
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,480
to hire, a lot easier.

1623
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,920
A lot more people to choose from.

1624
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,880
A lot more people, right.

1625
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,800
So that's a change that's going to stay, you think?

1626
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,320
Certainly.

1627
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:14,880
Yeah.

1628
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,520
Wow.

1629
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,680
That is a big change for you.

1630
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,000
Yeah, we found that we, in many respects,

1631
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,360
were operating faster and better.

1632
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,520
It took some time to get used to.

1633
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,520
Things like Thaleo Mega, it was on the cusp of being released.

1634
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,600
And then we all went home and figuring

1635
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,960
how to design a hardware product remote

1636
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,920
was really challenging.

1637
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,520
That's what stands out to me here is, right,

1638
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,160
you've kind of got different sides of your business.

1639
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,560
Sure, you've got customer support.

1640
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,040
You've got the more traditional software side of the house.

1641
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,000
But then you're building physical hardware here.

1642
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,160
How do you make that work?

1643
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,560
Well, I can tell you the beginning was very frightening

1644
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,560
because we thought they were going to shut us down and send

1645
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,520
us home, right?

1646
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,760
I mean, all these businesses were being closed.

1647
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,160
So that's a frightening prospect to face.

1648
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,960
And then we learned that we were considered essential

1649
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,920
because with work from home, computers

1650
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,400
were necessary to support that.

1651
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,000
And so then it meant all the mitigation factors

1652
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,800
to make it possible for us to be a safe place

1653
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,120
to work during a pandemic.

1654
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Right, boy.

1655
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,040
So all the deaths were spread far apart.

1656
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,760
Everyone was in masks for over a year.

1657
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,800
And then finally, the vaccines came along.

1658
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,480
And everyone at the factory got vaccinated.

1659
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,760
And then the CDC said you could take your mask off.

1660
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,560
And all of a sudden, I saw these people

1661
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,140
that we had been hired and I've been working with for a year

1662
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,840
for the first time.

1663
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,160
Wow.

1664
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,960
Because I never actually had seen their faces.

1665
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,680
And it was liberating.

1666
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,960
What an experience.

1667
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,120
What a unique, you're going to remember that experience

1668
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,320
probably forever.

1669
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,640
Striking, yeah.

1670
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,680
And amongst all of this, too, there's

1671
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,480
the launch of the launch keyboard.

1672
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,000
Right.

1673
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,200
How did that get impacted by all of that?

1674
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,320
Everything slowed down.

1675
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,520
So that was the first part was, at least in the beginning.

1676
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,400
And then it began to accelerate again.

1677
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,200
And like everything in business, everything

1678
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,800
costs more and takes longer than you expect.

1679
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,440
And the supply shortages must have been horrible.

1680
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,840
Or probably still are, right?

1681
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,280
Yeah, I have a horror story for the launch for that one.

1682
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,360
So when we were ready to launch the product,

1683
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:21,280
we started with 500 because we didn't know what the sales were

1684
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:21,800
going to be.

1685
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,200
And we thought that we sold keyboards before,

1686
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,240
but we knew it wasn't a reflection of this product

1687
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,160
that we were building.

1688
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,160
It was something very different.

1689
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,040
But we didn't know quite what it would be.

1690
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,560
And 500, with our old thing that was just

1691
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,200
there for convenience with purchasing a computer,

1692
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,240
was it would be a hefty sales for us.

1693
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,480
And then we sold it, and then they were all gone in a day.

1694
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,360
Wow.

1695
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,360
And then so we needed to order more PCBs.

1696
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,720
We needed to increase our production.

1697
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,520
We went to order the PCBs, and one of the controllers

1698
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,760
was out of stock.

1699
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,440
So then we did the electrical engineering.

1700
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,520
Jeremy and Darrell worked on that

1701
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,560
and made the modifications within a day.

1702
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,560
Looked at the spec sheets so that it would work.

1703
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,520
We went to do validation.

1704
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:10,680
We went to order them.

1705
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,320
Another part was out.

1706
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,320
We had to do it again.

1707
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,560
So we reworked the, this time it was a more important component

1708
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:20,280
that required FCC and CE certification again.

1709
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,000
Oh, wow.

1710
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,360
So I mean, this isn't a small tweak.

1711
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,160
You're redesigning it to some extent.

1712
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,800
That's such a serious decision, too.

1713
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,080
Yeah, they're not dropping it.

1714
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,160
This was the USB controller.

1715
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,800
It's not just another drop in there.

1716
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,760
Some of the traces needed to be moved, and modifications made.

1717
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,140
We had to do a new certification.

1718
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,800
We also had to do new validation.

1719
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,840
So that was the struggle.

1720
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,560
And so what we started doing, which

1721
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,240
I think is natural for a lot of companies,

1722
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,880
is we started hoarding parts.

1723
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,240
So we don't know what our sales are going to be.

1724
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,880
We know what it is already, but now we're

1725
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,920
telling people it's going to be a couple of months for us

1726
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,500
to catch up.

1727
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,760
And so we had to.

1728
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,200
So we started just buying lots and lots of parts.

1729
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,560
When you could get it, you got it.

1730
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,240
Yeah, and no one wants to operate that way.

1731
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,360
But now I'm thinking, we're doing this because we

1732
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,080
want to secure our supply.

1733
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,560
But at the same time, we're part of the problem,

1734
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,680
just like all of us.

1735
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,840
Adding more stress to the system.

1736
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,000
Right, we're adding more stress because we're

1737
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,780
buying more parts.

1738
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:15,120
But I don't know any way around it other than to do our best

1739
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,640
to take care of our customers by buying those parts.

1740
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,320
Yeah, it seems like I bet just about everybody

1741
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,480
is in that position.

1742
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,000
Right.

1743
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,520
And so it sort of, in a way, elongates the problem,

1744
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,960
but there's no choice around it.

1745
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,440
You're right.

1746
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:27,960
Yeah.

1747
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,720
Man.

1748
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,360
It's tricky.

1749
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,920
We hold ourselves as high ethical and moral grounds,

1750
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,440
even with our partners, and think about these things

1751
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,880
and our impact on the supply chain.

1752
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,800
And it's the Wild West today.

1753
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,400
So how much of a skill up was it to manufacture a keyboard?

1754
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,120
Because I took a quick tour out there,

1755
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,200
and it looks like that keyboard literally

1756
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,800
starts as a block of aluminum.

1757
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,680
It is, right.

1758
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,600
It is simply a block of aluminum that gets milled

1759
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,840
into its shape, sandblasted, and painted, and parts.

1760
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,280
That's a lot of equipment.

1761
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:02,840
Yeah.

1762
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,880
And we also don't have nearly the capacity we need either.

1763
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,520
So we bought another half million in equipment

1764
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,640
that's coming in in the next few weeks,

1765
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,960
just to ramp up production for launch itself.

1766
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,760
Where is it going to go?

1767
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,200
You'll see tomorrow.

1768
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:19,960
All right.

1769
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,800
Wow.

1770
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:21,000
Yeah.

1771
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,560
I mean, I actually want to buy another launch keyboard.

1772
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:23,680
So you better get that ramped up.

1773
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,360
Yeah.

1774
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,240
We're getting there.

1775
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,560
I think our goal is to get there for the Christmas season.

1776
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:33,320
So mid to late October, we want to be in front of sales.

1777
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,360
Right now, we're shipping.

1778
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,120
It's mid-August.

1779
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,400
We'll be able to ship by the end of September.

1780
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,880
I think we can get ahead of sales by mid to late October.

1781
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,400
Sure.

1782
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,400
The number one thing, I know you hear it, is, well, it's so expensive.

1783
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,680
I don't actually necessarily agree with that characterization,

1784
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,880
because depending when you get into certain markets,

1785
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,200
like headphones and keyboards, you can spend a lot of money.

1786
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:59,720
Is there a long-term System76 roadmap where a $100 launch is on that roadmap?

1787
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,880
No.

1788
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,880
Just can't build a keyboard good enough?

1789
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,360
There is a roadmap for launch.

1790
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,920
It just doesn't go down to $100.

1791
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,280
I don't think that we can build a product that we would be

1792
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:15,560
proud of that fits with the design and the characteristics of launch itself.

1793
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,560
We don't want the quality to be any lower.

1794
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,600
So there are things that we can do to bring the price down for another model.

1795
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,120
So the launch roadmap includes a model that's going to have a 10-key numpad.

1796
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:31,240
So that'll be coming, I think, both of these are probably first half next year.

1797
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,120
So a 10-key, well, we've got to get a production up and running.

1798
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,160
And caught up.

1799
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:41,200
But the 10-key, and then another smaller, I believe it's 67-key,

1800
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,800
which is going to remove the F row.

1801
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,080
So you'd hit the function row underneath the function key with 1, 2, 3, and so forth.

1802
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,480
So an even smaller footprint.

1803
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,000
Right, an even smaller one.

1804
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,560
So that cuts out a bunch of switches.

1805
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,320
We're also going to remove the hub from that.

1806
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,240
And my hope is we can get that to $199.

1807
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,280
So yeah, the idea would be to be able to reach more customers that

1808
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,600
need more things and a couple different price points.

1809
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:02,840
Right.

1810
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,400
Sounds like it might be a model I'd want to throw in my backpack to take with me,

1811
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,900
too.

1812
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:06,400
Yeah.

1813
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,760
Yeah, that's OK.

1814
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,080
I could really see that.

1815
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,440
That's pretty great.

1816
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,780
Now, along with all of this, everything we've been talking about,

1817
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,720
we've talked about equipment, and we talked about some hiring.

1818
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,280
You can use rough terms if you like.

1819
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,800
But how big are we looking now for the team size of System76?

1820
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,440
I think we have 63 employees.

1821
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,520
Wow.

1822
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,520
Wow.

1823
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,800
Did you ever think?

1824
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,560
Did you hope?

1825
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,560
I don't know.

1826
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,600
The thing about making something like this is that you're so heads

1827
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,640
down all the time that they don't think about it much.

1828
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,240
You're just solving problems.

1829
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:46,400
We do, we think long term, but the people that you're adding

1830
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,520
just feel like a natural extension of this body we've made.

1831
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,920
It's a lot harder to communicate with 60 people than it is a dozen, though.

1832
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,720
Like that has a lot of challenges associated with that kind of growth.

1833
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,840
It does.

1834
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,680
But I think what's interesting is the team leaders and most of the teams

1835
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,400
have been here for a long time.

1836
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:05,920
Right.

1837
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,040
And so we were all the people that were part of that first 12

1838
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,240
that built the ethos and the character and the voice

1839
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,560
and culture of this company.

1840
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,080
And so I was actually just having a conversation earlier today

1841
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,480
about this, funny enough.

1842
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,760
We had a new director of marketing start.

1843
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,240
And she said, you know, I've been all these different places,

1844
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,080
and this place, everyone knows why they're here and what they're doing.

1845
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,360
And to me, that sounded strange that it's abnormal.

1846
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,840
Should just always be that way.

1847
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,560
It is not.

1848
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,060
It is.

1849
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:34,560
Right.

1850
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,600
And I didn't add, thinking on it more, I

1851
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,600
think it's because we have that core group that we, instead of,

1852
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,600
I don't get up and do speeches or any of the things like that.

1853
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,520
I don't talk in Slack about our mission.

1854
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,600
I think we all just know it.

1855
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,320
And it's in part because the leadership team,

1856
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,800
we've been together so long that it just flows to the people that

1857
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,960
are growing the company.

1858
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,440
You're on the same page anyway.

1859
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,400
That's an interesting observation.

1860
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,880
And I would concur.

1861
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,560
From my perspective, I come back every couple of years,

1862
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,520
and a lot of the core team members are still here.

1863
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,240
And it's like catching up with old friends.

1864
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,940
And that's not true for other places I go.

1865
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,800
Usually, it's a new set of faces.

1866
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,200
Maybe one or two people are still there.

1867
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,400
And I will also say that when we're out in private,

1868
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,080
everybody always speaks very highly of you.

1869
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:26,400
So you've been able to foster, I don't know if loyalty is the right word,

1870
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,080
but people genuinely seem to care, and they respect you,

1871
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,840
and they bought into what is happening here.

1872
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,240
And that seems unusually rare to me.

1873
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,040
We're the same people sitting here in this booth

1874
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,000
that we are when we're having beers afterwards together.

1875
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,600
And that goes for our natural state is openness.

1876
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Well, it also means you have had to adapt to accommodate some characters, too.

1877
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:54,440
Everybody here really feels like they're unique individuals that are not trying

1878
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,240
to fit into some corporate mold.

1879
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,920
People are fully expressing themselves and their individuality.

1880
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,760
And I could see that being tricky to accommodate sometimes.

1881
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,720
I think that's right, except when you have people that are securing themselves.

1882
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:12,200
So what ends up happening is you have a group of a team of smart people

1883
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,120
that are both are secure in both their job and what they're doing

1884
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,960
and their understanding of things.

1885
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,440
And their place in the whole mission.

1886
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,880
Right, to the extent that no idea is scary.

1887
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,200
You will just simply recognize a better idea

1888
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:30,520
because you understand what you're doing and what we're doing as a team.

1889
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,160
So there's not a lot of, well, we might debate and talk through things.

1890
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,480
It's frictionless and kind of it just flows organically.

1891
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,240
There's not a bunch of politics or second guessing or posturing,

1892
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,400
like you just kind of all, it seems like you guys trust each other.

1893
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:44,920
Right.

1894
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,880
Now, the question is, as the company grows, can that be maintained?

1895
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,080
Do you feel like it can?

1896
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:53,720
So far, we've been able to do that.

1897
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,360
I don't see, I think about how we'll do that.

1898
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,680
And we are hiring an HR manager with the idea

1899
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,000
that that role is going to help onboard people with the culture

1900
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,080
and the style and the way we work.

1901
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,000
So I guess we are growing up a little bit.

1902
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:11,360
Yeah.

1903
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:12,360
Thinking about those things.

1904
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,520
Make it a little bit of a process to make sure people are on board

1905
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,080
and all of that.

1906
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,480
That kind of makes sense as you grow, though.

1907
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,880
Well, Carl, it's been great to catch up.

1908
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:18,840
Thanks for joining us.

1909
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,360
Thanks for having me.

1910
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,640
Well, that'll do it for this very special episode.

1911
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,560
But if you do the Twitter thing, you can follow the show at Linux Unplugged.

1912
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,640
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

1913
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,360
I'm at Wes Payne, and you're at Chris LAS.

1914
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,880
And I have to say, there's a whole bunch of other podcasts

1915
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,720
you heard from Alex, our self-hosted co-host.

1916
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,480
There's Coda Radio over there.

1917
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,680
And if you're not catching Linux Action News,

1918
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,000
you're missing out on what's going on in the world of Linux

1919
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,040
in terms of how it impacts the industry and your daily life.

1920
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,280
LinuxActionNews.com.

1921
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:50,920
Go get that.

1922
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,160
All of it's over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1923
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,520
As for this year's show, yeah, we'll be live next week.

1924
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,880
We'd love to have you join us.

1925
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,200
See you next week.

1926
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,720
Same bat time, same bat station.

1927
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,240
But as for now, we are all done.

1928
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,480
Thank you so much for tuning this special episode of the Unplugged program.

1929
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,200
Thank you to everybody who's reached out with messages of support

1930
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,200
for this road trip or listeners who had a chance to do a micro meetup with us.

1931
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,480
Those have been so much fun, more intimate settings.

1932
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,120
We did a diner in Cheyenne recently.

1933
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,200
It was great.

1934
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,320
Now I have spots to go visit when I return to these places as well.

1935
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,920
But the trip does continue.

1936
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,080
You can follow us at ColonyTracker.live.

1937
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,080
And then don't forget about that meetup.

1938
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,120
If you're in the Denver area, it's this Friday

1939
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,880
as we record at 4 PM to start trickling in after that

1940
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,240
and come hang out with us.

1941
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,120
But that does wrap up this edition of the Unplugged program.

1942
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,000
Thank you, everyone, so much for tuning in.

1943
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,800
And we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1944
01:09:41,800 --> 01:10:11,280
Signing off.

1945
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,280
You
