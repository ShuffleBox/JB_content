1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
I got a rumor you guys ready for a little for a little hardware rumor

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,120
Totally I bet Pope he's not here because he knows and he doesn't want to get cornered on it

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,420
But rumor has it that you may the you know, the big guy Chinese phone manufacturers plan to release a svelte

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
laptop that runs Linux

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,640
Manifest manufacturing sources speaking to the tiny site DigiTimes which has by the way a horrible track record just in my personal opinion

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,920
says that the company is developing a 15-inch notebook with partners in the tech who also makes notebooks for HP Acer and Toshiba and

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,920
Foxconn where the manufacturing happens for Apple's iPhones iPads and the PlayStation and

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,780
Xbox and Nintendo the I'm a laptop or probably feature a high price performance ratio and the target retail price of around

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,240
470 US greenbacks

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,800
Yeah, I may make some good stuff. They're often known as an Apple ripoff. Are you familiar with their stuff?

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,680
Yes, I've enviously looked at some of theirs. Yeah, I might achieve Android phone. That looks pretty this would be running not Android

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,160
This would be running Linux. Yes, this would be even better

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,280
Yeah, this would this would be full-on and you wouldn't have to worry about installing Linux

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,000
I've never installed you know slash Linux because it would come pre-installed with it. That's awesome

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,480
Yeah, now it could be a hoax though

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
They have had it they have had a hoax in the past

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,360
But I don't know anybody the mumbo-jumbo you guys would anybody check this out if you had a sub $500 nice looking laptop from Yao

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,800
May now it's not gonna be like a super freedom respecting

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,600
It's probably gonna be something that's more similar to a Chromebook

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,320
Anybody in the mobile room jumping on it? I might give it a thought what distro is it going to be running?

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,400
Well, the rumor is a custom version of Linux

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,120
Yeah, exactly, but they say DigiTimes is not always as they point out on OMG Ubuntu not always that reliable I agree I

23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:50,560
Agree, but it could make sense. It could go into a nice lineup of products. So actually I

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,920
Could see it. I could see this really happening

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,520
You know

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,360
It doesn't seem like a big jump if you're making cell phones to go into a portable laptop market that maybe includes a data chip

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,720
A decent CPU you can install, you know, maybe your own version of Linux on there. This could be kind of a neat thing

28
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,760
Exciting to see a new hardware manufacturer at least. Yeah, or you know what? Here's a way. I got another tip for you

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,160
This is this is your pro tip. You ready for this? I got pro tips

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,520
Actually, let me think about this. Maybe we should save this for the show because this is good. This is really good

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Maybe we'll save it in the show

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,800
Now let's talk about it. Now. Let's talk about it right now. So did you guys see did you guys see that the Linux foundation?

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Is a giving away Chromebooks?

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,560
The Linux foundation is giving away Chromebooks when you sign up for some classes. So here I'm gonna here

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,080
Here's the detail. This is from from our buddy over at IT world a swamp swamp Lee. How do you how do you say his name?

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,360
I met him at Linux con nice guy nice guy. He took a selfie with his huge nexus 6 and

37
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,800
Now he's using an iPhone 5s as it to test Android where so Linux foundation is giving away

38
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Chromebooks when you enroll in a training course in the month of September

39
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,720
What do you think about this the Linux foundation giving away Chromebooks? Interesting

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, that's a bummer. I've only just enrolled for a course in like the 30th of August

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,320
Well, I wouldn't be does it make you uncomfortable to give me away Chromebooks as I seem perfectly fine

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Well, I'm not surprised because

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,800
The course that I've enrolled for says that in order to do the course where you have to be running chromium or Google Chrome

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Oh, really? Oh, really? Huh? I at first my first gut reaction was like

45
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,000
I wasn't super comfortable because this doesn't feel like real Linux

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,800
But here's here's what made me sort of change my tune. I feel a little bit better when I read this

47
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,360
Jim the Jim Zimlin. He's the executive director of the Linux foundation

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,080
He said we want students of Linux to experience a Linux desktop and Chromebooks are a great way to do that

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
Either through Google's Linux based OS or by investing in a Linux based OS

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,240
Either through Google's Linux based OS or by installing one of the many Linux distros available

51
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,360
Alright, that's not bad. He says we hope this offer can provide freedom

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,040
The freedom Linux developers and IT professionals value and spark new ideas and discoveries as they embark on our Linux training program

53
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,720
So he's right there saying in the announcement that they're pretty much

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay, if you'd wipe Chrome OS off there and put any Linux distro on there and that I'm all about and by the way

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,040
They're not bad Chromebooks. They look like they're these these Dell Chromebooks that we've talked about in the past

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, the I don't the Dell Chromebook 11 the 299 Chromebook features one or probably an 11.6 inch display

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,480
1.4 gigahertz processor and 4 gigabytes 4 gigabytes of RAM

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,520
So there you go. That's not a bad giveaway

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,560
No, it could be pretty fun for people get it to play with as they're learning Linux

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,960
Yeah, absolutely

61
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,240
That could be a great way for people to get their start and it's not a big investment for them to see that's actually really

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,200
Clever because if it's not a huge expense

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,280
Then maybe you're not so worried about trying out and seeing how things go and if things don't go well well

64
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,000
It was a Chromebook you got for free

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,860
You don't mind if you erase your hard drive a couple times while you're installing it

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,400
This is Linux unplugged episode 108 for September 1st

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
2015

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,480
You

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,600
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's learning how to dump its black tank. Oh

70
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,480
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey Wes. Hey, guess what big show today, Wes

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,240
I know I know surprise surprise surprise that so I had I had been I've been pondering this question

72
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,920
I realized maybe I actually have the best group to possibly ask it to because I need to get an international

73
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,600
perspective on this one, so we're gonna bring in our virtual lug on one of our

74
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,160
Quandaries top law for enforcement officials in the US want backdoors into all types of encryption technology

75
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,280
This is something that's been they've been debating since early in the year and it's picking up a lot of steam

76
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,560
What would the ramifications be for open source?

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,540
Especially code that's developed outside the US if the US were to make this the land of the law

78
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,380
What responsibilities does open source have distro makers and things like that?

79
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,780
So I want to talk about that and just pontificate on the subject also some details on the upcoming roadshow

80
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,220
Kubuntu's new look and saying goodbye

81
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,600
To an old friend plus we have some really awesome go powered retro feedback coming up in today's episode

82
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,040
So since that's so much to get into no more delaying is is allowed

83
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:25,360
I say we bring in that virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

84
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,580
Hello, it's good. It's good to have you all here. Yes. Good evening. Hello all so let's start with a little follow-up

85
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,680
I I know some of us may have seen that Kubuntu

86
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,980
Has a brand new look they have a brand new look for a brand new well for a brand new season

87
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,620
I guess it's fall after all it's becoming fall and I want West your first takes on Kubuntu

88
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,020
Dot orgs brand new look one of the big stories today going around. What do you think nice and clean? Yeah?

89
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,820
I don't like it. No. I like I think it represents plasma 5 pretty well

90
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,020
Oh, yeah, it does actually front and center represents some really nice aspects of the haven't used it too much

91
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,980
So the usability that's a separate question, but it's at least visually appealing

92
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:09,260
Yeah, it really does kind of highlight some of the nice things like here's the productivity suite and the multimedia playback good point

93
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,380
Yeah, it does draw a lot of us make me want to use Kubuntu

94
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,900
And it does yeah, you know it's really nice

95
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:21,180
Not in your face and like a yeah like a big windows way and like if you're wondering like how do I do media playback?

96
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,220
They have a button right there that we show you that

97
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,300
I've actually heard some grumbling about it, but when I look at it myself

98
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,260
I'm pretty impressed. I like how they've broken out long-term

99
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,620
They also make it really clear of here on which one is the latest instead of release on their download page

100
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,580
And then the the page I haven't looked at yet is their community one. Oh, yeah, there we go

101
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,620
They got a way they got a web chat set up right here. I don't know

102
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,500
I think it's pretty nice anybody in the mumble room have any reactions the new kabuntu org

103
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,940
It's okay. It's

104
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,180
Like I'm on the full desktop, so I don't have windows full screen all the time

105
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,300
So when it's not you got the when your browser like half the screen

106
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,460
It's pretty much hamburger menu and icons are fairly large even on the 1080p desktop

107
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,700
So I still think it needs some work

108
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,740
Chai room thinks it should be kde.org. I kind of agree. This would be a great kde.org site. Yeah, definitely

109
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,220
Should help out. Well, I just props to those guys

110
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,940
It looks like a lot of work and effort went into that if anybody else has comments going once

111
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,100
Oh, did you just shrink it down and see what he's saying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's not great

112
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,540
They should work on their mobile design, but it does work though when you shrink it down at least

113
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,120
I mean definitely I can grab the download right here. Yeah

114
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,940
Well, it does look like they just bought a theme. So I mean looks like they'll need some tweaking after that

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,280
Yeah, maybe that's the case. Maybe that's the case

116
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,600
All right

117
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,120
I I wanted to just note because we've been following this story and unplugged now for a little while another death in

118
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,520
Flash is caught another nail and thought flashes death coffin. Is that is that the right turn of phrase?

119
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,520
He'll in the coffin. Yep. Yeah, something like that. Something like is dying. That's important. Yeah, that is the important

120
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,960
That is the thing to pull from that and I think this is a big one because Chrome is gonna block like those obnoxious

121
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,320
Like flashing ads and then one of them in one of the next updates

122
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,560
This is huge for us Linux users because this begins to finally die off

123
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,760
And then what I'm looking forward to is eventually somebody's gonna have to come up with a really good solution for live streaming in HTML 5

124
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,880
Hopefully this will put more pressure in that wouldn't be are you skeptical?

125
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,480
Well, it was just that it was last week or the week before that there was this big brouhaha about Hulu

126
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Not that I can use it, but Hulu has switched to flash. Is that right?

127
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,520
So Hulu switch to flash what were they before

128
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,600
Did they switch or have they always been flashed but they were I saw a load

129
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Maybe from Silverlight or something, huh?

130
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Maybe maybe pardon there

131
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,640
Yeah, and then

132
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
over here

133
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,320
I've got Amazon Prime

134
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:04,720
Yeah, so prime I've now got access to prime music because that's just arrived a couple of weeks ago

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,160
and prime instant video and the only way I can access those services on Linux is with with flash so

136
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,480
There's still some sort of premium content

137
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,960
Providers out there using flash. So I'm bring it where heralded heralding in flashes death

138
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,720
prematurely

139
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,840
To me, it's like the slow end of a distribution, right? We're getting there. I think eventually I

140
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Don't know about right now. I mean

141
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah, you're right wimpy I think it's it's years off isn't it because

142
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,520
hmm

143
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,440
Yeah, cuz Google itself distributes quite a bit of ads over flash. I

144
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,880
Flash is gonna end up dying the death of XP

145
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,600
Yeah, is that is that we in the in the sense that like it gets relegated to like a whole bunch of people are still using

146
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,480
It kind of thing or what do you mean there?

147
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,720
Like just it drags on forever before it actually gets, you know put away

148
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,440
The same sort of things where you need XP for that one piece of hardware. Yeah, but your business can't upgrade

149
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,720
That's what happens to flash. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I could see it. Yeah, I don't actually I know I

150
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,200
People you guys are such a bunch of pessimists

151
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,640
I think this is actually starting to happen though to a degree and you guys are every charm is like, come on

152
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,120
No, come on. This is act when you have auto pause happening you have I don't know

153
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,120
I think this is actually people are starting to finally turn the tide. I think this is really happening plus

154
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,160
I think at the same time this is happening where I think it's gonna be a big deal that well, maybe not

155
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:37,400
We'll see but a lot of iOS devices starting in the fall are gonna automatically start blocking ads Safari on iOS 9 is coming

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
with a built-in ad blocker

157
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:45,480
You combine that with the auto pausing of flash ads and online advertising is about to take a big hit. I

158
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,480
Mean display ads. Yeah, definitely. That'll be interesting

159
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,160
Do we know anything about how Google decides what the main content is versus?

160
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,120
Well, yeah a little bit. So, you know what Google is doing is they're looking at ads that loop fast

161
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,080
So if you have like a very short video play loop loop loop loop loop loop

162
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,820
It'll it'll count that after a certain amount and then it will detect that and then pause it

163
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,440
and you can go to advanced settings and select the content settings for privacy and then you can deselect and

164
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,040
Say deselect and run important plug-in content or something like that is the wording. I can't quite remember it

165
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,440
But yeah, got it. Oh here. I think they specified actually here's the link. I have it in the show notes

166
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,160
Here it is from Google and they have some of the details and they also talk about how to convert your each year

167
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, this is interesting. This is okay. So this here's the back end now and this is gonna work

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So starting on September 1st, that's today

169
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,480
Most flash ads uploaded to AdWords

170
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:47,240
That's Google's ad platform are automatically going to be converted to HTML 5 to ensure your ads continue to show up on Google's display network very

171
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,760
nice

172
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,880
So that's so that's how Google's getting around the fact that so many of their ads are in flash is they're converting them to HTML

173
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,680
I wonder they must just be breaking them out and then

174
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,640
And then transcoding them if necessary

175
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,960
Yeah, that's kind of interesting technology. Yeah

176
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,720
Yeah, and then they give people instructions like to me perhaps it's not perfect though because they say you need to identify flash ads in

177
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,320
Your content that aren't eligible for automatic conversion and then convert these and they give you steps to do that

178
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Yeah, so

179
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,180
I think online advertising is about to

180
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,280
For display ads is about to get a big shakeup. Yeah, what are they gonna do about that? I don't know

181
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,420
That's a huge market. I think they ought to convert to podcast advertisers personally

182
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,560
Yeah

183
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,880
Yeah, well, yes, apparently there are HTML 5 to I mean so flash video for the most part is really just an h264 video

184
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,280
And sometimes an mp3 audio stream wrapped up in an FLV container

185
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:51,000
And then the flash player is simply just playing it like our live stream right now is an h264 stream and an mp3

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,720
Audio stream that is then wrapped up in FLV and sent to the player that just happens to be a very good container for delivering

187
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,080
live content

188
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:03,880
If you have the technology you could have like for example, there is an open source tool out there called live streamer and live streamer

189
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,920
Will break h264 and the audio stream out of the FLV container

190
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm probably butchering the real technicals of how this works, but this is layman understanding

191
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
it'll break it out of the FLV container and

192
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,120
Then repackage it up for you and display it on your Linux box without any need for flash and so you could take something like the live

193
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,640
Streamer app and point it at the Jupiter broadcasting backup stream on ustream and it will pull it will break the stream out of

194
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,280
It'll break the h264 video out and the mp3 video out and repackage it for you

195
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,400
Automatically right now, so it's obviously possible because really all flash video is is h264 video with a flash container

196
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,160
so that's why it's that's why it's not that hard, but it's it's

197
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,720
Fascinating and this is on the verge of we were just kind of talking about in the pre-show

198
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,440
But there's a bunch of industry people coming together to hopefully work on a non patent-encumbered video codec

199
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,920
Oh, and I'm my hopes up, but that's happening at least we'll see yeah

200
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,200
All right, so let's move on to something else and something

201
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,400
I've been thinking a lot about right now is mobile data

202
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,320
And I'm gonna tell you why in a little bit coming up on the show and so of course that gets me thinking about our

203
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,640
Friends over at ting I'd like you to think about them to go to linux.ting.com and check them out

204
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:13,080
It's mobile that makes sense ting is on a mission to change up mobile I say

205
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,480
People follow ting for a while

206
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,040
You've known that some of the things they've been pioneering have now been showing up in other ways and sort of a watered-down

207
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Fashion in the industry. It's kind of a

208
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,460
A little disappointing that can't ever quite get it right

209
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,480
But I guess that's kind of how it goes when you're an imitator ting is great because it's no contracts

210
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,400
No early termination fees, and you only pay for what you use

211
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,820
They just take your minutes your messages in your megabytes, and they add them up

212
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,600
It's six dollars for the line, and then it's just your usage on top of that

213
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,020
It's a really slick system and in fact if you go over to linux.ting.com

214
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,800
You're gonna save fifty dollars off your first ting device or fifty dollars in ting service credit

215
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,800
We have a special promo for the month of September to give you fifty dollars of service credit or off your first device and so

216
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,920
You think about that you only paying for what you use well

217
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,060
I my first month of ting service was less than twenty five dollars

218
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,040
So you might be able to get a couple of months in there or do what I'm doing

219
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,200
I'm picking up the ting netgear zing at least I think this is the one I'm gonna get my hands on this is a nice

220
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,520
Wi-Fi hotspot that connects to the ting network has a nice LCD or I think it's OLED screen on it touchscreen

221
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,960
So you can see your signal how many users you have connected your battery life

222
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,440
And then you only pay for what you use so once you buy this and it's unlocked

223
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,000
You own it

224
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,960
It's just six dollars a month for the line and then your data usage and you can turn it on and off and and with a

225
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,660
fifty dollar service credit

226
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,520
Well, I mean you might be able to use this for a few months and not have to pay a dime

227
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,680
And there's no contract after you're done. It's just a six dollar hotspot in your pocket go to a

228
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,160
Linux dot ting comm get that discount also check out their savings calculator. See why ting is really really great

229
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,120
They have a CDMA and GSM network. So I'm gonna be using it

230
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm gonna actually I'm hoping to end up with a CDMA and GSM ting device

231
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,700
So that way wherever the signals the best that's the one I'll use for broadcasting on the road

232
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,280
That's slick

233
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,640
I'm still looking into all of that still but I think it's gonna be really great and if I ever have any troubles or if you

234
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,680
Ever have any troubles ting has no hold customer service

235
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:09,040
You can call them at 1 8 5 5 ting FTW anytime between 8 a.m. Or 8 p.m. East Coast and a real human answers the phone

236
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,440
And they can actually solve your problems and if you're a small business

237
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,600
Definitely definitely definitely look into ting because it is an incredible way to save money

238
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,060
essentially, this has been verified by there's a couple of third parties if you have

239
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,520
Guaranteed if you have between like 11 and 20 employees, you're probably gonna save on ting. It's almost guaranteed

240
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,840
It's it's impossible not to and it goes from there too. It's because it's six dollars

241
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,440
There's no early termination for you can move the phones around. It's easy to manage the lines

242
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
You can turn them on and off you can add and remove devices with no penalties

243
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,200
It's so slick and then all the features you'd expect like hotspot and tethering and caller ID and all that stuff with no crazy

244
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,040
Mysterious line items it's and and a really easy to manage dashboard

245
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Go to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting ago get that $50 credit or $50 off a ting device and they have a they

246
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,480
Have the whole range of devices GSM and CDMA linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged you guys rock

247
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,380
That $50 promo is awesome

248
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,120
Wanted to do a little follow-up from this Sunday's a Linux action show

249
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,240
we talked about go TTY a way to share your your terminal as a web page and

250
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,180
Halifax submitted his use of go TTY after that episode of Linux action. I thought that was so cool

251
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,140
Because he said there's a there's you know a lot of different things you use with go TTY

252
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,620
So I was delighted to see you guys covered it in the last episode

253
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,040
I recently it's just about a week ago started experimenting with go TTY as a bridge between my telnet

254
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
SSH BBS and the web and

255
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,860
It's been pretty sweet the author was very responsive on his github page and walking me through a handful of issues

256
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,480
I was having getting the font set up correctly so he has connected his freaking BBS to the web

257
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,800
Using go TTY and if you're watching the video version right now. I'm I'm I'm amazed look at that. That's amazing

258
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,940
It's awesome. That is that is incredible. We have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out

259
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,920
But I love this as this is a super solid follow-up

260
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,720
I thought to look at that so I'm gonna type in let's type in Chris LAS

261
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,280
Chris LAS or maybe I should put new in there

262
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,240
Create an account yes, okay, my username is gonna be Chris LAS my origin is Jupiter that seems like that should be good, right?

263
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,160
Only my email. This is Chris at Jupiter broadcasting calm. That's a secret. Don't tell anybody that okay West and my password

264
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,640
I better not I better not say what my password is

265
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Super secret JB password. Yeah, it's super super secret create account. Yes create account boom now. I I'm done now

266
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm in his BBS

267
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,800
Using cheese, this is a really nice system look at this. Here's here's the bulletins. Here's rumors. Who's online who else is online right now?

268
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,320
Let's take a look

269
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,400
Just me just Chris LAS. Yeah, I'm a little lonely hmm. That's too bad

270
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,280
This is slick though odd network org slash BBS if anybody else wants to get online

271
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,440
Yeah, I I agree and so spacebar. Yeah, so everybody go go there. We go now

272
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,880
We got somebody else on line. We got anonymous is logging in cool

273
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,000
We're rocking his BBS and look it's moving around my screen because it's you know cuz I don't you cuz you had a CRT monitor

274
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,320
Back in BBS that you see wouldn't want to burn in so every time you refresh. It's awesome

275
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,800
I guess or maybe it's I'm not sure why it's moving around, but

276
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:13,240
That is really cool. That is that is really great. Thank you Halifax for submitting that into the subreddit

277
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,760
That is some awesome feedback and that going from flash. That's it. That's not flash at all right, so that's yeah

278
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
That's a great. That's such a great use of

279
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
HTML 5 I guess what you call it I suppose

280
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,720
Okay, I want to talk about this story

281
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:33,920
Just because I've been trying to contemplate in my head like how exactly would open source a deal if this actually happened

282
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,000
so a couple of different really important people James Comey the director of the FBI and

283
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,720
Admiral Mike Rogers the director of the NSA

284
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,720
and are are both petitioning industry the technology industry specifically Silicon Valley and Congress as well and

285
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,400
They've remained adamant that companies need to install government-friendly backdoors into their encryption products

286
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,000
And I've played some clips quite a few clips actually on our own filter show about this

287
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,560
But this continues to be a trend that legislators are actively considering

288
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,440
because of threat of terrorism and

289
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,240
They're worried that terrorists are using what's happened what not to communicate and so they want to have backdoors

290
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,160
and I I could really care less if they work with Skype or what's apt or

291
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,240
Instagram or Facebook to build in the backdoor that almost seems like a given

292
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,360
But when I start thinking about what if it became a requirement that if this is a communications piece

293
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
This is how the legislation is currently sort of being proposed

294
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,580
Communications enabling technology has to have backdoors

295
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:39,080
Well, there's a lot of things that fall under that category a lot of open source products and projects fall under communications enabling technology

296
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,640
And so I'm I I don't really understand how if law is passed in the US that mandates this

297
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,240
But software is created outside the US by open source developers

298
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
how do we reconcile that difference and

299
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,040
Does that software have to comply with the US law to be used in the US West

300
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,640
Do you have any thoughts on the insights on this?

301
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,720
I don't know, but it sounds very negative for I mean

302
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,400
We've seen how much open source is important to business interest these sure and already you see

303
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,440
You know some programs developed outside of the US open BSD comes to mind almost explicitly because they don't want things like this meddling with software

304
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,600
So I don't think would be in our interest to have this. Yeah, I agree and of course

305
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,740
Building and back doors by design is not as a silly as we've seen import restrictions exactly

306
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,780
I wonder if it's to come across as import restrictions anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts as

307
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,340
As we start to talk about this

308
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,700
My first thought is no this should not exist in any way shape or form

309
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,900
In the entire world because it's just gonna compromise everybody in the end

310
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,460
Yeah building in basically making the product insecure by design

311
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,020
My biggest beef on this one from an economic standpoint is don't they realize that this is going to kill

312
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,780
US businesses. Yeah, exactly. I

313
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,100
Also wonder how they think I mean it depends on if it's at the service level

314
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,460
But if the NSA can use a back door into something owner why they're so you know if they're arrogant enough to think that the Chinese

315
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,420
Intelligent service wouldn't be able to find such a back door. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, especially as we've seen that, you know

316
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:14,620
Documentation and information can leak secrets get stolen and source code can be stolen

317
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,620
And then once that gets out there then that then that any anybody that's implemented that product is compromised

318
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,860
that's so that's a

319
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,300
and it seems it seems like extremely dangerous seems like an extremely slippery slope because

320
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,500
What I would worry about is it would force

321
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,860
large

322
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:38,060
Large companies that work with the government as contractors or the government itself to buy proprietary software and and not

323
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Longer be able to include an open-source option because they don't have these mandated requirements and they would just look at it as they are

324
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Not up to whatever the spec requirements are and they would just simply be disqualified on those grounds

325
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,220
And so they would have to go to vendors like Oracle and Microsoft and Apple or whoever

326
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:00,660
Cisco whoever instead of implementing an open-source solution because those open boards open-source solutions

327
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,060
Can't be guaranteed to have that and they're not going to be bothered to patch it themselves or whatever. It's probably impractical, right?

328
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,100
It's probably impractical right? They'll just get a bid from one of those companies and that'll be that. Yeah

329
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,140
Oh, yeah, it just makes me really uncomfortable. I think about it and I was specifically I was specifically wimpy outside the US

330
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,660
I'd be really curious what your thoughts are when we make changes like this and how we can mess with people outside the US

331
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,660
Any insight there?

332
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,340
The UK so in bed with the US that

333
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,340
it's pretty much the same or similar legislation and

334
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,300
activities end up being

335
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:41,160
Adopted over here. So in fact Cameron himself has been making a lot of rumblings about about this very same issue at the same time

336
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,740
Yes, yeah, it's very interesting that both sides of the pond are talking about the same thing at the same time

337
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,920
There's obviously a push behind the scenes here for this

338
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,900
And I mean not to say here and fry conspiracy bacon in a linux show

339
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,700
But it seems pretty obvious on the face of it that they're all talking about at the same time

340
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,620
and it seems like we're surrounded it really does and

341
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,620
And and in the case where open source might be our salvation as users

342
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,660
I feel like it could also that any companies that have to follow these standards and requirements any private companies or any government

343
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,500
Departments they can't use open source. Just I don't like the way it's going

344
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,780
So it's a good thing

345
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,540
The good thing is is the battle isn't over yet

346
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,500
And there's actually a lot of agencies in the government that are also taking opposite stances

347
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,980
the I think the FCC just published something actually today saying that

348
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:31,340
Solid encryption is is fundamental to protecting us commerce. Yeah, definitely so

349
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,780
Obviously, there's a lot of different angles on this if you are curious about this topic at all

350
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,220
It's something we've been following for for since about April

351
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,540
Pretty pretty consistently in the unfiltered show and you can check out some of our episodes on that

352
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,380
I've played some clips

353
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,660
I think I oh I did actually in the show notes to if you really actually are really concerned about this and I kind of

354
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,460
Would I like to believe that some of you out there actually are even if I even if it's just a fantasy if not us

355
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,700
Then yeah, I linked in the show notes a hearing back in

356
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,420
Jeez, where was it? I'm looking for it right now. It was a hearing back in April

357
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,780
I think about about this topic and about about all of this and it's a very long boring C-Span capture

358
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,060
but it covers the reasons why they want this and how they want it done and it's

359
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:26,660
They're really working on it. And I just I always I always curious when one when one major nation makes a big decision like that

360
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,700
How it impacts Linux and open source, maybe the audience has some insights on this to Linux action show dot reddit.com and look for episode

361
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,540
108

362
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Raymond in there a ramen in general

363
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,820
Hammons in the chat room says if it went through wouldn't that mean that fedora and Debbie et cetera would stop shipping security software as

364
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,660
Non-free on the same grounds as things like patent encumbered codecs. That's exactly what I was thinking, too. Is

365
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,580
It all of a sudden. Yeah, I mean, yeah

366
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,540
Cuz the fedora projects and Debian project isn't gonna want to ship stuff that's compromised by design, right? No, it doesn't protect the user. Oh

367
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,620
Boy, you see what a slippery slope this could be

368
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,780
This is something I've been thinking about it just don't I don't quite have an answer to it

369
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,660
And maybe we're overthinking it, but I don't think so. I think it's something that the kids and what are your thoughts? I

370
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,800
Think that the rest of world is smarter. I don't think they'll go along with it

371
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,460
I mean the US could only go so far with with bullying and with

372
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,780
Legislation before the rest of world just says stop it. You're only 5% of the population

373
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,300
You don't get to dictate what they rest in 95% of the world does. Oh

374
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,340
Maybe

375
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,580
Yeah, maybe but a lot of the industry and influences is where they where they're making those decisions right now

376
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,540
So this is probably for their point of time the time to do it. Well, they still have that position

377
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,700
Well, I don't know this is let's let's move on let's this kind of got us down, isn't it?

378
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,060
I'm a little depressing. I'm sorry. I don't want to be I don't yeah, I agree

379
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,580
It is it is very and the value of this is negative. No more with that. So no more with this

380
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,500
Let's actually move on to something. I'm really crazy super excited about I want to talk about

381
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,140
The the road show that we're gonna be doing here in just a little bit

382
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,780
But first, why don't we pick it up? Let's pick up the pace. Let's talk about something that makes me excited

383
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,240
Let's talk about digital ocean

384
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,560
Let's talk about our friends at digital ocean just for a second because you could go over there and create something that makes you feel

385
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,100
Good doesn't make me think about James Comey or Admiral Rogers or whatever

386
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,860
It makes me think about creating Linux servers on-demand because digital ocean is dedicated to offering the most

387
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,300
Simple and intuitive way for you to do that

388
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,980
If you use the promo code do unplugged you get a $10 credit you can get started in less than 55 seconds

389
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:31,700
You get a machine with 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer for $5 a month

390
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,820
And if you use our promo code do unplugged you get the $10 credit try that $5 rig for two months

391
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,660
It's pretty nice and digital ocean is data some locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam London and a nice one

392
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,420
I mean a really they're all nice, but a really brand new one in Germany

393
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,440
I say that because I drool a drool at the pictures they post online and I love digital oceans interface

394
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,140
It's simple. It's intuitive and you can replicate it on a larger scale with their API

395
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,860
Go over digital ocean just play around with them a little bit create some machines

396
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,540
Destroy some machines update some software feel like a boss and use the promo code you unplugged you can do it all for free

397
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,620
And while you're there, why not follow one of their great tutorials? They're posting new ones all the time

398
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,780
Like here's one that just went up how to automate installing WordPress on Ubuntu 1404 using ansible

399
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,080
how to set up Apache virtual hosts on Ubuntu 1404 now that is

400
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,420
You know every time you do it you get better and better at it

401
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,180
But if you only done it a couple of times boy, this is a really great guy

402
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,740
first of all, a 1404 LTS is a great machine to deploy Apache on and

403
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,540
This is super super nice. It's all the steps you need and it's been gone. It's gone through by technical editor

404
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:37,700
Look at this. I mean, I'm sorry Arch wiki, but this is this they're quickly becoming like, you know

405
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,860
Go to place. Look at this. This is I mean, you know what?

406
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,860
The thing is is this is just like scratching the surface. They have tons of them

407
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,020
So not only do they have all of these great tutorials

408
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,820
But they also have one click deployment of many many applications that you might want to install ghost WordPress Ruby on rails

409
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,700
Git lab, I mean the list goes on and on in fact, there's we have wave way more now

410
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,500
So just use the promo code do you unplug it a $10 credit and you know speaking of the road trip when I'm on the road?

411
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,100
You know, you know, I'm gonna be using digital ocean and move stuff around bounce our live signal off of it

412
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,020
Did you lotion calm you can get started right now do unplug?

413
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,740
They also have core OS and go check that shenanigans out. It's a pretty cool system

414
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,200
They get updates right from the upstream distro digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplugged big

415
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

416
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,680
So I've been trying to come up with a name for the road show. So Wes Eubanks current on the shows

417
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,580
I'm impressed. I just watched the latest last this morning

418
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
Look at you. I doing your homework for you

419
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,420
You were you weren't we honeymooning or moving last week?

420
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,780
I can't remember is I get them all mixed up kind of both got back from my honeymoon and

421
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Then I had to move out of my previous house

422
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,460
So you get married then and then you and then you go on a honeymoon and then you move like all like back to back

423
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,980
To back. Oh, yeah, why didn't you I mean, I mean, I'm not why didn't you either schedule the move or the marriage?

424
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:01,860
Further apart probably should have there was some yeah, let's just say operational constraints. Okay. I'm very familiar with that

425
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,580
No, I'll be more stable. I understand. I'm very familiar with operational constraints. Let me tell you

426
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,660
Yeah, yeah, that's my world these days. So this road show so I guess I don't have to fully update you

427
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,740
You're pretty current. I'd like to hear it from okay. Oh, well, all right

428
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,180
So well, I'll give you I'll give that I'll get everybody super up-to-date on where we're at

429
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,980
So right now I am planning to go on the road and this is all

430
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:30,500
Semi lockdown but also as anything that's production-oriented could change at the last minute. So I make that disclaimer, but right now

431
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,820
tentatively planning to get on the road September 19th and

432
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,100
and and and and make the drive from

433
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,220
Everett Washington to Grand Forks, North Dakota

434
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,860
Taking us to know it tells me that we can leave from Everett Washington and make it to his house without taking more than like

435
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,340
Four or five turns off of us to now we're going to but wow, that's a pretty cool concept

436
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,580
So we're gonna see if it's we're gonna that was the basic core concept we get there and then we've committed to doing a last

437
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,980
Cribs edition where I want to go through and tour Noah's house

438
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,940
No, that's a Google glass and take some video of how he automates his house

439
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,700
See if I can find it where he's snuck in some windows or max

440
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Wouldn't that be something? Yes

441
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:16,620
Scandal exactly and then but the idea is the journey between Everett and Grand Forks, North Dakota

442
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:21,940
That itself is going to be content. We're going to be recording along the way

443
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,020
We're gonna be trying to produce shows along the way doing meetups along us, too

444
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:32,300
Between Everett and Grand Forks and starting in Spokane with I'm a con and crew if anybody wants to meet up at that

445
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,620
I'm a come put the brewery in there again, if you would add the roaming penguin. Yeah, that's oh, that's a good name

446
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:40,260
Yeah, so we're kind of we're trying to come up with a name for the road trip because I should back up

447
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
I'm very excited. I'm very excited

448
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,980
So that was the core concept. We started with

449
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,060
months ago when I mean months and months ago when we had a goal on patreon and

450
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,980
And

451
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,580
So we've been trying to figure out how to really do this in a way that's sustainable and

452
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:02,300
My initial thought was in order to continue to do shows so the shows can continue. I should rent an RV

453
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,860
Because it would be madness to buy an RV just crazy

454
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,380
That would be what the hell am I gonna do with an RV?

455
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,300
So I will rent an RV and it turns out that's like a lot of money

456
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,420
Like I don't normally really sit there and budget and plan things out

457
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:22,100
It's not my style, but in this one particular case like Noah was here and we had the crew we had the whole crew here

458
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,460
We all we were going down or broke down all the numbers and we looked at it. It's like it's gonna cost us

459
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,620
Over six thousand dollars just to rent an RV to do this road trip Wow. Yeah

460
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,860
and so because they also have to pay for like like 38 cents a mile for gas and stuff like that, so it's very expensive and

461
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,580
that was like, oh, I totally took the wind out of the sails and

462
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:48,540
Then I started the search process just to see what it would cost to just get a lightweight trailer to pull with my truck

463
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,300
that I have already and

464
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,220
Like I looked at like teardrop

465
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,420
units and because you know, I'm telling you price range is low here because we don't have a lot to work with and

466
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,020
I found a unit that

467
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,140
Folks were selling because the owner was having some health issues and he only taken on three trips

468
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,300
he did twice down to California once to the Oregon coast and they live here in Washington and

469
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,980
I

470
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,340
Go through it's a 25-foot trailer and it was just about right, you know, it's not quite like

471
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,140
like like an Airstream or something like that, but it's still it's a it's a fine trailer and

472
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,060
The deal was all getting finalized and I was about ready to like I thought maybe we could even do a show out of it

473
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,700
But the gentleman selling to me had a heart attack last week. Oh, that's terrible. Yeah, it's awful

474
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:35,020
It's awful. And so it completely derailed the deal for a couple of days, but more important things on their mind

475
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,180
Yeah, sure. So we managed but things are picking back up this week. So that's good

476
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,100
So I managed to get a fantastic deal because they needed to get rid of this RV pretty bad

477
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,300
And so I got a fantastic deal on a trailer that I'm gonna load up on September 19th

478
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,940
ideally and hit the road and then meet up with people along the way do broadcasts and

479
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,300
We'll see where I have connectivity and I don't yeah, and I'm gonna take it over the Stevens Pass

480
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,020
I've never pulled a trailer over Stevens Pass. I don't have an engine break

481
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,940
But I'm gonna take it over the pass. It should be fine

482
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,380
And yeah

483
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,740
And and meet up with people and I on the other side and I'm really really looking forward to it

484
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,380
And so this so a zero con 34 had a couple ideas to name the road show

485
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,340
I'm trying to come up with a good name for this road

486
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,580
So we're gonna be doing you know many of the shows from the road including last and unplugged and so he wrote says Chris mentioned

487
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,940
He was looking for a silly name for the new mobile studio in his RV

488
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,420
And he says here was an idea for the show name the whole enchilada show

489
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,700
a whole enchilada show I don't know about that one the other suggestions that

490
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:42,580
Other suggestions came in the mobile oriented broadcast and Linux entertainment, which the acronym without for that would be mobile

491
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,740
That's pretty clever good JB tube was is not is also available

492
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,700
The the free bird I like that that's not bad actually at the free bird the roaming penguin again comes up

493
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,820
So anyways that mummer if you guys have any ideas from what we should name the road trip the Linux action show road show

494
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,420
That's not bad Chatham's throwing some at us right now shuttle pod 5. I

495
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
Don't know why I like that what I do

496
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,020
That's pretty good too free birds not bad, and it's a JCO trailer, too

497
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,820
So it has birds on it already, and we could put a penguin on there. Oh, yeah, I get the J

498
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,940
I like the free bird. I'm gonna write that one down. I'm writing that down

499
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,180
We've got a couple of votes for free bird. That's not bad. He's actually writing it on paper guys. Yeah, I stressingly old-school

500
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,120
Yeah, that's actually how I commit things to memory. I find if I actually write them down

501
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:31,220
So I don't know exactly how we're gonna do this. We're gonna try to power the broadcast from the rig using Linux

502
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,060
Oh, this is exciting. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna try to actually make everything DC powered, too

503
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,940
Which should be an interesting challenge, so we'll have a couple a couple of Linux laptops

504
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,780
Probably one of them running nice cast or ice cast or whatever

505
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,460
But there's actually a problem called, but I mean there's a lot of different ones we could use

506
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,940
That well, I don't know

507
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,500
We're gonna use something to send a signal back and Skype and and then we're gonna do local recording so with audio quality should be pretty

508
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,260
Good, so it shouldn't shouldn't be that bad unless there's a bunch of background noise or something like that

509
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,780
And I wonder if I wonder if it's this real stretch goal of mine would be to be actually able to broadcast

510
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,020
While the rig is moving. Oh, that would be amazing

511
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,700
I don't know where that'd be possible that I have to make sure I have really good signal

512
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,260
But I think it'd be amazing to a show while the moosh while the rigs actually going down the road live stream

513
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,100
You just quietly drive for hours. No, I wouldn't be driving doing show at the same time. That's way too distracting

514
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:25,420
so if you would like to help out with our effort, I would more than appreciate that because I'm the the wish list is

515
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,900
Posted and the list is long right now the big thing the big thing that I'm really thinking

516
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,540
I'm probably not gonna be able to purchase and so if somebody out there is in a position to be able to afford it is

517
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,580
the

518
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,580
Cell phone booster kit which boosts all 4g LTE signals

519
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:43,300
Oh really from all the networks you press you put an antenna up on a metal plate on top of the

520
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:49,940
Traylor and then it has a plate that it connects to inside the rig and then it rebroadcast all LTE signals

521
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,900
So some people in the reviews I've read say maybe if you have one bar

522
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,020
This thing will transform it into four bars

523
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,380
And I'm thinking that's the difference between doing a show and not doing a show

524
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,140
however

525
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,140
the problem is it's 380 bucks and

526
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,820
The installation is probably gonna be another 400 bucks

527
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,340
Which just paying for the installation loans about all I can afford right plus I'm getting other things installed on the rig as well and getting

528
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,780
some things removed

529
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:15,460
That would be one that it could make the difference between being able to do show and not be able to do a show and it's

530
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,020
One that I don't think I can buy

531
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,020
So that would be high on my list if somebody could afford that we have the wish list linked in the show notes

532
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,900
There's also other things on there like

533
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,300
Everything like toilet paper. I mean anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated because tomorrow

534
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,580
I'm taking the truck in and I'm getting it sort of ready

535
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,860
You know there's a lot of small things on your vehicle when you drive five ten miles a day

536
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,060
You don't really care that it's out of alignment or the tires need rotation

537
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:43,460
or that you're a 1500 miles over on your oil or that your mirror is shaking or that your e-brake hasn't worked for three years or

538
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,420
The niceties you know or that you've never had your cooling system flush

539
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:52,260
You don't care about these things when you're just driving five ten miles a day, but then we're gonna be towing a

540
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,660
25-foot trailer

541
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,020
3,000 miles

542
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,860
Plus then these are things you need to look into so tomorrow

543
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,260
I'm taking the truck in and getting all that work done on it

544
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,700
Which pretty much soaks up pretty much any all the free spending yeah, yeah, so if anybody does want to help out

545
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,980
We have the wish link linked in the show notes and as I go along

546
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,140
I'll be posting videos and things like that, too

547
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,020
So hopefully it's gonna be a ton of fun, and if something blows up in my face

548
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,620
I plan to record that too. I'm not just gonna repost the good stuff. Oh

549
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,860
Yeah, yeah, if I end up with a flat on the side of the road

550
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,060
I'm gonna turn it into content. I am bound to determine to make the best out of it

551
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,180
It's all you'll be doing while you wait for the tow truck. Yeah, yeah, and so I don't know

552
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,060
I'll have the mumble room with me or Wes potentially you could be here in studio

553
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,520
And I could be you know you'd be here

554
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,660
Maybe jumping and getting them pulling the mumble room in because the show's got to go on I'd love to help that'd be great

555
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:40,780
So you so and then we'll still have somebody local in studio when I'm out on the road

556
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,260
Somebody says get triple-a. That's probably not a bad idea there. I should look into the cost triple-a

557
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,860
Yeah, maybe you can do it for just a month or whatever yeah

558
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,060
I'm like I wonder if they have like a limited thing and I'm getting insurance too for the trailer

559
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:57,360
They're these business things you have to do for a road trip anybody in the mumble room have an RV

560
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:03,440
I'm screwed. I got nobody get advice from I'm all out on my own on this

561
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,600
I've been watching YouTube videos and reading how to's and I think I actually might have made a good move not ending up with an

562
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,680
Airstream, maybe I was reading about wireless signals and getting wireless in and out of oh

563
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,640
it looks like those airstreams sometimes are a little difficult on that and

564
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,960
Also also

565
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm like pre marking down like areas along us to where I think I can might be able to get Wi-Fi if there's no cellular

566
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,300
Signal and I got an email from somebody's like hey Chris. Why don't we meet up here?

567
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,600
This is probably your last best place to get good internet in Montana

568
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,520
And I'm looking at the map, and it's like way way way way way way way east

569
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,320
All right way west on Montana, so it's way early in the trip

570
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,280
And I'm looking at going you mean I don't have good internet for like the rest of Montana

571
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
I'm gonna go crazy space. I'm gonna go crazy

572
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:49,560
So I probably download those coverage maps before you leave yeah, yeah, yeah, I wouldn't picture any Wi-Fi signal either coming out of there

573
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,800
So yeah there you go. I'm pretty excited. That's the latest try to think there's any other up

574
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,680
Yeah, so I'm gonna be posting more videos to our patrons to that for people to check that out

575
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,320
But it doesn't be an interesting challenge a live mobile Linux power broadcast

576
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,520
And I don't know there's anybody else done that. I don't know of anyone

577
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,160
Is this first is this first? I don't know it could be a first. You should probably just start calling it

578
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,520
Actually that's what I was thinking token rings is in the chat room said it might do me some good to disconnect from time to

579
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,880
time

580
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Yeah, especially in the mountains and

581
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,640
Yeah, like a glacier National Park and stuff. Yeah, I know Darren. I know I'm not saying it's the first mobile Roadshow

582
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,280
I'm saying I think it's the first

583
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,320
Linux powered Linux powered mobile Roadshow that's the important part. I think so

584
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,120
I think that's it's the first Linux powered mobile Roadshow. Oh, and you know what speaking of the wish list I

585
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,280
Almost moved on and completely forgot to mention this the first item off the wish list did arrive because I mentioned it on last

586
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,360
On Sunday and it came from Noah and it is the black tank empty kit, which is the poop hose

587
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,480
so this is the poop hose I'll be using on the road trip to empty the

588
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,120
Piss and poo from the RV and Noah got it from me off the wish list. Isn't that great?

589
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,120
So that was his special contribution right there to the road trip. No, I'm that's not his only contribution, but he got me a nice 15 foot

590
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,380
Was it rhino flex sewer kit rhino flex sewer kit and

591
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,820
Do you know why you want a clear swivel connector right there?

592
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,980
I do not so that way when you flush out your black tank

593
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,940
You can see the water turn from brown to clear. Oh, so, you know, you know, it's clear, you know, it's clean

594
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,060
I think this means you might not be welcome to use Noah's bathroom when you get there

595
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:38,660
You think that's some subtle? Yeah, maybe you're probably right. Yeah. Well, you know, it's funny is I liked it

596
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,500
Cuz this was Noah's real nice way of saying you're not welcome to stay at the house as you said to me

597
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,500
He's like have all the facilities. He's like hey, man

598
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,140
So would you just prefer that I just arrange a hotel for you and when you get here and I'm like, right?

599
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,620
They're like I was planning to stay in the RV. He's like, oh, okay

600
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,940
I think he was just trying to make sure I wasn't planning to stay in the house

601
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,100
Right, like you can come in and do the last Cribs tour, but you can't stay in the house

602
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:02,500
That's what I please mark a mile away from the property. Yeah, give us a good 15 minutes notice before you come over

603
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,700
yeah, we'll see I and and then if something really dramatically goes wrong and

604
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,420
Like I don't I can't do any I can't get any connectivity

605
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,980
So like like I can't show up for unplugged or something like that Noah's offered to stand in and do the broadcast from his studio

606
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,620
using OBS and Linux and

607
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:27,300
Probably Skype to do the shows so he can stand in as an emergency host if for some reason on the road trip

608
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,180
I'm completely unavailable which means I'll allow myself also to just if that happens

609
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,900
I'll just take the day off and let Noah handle it which is

610
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,300
which I think would be really nice and then like

611
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:43,420
For tech snap we're pre-recording because Alan's going to be traveling of course so we're not even gonna be doing tech snap on the weeks

612
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,740
That I'm gonna be gone anyways, so that shows taken care of so it's really a perfect time. It's just all working out

613
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,780
I'm looking forward to it

614
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,900
I'm really looking forward to it, but we could use your help if anybody does want to help us out

615
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,620
I'll have a link in the show notes, so I have I

616
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,260
Want to say goodbye to an old friend?

617
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:06,780
I maybe I don't know. I don't know if software has a has a sex or a gender, but oh just pot

618
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,180
pot-kettle I just suggested the fecal matters of Chris lass as as

619
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,100
No, no that is not a title suggestion

620
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:19,900
Okay, so we have an old friend to say goodbye to somebody who's brought us through good times and bad times somebody who's really brought

621
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,460

622
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,940

653
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,220
You guys probably saw the news

654
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,740
Lilo is

655
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,100
going to

656
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
cease development on

657
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,740
December

658
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,540
Lilo comes to an end the old Linux loader the development of Lido Lilo as a classic bootloader

659
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,900
was restarted in

660
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,820
2010 Lilo has some advantages because it's super simple and a lot of people liked it over grub and grub 2

661
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:08,260
But the developer says that because of limitations with butter fs GPT partition tables and even rate itself

662
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,700
He's kind of done. If someone wants to develop this further

663
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,620
He's willing to take submissions

664
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:20,740
Bye bye Lilo. What do you think Wes? What's uh, are you sad when things like this happen, you know?

665
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,740
It definitely had its place in history

666
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:28,780
Personally, I've never relied on it, you know between grub and sis Linux and now you know EFI does it itself?

667
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,820
I actually think it's good thing. Yeah, I think so too. I mean we only need so many solutions

668
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,480
It's good to have more than one. Yeah, and this is the natural cycle of software something gets created

669
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,940
It's useful for a long time something new comes along and we make room for the for the new stuff and this service purpose

670
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,340
So well and because the codes open it never goes fully away. Yeah, you want to use it for your own custom solution

671
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:51,500
Go ahead. I actually think Lilo is a perfect example of how open source code started

672
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,620
It was created to solve a problem people thought it was no longer useful

673
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,980
It was kind of put away and then in 2010

674
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:02,300
They came back out and he said actually we can take this code that already exists and we can make it relevant again and people

675
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,300
it got a whole new resurgence and

676
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,260
I don't think you'd ever have seen that with a commercial product because you can't do it because the light stuck

677
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:13,420
Yeah, I actually think it's a great example of the open source life cycle

678
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,820
I'm trying to think of other projects that I'm familiar with in mobile room

679
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:22,020
If you guys have any suggestions of projects that have been really big and then just so sort of faded away over time

680
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,380
You know, obviously there's been distros like mandrake and mandriva

681
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:30,780
But individual projects I was trying to think of besides Lilo that have been so important to us at one point

682
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,780
And now have sort of faded away

683
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,780
Doom

684
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,780
Doom no cork, you know not doom. Yeah, I don't know. I think that's it's an interesting

685
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,820
It's it makes me appreciate the contribution that they do make while they're here and you kind of make me realize not everything's gonna

686
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:52,100
Last forever and it is a lot of work to keep up with the you know changing file systems and XMMS not maybe XM

687
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:58,700
Yeah, you know some old old old X desktop applications sis Linux sis Linux open office

688
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,780
I don't I think open office is still around for the most part. Yeah

689
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:04,980
It's an it's an interesting way to look at those kinds of kind of projects in that

690
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,740
DOS

691
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:15,580
No, no, I can't I look at this to the history of this thing version 23.0 came out in 2010 and then version

692
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:23,220
24 was released in 21 in 2013. So it's three years between major major releases. So it's not like it was super rapid rapid

693
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,060
Rekha says gnome to star office. Yeah

694
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:32,580
Yeah, star office is yes still sis Linux is still used broadly. Yes

695
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,220
Star office was was a big one mumble room. Do you guys have any projects that have faded away that you used to?

696
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,760
No, okay. Nobody's very talkative in there today

697
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,980
Yeah, don't even get me started on BOS that yeah, oh boy, yeah, I my BOS experience was really solid

698
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,180
I've talked about we've talked about it before we did

699
00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:01,620
Heroku, is that what replaced it? Is that what came along there open-source? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yeah

700
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,780
Yeah, we did a haiku episode years ago. You guys remember that

701
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Thank you action show

702
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,600
That's what people call it. Yeah, the haiku action show

703
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,140
We didn't actually we didn't I don't think I don't think we actually named it that but yeah

704
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,500
At the haiku is a pretty fun operating system to check out you guys too. Anyways

705
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,540
Lilo coming to an end you guys can see the announcement in the show in December

706
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,060
Maybe we'll throw a little party for it. Maybe maybe I'll give it a try before it goes

707
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,100
Wait forever, give it one more boot up a couple things. Yeah, I

708
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:33,540
Like that West that's nice. Good way to send it out. We should do like a boy. That would be really interesting

709
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:40,620
It's just like a classic Linux distro. That's old kernel using Lilo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah system D. What? No, no

710
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,020
Hey guys

711
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,820
If you have any any projects any submissions for that kind of thing Linux action show dot reddit dot com go find episode 100

712
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,660
Nate and submit it there or any stories or submissions for this year show

713
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,340
you can go over there Linux action show dot reddit dot com and

714
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,260
Submit that to us. I'd really like to hear your thoughts on the whole NSA stuff, too

715
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:57,400
Kind of you know

716
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,940
What's going on there with the how would open source respond to that if backdoor encryption?

717
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,500
Was like mandated having backdoors in the interesting to hear from some people from other countries. Yes, exactly

718
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,820
Yes, exactly

719
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:15,780
And then also with the the debate continues on over over at the Linux action show if Richard Stallman ever needs to have actually installed

720
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:23,660
I've never installed Gnu slash Linux that debate continues to to rant to age on as well as the combo to site revamp and

721
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,460
A thread about diehard keystroke

722
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:32,580
Keystroke launcher folks and I have a quick I have a quick one that I'd like to throw to the audience and he runs down

723
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:37,060
By the way, gnome do and synapse and others I at some point, you know in gnome 3

724
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,380
When you hit the meta key or the super key or the Windows key

725
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:46,460
Whatever you want to call it it brings over the activities overview and then you can start searching immediately. I love that me too

726
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,460
That's that's pretty much how I use it as a launcher

727
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:52,540
Some point sometime my main machine upstairs. I accidentally remapped that super key

728
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:52,980
Yeah

729
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:57,060
And I have no idea how to undo that like I cannot I cannot use super key anymore

730
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,300
And I've gone in I've gone into gnome settings and keyboard and shortcuts and I don't see anything wrong there

731
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,260
I just can't set it anymore and it's driving me crazy

732
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,780
If anybody knows how to revert that back like if there's some G comp file like and I don't know what I could do

733
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,180
I I missed be able to hit the meta key and launch my oh, that's confusing. Yeah, and because it's upstairs

734
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,540
I can't ever troubleshoot on there. Otherwise, I would try that a little bit go TT wine

735
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,340
We can get the mobile room right on your machine. Yeah. Yeah, that's true, right?

736
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,660
I actually I was thinking if I if I can't figure it out

737
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,660
I might just switch over to one of these

738
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,500
To one of these other ones that were just linked to the subreddit

739
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,660
Cooper is one looks like it's QT. You have gnome do synapse Albert

740
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:37,260
Albert how about that mutate? Let me look at that one, too

741
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,180
This is a really pretty solid lineup including the built-in krunner unity and gnome shell launchers

742
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:49,020
I'm looking at mutate the award-winning productivity application. Hmm. Okay, it's in the AUR that meant that meets my requirements

743
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:55,840
Albert's looking good though. Look at Albert Wes. Look at this Albert an amazing desktop environment agnostic omni launcher

744
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,620
The back end will be written at the end of February. Oh, well, okay, it's after February

745
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:04,020
So these launchers are super look he's doing math in the launcher. He's doing Google searches in there, huh?

746
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,260
I think that's I might Albert might be want to check out

747
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,860
That might be one to look at. I don't know. I see it looks like it has looks like 27 days ago

748
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,220
It was last ice pretty active looks like it's using qt5

749
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:23,100
So you need to have qt5 installed on your system. That's Albert. So he has I'll link to this in the in the show notes

750
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,660
He's gone through and done a really good job

751
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:30,020
SB 5 6 6 3 7 in the subreddit and really summarize the current state

752
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,020
Like one of the things I like here is like he when he's separating out the different launchers

753
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:38,380
He mentions that gnome do had his last released in January 22nd 2014. Yeah

754
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,780
Yeah, so that's that is the issue with gnome do is that it doesn't have a lot of active elements

755
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,060
So he's done a really really superb job. In fact, that's

756
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,800
That is really great work that he took he spent some serious time writing this up

757
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,600
So I'll link to that if you guys are curious about this if you haven't tried to have you ever tried to launch your West

758
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,640
Yeah, I used to use gnome do pretty heavily. Yeah, why'd you stop? I just launched everything from the terminal now. Yeah

759
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,800
Oh, really? Yeah, mostly really well, I use fish like you do a lot of things on my machine anyway

760
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,160
Yeah, and and and what's your main desktop environment?

761
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,960
No, no, I use awesome. Okay, so that makes sense. Yeah, so they have a yeah that

762
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:19,600
Oh boy, well then we should have you do a segment on here one day one week about why you use awesome

763
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,760
Oh, yeah, that'd be fun. Yeah, and what did you switch from?

764
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,240
Well, would you use before awesome? Oh, no three, how we certainly did you make this transition? Uh, it's been

765
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,920
No, probably better part of a year. Really? Yeah, really and so you went from gnome

766
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,760
What that would have been what gnome 312 ish timeline 360 now 312 ish timeline 312

767
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,400
Yeah, and you and you went to awesome. Yeah, and I still I mean I still love no, you know

768
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,960
I put it on friends. You're blowing my mind. I use cinnamon at work, which not the Italian window managers are so so crazy. It's just

769
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,200
For some reason I pegged you as a gnome 3 gun. I can't remember what we had said. Well, I do I do really like it

770
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,520
Yeah, yeah for you know when I want to show off Linux and make it look really feel violated now

771
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:07,040
Everybody tells me I should try it and we did do one episode on awesome at one point

772
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,720
And it just for me it and I wonder why if you don't feel it feel it feels for me like going back in time

773
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,120
You know, I do understand that from time to time I do

774
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:21,260
You know like integros has a beautifully configured gnome 3. Yeah. So like yeah, I use that as my go-to live CD for a lot of things

775
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,540
Yeah, so I really appreciate it or if I want to just like show off slick shiny Linux. Mm-hmm

776
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:32,020
Mostly I just don't need I prefer to mount things myself and you know a lot of the little things where I yeah

777
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,740
I'd rather I have my own set up for it already and

778
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:40,740
You crazy you crazy. Yeah, we should okay. We should do an unplugged episode on tiling window managers

779
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,340
Anybody in the mumble room on a tiling window manager? I three is pretty great, too

780
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,800
Yeah, that's the one I was thinking about trying actually was I three

781
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,400
No, I'm so playing with plasma five. Yeah, how's that been going?

782
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,660
Well, I'm on the beta one now and it's it's getting there. It's getting better

783
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:03,460
So I'm hoping looking forward to 1510 maybe even put all my new desktop finally. Hmm

784
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:08,060
Fascinating. Well if you guys want to see us do a tiling window manager episode in love

785
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,020
I'm not quite sure how I think we would need people in the mumble room that

786
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:15,140
Are involved or that are running it? That's how I would like to do it. I think

787
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:25,220
Yeah, sounds like okay that sounds like that might be a good idea I suppose I could try it I

788
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,260
Just don't want to waste a week of productivity doing something

789
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,740
I don't love but if people if we had a few people in the mumble room

790
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,740
So because I mean maybe it'd be okay

791
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,380
But if we had a few other people maybe long timers plus you'd be here that might

792
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,940
There might be a decent product could be a good segment. It could be a good segment

793
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:39,820
All right

794
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:44,760
I had to I wanted to answer one question before we left the show today because we've talked on and off about running

795
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:51,860
Linux on Macbooks on unplugged from we tried it with Angela's laptop and some other folks went out and pop MacBooks and try it

796
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,540
Well Jose writes in with a question

797
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:58,140
That I think a lot of you are probably gonna run into if you have if you've ever tried Linux on a MacBook or you know

798
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:00,700
Anybody out there who is and he says a year back

799
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,700
I wrote an asking for help getting links on my HP notebook

800
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,940
After a lot of research, I finally got arch running flawlessly. However, I need some help again about six six months ago

801
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,220
I really wanted a new laptop and I was looking at getting the Dell XPS 13

802
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,180
But my mother and girlfriend got me a MacBook Pro retina

803
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:17,480
with with the iris pro graphics

804
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:24,980
2014 edition as a gift for finishing my PhD. Well, congratulations Jose says I won't lie. I really like the build quality or it's Josie

805
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,140
I'm not sure

806
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,860
But all but not all that crazy about OS 10, right?

807
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,540
About a month ago. I installed anti-gross, but I have two huge problems

808
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:41,220
Number one the battery life drops from seven hours to three hours and number two the temperature on the laptop goes way up just by

809
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,900
Watching a simple video and the fan goes crazy. I wonder if you guys have any ideas

810
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,380
I've tried to browse the arch wiki, but it hasn't been all that helpful

811
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:53,860
I really like to run Linux full-time, but I can't solve these issues if I can't solve these issues. I'm going back to OS 10

812
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,340
So the first issue

813
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:01,680
Seven hours or three hours. I think partially might be which graphics card you're using. So if you're using say the built-in

814
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,380
Dedicated graphics versus the iris graphics that's going to use way more power

815
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:12,180
But the major problem you have in my opinion with Linux on MacBooks is that SMC controller you familiar with this only broadly

816
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:17,620
Yeah, the SMC controller is really responsible for a lot of the thermal management and probably I don't know a lot of other

817
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:24,640
Regulative things towards power and whatnot in the MacBook. It's custom. It's a custom Mac thing. There's no driver for Linux available. So

818
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,720
The fans and temperature management are all done proactively under OS 10

819
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:36,040
In fact OS 10 even is aware of CPU load and GPU load and how that relates to potential heat increase and will preemptively

820
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,400
increase the fans to cool the machine and

821
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,800
All of that is done in software inside the OS 10 operating system

822
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,600
And the reality is that what you get when you don't run OS 10 on a MacBook is

823
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,720
You get essentially the hard limit thermal controls that keeps the hardware alive. So you get these weird

824
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,360
swings from

825
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:59,960
Low thermal management to extreme thermal management where the fans kick up and he says I'm watching a video and my fans go crazy

826
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,020
I don't have a great fix for this and I'm wondering if people in the subreddit or in the mumble room or in the IRC do

827
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:11,040
But here's uh, oh look here is the air is saying there's a thermal daemon on github. You might build a search for

828
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,480
Not specifically for max thermal D is not specifically for max

829
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,800
But so so the thermal D I'll put a link to that in the show notes

830
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,800
I don't know about that specifically but

831
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:27,080
What I do know has worked and it's a little hokey and it does require that you have a little OS 10 install on the

832
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,080
Machine and itsy bitsy in OS 10 install which I actually do recommend anyways

833
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:36,080
Because it's the only way you can do important you if I and other firmware updates that would help protect you against things like Thunder

834
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,940
Strike

835
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:42,920
So I recommend you do keep a little OS 10 on there despite the hard drive space that comes at a premium on those Mac SSDs

836
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,320
If you boot into OS 10 before you boot into Linux and don't shut off

837
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,160
But just reboot don't power the machine off

838
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:56,520
But just reboot boot into OS 10 first and install an app called SMC fan controller now

839
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,320
SMC fan controller has been around for a really really long time. And what it does is it controls?

840
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,740
Statically the fans under OS 10 so you can go in there and what you can do is build different fan controller profiles

841
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,960
medium high sound low sound and

842
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,600
If you're going to be gaming you would set it to the higher profile

843
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,560
If you're not going to be gaming you would set it to the lower profile and if you're gonna be watching videos

844
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,200
Maybe you set to a medium profile and then you boot into Linux now

845
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:23,960
It's not ideal

846
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,040
But what it does is it sets a new baseline for the fan RPMs

847
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,280
So you could say instead of having them spin at 800 rpm

848
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:35,100
You could have a baseline of 15 or 2,000 rpm with the max about 6,000 where you actually start to hear them

849
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:40,080
So you could go in and say set your baseline level RPMs at a thousand RPMs or 2,000 RPMs

850
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,620
It's slightly louder than it would be under OS 10 just slightly

851
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:48,460
But it can run much longer that way before it has to kick into the crazy thermal management

852
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,620
This is a really hokey workaround. There's got to be a better way to do this

853
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:56,680
But if you do have a mini OS 10 install, that's one way to do it. This is Nate says

854
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,560
There is some Mac fan CTL D. I use it with Ubuntu. No, we never have any problems

855
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,760
So check out Mac fan CTL D. That could be another very nice. Yeah

856
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,340
That's really cool. Thank you Nate Mac

857
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:14,460
See Mac fan CTL D. I have not I don't I don't I don't have any any more Mac books with Linux on them at the moment

858
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,020
So it's like one of those things to you where it's so specific to you know, the different models and versions

859
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:22,220
Yeah, it does change right and then Apple can just get it just right and then the next version when you go buy a Mac

860
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,540
Book with one port and it has completely different stuff. So

861
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,680
Yeah, that's a rough way to go. But I know the people like those Mac books. We get a lot of emails about it

862
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,900
So if somebody has some solid solid links like Nate there

863
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,760
I would love it if you'd add it to episode 108 over at the subreddit Linux action show

864
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,260
Dot-reddit dot-com and then other people could benefit from that as well

865
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:47,620
So Linux unplugged is live on Tuesdays 2 p.m. Pacific can go to jblive.tv to join us

866
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:52,180
We have the chat room there. We also have a mumble room info so you can hang out in our virtual lug

867
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,740
If you're not quite sure what 2 p.m

868
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:59,980
Pacific is I don't blame you because I realize now I'm gonna have to try to figure out time zones as I go across the US

869
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:05,240
I'm like, ah crap. What am I gonna do? And then it was pointed out to me Chris. Just go to do a broadcasting comm

870
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:09,500
So that's calendar. I'm smart guy already set that up. Yeah, I too will be using the calendar on the road trip

871
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,860
I will be feeling your pain audience. So no judgment

872
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,420
also

873
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:16,380
we love feedback Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact choose unplugged from the drop-down and

874
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:22,060
Send in your emails Linux actually reddit comm West. Thanks for joining me. My pleasure. Thanks for having me

875
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:34,060
All right, buddy. See you right back here next Tuesday

876
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,560
All

877
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:11,460
Right now we both JB titles calm JB titles calm only grab this one second. There you go. All right. There we go

878
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,020
Hello coming on the possibility of unfiltered Colorado high note

879
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:21,660
Haha, if I'm gonna be in car, I don't think I'm gonna be in Colorado. I'm taking us to I

880
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:27,500
Don't think I'll be there a high note from Colorado. Although I Colorado could happen on the return trip

881
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,380
We're gonna break from us to on the road on the return trip and take in more of an indulgent route home

882
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:37,440
So it's always possible. Oh that new Google logo. Oh, look at that. Look at that. Oh

883
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,200
I kind of missed the serifs honestly, really

884
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,120
Backdoors for the clueless. Do you have a lot a list of plan stops on us to know Billy?

885
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:49,680
I'm hoping people want to do meetups and contact me. I need I need meet it

886
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,200
I can if you do meetups, is there a way to do like meetup suggestions on meetup calm?

887
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,200
I don't I don't know. That's I don't know

888
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:57,960
Yeah

889
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,520
What highly window manager should we force Chris to use for a week?

890
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:06,240
I do remember that now that we do this see the results were i3 by 54 percent. So apparently we've discussed this

891
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,240
Yes, I do recall discussing this now

892
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:14,120
Oh boy, see I I was I was see Matt Matt was Matt had my back on the anti

893
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:20,460
He was an anti Tyler too. So it was easier for me to avoid having to deal with the tiling issue on the show

894
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:25,600
However now that you're here and you've got tiling preferences now and now got the mumbo-mumbo. Look at this

895
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:32,640
I 380 votes on it. I look at this. Look at this at a 148 votes. This is no good. This is I

896
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,960
I think you should wait till after the road trip that way you don't get too many things going on

897
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,320
That's probably a good point or maybe we do it on the road trip

898
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,200
Really everything up. Yeah, just like uphaul everything in my life

899
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:53,560
Why not back doors for the Calusa isn't bad the fecal matters of Chris last while in security by design back door complaint

900
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:58,220
Lilo bought a boom luxury furry road open source back doors

901
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:04,840
Hmm smoky on the penguin. That's not bad either. Man. These are some good ones JB titles calm

902
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:13,100
Dude you're getting shot by a machine gun. Watch out you're getting shot by a machine gun. You better be careful

903
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:19,940
Keep the bummer room safe everyone. Yeah, it kind of reminds me of how like the original Phil Zimmer

904
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:27,500
Like the 90s with PGP encryption how that was like you can't export this encryption and stuff like that

905
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,460
And they were fighting for that back then

906
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,580
Yeah, yeah, I know right use Windows for a week. I

907
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,700
Actually wouldn't do that. I

908
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,900
Have some pride

909
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,540
We just drive me crazy the fecal matters of Chris last cannot be our title

910
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:48,860
I don't think that's a very good title for Linux unplugged. I don't really think that's not accurate

911
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:54,580
I mean if that's what the episode was about. Yeah, that's true. I mean I could I could definitely do an episode about that. Trust me

912
01:05:54,580 --> 01:06:01,460
Trust me. I was surprised nobody had any nice parting words in the mumble room to say about Lilo, you know is solid

913
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:06,700
Let's really be ready for death. I guess it's just we've all moved on right? We have all moved on it is time

914
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:11,340
And jalapeno ale. Yeah, I do need to do that. You're right. I'm a con you're right

915
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,940
So I'm a con I'm gonna have a camera when we're at our meetup

916
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:18,840
So I should probably get this I kind of get this figured out. I need a meetup on demand

917
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,580
So so basically I'll be I'll just be spawning meetups as I go

918
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:26,940
So sign up at meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting spawning them was spawning them coming out everywhere

919
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:31,180
just I'll just awash in meetups, I don't actually know if that's true or not because

920
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:38,020
Us too has long spots where there's nobody around we got to like share your location to you like a where's Chris?

921
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:41,320
Hmm like a beacon. Yeah, exactly like a JB Road beacon. Yeah

922
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,260
Get up at 2 in the morning and check where Chris is

923
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:47,700
I wonder how I would actually practically do that in a way that would actually be doable

924
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:51,780
I saw something that used open street maps and like you could set it up that would be amazing

925
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,420
You could plot where you were going if there's a way to do that and it doesn't cost a bunch of money

926
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,260
I'll see oh totes do it. That'd be fun. I'm a room you see too

927
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,100
Yeah

928
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:04,260
Don't find out and then you can wallow you can follow me as I go and then if I get stuck on the side of the road

929
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,260
You can alert somebody cuz I might be somewhere. There's no cell so cuz how's that gonna work if it doesn't have Celsius?

930
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,300
Yeah, I assume there'll be some big hole. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Yeah car tracker thing

931
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:18,460
Hmm Lila was two letters ago. That's funny Rick guy. That's good way to put it. Yeah, low jack Chris last low jack
