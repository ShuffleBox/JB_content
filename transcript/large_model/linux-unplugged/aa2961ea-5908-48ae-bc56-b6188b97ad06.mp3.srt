1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
So it's called AmpliPi, I think, Wes.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,880
Is that what it's called?

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,520
AmpliPi, like amplify, but with a Raspberry Pi involved.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,640
Yeah, or at least the compute module.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,600
This is one of these Kickstarters

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,920
that I wasn't sure if no one would pay any attention to

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,360
or if it would be a big success.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,160
And it seems like it's going to be in the big success category.

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,660
They've already reached their goal.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,040
But it is a whole house audio system

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,260
with multi-zone audio support, like the old school

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,040
amplifiers, that you pop a Raspberry Pi into.

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,880
And so you can imagine it's gotten a lot of attention.

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,240
And it also has an API.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,160
So of course, you could now write scripts for your amp.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
This is so cool.

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,000
I mean, yeah, not only can it do the kind of standard stereo

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
stuff with analog input so you can hook up

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,040
any of your standard stereo gear,

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,320
but it can also stream directly from AirPlay, Pandora, Spotify

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,120
if you've got a DLNA source.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,280
And all of its open source, the schematics, the rest API

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
is written in Python.

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
They've got low-level control written in C controlled by Python.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,080
You can get all of it.

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,680
Yep, if you ever wanted a free software

27
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,600
amp for your home theater setup, this is it.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
We'll have a link in the show notes.

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Hello, friends, and welcome into episode 393.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,120
My name is Chris.

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,000
My name is Wes.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,900
Hello, Wes.

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,360
This episode is brought to you by the all-new Cloud

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,400
Guru, the leader in learning for the Cloud, Linux,

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,600
or modern tech skills.

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,560
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs,

37
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,520
get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,480
We have some fun things to get into on episode 393,

39
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,280
and I'm obviously just now realizing

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,320
that that's almost 400 episodes and having a mild panic attack

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,720
while I do the introduction.

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,960
But we won't worry about that today.

43
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,160
No, no, it's a very special day in open source.

44
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,000
A brand new workstation-grade desktop is rolling out today,

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,800
and we've gone hands-on and have our opinions, our thoughts,

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,800
and some procrastinations, I got nothing on that one.

47
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,240
It's horrible.

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,320
But we'll get there.

49
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,380
We'll get through some community news.

50
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,800
And to help us do all of that, we've

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,300
got to bring in our virtual lug.

52
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,960
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
Hello, hello, hello.

54
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
Hello.

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,440
Hello, hello.

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,240
I see Phil from Mangero snuck in there too.

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,920
Hello, Phil.

58
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,680
Yeah, hello.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,400
How are you?

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,320
Good, welcome back.

61
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,800
Well, I'm glad to have all of you here today,

62
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,640
because there's a lot to talk about.

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,200
And I'm going to start with a little bit of local news

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,480
here at the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,800
We just hit 400 episodes on our CODA radio program,

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,580
eight years of fun shows.

67
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,720
And I think a lot of you are probably

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
aware that Jupiter Broadcasting hasn't

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,960
done any swag or merchandise in over two years,

70
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,880
since before we were acquired and then now independent again.

71
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,880
And that is definitely something I wanted to fix,

72
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,480
but I didn't want to do the same old stuff everyone else is

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,520
doing.

74
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,920
I wanted something awesome, something useful, something

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
great, something that can help you

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,880
be productive and comfortable.

77
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,560
And it took combining multiple platforms and shops,

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
multiple team members researching and conducting

79
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,880
calls.

80
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,800
It's a product born of 2020 and early 2021,

81
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
and we are calling it the CODA.

82
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,840
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

83
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,040
It's 100% terry cloth velour, soft, cozy robe.

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,960
It feels great on the skin out of the shower,

85
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
and it works well all day long.

86
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
It's embroidered right here in the US of A,

87
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,240
and we are doing a limited run on a brand new CODA radio robe,

88
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,600
all black, white logo.

89
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,800
It looks fantastic, the CODA.shop.

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,160
It's our first swaggin' forever.

91
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,520
Pre-orders are now until the end of February.

92
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,320
It's $65 plus shipping.

93
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,280
And depending on how bad I screw this up or how good it goes,

94
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,960
this will 100% kind of drive what we do in the future

95
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
with merchandising.

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
I don't think it's going to be robes,

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,680
but I do want to do kind of neat stuff

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
that nobody else is doing, or as far as I know.

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,440
And I'd love for you to grab a robe, the CODA.shop.

100
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm getting you one, Wes.

101
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,400
Ooh, does that mean pants are optional?

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,200
Totally.

103
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,760
That's the great thing about this robe.

104
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,380
You could wear it all day long, and it

105
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,720
could be the only thing you wear,

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
or you could wear it over your clothes.

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,200
It's not a house coat.

108
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,760
It's a house coder, the CODA.shop.

109
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,080
But now moving back into, yes, it's really here

110
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,800
in the chat room.

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,320
Look at that.

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,800
What do you think, Brent?

113
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
Do you feel like you want a robe now?

114
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,600
I saw this in the Telegram, Jupiter broadcasting Telegram

115
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,080
group.

116
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,780
I think that might have been a sneak peek.

117
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,680
And I'm not a robe guy, but man, you've got me tingling.

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
So we're going to have to see.

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,060
I think it's super awesome and hilarious.

120
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,640
I love it.

121
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,760
Everyone can be a robe guy or gal,

122
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,000
and I hope people enjoy it.

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,840
So I thought we'd start today with a bit of Linux history.

124
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,320
22 years ago yesterday as we record this,

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,120
it was Windows Refund Day.

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,440
We've talked about this once before on the show,

127
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,000
but this was a day where Linux users, including

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,440
Eric Raymond and others, got together to go to Microsoft

129
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,760
and request that they actually fulfill an aspect of the Windows

130
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,440
EULA in the Windows End User License Agreement.

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,120
It clearly states that the agreement can

132
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,920
be refused by the end user and that Windows can be

133
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,120
returned to the manufacturer.

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,200
However, in real life, the way that kind of plays out

135
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,920
is the manufacturer says, sorry, you've

136
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,120
got to go to Microsoft for that.

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,900
Microsoft says, sorry, you've got to go to the OEM for that.

138
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,560
And the user is left paying for Windows that they don't want.

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
So this group decided to make a statement out of it

140
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,040
and go down to Microsoft's office in the Bay Area

141
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,840
and protest.

142
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,460
And they actually got a group together.

143
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,200
They had signs.

144
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,840
And the press showed up, and there

145
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,080
was quite a bit of coverage.

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,600
And I grabbed one of these clips from 1999, 22 years ago.

147
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,080
It was a small orderly protest calling attention

148
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,440
to some big issues facing Microsoft.

149
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,040
Some computer users who don't want Windows 98

150
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,440
on their computers want a refund for the software

151
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,400
they say they're forced to pay for.

152
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,480
High tech business reporter Jim Goldman has the story

153
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,760
from our San Jose News Center.

154
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,200
These people don't just dislike Microsoft.

155
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,360
They want a refund.

156
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,440
And they may indeed have a legal leg to stand on.

157
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
We don't want their Windows.

158
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,240
And we want our money back.

159
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,880
That was Eric Raymond right there.

160
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,600
The protest was organized by a group supporting

161
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,280
a free alternative operating system called

162
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,680
Linux that works on most PCs.

163
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,120
It also happens to be in direct competition

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
with Windows 98.

165
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Linux is also gaining in popularity,

166
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
but still mostly an operating system

167
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,360
for hardcore computer users.

168
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,060
60 computer makers from 14 countries

169
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,960
now sell systems with Linux pre-installed,

170
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,640
just as Compaq or Dell sell computers with Windows 98

171
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,800
already loaded.

172
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,920
The refund demand was really a stunt

173
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,720
to let consumers know there is indeed a choice to Microsoft.

174
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,240
When you call a manufacturer, when you talk to someone,

175
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,280
that Windows isn't your only alternative.

176
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,640
Microsoft mostly took the PR nightmare in stride,

177
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,960
even displaying a welcome sign to the Linux community.

178
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
Protesters were not amused.

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,240
You could be looking at a class action suit.

180
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
They even tried to get up to the company's ninth floor offices.

181
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,280
So you're not letting the people upstairs to-

182
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,560
No, it's a business day.

183
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,440
There's a lot of people working upstairs.

184
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,760
But were prevented from getting inside.

185
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,840
The message is, it's OK to take your money,

186
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,400
but it's not OK to listen to you,

187
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,200
or to pay attention to their own licenses.

188
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,240
That's Chris Tabona.

189
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,280
For its part, Microsoft says consumers

190
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,360
are free to choose whatever operating system they want.

191
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,840
And policies are already in place to get that refund.

192
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,880
The license agreement that comes with Windows clearly states

193
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,400
that if you do want a refund on the copy of Windows that

194
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,520
comes with your PC, that's fine.

195
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,480
There's nothing preventing you from doing that.

196
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
You just go and contact your PC manufacturer,

197
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,960
and they handle the process and policy for that return.

198
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,080
In enlightened circles, this is called a catch-22.

199
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,280
This subdued protest will not end here.

200
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,800
Organizers hope to create somewhat of a groundswell

201
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,200
to pressure Microsoft into a new refunding program.

202
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,040
But with 25 million copies of Windows 98 already licensed,

203
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,440
at least at this stage, it appears

204
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,760
Microsoft has little to worry about.

205
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,680
In Foster City, I'm Jim Goldman, New Center 4.

206
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,880
Microsoft might not have worried about it very much,

207
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,640
but I actually think it did catch the attention of OEMs

208
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,800
to some degree.

209
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,360
And it showed that there was a demographic of customer

210
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,480
out there that was happy to buy a machine without Windows.

211
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,840
Now, the process of OEMs unwinding themselves

212
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
from Microsoft's grasp was an entirely different issue.

213
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,200
You know what stood out to me from all this archival history?

214
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,400
The rat tales.

215
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,520
Oh, yeah, lots of rat tales.

216
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,960
Lots of tuxes out there.

217
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,680
And we will have a link in the show notes

218
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,680
where you can read the original posts about it and the day.

219
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,840
And then you'll also find links to the video archive,

220
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,400
CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox.

221
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Oh, and I guess CNN, but you can't get the video anymore.

222
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,560
They all were there.

223
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,800
And there is old, retro video footage of it that is, well,

224
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
it's very nostalgic.

225
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,960
So much has changed, and so much is still the same.

226
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,120
Well, speaking of things that are about 20 years old,

227
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,360
VLC 4.0 is coming later this year.

228
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,600
Embrace yourselves.

229
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
It has a new UI.

230
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,320
Now, the player has reportedly been downloaded by more than,

231
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,160
or it has been downloaded at least 3.5 billion times.

232
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
That's what they say.

233
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,600
Now, I don't know if that even includes Linux distributions

234
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
that have it in the repository.

235
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,680
And work on version 4.0 is nearly complete.

236
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,320
The stable release is expected in the coming months.

237
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,440
And the user interface, as they say,

238
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,160
will be redesigned from the ground up.

239
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,360
Another interesting major feature

240
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,840
will be what they're calling the Moviepedia project, which

241
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,120
is kind of like an IMDb competitor,

242
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,920
but with Wikipedia-style user contributions.

243
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,440
Interesting.

244
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,040
The new version will also focus more

245
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,480
on playing videos from the internet,

246
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,840
relying on extensions to find third-party content.

247
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,000
And it sounds like they're maybe working on a WebAssembly

248
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,760
version that could play videos right inside the browser.

249
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,000
That's interesting.

250
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,080
But going back to the plugins thing, hmm.

251
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,280
Well, I could see that being a real pain in the butt.

252
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,720
You go to play something, and this whole dialogue comes up,

253
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,400
and you've got to go retrieve a plugin.

254
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,520
What about the reverse case of, like, MPV integrates

255
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,120
with YouTube DL already, and that just works?

256
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,760
That's true.

257
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,560
Something like that.

258
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,240
That's a great example of just being

259
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,920
able to pop YouTube DL support into VLC,

260
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,040
and they don't have to develop it directly themselves.

261
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,760
That'd be OK.

262
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:48,960
All right.

263
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,840
You got me on there.

264
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,440
But did you see the bit in this article

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,480
about that John Baptiste is mulling

266
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,360
around the idea of an ad-supported video streaming

267
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,000
service, similar to what Plex did back in 2019

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to support the project?

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,720
Whoa.

270
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,160
I don't know how I feel about that.

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,640
Yeah, more ads is not necessarily what I want.

272
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,320
Yeah.

273
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,800
And I don't really like what Plex has done so far.

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
As a fan of Plex, you know, I've interviewed their CEO.

275
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
I've been a user a long time.

276
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,120
I like it.

277
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,960
I mean, I wish it was all open source.

278
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,520
But that aside, I really like it.

279
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,440
And I have not been a fan of their streaming service.

280
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,320
I have tried it out in various incarnations

281
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,000
that they've updated it, and I have not

282
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,520
found it to be particularly compelling.

283
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,840
And in part, it's really coming down to content licensing

284
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,320
deals and stuff, because everybody

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,520
who owns content that is worth a damn

286
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,160
is just launching their own streaming service right now.

287
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,680
And they don't want to license it.

288
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,160
And it's not really clear to me that the Video Land Foundation

289
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,680
is really the best project to take that on.

290
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,960
I mean, I want to support them.

291
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,480
I use VLC all the time, especially

292
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,840
with the handy new Chromecast features, good mobile support,

293
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,120
all the things I like about it.

294
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,920
But that, I don't know, just doesn't speak to me.

295
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,600
Yeah, Colonel, what are your thoughts on them developing

296
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
this Movipedia project?

297
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,400
Yeah, I wonder why they're doing that,

298
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,960
because as a lot of people may be aware,

299
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,400
IMDb has been a crap show, in my opinion, for a long time.

300
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
But a couple of years ago, there was a new competitor

301
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,240
that started up called TMDB.org.

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,400
And it essentially sounds like what they're trying to create.

303
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
So why not just partner with them?

304
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,120
Because TMDB started because people

305
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,920
didn't like the direction that IMDb took.

306
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,240
So they go, well, let's just remake it and make it better.

307
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,320
And TMDB is very much about community contributed content

308
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,880
and making it that way.

309
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,640
So I wonder how much of what they're doing

310
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,600
is maybe they're not aware.

311
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
Maybe they tried, and there's some issue there.

312
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,600
Or if it's a not invented hair syndrome, or what?

313
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,240
Piecrash, it could also come down to an issue of focus

314
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,000
with a new streaming service.

315
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,920
Yeah, I mean, one of the problems

316
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,200
of implementing streaming services

317
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,040
is that it moved from the core project on the core business.

318
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,000
I mean, it's people that are not spending their time making

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,480
the video LAN player better, but are working on code

320
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
for supporting the streaming services and stuff like that.

321
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,120
And I think it's a problem for the project.

322
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,400
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,920
I'm kind of skeptical of this plug-in system.

324
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
How about you, Brent?

325
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,600
Yeah, you were mentioning their thoughts of putting plug-ins.

326
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,640
And I was remembering how VLC was so great because they

327
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,160
solved that problem originally.

328
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,280
So it almost sounds like they're creating a problem

329
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,240
that they solved originally, which might be worrisome.

330
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,600
I think you nailed that's exactly what it is for me.

331
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,520
It's like VLC was my no plug-ins, no extra codecs required.

332
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,240
I can just open a video file, and I know it's going to play.

333
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,080
I would feel a bit of a loss if that changed.

334
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,520
But maybe it's more like Wes was saying,

335
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,080
and it's additional outside functionality.

336
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,360
Well, right, things have changed since those old days.

337
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
I think, hopefully, it wouldn't be

338
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,800
dropping any of that support for just playing

339
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,840
whatever you throw at it.

340
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,120
But we now live in a world where you often

341
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
aren't throwing a file at it because it's just

342
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
some third-party service.

343
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,760
True.

344
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,800
Well, we've been sifting through Fosdom 2021.

345
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,080
They did a virtual event.

346
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,560
They had Matrix as their chat.

347
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,200
And they've been posting videos of the event

348
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,120
as the people that did the talk approved the video.

349
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,920
And one of the things that's interesting is a Facebook

350
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
employee gave a talk at Fosdom.

351
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,240
And I think it's Michael Salem is his name.

352
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,920
And we learned a little bit about Facebook's desktop Linux

353
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,440
use.

354
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,240
Yeah, isn't that interesting?

355
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,840
Facebook is known for their usage of CentOS on the servers.

356
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,720
But when it comes to Linux on the employee desktops,

357
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
turns out Fedora is the primary target these days,

358
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
but with growing support for CentOS Stream.

359
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
For a while, Facebook internally recommended Ubuntu LTS

360
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
releases in the past for their employees,

361
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
but shifted to Fedora so they could leverage

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,960
some of the internal infrastructure and tooling

363
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,040
that they already had for handling CentOS on the server.

364
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
Well, yeah, OK, that makes sense.

365
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,480
They're using Chef.

366
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,840
They've got a lot of open-source Chef libraries.

367
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,360
Now, they can also use that on the desktop.

368
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,960
Yeah, though, the notable thing here,

369
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,960
it sounds like from the talk, is that the Fedora CentOS

370
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,720
Stream on the desktop thing is going

371
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,920
to be like an official stance supported by Facebook IT,

372
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,600
whereas the prior recommendation just if you're going to use

373
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
Linux, you've got to use Ubuntu.

374
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,280
They left the employees to self-support that themselves

375
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,680
with Windows and Mac OS remaining

376
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,240
the most common platforms.

377
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,440
But in addition to the standard Fedora repositories,

378
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,600
when they have a Fedora image that they deploy,

379
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,520
their own internal repository gets added,

380
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,960
Facebook's own internal repo.

381
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
They have one.

382
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,240
And also, they enable the RPM Fusion

383
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
on their Fedora desktops repos, and they

384
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,800
allow the use of Flatpaks.

385
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
So modern, right?

386
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,760
And you can kind of see why CentOS Stream might

387
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,040
be a good fit for them.

388
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,440
I mean, Fedora is great for a lot of reasons.

389
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,840
They've got a slide in the presentation

390
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
sort of addressing this.

391
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,560
But there are some downsides.

392
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,040
You've got to figure out how to keep up on the updates,

393
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,640
a lot of change.

394
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,440
Maybe there's employees who just don't care

395
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,480
about being that cutting edge.

396
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,160
I'm sure some do, some don't.

397
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,240
So with CentOS Stream, you kind of get a nice balance

398
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,120
of a stable, quote unquote, rolling

399
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,160
release, binary compatibility with which

400
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,280
you're running on the servers, good security posture,

401
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,960
and still a close relationship with Fedora.

402
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,400
I noticed that they packaged internally

403
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,800
some of their dependencies, and it

404
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,160
sounds like they try to get stuff

405
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,640
they might need for their internal stuff,

406
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,000
actually just packaged in Fedora or upstream

407
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,080
or in user-provided repositories when they need to.

408
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,240
This is an interesting development

409
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,560
in that imagine if multiple large companies like this

410
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
started recognizing this value chain,

411
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,840
and then they start contributing towards Fedora.

412
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,120
In this article specifically to that end,

413
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,320
Michael Larble says, you look at some of the things that

414
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,920
have come down, like enabling early out-of-memory daemon

415
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,960
and stuff, that's because Facebook is now using Fedora,

416
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,360
and they're contributing directly.

417
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,720
So Neil, I'm sure you've seen some of this go by.

418
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,440
I'm curious what your thoughts are on this.

419
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,560
So some of this is a little bit less of a surprise

420
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,800
if you'd seen some earlier versions of their talks.

421
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,280
They gave a similar talk at Nest with Fedora

422
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,440
about their growing usage of Fedora on the desktop.

423
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,560
And last year, not last year, the year before, for Flock,

424
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,360
they gave a keynote about their growing usage of Fedora

425
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,920
when they switched to Fedora by default for the desktops.

426
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,120
A big part of the rise of CentOS stream for desktops

427
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,040
mostly is attributed to the NVIDIA driver

428
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,680
because the NVIDIA driver is only officially supported

429
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,920
for RHEL platforms, especially for certain things like CUDA

430
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,080
and data science and all that fun stuff

431
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,360
that nobody really wants to talk about.

432
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,480
But because those things are only really properly supported

433
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,880
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives,

434
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,560
they are ramping up CentOS stream for desktop users

435
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,240
for people that need those things.

436
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
And everyone else is generally going

437
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,200
to be encouraged to use Fedora.

438
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,000
That's pretty neat.

439
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,480
And you can see how that's a nice system for them.

440
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,600
And for a modern company like Facebook who gets it,

441
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,880
there's a lot of advantages to it.

442
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,280
And you start to see serious contributions,

443
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,160
real improvements get added to the distribution

444
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,280
because one large shop uses it.

445
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,840
And you wonder what if Google came to a similar realization

446
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,800
or some other large organization,

447
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,240
maybe not even at that scale, but still had developers

448
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,520
that were contributing upstream.

449
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,080
And all of a sudden, you start seeing a lot of really good

450
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,240
code floating into the project.

451
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,840
That's pretty exciting the way that works.

452
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,000
So I debated this one because I'm like, it's Facebook.

453
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And I know that's not great.

454
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,360
But when you look at the code contributed,

455
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
it actually has worked out really good for Linux users.

456
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,440
And so this is a positive development.

457
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,240
And I also, as a former corporate user

458
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,520
who was trying to use Linux, I always really like a story

459
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,640
when I see the corporate IT staff are saying,

460
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,480
yes, Linux is allowed.

461
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,880
This is like first party, yeah, they're saying, go at it.

462
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,520
Run Linux on your desktop.

463
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,560
We need more of that.

464
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,120
Exactly.

465
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,280
So that's good to see, too.

466
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,080
So all in all, it was a good story.

467
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
And we'll have a link in the show notes

468
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,520
if you want to read the details.

469
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,560
linode.com slash unplugged.

470
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,040
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account

471
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,200
and support the show.

472
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Linode's how we host anything online.

473
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,920
Since JB 3.0 launched, we've put everything on Linode

474
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,840
for a lot of reasons.

475
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,260
I started using them a couple of years ago.

476
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,760
And I just realized how great they

477
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,440
are at doing what they offer.

478
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,200
They've been around since 2003, but they

479
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,520
decided to focus on a handful of sensible services

480
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,820
and just do a killer job.

481
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,560
And that means the entire package.

482
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,880
That means support.

483
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,320
That means web UI.

484
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,880
That means network infrastructure.

485
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,200
That means disk speed.

486
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,800
That means host speed.

487
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
It means having packages available

488
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,680
if you want dedicated GPU or if you need a lot of storage

489
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,160
or you just need something simple

490
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,800
or maybe you just want object storage.

491
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,960
It means getting those things right

492
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,680
and doing them really well.

493
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,840
That's what Linode is all about.

494
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,840
And one of the things that I like about Linode as a user,

495
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,080
having a system I'll put up and then I kind of don't think

496
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,880
about it very often, is they have really sensible defaults

497
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,160
for alerts that they just set up automatically for you.

498
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,000
You can obviously always go in, look at the dashboard,

499
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,600
look at the charts, see what performance has been like.

500
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,760
But if something gets a little out of whack,

501
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,520
like on one of our PeerTube instances, all of a sudden,

502
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,640
we were just using a ton of data and there

503
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,720
is a trigger that will automatically tell me that.

504
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,040
There's one for CPU and other basic system connectivity

505
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,120
issues and whatnot where they are set that up already

506
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,520
with a watchdog and they will alert you to that stuff.

507
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,480
So it keeps us proactive because we

508
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,040
can keep an eye on how our PeerTube instances are doing

509
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,160
without having to hover at the dashboard all the time.

510
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,360
And they just set that stuff up for you.

511
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,040
And of course, it's all customizable.

512
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,760
I mean, like I said, they've been doing this since AWS.

513
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,040
So what they offer, they know how to do really well.

514
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,120
I encourage you to go over there and try it out.

515
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,060
It's also a fantastic platform to learn on.

516
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,480
And there's really pretty much no downsides

517
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,140
in terms of making changes and then being

518
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,840
able to revert them or trying something, having it go wrong.

519
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,520
It's like you get a save button in a game.

520
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,120
Before you go fight the boss, you can hit the Save button,

521
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,680
save your game, and then go fight the boss.

522
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,240
And if things go wrong, you just reload your save point.

523
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,200
That's what it's like when you're

524
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,320
doing servers on Linode.

525
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,000
It's so great to have that peace of mind.

526
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,080
So go to linode.com slash unplugged and check it out.

527
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,000
One of the things I do with all of my Linodes

528
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,680
is I always turn on that backup, automatic backup.

529
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,520
It's cheap.

530
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,440
It's peace of mind.

531
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,960
And they give you really good output

532
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,880
on when the last backup was and all of that.

533
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,420
It's just another way that Linode just

534
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,080
keeps our infrastructure running and makes it possible,

535
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,160
even with a limited team, to offer a lot of services

536
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,240
to our audience.

537
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
So check it out at linode.com slash unplugged.

538
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,120
Support the show and get that $100 60-day credit

539
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,200
towards a new account.

540
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,240
And thanks to Linode for sponsoring the Unplugged

541
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,200
program, linode.com slash unplugged.

542
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,480
A few more bits of community news.

543
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,600
So I want to talk about this one item

544
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,200
just to give people some advice.

545
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,520
And then I want to do some updates with Phil.

546
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,680
So let's start with this one just

547
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,280
to get this out of the way because it's bad news.

548
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,080
And I don't want to end the new segment on bad news.

549
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,380
LastPass, if you're still using it,

550
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,960
has made the final changes that are

551
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,600
going to get you to drop it now.

552
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,720
LastPass free users must choose between mobile or desktop

553
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,080
computers for unlimited device access starting March 16.

554
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,600
If you want access on multiple machines, mobile and desktop,

555
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,800
you'll have to pay.

556
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,640
You'll have to pay.

557
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,340
It's not an unreasonable amount right now,

558
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,880
although I'm sure they'll eventually raise the rate.

559
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
It's like $3 a year right now.

560
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000
But it's a pretty brute force kind of change.

561
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
It's a real screw your users, we don't care about you

562
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,120
kind of change, the kind that's going to get people really

563
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,160
upset.

564
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,240
And as a free user, you're going to have to log in after March

565
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,200
16 when this change takes effect.

566
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,680
And you're going to have to set your active device type.

567
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,520
You're going to have three opportunities after that

568
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,040
to switch your active device type and then lock it in.

569
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,960
In addition to that change, email support

570
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,720
will only be available to premium and family customers.

571
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,120
So I thought this is a moment to sit around our lug

572
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,040
and say, what are you doing for password management today?

573
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,920
We've talked about Bitwarden before on the show.

574
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,840
So I wanted to make that recommendation.

575
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,000
You can also self-host Bitwarden, which I like a lot.

576
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,780
Wes, I think you're a KeyPass user?

577
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,700
I have been, although these days I'm

578
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,480
pretty much all on Bitwarden, although I'm using

579
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,560
one password for my work stuff.

580
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,680
Yeah, I was going to mention that.

581
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,040
OnePassword is not open source, but it

582
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,960
is well-supported on Linux.

583
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,800
They've recently just wrote a new Linux app,

584
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,960
and it's well-supported in business and enterprise.

585
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,120
So there is that advantage of it.

586
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,760
Looks like KeyPassXC is getting recommended in the chat room,

587
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,840
but a lot of people are saying they're using Bitwarden now.

588
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,080
Pass, P-A-S-S, on the command line.

589
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,360
The orange one uses KeyPassXC plus Next Cloud Sync and KeyPass

590
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,240
to Android to put it all together.

591
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,120
But I think if you are a one-password user right now,

592
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,920
you're probably going to be a little bit more

593
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,200
happy with Bitwarden or one-password.

594
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,680
And that just really stinks, and I

595
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,960
hate to see this because password hygiene is super

596
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,160
critical to keeping your online account secure,

597
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,560
and there could have been a better way to handle this.

598
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,920
And they claim they wanted to let us know as soon as possible.

599
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,280
Josh is like, OK.

600
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,160
It's kind of funny to watch this.

601
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,800
They were one of the pioneers, maybe not pioneers,

602
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,840
but at least in the broader public sphere,

603
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,360
one of the first companies to really get broad adoption

604
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,560
of using a password manager.

605
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,120
And now they're kind of like a weird off-brand.

606
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
They're just not, you know, the value has gotten worse and worse

607
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,840
to become more restrictive.

608
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,120
You complain about it, I think, every week or so

609
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,720
when you have to log in again.

610
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,480
It's just they haven't kept up.

611
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,360
Yeah.

612
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,040
It's time.

613
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,800
This Band-Aid has to be ripped off.

614
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,040
I just hadn't really come to a conclusion on how I wanted

615
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
to host my password database because

616
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,480
of the scale of that decision.

617
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
But they're making the decision for me.

618
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,440
So I guess I don't really have a choice.

619
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,640
And I hope they have a great day.

620
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,440
I hope they have a great day.

621
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,040
So let's change gears and talk about something a little more

622
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,240
positive.

623
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,360
Phil's back from Andrea.

624
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,280
Phil, welcome back to the show.

625
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,320
It's good to have you, sir.

626
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Good to be here.

627
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,400
We're going to get our plasma on in a little bit.

628
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,720
And I noted that your project recently

629
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,520
did an update for plasma mobile.

630
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,980
And I'm just curious how all of it's

631
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,280
going with the PinePhone and plasma mobile in general.

632
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,160
And any other updates you have for us?

633
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,120
Well, we paired up with KDE Foundation

634
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,360
and started to work much closer with plasma mobile and plasma

635
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,440
in general.

636
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,120
So we always have the latest and greatest software

637
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,280
as we do daily Git snapshots.

638
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,160
And you can always get a daily build PinePhone images

639
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,920
of all our branches from GitHub now.

640
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,160
Wow, that's great, pumping it out.

641
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,380
And 5.21 lands with NeoChat, which

642
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,400
we've talked a little bit on the show before,

643
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,360
kernel 5.10.16.

644
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,600
What else?

645
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,160
What's new in the world of mobile?

646
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,920
Is it anything noteworthy that we

647
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,200
should share with the audience?

648
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,400
Well, we managed to get the ring tone

649
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
ringing on the phone on the first dial tone

650
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,660
when you do the phosh image.

651
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,920
So that is going on.

652
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,280
And we're also working on the firmware.

653
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,480
So the firmware will be replaced by a Linux kernel.

654
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,960
So all the Qualcomm firmware getting out,

655
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,520
and you can then replace it.

656
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,640
So we have a really open source firmware for the hardware

657
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
as well.

658
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,600
So that's some of the things that

659
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,120
was going on for the PinePhone in the background.

660
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,620
Well, that's great.

661
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,640
I saw too that shells.com recently launched.

662
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,920
I might be talking about them more soon.

663
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,960
And I noticed that Manjaro is on there.

664
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,920
Tell me about this.

665
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,680
Yeah, we partnered up with them as well.

666
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,040
So we will ship out on lunch day KDE Plasma.

667
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,520
Then we have XFC on GNOME.

668
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,720
And we will do all the other additions on shells.

669
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,640
So coming up as well to see.

670
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,200
And the good thing is you can run it

671
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,800
on any device which has internet access.

672
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,240
So if your fridge has some browser feature,

673
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,520
you can run your computer there.

674
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,080
And some people also told me that they run it successfully

675
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,520
on their Teslas.

676
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,760
Teslas.

677
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,600
OK.

678
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Yeah, so if you're not familiar, shells.com

679
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,760
is a in the cloud virtual desktop environment

680
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,760
that you can deploy or you can just use it

681
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,280
from your browser, obviously.

682
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,880
And we've talked before about cloud desktops.

683
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,320
Being able to run Manjaro is super appealing.

684
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,840
I wasn't going to be too surprised if they offered

685
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,880
a Debian desktop or a CentOS or a Ubuntu.

686
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,720
But having Manjaro on there is really great

687
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,200
and means that people can get a really super up-to-date plasma

688
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,840
system in the cloud.

689
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,880
These shells.com guys should come on the show.

690
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,760
We should talk to them.

691
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,280
Yeah, sure.

692
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,800
We can hook you up with them.

693
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,120
And I think they are really interested in getting

694
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
some promotion out for the new systems.

695
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,160
And yes, and some mini PCs will come along as well

696
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,760
because we partnered up with Beelink.

697
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,480
And I just tweeted out some of the new devices

698
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,720
we will support soon.

699
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,640
Well, speaking of new stuff, all things

700
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,840
going OK at the project?

701
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,280
Anything new to report in general

702
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,080
beyond just plasma mobile?

703
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,200
Not really.

704
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,480
We're deep in development for the phone and shells,

705
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,160
as you told now, and other things coming up.

706
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,960
So yeah, we have a good stride for 2021.

707
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,360
Yeah, I don't mean to make it sound like it's not enough.

708
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,440
It's plenty.

709
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
You guys are doing plenty, so that's great to see.

710
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,480
Well, very good.

711
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,880
Thanks for coming on and giving us

712
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,920
a quick update on what's going on over there.

713
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,160
It's good to see the updates landing on the mobile device.

714
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,720
Very good.

715
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,240
Well, thank you, Phil.

716
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,800
Have a good one.

717
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,280
You too.

718
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,780
Bye-bye.

719
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,280
Well, Mr. Payne, a couple of things

720
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,040
I wanted to touch on in the housekeeping.

721
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,720
So if you'd help me just tidy up a little bit around here.

722
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,600
First of all, I've got to mention the Telegram

723
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,000
because I feel like Telegram's new again all of a sudden

724
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,600
for a lot of people.

725
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,400
And if you've recently signed up with Telegram

726
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,760
and would like to hang out with like-minded folk,

727
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,800
well, you can join the Jupiter Broadcasting Group

728
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,520
at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Telegram,

729
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,900
where we're hanging out 24-7 and chatting.

730
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,440
And then also, if you want to take it up one more notch,

731
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,120
you can join the Luplug.

732
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,440
That goes down on Sunday.

733
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,320
Obviously, it happens right now during the show.

734
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,520
But Sunday is the official Luplug gathering

735
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,680
right there in the Mumble Lobby.

736
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,600
And you can hang out with everybody and chat Linux.

737
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,840
We have anything we should plug for the Luplug, guys?

738
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,600
I'm a little bit in vacation mode.

739
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,720
But we have our recording scheduled for next Sunday.

740
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
I don't know if it will happen.

741
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,920
But otherwise, it will be in a week.

742
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,520
So if you follow the Telegram group,

743
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,840
you will get any information about Luplug

744
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,280
and the recording of the next show.

745
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,880
Pow.

746
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,160
That's right.

747
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,580
The recording's coming up soon.

748
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,560
We also have the matrix chat for the Luplug.

749
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,480
And that information, links to all that stuff's

750
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,680
at LinuxUnplugged.com.

751
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,820
If you're looking for something to listen to,

752
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,600
I was on the recent episode of The Opinion Dominion,

753
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,440
chatting about the podcast markets and whatnot, episode 28.

754
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,200
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

755
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,880
And we get into the business end of podcasting.

756
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,640
And let me tell you, the business end,

757
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,240
there's a lot going on there.

758
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
So that's The Opinion Dominion, episode 28,

759
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,880
if you want to check that out.

760
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,240
I think we did it.

761
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,160
We are down and efficient with the tidying, Wes.

762
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,800
We got this.

763
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,960
Yeah.

764
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,380
Well, I mean, once you do that, then we

765
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,420
can have the drinks, right?

766
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:31,920
Yeah.

767
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,420
Yeah.

768
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:39,820
Let's pour one and talk about Plasma 5.21, which is,

769
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,480
this is something special, you guys.

770
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,000
We don't always talk about the point releases here.

771
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
But as I hope you'll come to understand

772
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,960
at the end of this segment, the KDE Plasma team

773
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,560
has done something special here.

774
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,380
They've cleared another castle.

775
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:07,280
This is a fantastic release.

776
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,760
This is a benchmark for free software releases.

777
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,960
And look, I really enjoy Gnome Shell still these days.

778
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,160
On my single monitor gaming setup, it is choice.

779
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,240
It's great.

780
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,680
I am in my happy place, playing with my machine,

781
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,440
using Gnome Shell.

782
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm even down to give 40 a good go.

783
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,120
But Plasma, that's my workhorse.

784
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,360
Plasma is becoming the ultimate professional workstation.

785
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,400
And it's getting better and faster while doing it.

786
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,560
There's so much we could talk about in 5.21.

787
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,040
I could spend the entire show talking about 5.21.

788
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,840
And it probably deserves it.

789
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,600
But a couple of things that are worth mentioning,

790
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
the new app launcher is great.

791
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,520
I have it installed right here because I'm on Neon.

792
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,240
And they've nailed it.

793
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,120
I'm so proud of them.

794
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,200
I'm so happy with this.

795
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,460
They have really, really nailed this.

796
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,360
And it looks great.

797
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,120
It's functional.

798
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,240
It looks beautiful in dark mode.

799
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,800
You know, the old one, I kind of just ignored, honestly,

800
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,760
especially since KRunner also exists.

801
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,760
But yeah, the new version, I think

802
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,200
I might actually start using.

803
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,840
KRunner's had some improvements too.

804
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,240
They have the new system monitor.

805
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,040
They have that new Breeze Twilight,

806
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,440
which is an interesting idea.

807
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,400
If you like a dark plasma theme, but you

808
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,480
want your applications to be light themed, that's what it does.

809
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,400
There's a lot in here, including new firewall settings,

810
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,640
Discover supporting unattended updates, improvements

811
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,240
in most of the applets.

812
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,040
What they, I feel like, have achieved here,

813
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,280
Wayland support, what I feel like they have achieved here

814
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,760
is like a line in the sand.

815
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,200
With 5.21, this is a new grade of professional workstation

816
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,680
desktop environment.

817
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,000
And it's just really well-refined.

818
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,340
Has anybody in the Mumble Room had a chance to look at this?

819
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,480
Of course.

820
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
What are your thoughts?

821
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,120
I think that with Plasma 5.21, we

822
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,480
have reached a point where I feel genuinely very comfortable

823
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,480
with saying that Plasma is something

824
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,760
that I am willing to recommend by default to people,

825
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,040
rather than feeling a little bit like I

826
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,060
need to wait to see if they don't like the GNOME desktop

827
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,320
experience before going to Plasma,

828
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,960
because it seems to have that polish.

829
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,400
It seems to have that integration.

830
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,960
They're taking paper cuts seriously.

831
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,680
They're doing a great job with the Wayland stuff

832
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,880
to make it so that the experience is smooth and competitive

833
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,960
with Windows and Mac OS.

834
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,120
And really, the remainder bits are,

835
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,540
what do you do for integration?

836
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,600
How do you handle things like preloading and stuff like that?

837
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
And those will all come with time.

838
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,620
But the fact that the desktop itself,

839
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,040
that the core experience is now so solid and so well thought

840
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,360
out, I'm blown away at how well it is.

841
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,120
Like, it's come a long way since when I first

842
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,880
switched to KDE Plasma back in 2013,

843
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,520
after just suffering for a couple of years in GNOME 3

844
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,600
and not being able to deal with the workflow.

845
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,040
That vision from when the first KDE Plasma active stuff

846
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,240
and all that stuff back then in the KDE 4 era, that vision,

847
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,480
I feel, has finally started to be properly realized.

848
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,680
Yeah, to me, it's not a good Linux desktop environment.

849
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,680
It's a good desktop environment, period, for any platform.

850
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,400
And the other thing that I feel like I get with Plasma

851
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,080
to a degree that I don't quite get with GNOME Shell

852
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,360
is true distribution independence.

853
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,420
I can have any distro I want under the hood,

854
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,000
and I get a great Plasma experience.

855
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,280
I can get there, absolutely, with GNOME Shell.

856
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,120
But there's POP's version of GNOME Shell.

857
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,160
There's Ubuntu's version.

858
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,520
There's Fedora's version.

859
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,640
And each of those is a very unique starting point

860
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,360
for building up the GNOME Shell.

861
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,680
And with Plasma, it's like it's just

862
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,160
feels more independent, right?

863
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,360
Yeah, for better or for worse, it feels more independent.

864
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,080
And Wes, I think part of what appeals to me now, too,

865
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,640
is the track record that we're seeing from the project.

866
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,560
Yeah, they've really hit a certain stride.

867
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,680
We've gotten some great updates from Nate Graham's blogging

868
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,820
around this.

869
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,080
And it just feels like it's in a healthy state,

870
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,520
especially with a lot of these whaling improvements

871
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,640
finally addressed, that you can just

872
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,360
count on Plasma being there for you in the future.

873
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,760
Yeah, and you know it's just likely

874
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,440
going to get better and better.

875
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,320
If there is a regression, they've addressed it quickly.

876
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,440
We were looking just before the show,

877
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,840
and I can't remember the exact date.

878
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,760
Oh, yeah, I do.

879
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,860
It was January 29, 2018 is when we installed this Neon

880
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,100
workstation that I'm sitting in front of right now.

881
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,680
And I have updated it at least at a minimum

882
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,680
twice a week since January 29, 2018 with few exceptions.

883
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,240
And I've gone through a different base OS

884
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,680
and many, many Plasma releases.

885
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,480
And in every single release, I have noted something

886
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,080
that I have liked about that upgrade every single time,

887
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,120
every upgrade since 2018.

888
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,240
Sometimes there are a few regressions,

889
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,980
especially if you're riding the Neon edge there.

890
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,700
But those always come with other improvements.

891
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,360
And I think, really, the track record

892
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,720
has been borne out that they get fixed pretty quickly.

893
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,760
I can't think of a lot of niggling little Plasma

894
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,800
issues that have hung around and kept bothering me on Neon.

895
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,200
They kind of just go away.

896
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,320
Yeah, I really do agree with CM in the chat room.

897
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,240
It is the ideal desktop environment

898
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,680
for a distro hopper.

899
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,280
I now run Plasma on, currently, just out of my current mix,

900
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,600
I run it on Ubuntu, I run it on Arch, and I run it on Fedora.

901
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,640
And I run it on different versions of Arch,

902
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,520
and I run it on different versions of Ubuntu,

903
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,840
and I run it on the latest Fedora.

904
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,720
And it's still the same Plasma, still the same window rules.

905
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,760
Everything's, I mean, it's really great.

906
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,560
It is really great, a tool like that.

907
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,000
And I don't know why I don't have that same quite sensation

908
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,840
with GNOME Shell, other than the distro makers generally

909
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,320
just customize it more.

910
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,960
Yeah, well, and it does almost feel like there

911
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,440
are some different use cases.

912
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,240
I think you touched on it there.

913
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,000
And my systems are somewhat the same.

914
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,120
I've got a distro set up for just sort of gaming,

915
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,440
casual use, and GNOME or Pop works really well there.

916
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,560
But when I want things to get out of my way,

917
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,320
when I want to be configurable, the machine I'm using right now

918
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,040
for the live show, that's going to be Plasma.

919
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,160
And I don't see that changing anytime soon.

920
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,400
Where I'm really finding GNOME Shell's working super well

921
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,560
for me is that single monitor laptop setup.

922
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,920
And the one that I'm using for gaming right now,

923
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,760
that G14 that I talked about recently,

924
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,160
that's really a sweet spot for me.

925
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,240
And I think for my son, we were talking

926
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,440
about giving him a new machine last episode.

927
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,600
I think for him, and probably because I'll then hand down

928
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
his machine and down to the younger,

929
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,960
each kid gets a machine iteration essentially.

930
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,920
When I do that, I think all of them

931
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,880
will probably be on GNOME Shell still.

932
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,000
I don't think I'm going to change it for them,

933
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,920
because they're using the computer somewhat for homework,

934
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,920
but their school gives them Chromebooks for that.

935
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,440
They're really using it for play.

936
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,400
And if you have a more casual relationship

937
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,400
with your computer, I think GNOME Shell's perfect for it.

938
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:25,720
Right.

939
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,100
It's sort of that area of, do the defaults

940
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,280
work really nicely for you?

941
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,060
Or do you have specific use cases

942
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,640
where you need more tunability?

943
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,680
And most of the time, no.

944
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,480
But when you do, that's where Plasma really shines.

945
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,680
Yeah, and in a way, Wes, it lets me mentally context shift.

946
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,960
So when I'm on the GNOME desktop,

947
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,120
well, that's my play time.

948
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,240
That's off work time.

949
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,640
That's playing games.

950
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,360
Maybe I don't have my work chat installed on that system.

951
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,080
And then when I am in work mode, I'm in Plasma.

952
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,760
And so in a way, it gives me a bit of a context shift

953
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,680
that I otherwise wouldn't get between personal life and work.

954
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,960
For me, it also sort of means I fuss less with the GNOME setup.

955
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,720
I just let it be GNOME, or POP, or whatever it is over there,

956
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,360
and don't install too many extensions.

957
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,520
Don't try to fight customization there,

958
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,240
because I have that outlet in Plasma.

959
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,200
Totally.

960
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,680
Totally.

961
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,360
That has been the same for me, too.

962
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,600
That has been totally the same.

963
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,160
It's just a few extensions.

964
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,520
I do have Discord installed, but I

965
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,440
don't have any other chat programs installed.

966
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,080
So I'm not getting notifications when I'm

967
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,720
in the middle of doing something.

968
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,920
That's worked out really good.

969
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,040
And you could replicate that on one box.

970
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,680
That doesn't have to be separate boxes.

971
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,760
It could be you have both Plasma and GNOME shell installed,

972
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,840
and you'd log out and log back in when you're done for the day.

973
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,120
Absolutely.

974
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:43,640
Anyways, 5.21 is super, super great.

975
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,360
I invited Nate Graham on to talk about it,

976
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,440
but he's really busy today.

977
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,600
So we may get him on in the future to talk about it.

978
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,840
But this is the release.

979
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,680
This is the one that you want to try out.

980
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,040
If you've been thinking about trying it

981
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,400
when we talked about it, it's just super good.

982
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,640
And I just want to give the project a ton of props,

983
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,120
because I think this is probably one

984
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,520
of the best examples of free software development.

985
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,320
When you want to talk about innovation,

986
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,960
look at what this project is doing,

987
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,040
the features they're bringing that other desktops have never

988
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,440
even thought about, and then just

989
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,040
the continued pace of iteration.

990
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,080
They lost one of their own to COVID recently,

991
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,880
and this release is dedicated to them.

992
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,640
And they kept going as a team.

993
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,840
And I think this is a release they should be super proud of.

994
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,880
So congratulations, guys.

995
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,840
Your job is well done.

996
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,920
You deserve a release party for this one.

997
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:45,440
And honestly, I'm looking forward to seeing GNOME 40.

998
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,280
That's going to be a lot of fun to try out, too.

999
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
It just makes me happy in general.

1000
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,400
We've got multiple great desktops.

1001
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,440
The Wayland work is coming along really nicely

1002
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,200
in all kinds of areas.

1003
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,800
It's just a good time to be a desktop Linux user.

1004
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Yeah, absolutely.

1005
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,640
Datadog.com slash unplug.

1006
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,760
This episode right here is brought to you by Datadog,

1007
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,560
the unified monitoring and analytics platform that

1008
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,320
gives you comprehensive visibility into your cloud.

1009
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,000
If you have a hybrid setup or if you

1010
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,440
have multiple cloud environments.

1011
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,640
I mean, I'm talking about full stack monitoring.

1012
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,080
This is make important business decisions monitoring.

1013
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,440
Data about your entire stack monitoring.

1014
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,480
Quickly analyze the performance of your Linux servers.

1015
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,160
Go in deep.

1016
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,400
Get real-time, customizable dashboards

1017
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,240
that will update and show you exactly what you want to see.

1018
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,840
Have a dashboard for troubleshooting issues.

1019
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,360
Trace something down in seconds.

1020
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,080
Think about it.

1021
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,620
You could build a beautiful dashboard

1022
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,120
because these dashboards are gorgeous.

1023
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,200
Check out datadog.com slash unplug just

1024
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,160
to see the dashboard because they are great.

1025
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,040
But think about this.

1026
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,480
You could build a real-time dashboard that pulls in data

1027
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,120
from your application logs, your system logs,

1028
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,440
has performance traces in there, and you

1029
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,080
can get a snapshot of the health and performance

1030
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,440
of this application stack or your entire infrastructure.

1031
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,960
That is really useful.

1032
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,080
And you can build graphs for over time.

1033
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,680
You can go and get information from containers themselves.

1034
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,920
They recently rewrote their agent in Go,

1035
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,360
so it's really simple to deploy.

1036
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,840
You install it on a Linux box.

1037
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,380
You can get all kinds of information.

1038
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,560
They have multiple ways to monitor, too.

1039
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,240
But you just got to get started by going

1040
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,520

I have a wee spot of follow up for us.

1054
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,880
We talked about a SATA enclosure a couple of episodes

1055
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,480
ago where you put an MVME style M.2 SATA disk in there.

1056
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,280
And then it's essentially a big fat USB stick,

1057
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,600
but you get MVME speeds.

1058
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,680
Right.

1059
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,400
Wes, Wes, you got to get one of these.

1060
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,240
This is, this is, I highly recommend this.

1061
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,440
It's that good?

1062
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,600
You're this excited?

1063
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,480
It's really good.

1064
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,720
This is going to be a game changer for me, because just,

1065
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,760
if it was just the improvement of how fricking fast you

1066
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,800
can copy ISOs over to it, I'd be like, it's worth it.

1067
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,160
But it is a game changer for the live environment.

1068
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,920
It is completely responsive.

1069
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,080
It is, I mean, it's just, it's got

1070
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,360
to be like near the best case you could ever get from USB 3.0.

1071
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,800
It is so fantastic, Wes.

1072
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,440
And you know, with Ventoy on there, it's,

1073
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,880
the combo is so nuts.

1074
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,960
That's what I was just thinking about, like, oh,

1075
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,920
that sounds perfect.

1076
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,600
Yes.

1077
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,080
So that's what I have done is I threw Ventoy on there,

1078
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,460
and then I have the big partition, which I reformatted.

1079
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,960
So this thing's only 256 gigs, but for ISO images,

1080
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,280
I mean, come on, right?

1081
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,400
And it's, I think, all in.

1082
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,640
It's like, I'm under $100 for this whole setup.

1083
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Anyways, so I throw Ventoy on there.

1084
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,000
I reformat the big ISO partition to XF from, what is it,

1085
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,960
originally, Wes, like fat something?

1086
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,880
Yeah, fat or, oh, ex-fat.

1087
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
Yeah, that's what it is.

1088
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,940
Ex-fat, OK.

1089
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,960
Anyways, I reformatted that sucker right away

1090
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,320
to extended 4.

1091
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,200
Debated butter FS, but just opted to keep it simple.

1092
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,280
Keep it simple, sure.

1093
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Went to extended 4 on there.

1094
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,280
And so you plug that into your Linux desktop.

1095
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,960
You mount it, and then it just shows up.

1096
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,800
It doesn't, the Ventoy stuff side, you just ignore that.

1097
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,640
And you throw the ISOs on there.

1098
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,080
And then when you boot off that, it just is lightning fast.

1099
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,520
And the combination of an enclosure

1100
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:46,160
that's like a big thumb drive, but with maximum USB 3 speed,

1101
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,120
it makes booting ISOs just so much smoother, so much faster.

1102
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,760
And if you do that a lot, if you're a distro hopper,

1103
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,300
or you're doing tech support, or you

1104
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,300
need to have multiple ISOs you carry around,

1105
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,440
you've got to do this.

1106
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,400
Take Ventoy, take it off the USB stick,

1107
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,640
and put it on this enclosure.

1108
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,140
I'll have a link in the show notes.

1109
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,080
If I could make this as a swag product and sell it, I would.

1110
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,600
That's how much I like this thing.

1111
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,480
I would love to have a JB branded one of these

1112
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,280
that you could buy.

1113
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,640
It comes with Chris's hand-picked ISOs.

1114
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,160
Yeah.

1115
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,000
Wouldn't that be great?

1116
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,840
I just put the latest Manjaro Gnome Spin on there.

1117
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,440
And it's just such a great way to experience the desktop.

1118
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,720
So I just wanted to give that little bit of a follow up

1119
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
from just a couple episodes ago.

1120
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,760
And we do have a little bit of feedback to get to.

1121
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,080
And we wanted to start with some ARCH upgrade tips.

1122
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,520
This one comes from, I'm going to say Omni,

1123
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,720
because that's a great name.

1124
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,840
I heard you and Wes were upgrading your ARCH server

1125
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,160
a couple of weeks ago, and that you were considering

1126
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,720
giving ARCH to your son.

1127
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,480
May I recommend a package from the AUR

1128
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,480
to remove most, if not all, upgrade uncertainties

1129
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,540
with ARCH?

1130
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,200
It's called Informant.

1131
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,360
And as you know, ARCH officially requires

1132
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,440
you to read its news before you upgrade.

1133
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,100
It is on you to go read the news.

1134
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,640
There may be manual intervention,

1135
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,120
and that's where they're going to tell you about it.

1136
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,900
But it's a pain in the neck to do that every time you upgrade,

1137
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,800
which, if you're like some of us, is 10 times a day,

1138
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,600
he says.

1139
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,760
Well, Informant installs a Pac-Man hook

1140
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,300
such that when there is news, it won't upgrade

1141
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,680
until you apply the required manual intervention

1142
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,200
and then mark the news as read.

1143
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,120
And it's just an AUR install away.

1144
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,600
So I put that on my box right away.

1145
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,400
I know we've kind of talked about this before.

1146
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,320
Wes, you ever tried it?

1147
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,440
No, you know, I haven't.

1148
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,280
I've sort of relied on my hopefulness

1149
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,120
that I'll check before upgrading or have the skill

1150
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,000
to figure out if I don't do that and fix

1151
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
whatever is wrong by then eventually reading the blog.

1152
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,900
That's worked OK.

1153
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,220
But this seems maybe ideal for a case

1154
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,840
where you're providing support and you just want to say,

1155
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,120
all right, Delamuul, if you run into this,

1156
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,940
I mean, if he's not comfortable doing it,

1157
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,200
that's a perfect sign to go call dad.

1158
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,160
That was your humble brag way of saying, I follow the news.

1159
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,280
Sometimes.

1160
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,560
No, but you're right, it is great.

1161
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,640
That's probably a good, solid thing to have on the server,

1162
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,940
just to remind us, since we don't upgrade it frequently,

1163
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,320
and definitely for a laptop for like a kid or myself.

1164
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,840
I put it on my box because why not?

1165
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,400
You know, just see how it goes.

1166
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,240
Do you want to take Frank the Tank's email?

1167
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,880
Yes, I mean, we've got some great names

1168
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,760
writing into us today.

1169
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,480
Frank the Tank had a similar take

1170
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,840
on thoughts for Arch on the laptop of Dylan.

1171
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,680
And he points us to some comments back from October,

1172
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,200
pointing to issues with NVIDIA drivers and kernels

1173
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,680
greater than 5.9.

1174
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,160
Mostly to say, you really should probably

1175
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,880
consider the LTS kernel.

1176
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,280
There might be changes, especially

1177
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,540
if you're using something like NVIDIA graphics, which

1178
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,260
I think on that laptop you are.

1179
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,560
Those two systems don't always play nicely.

1180
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,960
So either choose a distro that's not going to get into this,

1181
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,040
or try to find the bits of stability that you can in Arch.

1182
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,240
I think that's solved now with the latest kernel.

1183
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,800
That whole, remember that whole GPL condom-inspired issue?

1184
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,480
I think that's pretty much resolved now.

1185
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,120
But it's a good note, Frank, that it

1186
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,120
is another example of the kind of thing that

1187
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,880
can come up that the LTS kernel will steer you away from.

1188
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,920
Right, and you're just going to be on that cutting edge

1189
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,400
right there.

1190
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,020
Because yeah, sure, this one is solved.

1191
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,640
But there very well could be future problems like this.

1192
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,360
Not that they're huge problems, but just that they

1193
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,560
do have to get figured out.

1194
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,780
It can take some time.

1195
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,080
And if you don't follow the latest kernel development,

1196
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,540
maybe you don't listen to Linux Unplugged for some reason,

1197
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,720
then you might run into issues that you just

1198
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,640
don't want to deal with.

1199
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,040
Don't listen to Unplugged.

1200
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,880
Come on.

1201
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,360
Come on.

1202
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,320
That's not happening.

1203
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,680
All right, we have one pick this week.

1204
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,120
And I didn't even warn you about this one, Wes.

1205
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,160
But you were chatting about it.

1206
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,280
And I just grabbed it from our chat conversation

1207
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:53,060
and threw it in here because, man, this looks really cool.

1208
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,760
And I would love you to explain it to me.

1209
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,600
It's called Sonobus.

1210
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,240
And the subheadline is, it's a high quality network audio

1211
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,680
streaming system.

1212
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,560
That's all I know.

1213
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,480
Yeah, this looks like a tool that we might want to adopt.

1214
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,320
So it's open source, easy to use,

1215
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,080
runs as just an application.

1216
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,440
You can get it on iOS even, or Mac, or Windows,

1217
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,440
or they've got instructions for building it on Linux.

1218
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,360
You can even run it as a VST if you want.

1219
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,240
And it's kind of like some of the software

1220
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,040
we're using already to talk right now for the show.

1221
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,120
But runs as an application.

1222
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,040
It's open source.

1223
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,200
And you don't have to rely on a hosted service.

1224
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,500
Oh, you mean we could do it for real time chat?

1225
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,000
Yes.

1226
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,400
And if you take a look, it's got a really neat UI.

1227
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,480
It shows all the different tracks in there.

1228
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,200
It gives you some waveform previews.

1229
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,160
It's got recording.

1230
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,880
One thing I haven't figured out is if it's got local recording

1231
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,800
yet, that'll be next.

1232
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,860
But it's got Opus integrated right in there,

1233
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,040
configurability around what kind of bit rates you're sending.

1234
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,480
And then it does just direct peer-to-peer streaming.

1235
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,160
So perhaps future episodes of this here show

1236
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,800
could be recorded using such a thing.

1237
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,300
They've also got some nice docs too.

1238
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,000
So whether you're trying to record a podcast,

1239
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,280
or maybe you're in a band and you miss hanging out

1240
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,520
and playing with your bandmates, they've

1241
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,260
got some good docs for getting this set up.

1242
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,760
And I think the biggest thing to me

1243
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,760
is that they do have those docs.

1244
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,160
They've got binaries available for Mac, Windows, and iOS.

1245
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,400
That goes a long way, because sure, we've all got Linux.

1246
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,840
We're comfortable building things from a Git repository.

1247
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,740
But when you add on that to the already sometimes complex

1248
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,440
nature of getting audio set up for non-technical users,

1249
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,760
you just want it to be as plug and play as possible.

1250
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,920
And Sonobus looks like a great fit.

1251
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,640
Yeah, check it out at sonobus.net.

1252
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,720
And of course, we'll have a link in the show notes.

1253
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,920
If you've got a cool app, or an email, or feedback

1254
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,560
that you'd like to share with us,

1255
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,520
anything we've talked about is fair game.

1256
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,800
We'd love to get your feedbacks, and your show ideas,

1257
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,880
and questions for the show.

1258
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,720
In fact, we're kicking around an email that was sent into the show

1259
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,200
this week.

1260
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,480
And we're holding it right now, because we're

1261
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,560
thinking maybe we'll just base an entire episode

1262
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,120
off that email.

1263
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:57,920
It's possible, too.

1264
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,520
So we'd love to get your feedback

1265
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,920
at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1266
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,000
I also want to thank our members who

1267
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,320
have supported the Unplugged show with their contributions.

1268
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,600
The Unplugged core is at unpluggedcore.com.

1269
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,920
And you can become a core contributor,

1270
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,680
help keep this show independent for as long as this is a show,

1271
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,280
and you reduce the amount of ads we

1272
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,640
need to make the show profitable.

1273
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,600
But you get some perks, too, as a thank you.

1274
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,020
When you become a core contributor,

1275
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,040
you get access to two feeds, your choice,

1276
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,160
the limited ad version of the show, same production,

1277
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,880
just limited ads, or the full live stream,

1278
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,920
where you'll actually hear us reformatting

1279
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,600
this show a little bit in real time on today's pre-show.

1280
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,220
And you get a lot more of that, too.

1281
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,880
That's in the second feed.

1282
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,800
You know, we don't say this often, Wes,

1283
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,440
but it's also the best way to get the show immediately.

1284
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,720
Because Wes and I hustle after we get off the air

1285
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,600
to get the full live stream published.

1286
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,640
So that way, if you can't make it,

1287
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,920
but you want to get the show for a Tuesday evening commute

1288
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,360
or something like that, that's another good reason

1289
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,160
to become a member.

1290
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,320
Because we give it our best to get the full live feed

1291
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,840
published as soon as we can after the show.

1292
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,960
It's not immediate, but we do our best.

1293
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,480
You can get that at unpluggedcore.com.

1294
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,360
And thanks to everybody who does support the show.

1295
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,600
We appreciate you.

1296
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,640
We really do.

1297
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,360
And don't forget about the coder, the coder.shop.

1298
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,640
It's Jupiter Broadcasting's first swag item in like forever.

1299
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,920
And you can get that at the coder.shop.

1300
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,760
Clear room in the closet, Mr. Payne.

1301
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,280
Yours is on the way.

1302
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,720
Oh, boy.

1303
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,520
OK.

1304
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,040
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this show

1305
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
at Linux Unplugged.

1306
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,160
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1307
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,560
And all of the great shows, you can find more of them

1308
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,600
at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1309
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,220
Self-hosted's coming out later this week.

1310
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:53,320
And Alex shares a super cool file manager web-based app

1311
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:57,240
that you can self-host that I wish I would have found first.

1312
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,800
But that'll be in self-hosted and a lot more

1313
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,120
at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1314
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,580
And everything we talked about today

1315
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,840
is at Linux Unplugged, LinuxUnplugged.com

1316
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,880
slash 393 for our links.

1317
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1318
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,120
of The Unplugged Program.

1319
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,440
And I'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1320
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,080
Oh

1321
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:53,800
JBtitles.com.

1322
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,760
So I tried out enlightenment really briefly last week.

1323
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,760
What?

1324
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,760
Sneaky.

1325
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,920
You know what I thought would be great is my center monitor stays on one workspace and

1326
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,240
then separate workspaces for my two edge monitors.

1327
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,000
I just wanted two so I could have like a business side, you know, so I could just flip between

1328
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:20,320
them, but had to hard bail, hard, hard bail on enlightenment because first of all, I have

1329
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,440
this horrible thing where my monitor assignment when you first log into a graphical desktop

1330
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,440
is all crazy.

1331
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,020
My desktop is the wrong orientation because I have two vertical screens.

1332
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:30,520
The monitors are all out of order.

1333
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,520
The wrong primary screen is always set.

1334
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,560
I mean, it's real bad.

1335
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,600
It's one of the reasons why I had to get off Gnome Shell on that box because every time

1336
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,720
I'd wake up from sleep, I would reorder all of my screens and even an X-Ranger script

1337
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,680
could only do so much for me.

1338
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,000
So I have not had that problem with plasma.

1339
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So I log into enlightenment.

1340
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,680
I'm like, oh, right.

1341
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,160
Here's the thing, though, guys, and I would just I just installed enlightenment from from

1342
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,160
arch.

1343
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,080
So it's, you know, whatever is in arch is repo.

1344
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,080
Wow.

1345
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,200
The display manager, it doesn't have a graphical layout for arranging your screens.

1346
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,500
Like you have to say this monitor is left of this monitor.

1347
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,760
This monitor is right of this monitor.

1348
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,760
This monitor set.

1349
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,320
And then it doesn't identify which monitors it thinks are one, two or three.

1350
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,120
It just lists them, but it doesn't actually tell you like this one's monitor one.

1351
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,120
This one.

1352
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,160
So you so you just have to say I just had to start guessing, OK, this one's going to

1353
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
be left of this one.

1354
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
This one's right of this one.

1355
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,160
Apply.

1356
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,160
Oh, no.

1357
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,160
Got that wrong.

1358
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,160
And then I do that two or three times.

1359
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Crash.

1360
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Hard crash.

1361
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
Guru meditation error.

1362
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,160
So then I do that a couple more times.

1363
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,160
Crash.

1364
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Guru meditation error.

1365
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,160
Then I do that one more time.

1366
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Crash.

1367
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Do that one more time.

1368
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,160
Crash.

1369
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,160
Do that one more time.

1370
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,160
Crash.

1371
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,160
It starts crashing every time.

1372
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,160
So then I reboot, log back in, make a few more changes.

1373
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Crash.

1374
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,160
And it was rough.

1375
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,680
It was really rough because I couldn't just visually lay them out.

1376
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,300
And God bless it, I even I even launched a render because I have the gooey graphical

1377
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,200
front end to X render, laid it out in there.

1378
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,200
Hit apply.

1379
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,880
It applies for like two seconds.

1380
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,440
And then like enlightenment says, oh, I need to resume your layout for you.

1381
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,680
And it reverts it back to the horrible layout.

1382
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,680
Oh, no.

1383
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,340
I disabled that setting in the display manager.

1384
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,340
It still does it.

1385
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:07,560
And then when I go to change it crash and I could tell it was close at one point, but

1386
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,560
it just got so crashy.

1387
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,600
I bailed.

1388
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,920
But it enlightenment does have the ability for like my side displays to have their own

1389
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,920
virtual desktops.

1390
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,920
And that would be so awesome.

1391
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,040
I got close, but I had to walk away.

1392
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:42,800
I had to go back to plasma.
