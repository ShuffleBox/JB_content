1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
I wouldn't want to judge you for using Outlook, Wes, but rumor has it you have a little Outlook

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,960
rant for us.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
A little pre-show Outlook.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,600
It was just a weird experience.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, at work we have Outlook 365, and honestly it's fine.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,640
It works with Linux, obviously, because it's a web client.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,720
It meets my needs.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
And they pay for it.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,720
How practical of you.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
Yeah.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,040
Not what I would set up for myself at home, but I don't have to.

12
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,560
I was trying to send a SQL dump, right?

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,080
So I gzipped it to save space, getting ready to email it, send it off.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,880
A couple hours later I get a, you know, come back and say, hey, could you send that again?

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,880
This looks like a binary data file.

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,320
And I was like, all right, maybe I made a mistake.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,480
I know how gzip works.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,720
So I didn't think so.

19
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,700
It turns out anything with a.gz extension, Outlook gzips.

20
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,440
Like it will just, so it was a doubly gzipped file.

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,280
Why would you do it on something that has a.gz?

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,440
I don't know.

23
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,400
So I tried with.xz,.bz2.

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Like none of those.

25
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Doesn't touch them.

26
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,520
Doesn't touch zip files, but it wasn't even after sending it, all I had to do was attach

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
it.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,960
So like once it uploaded through the browser, it even was to the point where if you, if

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,200
I made a tar and I named it tar.gz, just change the file name and then upload it, it would

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,800
then decompress it for me.

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
And it doesn't add an extra gz.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
No.

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
So that was just bizarre.

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,080
And it took me way too long to figure out what was going on.

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,640
I was like, why can't I send this guy a file?

36
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,760
And then how was it, how was the checksum different after all I did was upload it to

37
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
them?

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't know if it's a consequence of them trying to do virus scans or just a bug on

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
their end.

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Hey, you know what?

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Notify them about it.

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,120
You got to make sure that those PST files don't get too big, Wes.

43
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
That's true.

44
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
We got a pixel 2 leak.

45
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
This is funny.

46
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Did the doorbell ring or did I just imagine that?

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,440
No that, well, I am pulling the case out of the box and I accidentally punched myself

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
in the nose.

49
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Oh my God, Ben.

50
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Oh my God.

51
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,320
That's not great.

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:09,440
This is Linux Unplugged episode 215 for September 19th, 2017.

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show, or at least part of it's getting

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,240
ready to ship out to New York.

55
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
My name is Chris.

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
My name is Wes.

57
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Hello, Wes.

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Hello, sir.

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,760
And as always these days, it's the beard, what's up beard?

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Not much.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Good.

62
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Good.

63
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm glad because you know what?

64
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
I got a little podcast I need you to help me with right now.

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
That would be great.

66
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm down.

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
All right.

68
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Well, we've got a great show coming up on this week's episode.

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,600
We're going to cover some community news that I figure we should talk about.

70
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,120
That's what we'll do at the top of the show.

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,040
Then just a little bit into the show, we have a special guest joining us from the newly

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,540
announced PipeWire project.

73
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,840
Very excited to jump into this project, explain what it's about, clear up some misconceptions

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,680
and hopefully get to the bottom of why Linux needs a little something like this.

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,160
Then I hope you'll stick with me to the end of the show because I got something I got

76
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,720
to get off my chest.

77
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,640
It is an issue that is near and dear to my heart.

78
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,960
It's not really unfamiliar to some of you on this show.

79
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,640
I hope you'll stick around because it's something that's super important I want to talk to you

80
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
about.

81
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,160
And I think it has major ramifications for the entire open source community.

82
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,240
So we'll dig into that towards the end of the show.

83
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,200
But before we can do any of that, there's one ritual in which we must always follow.

84
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,160
And that is saying hello to our virtual log.

85
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,960
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

86
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Hey babe.

87
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Good day.

88
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Hey there.

89
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,960
Hello guys.

90
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
Hello.

91
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Hello.

92
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Look at that.

93
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
You guys all came to say goodbye to me.

94
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,960
You guys all come leaving right after the show and they all knew that they knew that

95
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,280
they're going to storm the studio try to take over and then I'm driving to see poppy.

96
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
That's my plan.

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,960
That's really why I'm going because poppy is going to be there.

98
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
There's some others.

99
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
Big draw.

100
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
There's some other people there.

101
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,760
I mean, I heard Ike is going so I almost considered not going obviously, of course, but stay in

102
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
North Dakota.

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
Yeah.

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Is that why you're bringing Noah's insurance?

105
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Yeah.

106
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Well, I got to have my muscle.

107
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,480
You know, I heard Ike wants to throw things at me from windows.

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
So I got to be ready.

109
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
I got to be.

110
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll admit I'm fairly jealous.

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm looking forward to it.

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,680
Anyways, let's let's get into some of the news today.

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,420
I think this first story is pretty big for a lot of us more and more so for me these

114
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,360
days because I found myself on public Wi-Fi a lot.

115
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,840
Core has a new release that I think is pretty interesting and it is specifically version

116
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,360
3.2.1 alpha with support for the next generation onion services.

117
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,440
This is, I think, inspired after some recent trouble that they've had.

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,760
It uses the new version three of the onion service protocol and it adds a new circuit

119
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
scheduler.

120
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,480
Hey, that sounds good.

121
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
It does sound good.

122
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,180
That's like that sounds good for more responsive forwarding decisions from relays, which also

123
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,540
seems like a great thing.

124
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,800
There's a bunch of other changes in here, too.

125
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm actually just telling you just the super, super highlights of it.

126
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,080
They have new major features that I can only barely understand, but it's called the kernel

127
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,280
informed socket transport.

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,520
Yeah.

129
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
How about that?

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,800
It's available on Linux system.

131
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
It uses feedback from the kernel to prevent the kernel's TCP buffers from growing too

132
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
full.

133
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Oh, nice.

134
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
Okay.

135
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Yeah.

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,520
Which I would imagine probably has big improvements for Tor network speeds.

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah.

138
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,960
So that's the new version 3.2.1 alpha.

139
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
That's a great step in there.

140
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Yeah.

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
Yeah.

142
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Are you much of a Tor user?

143
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
I feel like I'm a criminal when I'm on Tor, but I've been thinking more and more about

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
it.

145
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,200
I've been using a VPN a lot these days.

146
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Using that.

147
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I have certain...

148
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I don't use it a lot currently.

149
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,720
I have certainly used it in the past and I'm glad it exists and glad that they're making

150
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
good progress.

151
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,920
I'm sure, Beard, when you're hanging out on the dark web, you're probably using the Tor

152
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
as well.

153
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Yeah.

154
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
All the time.

155
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Yeah.

156
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Yeah.

157
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm only on the dark web.

158
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Yeah.

159
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
That's...

160
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Yeah, exactly.

161
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
I mean, I guess you stream on the regular P web, but you just...

162
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Because that's where the eyeballs are.

163
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
Yeah.

164
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
I use dark Twitch.

165
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Oh, dark Twitch.

166
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Gotcha.

167
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Dark Twitch.

168
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
Good, good, good.

169
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
It's got a lot of illegal things on it.

170
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
Yeah.

171
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
It's far more interesting than regular Twitch.

172
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,520
Well, when you're using your dark web, you can also use Keybase teams to kick Slack in

173
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
the balls.

174
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,480
It is a new app to replace Slack and it uses their famed security and encryption by default.

175
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,160
It's got channels like Slack or your Discord out there.

176
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,960
It's end-to-end encrypted, which means you don't have to worry about their server reading

177
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,640
it, they say.

178
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,760
And you can lay awake at night fearing the breach of your company.

179
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,360
You don't have to lay awake, I guess.

180
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,980
They say that's either use their system or lay awake at night.

181
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,080
That's pretty hyperbole.

182
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,580
But anyways, they say Keybase accounts are simpler.

183
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,760
You don't have to switch at the top level of an app.

184
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,320
Teams can be casual and small.

185
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Nice.

186
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,720
That is kind of a cool idea.

187
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,960
It's quaint how we try to do this.

188
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,000
I mean, good luck to...

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,320
I like Keybase.io, respect the people over there.

190
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,560
Good luck to you.

191
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,320
Good luck to you.

192
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,380
Looking in the good footsteps of Skype competitors and Facebook competitors and everyone who

193
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,720
likes to launch an alternative to a platform, Goliath, I say, good luck to you.

194
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I think...

195
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,480
You know what I've been saying, gosh, Rocket Chat and Matrix, and just not enough.

196
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Not enough.

197
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
It matters most.

198
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah.

199
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Not enough.

200
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Not enough.

201
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,400
And Nextcloud is also kind of squaring in on this, too.

202
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,760
And not enough.

203
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,560
And I'm glad the guys at Keybase recognized this need as well that none of us had and

204
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
decided to set up a...

205
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Set up a affiliate.

206
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Now...

207
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,960
It's not like we also had a specific one from Amazon or anything.

208
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
No.

209
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
This is not enough.

210
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Just not enough.

211
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
So that's good.

212
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
And I hope them...

213
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
I wish for them the best because it seems like they're a great team over there.

214
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,300
And if nothing else, I'd rest a little more comfortable thinking open source projects use

215
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,160
something like this or at least your Isises and your Alcataz.

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
This would be nice for them.

217
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,220
Oh, yeah.

218
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,080
I like the no upsell about message history.

219
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
That's...

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Yeah.

221
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
That makes it nice for me.

222
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
That is nice.

223
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
That is nice.

224
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
And you know, as your terrorist cells have to migrate off of Telegram, they got to go

225
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
to something else.

226
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
They got to go to something.

227
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,520
Governments got to lean on something new.

228
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,160
So I think this makes a lot of sense.

229
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,600
And you can find out more at Keybase.io slash blog, and we will have a link in the show

230
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
notes.

231
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,880
I want to talk about something serious that happened yesterday, September 18th, 2017.

232
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,120
And it was the EFF formally resigning from the W3C.

233
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,960
And now the W3C is the, quote, unquote, standards body that has standardized the recent encryption

234
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,040
media extensions that all browsers happily lapped up.

235
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,960
Well, I guess not all.

236
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,280
And as you can imagine, Cory Doctorow and his colleagues at the EFF were very disappointed

237
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,920
and they challenged this decision.

238
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,080
There's a lot of controversy about how that challenge was handled.

239
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,960
And now that things have run their course as a result of the way things have ended up

240
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,960
on behalf of the EFF, Cory Doctorow has resigned from the W3C and has also publicly said here

241
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,000
in his post that they will defend those who are put in harm's way for blowing the whistle

242
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,280
on defects in EME implementations.

243
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,400
In other words, the EFF is publicly stating they will defend people who try to crack EME.

244
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,640
This is a really complex issue because you have what are the expectations of what the

245
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,800
W3C actually is expected to do in this day and age, especially the way browsers are actually

246
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
developed and the reality of the actual market.

247
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,600
What were the EFF's expectations?

248
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,360
And you could debate EME as a topic itself.

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Right.

250
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,260
Then there's a separate tertiary debate on how the W3C handled the challenge to this

251
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,480
entire thing.

252
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,280
So this is a deeply complex issue.

253
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,360
And as usual the dialogue is just mostly consisted of people shouting at each other so far and

254
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
making rage quit posts.

255
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,880
I thought that's how arguments work, Chris.

256
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Don't you know?

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
That's how you get to the bottom of everything.

258
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,760
Now I will give Cory Doctorow, the man writes, the best rage quit post of them.

259
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,840
This is an example for the internet on how to write an eloquent rage quit.

260
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Really well done.

261
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll keep that in my back pocket for the future.

262
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,520
Definitely gives the umplexed dab of approval there.

263
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,200
So that was a big movement story that we're following here and I think it's one of those

264
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,880
where we have to wait for a lot of the hype to settle too.

265
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Yes.

266
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,080
Speaking of hype, speaking of hype, let's see, we're going right through the news because

267
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm very, you can tell I'm excited to talk about pipeline.

268
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Oh yeah.

269
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,560
So we're just busting through this stuff.

270
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,480
1804, speaking of hype, Ubuntu 1804.

271
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
You're ready.

272
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
You're ready already.

273
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Oh my body's super ready.

274
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,600
And as you know, Popeye's good buddy Dustin Kirkland was out scouring the web to get

275
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,880
users feedback on what default application should be in 1804.

276
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
In fact, here's from the horse's mouth.

277
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,320
We asked the community across three different forums, when I posted the previous thread

278
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,840
about what do you want to see in 1710 to Hacker News, I immediately got emails from the editors

279
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,640
of both Reddit and Slashdot saying, you know, our users want to contribute to this thread

280
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
as well.

281
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,800
And so I said in the future we'd certainly make this, we'd open up the feedback to Reddit

282
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,420
and Slashdot.

283
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,920
And so we posted this in July and it was a coordinated effort as opposed to the first

284
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,620
one, which was something that we just sort of shot from the hip.

285
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,360
This was one that we put together.

286
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,120
I worked with Will Cook, who's the desktop manager at Canonical and some of his team

287
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,320
to put together what amounted to a survey for the desktop apps.

288
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,120
What desktop apps do you use on Ubuntu?

289
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,240
Out of curiosity, did anyone here contribute to that survey?

290
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,080
So Dustin goes on to provide some of the data that people suggested for default applications

291
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:32,100
in 1804 and you might be shocked, I say shocked at the conclusion.

292
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,760
Desktop users like to use the same old boring crap that they've always liked to use.

293
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,920
It seems overwhelmingly the data revealed that people would like to see Firefox as the

294
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,380
default web browser, Thunderbird is the default email client, VLC is the default video and

295
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,320
music player, LibreOffice is the default office suite, geedit as the default text editor,

296
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,760
and Nautilus as the default file manager.

297
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,120
Everybody shocked because they also would like to see Gnome Terminal as the terminal

298
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,320
emulator, GIMP is the image editor, Pigeon is the chat messenger, Gnome Calendar, etc.

299
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,140
Now, not too surprising, I was a little disappointed in the VLC on this whole list and Thunderbird

300
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,600
a bit, but VLC mostly because it feels like a list of people that are stuck in the mud.

301
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
Sorry, but Gnome MPV clearly better.

302
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,400
Anyways, moving on from that, perhaps realizing that the vast majority of people taking the

303
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
survey had no taste.

304
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm totally kidding.

305
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I'm teasing.

306
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
VLC is great.

307
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I use it.

308
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I mean, it's totally fine.

309
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,880
Yeah, I use it as well, but it's kind of frustrating that we can't have something you might love

310
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
and share some respect.

311
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,640
I would prefer to have Chrome.

312
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,260
I would prefer to have Gnome MPV.

313
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,720
But Gnome MPV seems like an even stronger argument to me because we should also be excited

314
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,560
and we don't want to hype and we want to still love on VLC, but there's a cool new open source

315
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,980
option that maybe people aren't hearing about or don't consider.

316
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,640
So to this end, this means Dustin says that they are investigating a potential approach

317
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,480
to make Ubuntu desktop experience perhaps a little bit more like choose your own adventure

318
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,020
where you could plug in the different applications you want.

319
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,700
That's pretty probably out there, but it is something they're considering is maybe in

320
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,480
the future you'll just plug in Gnome MPV and plug in Vim and Emacs for all the things.

321
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,360
Poppy, you were sitting in the room there, I saw your magnificent head a few times.

322
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,160
Is there anything, any takeaways from that talk that Dustin had that you wanted to share

323
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
with the class?

324
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,820
Yeah, I think one of the things you've got to be aware of is a lot of people don't actually

325
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,480
use desktop email clients or desktop music players.

326
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,840
A lot of people use the cloud for their calendar and everything.

327
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,160
So I mean, the graph was a long tale.

328
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,800
He showed graphs of how many people responded to each of those categories.

329
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,680
And yeah, sure enough, Thunderbird was on the far left hand side and a very tall graph.

330
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,680
But there are a ton of people who just wrote Google or Google Calendar because their calendaring

331
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,760
is synced to their phone and is done in the browser.

332
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,400
And similarly, there are a bunch of people who use Spotify for their music or Pandora

333
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,680
or something else.

334
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,680
There's a significantly sized trend of people who just don't use desktop applications for

335
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,760
doing their daily stuff and the vast majority of it is done in the browser.

336
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Look at a Chromebook.

337
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,080
The vast majority of people who use Chromebooks are perfectly happy and can listen to music

338
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,840
and can look at their calendar.

339
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,880
They just don't use big fat applications to do it.

340
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,200
Yeah, I did notice that.

341
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
There was a very long tale.

342
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,680
Just about everything you could imagine or name was on there to some degree.

343
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,540
And to your point about GNOME MPV, I think a sizable proportion of the open source community

344
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:39,000
had no idea that exists, like VLC is in everyone's head, the stupid little icon that everybody

345
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,120
recognizes that everyone has fondness at Christmas when it's got snow and a hat on it.

346
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,160
That's what GNOME MPV needs to compete and really take over.

347
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Right.

348
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Yeah, that's what you need.

349
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,920
You need a comedy icon is what you need for your application.

350
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,580
But I think a significant people just don't know GNOME MPV exists and don't realize that

351
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,640
it may or may not be better than VLC because VLC for many years has been the go to application

352
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
for that.

353
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Yeah.

354
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,920
And if you're coming from Windows, too, it's much more likely to be something used on Windows.

355
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
It's probably easy.

356
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Oh, shoot, great.

357
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
It's got VLC.

358
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Woo.

359
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:19,120
My favorite was the guy who replied for every single application category, Emacs, except

360
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
text editor.

361
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,040
Vim is for the text editor, yeah.

362
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,600
One of the things that was actually just side note, too, really kind of interesting is not

363
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,400
only was it obvious a lot of people were doing software as a service, but Rhythmbox was surprisingly

364
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,600
well represented in the data, which-

365
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Interesting.

366
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,080
Yeah, that surprised me a little bit, but I'm trying to...

367
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
There was one pop-in.

368
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,360
You might remember what it was where, oh, it was VLC actually, wasn't it?

369
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,120
Nobody was really using Totem, even though Totem was the default out of the box in Ubuntu

370
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
desktop.

371
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,040
Most people switched to VLC, which was sort of an unusual trend.

372
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,920
Yeah, I think there's a sizable number of people who just default to VLC, and that's

373
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,440
just what they use.

374
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,560
But also, we've tried to make Totem so that it can play anything.

375
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,920
I know the upstream developers and the people on GStreamer and Upstream Gnome have all tried

376
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,800
to make it as slick as possible that when Totem can't play something, it does the right

377
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,800
thing.

378
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,600
It goes and gets the right codec package or whatever, and it should.

379
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,440
But sometimes that fails, and people have got it ingrained in their head that when Totem

380
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
fails, I install VLC.

381
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,480
And I think it's got to the point where people preemptively install VLC just to avoid having

382
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
that situation.

383
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
It works.

384
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Yeah, yeah.

385
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,360
VLC, MPV, I have the codecs built in automatically and you don't have to worry about it.

386
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,360
I haven't actually tried Totem in a couple of years solely because every time I tried

387
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,920
it, it was like, hey, you want to install this thing?

388
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,400
No, I'll just install another application.

389
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Yeah.

390
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,400
That whole thing, years and years ago, I remember when I used to run Windows before Linux came

391
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
along.

392
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,200
There was all these little special packages of codecs that you would install and you'd

393
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,040
get these codec packs from here and a codec pack from there.

394
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,760
And then when I moved to Linux, there was still like, oh, you got to go and get this

395
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,840
codec pack and you got to get I just never do any of that anymore.

396
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,520
It's just not a thing.

397
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,780
And I'm frankly surprised that people still consider the fact that one distro ships codecs

398
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,440
over another one that doesn't is still a thing as well, because, you know, I just never install

399
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
it.

400
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:28,680
And I, you know, view some ropey, dodgy MP4 and strangely encoded stuff all over the place

401
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,160
and it all just works.

402
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,560
So maybe that's a solved problem.

403
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
I think it is.

404
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,840
We should certainly be grateful anyway.

405
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,600
The whole talk's pretty good.

406
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,120
It's a little like a little bit of getting inside the head of the semi silent majority

407
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,400
that runs Linux.

408
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,160
It's not like the total silent majority because they obviously fill out the survey.

409
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,720
But it was over 10,000 respondents across multiple sites.

410
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,440
It was a huge one of the number one threads on Hacker News for a long time.

411
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
So you got quite a bit of data.

412
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,640
They did some language processing against it, did a lot of reading.

413
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,200
And Dustin just does like a high level overview of what some of the team has pulled out.

414
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,460
And that video is embedded in the show notes.

415
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,000
If you'd like to watch the whole thing and get inside the head of the average Linux user

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,360
or quote unquote, I don't know about average because they're on Hacker News and other sites.

417
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:21,060
But maybe your typical DevOps, IT, sysadmin, cloud worker, what do we call these people

418
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,240
that they're trying to target these days?

419
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,400
That category of user, that's who they got to hear from.

420
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,080
So if I were a System76 or a Dell or an Intraware, I think I'd be watching that talk by Dustin

421
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,700
and just getting a little insight into what the users are doing with the system once you

422
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
ship it.

423
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
All right.

424
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
We got to talk about pipeline.

425
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,440
Well, we'll get into why I think it's going to be great.

426
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,880
Let's take a moment right here and thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the show.

427
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,600
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to support the show and sign up for a free seven day

428
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
trial.

429
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,120
And that's sweet because you can kick the tires and get an idea of what the platform

430
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
is capable of.

431
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,140
It's a full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

432
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,640
advance your career.

433
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,880
Self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux cloud and DevOps topic with hands on

434
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,680
scenario based labs give you real experience and confidence to work with it.

435
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,200
Stream paths, which are a series of courses and content planned by instructors for a career

436
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
track you're trying to get into, human beings when you need them, which is unique and great

437
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,960
for an online platform like this, exams and practice quizzes and things like that to get

438
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
you ready for the test.

439
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,280
And they also have certification training, which are courses that are created specifically

440
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,540
to prepare you for the exam.

441
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,600
One of my favorite features is you choose your distribution.

442
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,240
The courseware matches that and the cloud servers that they spin up for you on demand

443
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,560
when you need them and then you can SSH into to work all match.

444
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,560
And they have nuggets when you're busy, they have course schedulers when you need to stick

445
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,040
to a time when you're just crazy busy, like maybe you're going to New York or something

446
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
like that.

447
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,320
They got course schedules for that.

448
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,320
It's great.

449
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,920
It's one of my favorite features.

450
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,480
And also I loaded up their iOS app on the old iPad and tried that out on the road trip.

451
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
That seems very convenient.

452
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Yeah.

453
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
Yeah.

454
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
I'm excited about that.

455
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,320
If you want to sign up for a free seven day trial and a big thank you to Linux Academy

456
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,640
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

457
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,880
So PipeWire, a game changer in Linux multimedia possibly.

458
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,360
I'm very, very excited to, I'm going to say Wim.

459
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,720
Is that how you say your first name?

460
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Wim Tamus?

461
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
How do you say it?

462
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Give me your whole name.

463
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I sound like a jackass.

464
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,520
It's pronounced Wim Tiamans.

465
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Okay.

466
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,560
And you're going by W-Tay here in the mumble room.

467
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,040
So thank you for joining us, Wim.

468
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,600
It's great to chat with you.

469
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,960
I'm glad to be here.

470
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,200
I've been kind of tangently covering PipeWire, but I don't really, obviously I don't know

471
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,280
much about it because it's so new.

472
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,120
So could you kind of give the audience a basic overview of what PipeWire is?

473
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,560
Because a lot of them are going to be familiar with things like Gstreamer, PulseAudio and

474
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,440
those types of technologies, but I don't think they're familiar with PipeWire yet.

475
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Yeah.

476
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:14,560
So it's a new attempt to try to combine the good things that you can find in Gstreamer

477
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,520
and in Jack and a bit in PulseAudio and also in the CRAS audio server.

478
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,280
That's a Chromium audio server.

479
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,360
So yeah, it's kind of like Gstreamer, but different, built differently.

480
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:40,320
So there's plugins that is more like modeled around real-time plugins, the kinds that you

481
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:50,720
find like in lots power LV2, they do very little, but they are very, you can achieve

482
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,120
very low latency with them, stuff like that.

483
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,560
Let me ask you, let me double check to see if I'm tracking you.

484
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:03,000
So essentially PipeWire is eventually a replacement for PulseAudio and it would also be a video

485
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,360
pipeline or API that applications could use to make sound or get sound or create video

486
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,360
or send video?

487
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
Yeah.

488
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,260
So to understand that you have to think a bit about the history.

489
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,200
So at first I wanted to write video sharing or video camera using Gstreamer.

490
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,360
So using a multimedia framework to do these things, which worked.

491
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
It was called PulseVideo.

492
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,280
But then I started to think, okay, I can do audio with this as well.

493
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,240
There is no reason why I couldn't do that.

494
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,440
And then I started to think, okay, I could start to do something like PulseAudio.

495
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,680
I could write it in Gstreamer, but then I started to bump against limitations such as

496
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,960
low latency, which were difficult to achieve.

497
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,880
So then I set out to build something better that is still a multimedia framework that

498
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:07,200
would allow me to build these things like PulseAudio and I'm also targeting Jack.

499
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,480
Yeah.

500
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,800
And the plugin aspect, I don't want to chat more about, but I guess to kind of keep with

501
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:19,800
the background here, is it also a major factor in this Wayland and applications sharing audio

502
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,920
and video inside a sandboxed Wayland world?

503
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Yes.

504
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Yes.

505
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
So exactly.

506
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,600
Well, currently all video applications that capture from a camera, they directly access

507
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,720
your device, video zero.

508
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,880
So from a sandbox point of view, you just have to make that node visible to the sandbox

509
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,160
with zero security.

510
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,760
So any app can just open the camera and start capturing whatever you're doing.

511
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,600
So you need some way to move that outside of the sandbox, which we've already done with

512
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
PulseAudio.

513
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,280
There's a demon running outside of the sandbox.

514
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,040
The sandbox goes to the demon to access the device and we implement policies to restrict

515
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,200
what you can do.

516
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
So we need something similar for video.

517
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,920
So you need to have a demon sitting there that accesses the camera and restricts who

518
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,880
can do what with it.

519
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,000
So that is one aspect to make this work in a sandbox world, we need a demon that sits

520
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,260
there and does the control of access, which we don't have for video at all.

521
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:34,200
So this is the first priority that PipeWire was built.

522
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,720
So if we didn't have something like PipeWire in the Wayland universe, you would have exclusive

523
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,520
application access to say the webcam and then no other application would be able to get

524
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
access.

525
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
Am I tracking that?

526
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Yes.

527
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Yes.

528
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,080
Well, if you're doing a demon that controls access to the camera, you can start implementing

529
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
share.

530
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
That makes sense.

531
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Okay.

532
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
All right.

533
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Yeah, that does make sense.

534
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,200
So let's talk a little bit about the difference between this and GStreamer because if I'm

535
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,880
understanding you, it does support GStreamer audio plugins to an extent for the audio capabilities

536
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,260
and plugins, but it's not GStreamer.

537
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:25,320
So there is a plugin system, which is way, way, way more low level than GStreamer plugins.

538
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,320
So yeah, it's really more low level, you have to do everything yourself, the memory management

539
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,040
of the buffers and all of that.

540
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:39,760
And on top of that is actually the PipeWire layer on top of that, that does all the negotiation

541
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,560
and manages these plugins.

542
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:52,920
So it's not exactly like GStreamer, which is one big, because it's everything.

543
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,640
I would like a little clarification.

544
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,280
I've heard discussion around PipeWire about getting latency down on the audio in Linux

545
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,080
for recording purposes and mixing purposes.

546
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Is that a goal of PipeWire?

547
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,000
And can you talk a bit about that?

548
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah, absolutely.

549
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:18,400
So currently the only thing that is reasonably low latency on Linux is Jack.

550
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:26,800
So the way Jack works is very to the point, I would say.

551
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,320
It's very efficient, the way it's implemented, but it's also very insecure.

552
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,920
You can't really use it in a sound box.

553
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:43,800
It has a huge, it has 100 megabytes, sorry, yeah, something like that, a huge file in

554
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:50,960
shared memory that is mapped by all applications where you actually have the whole data exchange

555
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
happen.

556
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,920
So any client can look at anything else from everything else.

557
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,360
You can actually write in that memory and destroy it.

558
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Oh, wow.

559
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Yeah, that's pretty interesting.

560
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah, from a security point of view, that doesn't work, but it's very efficient.

561
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,960
But essentially the way it works is you get your sound card, there's a sample ready, and

562
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,680
then it does a few texts, it wakes up an application, and from the shared memory, the application

563
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:23,360
can immediately read the memory, process it, and put it in another piece of shared memory

564
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
where the daemon then picks it out and plays it back again.

565
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,680
So there is super, super low latency there to compare that, for example, with pulse audio.

566
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,080
It has the same kind of wake-up mechanism, but then it goes through different threads

567
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:48,160
to signal applications, then it goes through another thread, which lots of data structures

568
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,640
goes back to the server where it gets picked up, gets a copy, and then it gets copied and

569
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,800
stuff like that.

570
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:03,840
So it's a bit less efficient and it is not exactly, you can't achieve the same kind of

571
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
low latency.

572
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,680
It's also not designed for doing these things that Jack does.

573
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:16,640
Like Jack, it wakes up every two milliseconds, let's say, and all the applications that are

574
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,560
part of the graph, they get woken up, they do their little thing, so it's like lockstep,

575
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,440
every two milliseconds something gets done.

576
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
I see.

577
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Yeah.

578
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
That is fascinating insight.

579
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,760
That explains a lot of the audio end.

580
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,560
Can you talk a bit about, for my personal interest, I'm curious more about the video

581
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,560
end.

582
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,600
Is this a means to an end to efficient video-accelerated GPU-decoded video?

583
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,400
Is that part of Pipewire or could be part of Pipewire in the future?

584
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Yeah.

585
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:55,080
That is definitely something that I want to do eventually, but currently that is pretty

586
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,680
well handled by Gstream as well.

587
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Ah, okay.

588
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
Okay.

589
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Yeah.

590
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,760
So in the future, will Gstreamer then be able to leverage Pipewire?

591
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
Yeah.

592
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:17,880
So currently I have a couple of Gstreamer elements where you can get data from a Pipewire instance

593
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:25,040
and send data to a Pipewire instance, so there is a communication mechanism there.

594
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:32,400
You can upload stuff and download stuff, and that works with compressed formats video.

595
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:39,240
So when do we start seeing this land in our Linux distros near us?

596
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,360
When does this stuff actually start shipping?

597
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,960
So currently it's in Fedora 27, so we will be shipping Fedora 27.

598
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,760
The idea is to use this for screen capture.

599
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,040
So there is a bit of stuff going on behind the scenes to get this working with the screen

600
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
capture.

601
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:07,820
There's a portal API to start it, and then what basically happens is that the GNOME Shell

602
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:15,400
mutter creates a new Pipewire stream, which is basically the screen as it is being rendered,

603
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,640
that you can then fetch from several different programs.

604
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:26,640
So you can start a program, for example, to stream this to a remote desktop, or make an

605
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,480
RTSP server, or encode it to a file or something like that.

606
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,540
I am very excited about that functionality, and that's going to give us remote desktop

607
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,440
on Wayland, which I am really thrilled about, because it's been a number one complaint,

608
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,760
I'd say, by the audience when they talk about switching to Wayland.

609
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,040
Audience, Reddit, everywhere.

610
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,320
That's a great feature that Pipewire is going to bring.

611
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,920
I know Eric in our mumble room had a question for you, Wim.

612
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Eric, do you want to...

613
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Go ahead.

614
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:58,600
Yeah, among other things that I do for a living, I'm actually an audio and video engineer,

615
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,520
and I'm just curious as to how...

616
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,200
If this would be one of the goals, perhaps the ability to do multi-track audio recording,

617
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,000
say via USB or something.

618
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,080
I mean, I have the same mixer that Chris does if they're in the studio, and it's capable

619
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,840
of doing 32 tracks in and out via USB.

620
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,360
Is that something that this could maybe one day be capable of?

621
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,120
Yeah, that's one of the goals, yeah.

622
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Excellent.

623
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
That should be.

624
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
That's great.

625
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,080
It's going to be a beautiful Linux multimedia future.

626
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,080
That is really great, Wim.

627
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,440
Is there anything else you want to mention about Pipewire before we chug along?

628
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,480
I could talk on for hours, but you'll have to watch my talks in the conferences that

629
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
are coming up.

630
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Okay, very good.

631
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
I will keep an eye out.

632
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,520
I will also have a link to the blog post about the Pipewire launch, too, that people can

633
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,400
check out to read more about it.

634
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,760
So that's a really exciting, Wim.

635
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,560
Thank you very much for joining us and talking a little about it.

636
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,240
I look forward to watching this develop.

637
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Yeah, definitely.

638
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,120
All right, thank you.

639
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,460
Now, we have many things to do today in the show, so I have something very near and dear

640
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,640
to my heart that I want to talk about.

641
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
This is a good one for me.

642
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,840
This is a good last episode, because I was really looking forward to talking about Pipewire,

643
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,480
and this next thing, it wasn't really going to be a show topic, and then, I don't know,

644
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,360
something just switched on in this morning in my head, and now it has to be.

645
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,880
So let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

646
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,840
And thank you for visiting DigitalOcean.

647
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,680
And then you use our promo code.

648
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,220
You use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

649
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,040
It's one word you apply to your account after you've created the account, and then you get

650
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,320
a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean.

651
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,080
And keep your eye out, because very soon, DigitalOcean, a little birdie tells me they'll

652
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,720
be rolling out object storage.

653
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Very, very soon.

654
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
I was just playing with that beta.

655
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
Were you?

656
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Yeah.

657
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Nice.

658
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
They turned it on for me, too, so I could play with it.

659
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
It's a lot of fun.

660
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,000
DigitalOcean's always added new features.

661
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,360
So they recently added load balancing as a service, and monitoring, and metric performance

662
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
monitoring.

663
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,280
They've also done what they call cloud firewalls.

664
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,900
It's actually pretty brilliant, because instead of you doing the firewall at your machine,

665
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,120
they apply the firewall rules at the network layer, so the packets never even make it to

666
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
your machine.

667
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,440
They have lightning fast networking, too, 40 gigabit connections coming to those hypervisors.

668
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,000
They run Linux on those things.

669
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,880
They run KVM for the virtualizer.

670
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,120
Data centers all over the world.

671
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,940
Load balancing as a service, pre-built open source applications ready to deploy, and pricing

672
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,360
that's going to blow your mind.

673
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Look at how affordable this is.

674
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,680
For $5 a month, you could run that rig.

675
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,720
And with our $10 credit, you get it two months free.

676
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,240
My favorite system is $0.03 an hour for 2 gigs of RAM, 2 CPUs, 40 gigabytes of SSD,

677
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,960
because it's all SSDs, and 3 terabytes of transfer.

678
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,240
And you know what's crazy, Wes?

679
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,720
It's a lot of really good stuff, and I haven't even mentioned the dashboard yet.

680
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
What?

681
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
You haven't even mentioned that?

682
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
No.

683
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
You haven't even mentioned the game features.

684
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
I know.

685
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
I know.

686
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Dashboard for days.

687
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
It's because it's so easy to use.

688
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
You kind of forget about it.

689
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
It is.

690
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,920
And they also have that API, which we've now built bots around and stuff, which is really

691
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,360
well-documented, easy, straightforward to use.

692
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,440
It's been great for us.

693
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
DigitalOcean.com.

694
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,640
Go over there, create your account, and then use our promo code of absolute power and knowledge,

695
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
DO Unplugged.

696
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
That's one word.

697
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,880
DO Unplugged over at DigitalOcean.com.

698
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,040
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

699
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Okay.

700
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,320
So, I want to talk about something that is not a totally new topic to this show, but

701
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,680
I do think it's a pretty big problem.

702
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:23,720
But I want to set a couple of ground rules, some disclosures up front.

703
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm not talking about any one particular person.

704
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,560
I'm not talking about any one particular business.

705
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,880
This is a bigger problem than any one person or business or company or media outlet.

706
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
I'm sorry, Chris.

707
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Thank you.

708
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,880
And it's something that I'm personally very invested in because I've followed the Linux

709
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,720
news for 11 years, very closely, every week, reading and analyzing it.

710
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,280
I cover it in a lot of my shows.

711
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,680
And so watching this has been, it's actually taken a toll a bit because of something very

712
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,040
special about the open source community.

713
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,960
More than ever, I really feel like the quote unquote open source media or Linux journalism

714
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,640
has taken a nosedive of quality, specifically in the written medium, but also with some

715
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,080
of the media outlets too.

716
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,720
Just really gotten bad.

717
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,400
There's fewer and fewer reporters that are actually going to a story, that are creating

718
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,700
new content.

719
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:30,120
And what's mostly happening now, because it's easy and good business, is we have lazy virtue

720
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:36,480
signaling clickbait journalism that touches on people's emotional buttons and gets people

721
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,320
fired up and sharing content and retweeting and thumbing down or thumbing up, either way,

722
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,360
angry and happy.

723
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,560
And it works so well.

724
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,360
It works so well, you see it all over the place.

725
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
It's media everywhere.

726
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,120
It's not just a Linux problem.

727
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,620
But I believe in the open source community, it has devastating consequences.

728
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,840
I think it murders people's passion and energy to contribute.

729
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,900
And we all know that a large reason why people contribute to open source is because it's

730
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:10,600
a passion project, or why people go out on a limb and advocate in their commercial company

731
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:17,820
to be a member of the open source community, to work upstream.

732
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,200
It takes a passion to be willing to take that risk.

733
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,160
So when the tone of conversation is mostly discourse based around toxic straw man arguments,

734
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,540
that the bar has been set by this bottom feeding media, who's not creating anything new.

735
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,060
That's the most offensive thing.

736
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,680
They're not making anything new.

737
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,040
They're creating discussion about the discussion.

738
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,320
This community, the open source community, is a worldwide community of developers of

739
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,120
different cultures, creating different projects for different reasons, coming together to

740
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,480
make something amazing, and predominantly the conversation in the open source media

741
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,040
space is discussion about the discussion.

742
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,960
Things to get people riled up and excited, virtue signaling.

743
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,400
And I think it's devastating in the open source community.

744
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:14,160
And what's really troubling to me is it's getting worse.

745
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,960
And there's less and less actual quote unquote journalists going to these events and covering

746
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,760
events or going to communities and finding out what they're making.

747
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,880
And I will use us as an example for a moment here, but look at the projects that have come

748
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,960
on the show over the last 215 episodes.

749
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,280
They generally do really well afterwards, not because of this, some magical effect of

750
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,880
the show, but because they connect with our audience and they express what their goals

751
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,280
are and their intentions.

752
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,180
And our audience likes that they buy into their ideas and it doesn't, it's not about

753
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,480
the show, it becomes about the project and that project grows and they get contributors

754
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,680
and they get mouth, word of mouth.

755
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,860
It creates something, it contributes something to the open source community.

756
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,840
But this diverse of click bait, emotional button pushing, bottom feeding journalism

757
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,080
that we have now does the opposite.

758
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,200
It's devastating.

759
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
So this is my rant.

760
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
This is my rant.

761
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,440
And I always, I've made this case before, I've made this case before, and I'm not done

762
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
making it.

763
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,000
So now I'm going to, I'm going to just going to, I'm going to call out some names and I'm

764
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,720
going to give you some examples right now on the show because this is a problem that

765
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,520
is getting worse and apparently not talking about it enough hasn't done anything and not

766
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
calling out names hasn't done anything.

767
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,800
So we're going to get to that next.

768
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:48,200
I solemnly swear by my oath as a crime fighter that this outrage will not go un-avenged.

769
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:56,240
I want to thank Ting, go to linux.ting.com and sign up for the nation's best mobile coverage.

770
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,500
What a company, linux.ting.com.

771
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:03,640
Go there to experience really incredible customer service, pay for what you want wireless, $6

772
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,520
a month for your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, no contracts nor the termination

773
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
fees.

774
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,280
Again, another fantastic, wonderful dashboard.

775
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,900
It's like people are starting to get this.

776
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,000
It's mobile how it should be done.

777
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,800
I hear that from people outside the US all the time.

778
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,520
They have a GSM and CDMA network.

779
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,800
You pick your device, you make it work.

780
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,440
Oh, you're going to get yourself the new internet phone or the new Samsung or the new Pixel,

781
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
whatever.

782
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
It doesn't matter.

783
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Ting don't care.

784
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
Just make sure it's compatible.

785
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Check their BYOD page, pop in a SIM, you're good to go.

786
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,040
You want to grab one from Ting directly?

787
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
No probs.

788
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
Check it out.

789
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Go to linux.ting.com.

790
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,200
You'll get $25 off your first device or $25 in service credit if you bring a compatible

791
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,920
device, linux.ting.com.

792
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,880
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring the show, linux.ting.com.

793
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Yes, sir.

794
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
And none of that was clickbait.

795
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
It's all true.

796
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
It is true.

797
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
It is all true.

798
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
I'm going to be using Ting all the way across the nation.

799
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,000
Tried and tested.

800
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,960
So I generally have a lot of respect for Matthew Garrett, but I'm going to start here because

801
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,100
this is the beginning of a beast right here.

802
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,080
And it is a disgusting, grotesque aspect of the Linux community, and it's perfectly displayed

803
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,240
right here.

804
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,900
So Matthew Garrett tweets on the 23rd of July, 2013, sitting on a plane watching Jim Zimlin

805
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,680
use OS X.

806
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,280
So he's shaming the head of the Linux Foundation back in 2013.

807
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,480
Four years later, this is September 10th, 2017, four years later, at Jim Zimlin is still

808
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,760
rocking an iPad and doing his slides under Mac OS X.

809
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,920
This starts a cascade of shit, including people jumping in, hocking hardware, hocking open

810
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
Seuss.

811
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,680
But it develops then into a series of YouTube videos and Reddit posts where people get clickbait,

812
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,280
and itsfoss.com posted this, Linux Foundation head calls 2017 year of the Linux desktop

813
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,080
while running Apple's Mac OS himself.

814
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,640
And takes shots at Jim throughout the entire article.

815
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,920
He even says here in the ITFoss article, perhaps I'm creating unnecessary controversy.

816
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,400
Perhaps this is simple, should be ignored.

817
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,760
This thing that we do is gross because it's shaming people for their choices.

818
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,020
And it wouldn't be accepted in thousands of other contexts in our daily lives.

819
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,200
But when it comes to picking a Mac or Windows, and we're Linux users, all of a sudden we

820
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,600
get to shame.

821
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,460
If they were Jews, we couldn't say these things.

822
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,880
If they were black, we wouldn't be saying these things.

823
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,680
If they chose to have bisexual sex, we wouldn't be saying these things.

824
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,240
If a man wanted to become a woman, we wouldn't be saying these things.

825
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,680
But because Jim runs a Mac, it's okay to publicly shame him.

826
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,920
Now I happen to know there's people in this mumble room right now, shocker, they're not

827
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
using Linux.

828
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,960
You're going to call them out, aren't you?

829
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,960
That's what's going to happen next.

830
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
Watch out.

831
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:54,600
But what really gets me is someone sees Jim on an airplane and he's using an iPad.

832
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,640
Well, depending on the day you saw me, you might see me editing video on my Macbook.

833
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Because guess what?

834
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,440
PipeWire isn't shipping yet.

835
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,360
So I use a Macbook to edit my videos.

836
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,080
Now I own three laptops, only one of them is a Mac.

837
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,340
The other two run Linux.

838
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,020
But if you saw me that day on my Mac, you might tweet out, oh, just saw Chris Fisher

839
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,140
had a Jupiter broadcast and using a Mac.

840
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,140
What a dick.

841
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,080
Well, you know, Chris, all the shows are edited on a Mac too.

842
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Yeah, we are.

843
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,840
We are just a bunch of heretics.

844
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
Trying to sabotage Linux from within.

845
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,440
Yeah, we're Mac lovers trying to pretend to be like Linux.

846
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,040
So with no information, with no quotes from Jim.

847
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,120
Right, this is not an interview discussing like, you know, maybe he feels the same way

848
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,280
about it, we don't know.

849
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,640
Maybe he has two Linux desktops at home and just prefers to have a Macbook for a laptop.

850
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,800
Because guess who else does that?

851
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
Linus Torvalds.

852
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,200
Maybe he has a Macbook running Linux.

853
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,440
Well, I mean, even if he's running Mac or Windows.

854
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,120
But the point is, or an iPad, at what point do we stop shaming?

855
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,120
When does that not become an acceptable thing to shame someone for a choice they made because

856
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,560
that tool works for them?

857
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,800
Not everybody takes this as a religious thing.

858
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,340
I mean, that's a good point.

859
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,600
But also the fact that there's literally no evidence whatsoever that it's even true and

860
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,320
people went off on like on Crazy Train to yell at him for something they have no idea.

861
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,080
And every single time someone does it, they always like, well, you know, I couldn't get

862
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,240
it confirmed or anything, but I'm going to go still go off on a tangent and yell at this

863
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
guy.

864
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
He's using a Mac up on stage.

865
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,440
And I am not arguing that the optics of this look bad.

866
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,340
Like get a loaner laptop running Linux and go up there.

867
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:30,940
Of course, then there would be headlines, head of Linux Foundation prefers Fedora, head

868
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,060
of Linux Foundation prefers OpenSUSE.

869
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,580
So then there would be those headlines, but they would be at least of a different caliber.

870
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,440
So I agree that the optics look bad.

871
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,480
However, the Linux Foundation is not a Linux desktop advocacy group.

872
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Wake up, everybody.

873
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,480
That's not what they're there for.

874
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,480
That's not where they have members like VMware.

875
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,560
They're not there for the desktop, OK?

876
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,560
They're there for the business.

877
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,560
Microsoft.

878
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Right.

879
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,240
Microsoft is more of a Linux desktop advocacy company than the Linux Foundation is, though,

880
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,040
because Microsoft makes Visual Studio code, for God's sakes.

881
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,360
And they make other applications for Linux.

882
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,240
The Linux Foundation is a business representation of Linux and that arm.

883
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,680
And they do they fund other projects that do good work, like the Core Infrastructure

884
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,600
Initiative.

885
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,600
And if you go to these conferences, like the camera that's pointing at Jim, if you turned

886
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:22,160
that camera around and took a picture of the audience, it would I would be willing to take

887
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,520
a rough best 70 to 80 percent MacBooks in that audience.

888
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,320
The rest would be mostly Lenovo's and Dell's and the half of them would be running Windows.

889
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,520
So Linux is a minority at these conferences.

890
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,600
Don't kid yourself.

891
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:42,740
And the the idea here that people have to pass some sort of purity test.

892
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,000
And we all love to take a shot at our at our authority figures in Linux.

893
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,640
So everybody got a shot at the Linux Foundation.

894
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,040
We got to take them down a notch, got to take Jim down a notch.

895
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,320
So everybody feels really good about that.

896
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,360
And Jim passed our purity test.

897
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,080
So now we all get the virtue signal about that.

898
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,580
And we're all feeling pretty good right now.

899
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,320
It's gross.

900
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,520
And it doesn't get anything done.

901
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,000
That's the part that stands out to me.

902
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,240
Or we're not like what are the reasons he can't use Linux on his desktop if there are

903
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,240
some.

904
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,880
Those are things we maybe we should be talking about and figuring out how to how to make

905
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
that better.

906
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,680
And isn't the mechanics of this interesting?

907
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,000
It starts with like if you think about it, the very origins of this are gross.

908
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,640
Matthew Garrett, they're publicly shaming.

909
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,580
He's Mac shaming someone.

910
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,520
And then he does it years later again on his Twitter feed.

911
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:34,600
And then you have YouTubers and bloggers who then try to get clicks off of it.

912
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,720
And none of them have a single poll quote from Jim.

913
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,580
It's remarkable.

914
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:45,560
It is the bottom feeding journalism that is suffocating the dialogue in the open source

915
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,600
community.

916
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,120
It makes us spin and chase our own tails.

917
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,140
And it lowers the starting point of the conversation.

918
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,040
And you can say, well, Chris, it's just about filtering the news that you take in.

919
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,080
It's just about making sure that you pick the right sources.

920
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:08,120
The problem is the dialogue in at a at a at a wider, higher level is getting set low.

921
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,000
The bar is getting set low.

922
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,520
It doesn't matter what source you're getting it from the conversation.

923
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,940
Just look at the big things that have happened to Linux recently or go back to system D.

924
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:25,480
It's eating us up and it's it's it's something that I feel like I am almost powerless to

925
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,560
solve because, like I said, it's bigger than one person and it's bigger than one company.

926
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,800
And I think about the amount of people that go to these events and cover these events

927
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,560
and it's it's painfully small.

928
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,600
Regular Linux journalists who go to like Gwadek or they don't go to that, but say they go

929
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,840
to DebConf or the open source summit or something.

930
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,600
It's four or five people and two of them work at Jupiter Broadcasting.

931
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,160
I'm serious.

932
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:02,280
It does make it hard to have like a diverse, you know, network of of coverage.

933
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:10,200
The only thing I can figure to try to fix this is to compete at a at a level that makes

934
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,800
clickbait journalism not as appealing and makes them have to compete.

935
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,440
And I don't know how to get there.

936
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,220
And my thought is starting to go to things like the Ubuntu rally or going at talking

937
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,040
to projects as as things are being developed and spotlighting them on the show is maybe

938
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,720
a way to do that.

939
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,080
Go to the story.

940
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,280
You know, when I when I think of this Ubuntu rally, I don't think of it so much as an Ubuntu

941
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,160
event as I do about going to a large person, a large company in the community who's at

942
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,760
an interesting transition right now, learning how they work, how they interact with the

943
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,920
community, networking with people and using that to influence and give insight into my

944
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
future commentary.

945
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,920
Right.

946
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,900
You get a different view of this that you can you can share.

947
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,320
And it's it is it is a type of it is a type of perspective that you don't get by just

948
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,560
sitting in front of your crappy YouTube set up and blabbing your mouth or throwing up

949
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,180
some cheap post on a blog somewhere, hoping that you get a few ad clicks off of it.

950
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:10,000
And the the cost of doing it is substantially greater.

951
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,580
And the time it takes is substantially higher and more.

952
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,020
So it seems like an impossible fight.

953
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,880
And it I you know, you have to go by my word that I hear over and over again.

954
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,080
In fact, it's one of the things I hear the most is people burn out because of it and

955
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,080
they they give up.

956
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,560
And it's it's it's it's people that if I said their names, it would shock you.

957
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,440
And it's people that you've never heard of before.

958
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,920
It's the whole frickin spectrum.

959
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,300
And I know it's a real problem.

960
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,340
And I hear a lot about it.

961
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,360
And I feel powerless to do anything about it.

962
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,280
And it feels like it's getting worse, like we're slipping deeper and deeper into this

963
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,160
shitty clickbait abyss.

964
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:52,200
Yeah, it's it's awful and there's the hate that people send about all kinds of different

965
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,880
things like the canonical hate for no reason.

966
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,680
But and there are other companies that are doing something similar that it gets no attention

967
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,680
whatsoever.

968
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,760
Yet, you know, other companies just get hate regardless if they just open their mouth.

969
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,880
Like why?

970
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,000
Why do you need to hate someone for making open source software?

971
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,260
Even if you don't want to use it, shouldn't you appreciate the work they're putting out

972
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,260
there for you?

973
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,260
Yeah, we covered it.

974
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,880
We covered an intense story in Kota Radio this week that just went out a couple days

975
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:21,880
ago or yesterday.

976
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,920
Well, I just wanted to clear up something I looked up.

977
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,760
I'm looking since this entire thing started, I've been trying to find any evidence whatsoever

978
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,500
that this is even true.

979
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
It's not true.

980
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Are you sure?

981
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,480
You can like see a picture of it or something like that.

982
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,200
There's not a you can go on the YouTube channel.

983
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,120
They don't they don't show what you're kidding me what slides there are.

984
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,320
There's no photos whatsoever.

985
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,560
I couldn't find a single photo.

986
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,560
Right.

987
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,080
And none of these articles I've seen have a photo of it either.

988
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,160
No, I saw someone had a stock photo of a MacBook as if that's proof or something.

989
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,160
Wow.

990
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,320
But every single one of them are referencing each other in a cycle of cyclicals, crazy,

991
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,040
you know, attack like the one like the its boss was referencing some YouTube channels.

992
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,800
The YouTube channels are referencing the Twitter.

993
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,920
The only thing we have is Matthew Garrett's word that it happened.

994
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,520
But so he took the time to make a tweet.

995
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,280
You're like, well, that's not a big deal.

996
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,720
He also took the time to find the older tweet that he made, but not the time to take a photo

997
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,200
to prove his statement.

998
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,720
Like that's kind of weird.

999
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,720
Yeah.

1000
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,400
And because he's using on the plane doesn't mean he was doing it from the podium either.

1001
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,440
That's I didn't right.

1002
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,100
And people are blowing it up as if he didn't did it on the keynote.

1003
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,500
You know, I think I think there I think I think there is more and more talking to rotten

1004
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,600
made me think rotten has really well researched coverage like on his channel.

1005
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:35,880
Like there are people out there that are doing like well thought out, well researched pieces.

1006
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,320
You know, like like a lot, like our friends that went to podcast and late night Linux

1007
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,320
and the work they do there.

1008
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,040
Again, I feel like people that are thoughtful about it.

1009
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,260
There is a place for that.

1010
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,240
You know, you don't always have to be like creating something brand new or interviewing

1011
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
somebody.

1012
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,100
Like there is a place for thoughtful conversation that does add to a dialogue because, again,

1013
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,360
it is an open source community and that's a huge part of it.

1014
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,120
So there is a so I feel like there is more and more good stuff, but it's getting outpaced

1015
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,120
by the click bait emotion button pushing and that there's such a template out there from

1016
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,200
like the buzz feeds of the world on how to pull it off.

1017
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,200
Oh, my gosh.

1018
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,360
Just I mean, like going through for, you know, preparing for this show.

1019
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,560
How much of that do you have to filter, cut away and just not.

1020
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,180
And I feel like it's harder to, you know, maybe for people who haven't don't see that

1021
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,360
much or don't follow as closely or other things.

1022
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,600
It can be pretty confusing when you're just trying to like you look at various aggregator

1023
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
sites or other things.

1024
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,520
And once it starts being shared, those clickbait titles, I mean, if you don't know any better,

1025
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,520
those will pull you in.

1026
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,800
Suddenly, you've loaded their ads, you've continued, you've been in their click count.

1027
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,720
So it can be hard to like actually signal that you're not interested in it.

1028
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,340
It's funny is that you're mentioning about the whole researching like the people who

1029
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:46,280
research their topics and stuff that I've actually when I first saw this last week,

1030
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,760
I was like, I'm making a video about this, although I'm going to research and make sure

1031
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,320
what I say is that I have like another day or two before it's going to be released because

1032
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,200
I still have some things I want to make sure that I'm correct about.

1033
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,280
But so far, through all the research I've found I've looked through, there's not a single

1034
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,040
reference of any kind to have any proof whatsoever.

1035
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,040
Here's an idea.

1036
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,560
Why doesn't somebody just email the guy and ask?

1037
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,560
Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

1038
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,280
I mean, if that was him, I wouldn't answer anyway, because it would just create like

1039
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,200
an extra like him denying and people are like, how could you deny something that we know

1040
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,200
is true or something?

1041
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,400
But I could tell you how the conversation would go with Jim if I was at one of the Linux

1042
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,280
Foundation events where Jim's at and we're on the sidebar, I'd be like, boy, can you

1043
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,760
believe that fucking shitstorm you got for that?

1044
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,000
And he'd be like, yeah, that's really just unbelievable.

1045
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,160
When you get real and you get outside your little virtue signaling bubble, you realize

1046
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,440
people are humans.

1047
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,800
And to him, he's sitting on a plane, guess what, the MacBook probably gets four hours

1048
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,880
more battery life than whatever Linux laptop he was going to bring on the plane.

1049
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,040
I mean, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that iPad that this time he got busted

1050
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,800
for, probably has 11, 12 hours of battery life.

1051
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,960
That's very freaking competitive.

1052
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,780
And it feels like it just kind of paints a bad image of desktop Linux users, especially

1053
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,400
in that world that's so dominated by servers.

1054
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,400
You're like, well, look, here's this weird, strange internet culture.

1055
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,400
They're not making money.

1056
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,760
They're not like, it's not part of the same class of people and here they are being dicks

1057
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,760
to me.

1058
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,760
Why do I care about that?

1059
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,920
I'm just going to stay in the world I know.

1060
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,920
I had a really interesting...

1061
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Oh, go ahead.

1062
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,120
There's also an argument of like, well, he's running something that he could be using it

1063
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,840
to learn more about the thing he's using so that he can convince people why this is better

1064
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
than this.

1065
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,760
If you have no reference, how can you say something is better than something you've

1066
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,760
never tried?

1067
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,520
So he could be saying like, maybe he has Windows machines and Mac things and he's just using

1068
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,160
them for like, well, he's doing a presentation on a plane.

1069
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,400
That's not like it's his main primary desktop or anything.

1070
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
Yeah.

1071
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,000
Although people are saying that in articles, of course.

1072
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah.

1073
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,220
Well, you got to jump to conclusions to make it worth clicking, I guess.

1074
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,760
So Swampy, he's one of the journalists that actually goes out there and actually goes

1075
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,760
to the story.

1076
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,440
I just kind of speak to those people and he has a YouTube channel now and he had a topic

1077
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,520
on it recently that, oh, oh.

1078
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:03,340
So it came across our YouTube recommended and it's a totally, for me, I don't even think

1079
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,340
about it.

1080
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:09,120
I'm trying to, I can't find it right now, but it was to me like a totally normal title

1081
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,760
and it was stop converting users to Linux and migrate them to Linux instead.

1082
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,640
It's a pretty good time and it's, you know, it's done pretty well for him.

1083
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,560
But Hadia saw that and she goes, wait a minute, is this, this is legitimately the conversation

1084
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
we had last night.

1085
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,560
So, and I think it's related to this.

1086
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,280
She says, is this, is this converting everybody to Linux thing?

1087
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,920
Is this something more than just Noah?

1088
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,120
Like, I thought that was just a Noah thing.

1089
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,120
I'm like, no.

1090
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,920
She's like, so is that a normal thing for you people to talk about?

1091
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,480
Like not, you know, like that kind of, that's a little creepy.

1092
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,480
I'm like, what?

1093
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,600
She's like, you don't think it's weird that you guys talk about converting people to Linux?

1094
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,600
That sounds like a religion.

1095
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,600
Yeah.

1096
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,600
Like religious undertones.

1097
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,480
And I'm like, oh yeah, I, yeah, I guess it, I guess it does have a religious undertone,

1098
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,480
doesn't it?

1099
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,280
Like you're, you're converting and we do or, or very culty and we very, very frequently

1100
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,280
talk about that.

1101
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:06,560
Evangelist is a common title and there's, I've never, ever said church of neon ever.

1102
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,560
We all do it.

1103
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,440
And it's because, you know, we all, we want to advocate and we think it can actually help.

1104
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,440
And a lot of us probably have personality types where we're sort of like the trend,

1105
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,680
the technology trends that are in our social group or something like that.

1106
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,300
So it's, it's not like it's, we're all a bunch of crazies, but to her, she, I guess she had

1107
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,760
made the assumption that that was just, well, that's just Noah because he's crazy passionate

1108
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:25,800
about Linux.

1109
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,320
And she was, which is a fine assumption for a few moments.

1110
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,440
She was creeped out by it.

1111
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,640
And then I explained to her, it's like, well, you know, when you discover something you

1112
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,920
think is really great, you kind of evangelize it.

1113
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,760
And she's like, well, you just said evangelize, okay, I'm digging a hole here.

1114
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,600
You know, she got to, in her business, she runs two Linux computers, but it's not about,

1115
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,000
it's not about the license or the, or, you know, because she likes unity or Matei it's,

1116
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,960
it's because it's just practical for her.

1117
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,760
And I think it's all kind of like, we get kind of swept up in this, like I said, morality

1118
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,040
testing and things like that, and we don't even really realize what we're doing and we,

1119
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,680
we jump into shaming and attacking.

1120
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,680
Yes.

1121
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,680
Right.

1122
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,200
Instead of pointing out things like, Hey, look, Linux can do this better in some cases.

1123
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,280
A lot of the dialogue ends up focused being on like, Windows is garbage and here's why.

1124
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,840
And when they're like, well, no, but Windows works fine and it has these, you know, it

1125
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,880
doesn't, it doesn't feel like a full debate.

1126
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,280
That's right where we're back at with this.

1127
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,520
I've now got two stories, one in an email and I think one in the haircare discord channel

1128
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,880
from a listener who has heard me kind of talk about this a bit on the pre-show last week.

1129
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,360
And he said, I came to Linux Fest Northwest to see you guys to kind of get more about

1130
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,640
Linux been thinking about switching.

1131
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,280
I have an old Mac book, which I brought with me and I got harassed by people in the booths,

1132
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,120
not by people at Linux Fest, but people behind the booths.

1133
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:42,800
Like somebody was giving him a hard time for bringing a Mac and he felt shamed and I kind

1134
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,660
of lost my enthusiasm to switch.

1135
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,960
Two people told me that they got a hard time at Linux Fest Northwest.

1136
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,800
It was totally the opposite atmosphere that we could want or imagine.

1137
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,600
And Linux Fest Northwest is always so cool.

1138
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,560
It's just such a cool, chill place.

1139
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,560
Like of all walks.

1140
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,560
Welcoming.

1141
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,560
Yeah, exactly.

1142
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,800
And to be fair, how often have we commented on one of the shows that how many Mac books

1143
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,800
are showing up at LinuxCon?

1144
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,800
Yeah.

1145
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
Yeah.

1146
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,680
I know we are not, we are not innocent here because especially back in my switcher days

1147
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,280
when I was, when I was really aggressively trying to get people off of Windows and I

1148
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,760
did consider myself an evangelist.

1149
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,920
Now I'm more like a, I'm like a, like a, like a, I'm like, what's a converted evangelist

1150
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,040
who's now just like, I practice the faith, but I'm cool if you don't want to practice

1151
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,040
the faith.

1152
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,760
I don't know what you call that, but that's the kind of Linux user I find myself to be

1153
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,760
these days.

1154
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,520
You show off that Linux works great for you, but you don't pressure others.

1155
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,520
You're not, yeah.

1156
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:34,800
I think that's a bit of the shaming a bit feels like insecurity about it.

1157
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,080
Like you're insecure that for some reason the guy that runs the Linux Foundation needs

1158
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,080
to use an iPad.

1159
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,760
I think you see the same like with programming languages or anything like that, right?

1160
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,720
Like you, you worry because you're thinking like, well, it clearly works for them.

1161
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,120
They must think it's so much better.

1162
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,120
Yeah.

1163
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,120
So what about the devil's advocate position?

1164
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,120
Like, so right.

1165
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,120
And what about this?

1166
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,720
What if, uh, what if, um, you know, a different CEO of a different company, I guess, cause

1167
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,320
that's not really fair because it's a foundation.

1168
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,320
It depends on the company.

1169
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,480
Someone would just automatically get a password regardless of what they do.

1170
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,760
But the Linux Foundation doesn't make a product.

1171
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,760
They're a foundation.

1172
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,640
Part of this whole thing is the nebulous connection between Linux and the Linux Foundation and

1173
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,360
Linux just is a kernel also.

1174
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,800
So it's all kind of like it's the company model is there to be easier to say yes or

1175
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,800
no.

1176
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,800
That makes sense.

1177
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,480
Or yeah, it's more of a, they're an advocacy group, so that's why you're not really doing

1178
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,480
very good advocacy.

1179
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,480
Right.

1180
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,480
Yes.

1181
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,160
I mean, they are because they're, they're showing that they're willing to use the things

1182
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,520
that other people are using and can show, like, you know, show them that they're not

1183
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,120
like creating this leadism or anything.

1184
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,960
But there's another thing I thought of was funny that the same people who would bash

1185
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,760
him for using an iPad are the same people who say that Android is not Linux or anything.

1186
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:43,360
So like, as far as tablet go, there is no right answer.

1187
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,360
Not yet.

1188
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,840
I think there was a new replicant release this week.

1189
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
That might be the.

1190
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,480
What are you going to say, Bjerg?

1191
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:55,520
What if you saw, you know, chairman member and former CEO Bill Gates using a MacBook

1192
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,000
at his charity events?

1193
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,640
Well, that's, that would be more.

1194
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
I'd give him a high five.

1195
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,640
That would be more surprising.

1196
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,140
But again, the Linux Foundation isn't like making an operating system directly.

1197
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,580
They finance Linus and Linus uses a MacBook and nobody gives shit one about that.

1198
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,920
It's only because, because we like to take a pop at our authority figures, but not our

1199
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,100
cult leaders.

1200
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:19,260
Like our cultural icons, they could, they can pick their toes and they can run MacBooks

1201
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,460
and we're good.

1202
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,920
But if you are an authority figure, well, then you are, you're an open target and we're

1203
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:29,720
just going to take a few, a few shots because we hate you apparently as far as the super

1204
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,320
double standard.

1205
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,760
The Bill Gates and the Steve Jobs interview, joint interview proved that they hated each

1206
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
other.

1207
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,760
Of course.

1208
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,760
Yeah.

1209
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,760
Yeah.

1210
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,760
That was a good interview.

1211
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,760
Yeah.

1212
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,760
See, I think it would be different too.

1213
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,760
Right?

1214
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,760
Like Bill Gates, much less attached to Microsoft.

1215
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,560
I don't think I would think anything of it.

1216
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,880
Now if like Sacha was doing it while they were trying to launch the next line of Windows

1217
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,000
phones, I'd be like, well, you can do whatever you want, but that's probably bad marketing

1218
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
for your company.

1219
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Or Tim Cook using an Android.

1220
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah.

1221
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
That would be crazy.

1222
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,520
And that would be, you know, that would be hard for them to explain it for.

1223
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,800
My argument would be like, if you have like, let's, especially the phones, cause the phone's

1224
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,080
the easiest one.

1225
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,040
Let's say you have, you're a developer for some kind of platform and you have the other

1226
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:14,280
phones that you carry around to test things and to make sure that they like to see that

1227
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,920
it's true interactions with different features.

1228
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,040
In fact, you almost hope they do do that sometimes actually have references to see what does,

1229
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,960
what works and what doesn't and things like that.

1230
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,520
Like that would be a reasonable thing.

1231
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,900
I mean, if he was going onto like a Mac, an Apple stage or announcing the iPhone pulling

1232
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,000
out a Samsung or something, that would be weird.

1233
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,080
But just having it in general is kind of ridiculous that people are freaking out.

1234
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,800
I feel like anybody that wants to criticize Jim and they're welcome to do it, but what

1235
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:44,360
they should do first, if they don't want to be a D bag is they should pack up their laptop.

1236
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,360
They should take a long flight.

1237
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,880
They should try to prepare for a presentation in front of thousands and thousands of people

1238
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:55,760
because it's also streamed and released on YouTube and a stand up there and give a presentation

1239
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,080
about whatever the hell Jim talked about and then you can criticize them for using an iPad

1240
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,080
or a Mac book.

1241
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,560
I really, I mean, at the end of the day, we really have to come to the understanding that

1242
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,740
for the majority of people that are going to use Linux ever, it's just a tool.

1243
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:15,720
It is an ends to a means and many of them will never even know it is Linux and that

1244
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:21,120
is the reality of our world and it's one that we've discussed before.

1245
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:25,560
It's one that Linus, we've read his quotes, he thinks it's great.

1246
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,560
That's what it is.

1247
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,560
And especially in the business space.

1248
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,560
Definitely don't care.

1249
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,560
Yeah.

1250
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,060
It kind of feels like it goes a little bit back to that, like the GPL enforcement questions

1251
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:38,340
and like the writings Greg had on that and just about, you know, like if we come off

1252
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:43,640
as this really aggressive, mean, super opinionated community, then it's really easy to see that

1253
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,440
and not all the value here and instead of like, you know, we're all trying to push for

1254
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,840
more open source, more DRM free things, all of this and a lot of times it's not the popular

1255
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,760
opinion, so we need to be seen as nice people and so that we can have a reasonable discussion

1256
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,060
with others and be like, look, we're not saying that you need this, but here's why it causes

1257
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,060
us a problem.

1258
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:05,720
Well, why can't we just have the tone, you know, a little more chill, a little more mellow.

1259
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,420
Everybody just be kind to each other, be nice and know that everybody's in here because

1260
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:12,140
they got a certain particular itch they're trying to scratch.

1261
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:16,920
They want to do it by writing code that's an expression for themselves and not every

1262
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,620
single person has to be an advocate or an evangelist and Linux will be okay.

1263
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,960
It will continue to grow.

1264
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,120
It will go on and you'll still be able to log into your desktop.

1265
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,680
Don't don't get your system in a bunch now, especially when it's system because that could

1266
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,000
be a real mess.

1267
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,080
So here we are.

1268
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,080
We are hard.

1269
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,280
We are hard up against our out time and I got to go to New York and I feel bad because

1270
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
your caravan out.

1271
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,280
Yeah.

1272
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,280
Yeah.

1273
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,400
My ride is here and Caleb is he's going to quit listening to the show.

1274
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,120
Caleb tweeted me, punting the Gentoo challenge was funny, but now it's really irritating.

1275
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,280
Say what you do.

1276
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,400
He's got to quit the show now and I'm sorry, Caleb.

1277
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,960
I'm sure you guys will get to it next week, though.

1278
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,960
Right.

1279
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,960
I don't know if it would be right to do it without you.

1280
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Oh, no.

1281
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,120
I really want to find out about your Gentoo feelings.

1282
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,400
I think Chris is trying to ditch the gender responsibility.

1283
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,400
I will listen.

1284
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,200
I absolutely want to get into it because I spent all that time working on it.

1285
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,240
But the problem here is, is my ride.

1286
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,240
I know.

1287
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,520
And so did Wes and Caleb is really, really upset.

1288
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:17,600
So I'll tell you what we're definitely going to do when I get back.

1289
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,600
That's right.

1290
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,600
We will for sure.

1291
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,600
All right.

1292
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,120
In the meantime, follow me live on my trip.

1293
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,280
I'm leaving in just a little bit at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash Rover.

1294
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:33,120
That's also where I'll post videos at Chris Elias for the Twitter at Jupiter signal for

1295
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,120
the network.

1296
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,120
At Wes Payne.

1297
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,840
And Beard, where would you like people to find you?

1298
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,400
Twitter dot com slash Rakai LP.

1299
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,920
Rakai LP on the Twitter.

1300
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,680
Very good.

1301
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,680
Thank you for joining us, you guys.

1302
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:43,680
Yeah.

1303
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,680
Come back next week when it's the Beard and I.

1304
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,680
Join you guys.

1305
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
Just you two.

1306
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
I won't be here.

1307
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,680
I hope you guys have a great show.

1308
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,680
Be right back.

1309
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,680
Yeah.

1310
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:51,680
And all that good stuff.

1311
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:52,680
We'll see you right.

1312
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,680
Well, they will see you.

1313
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,680
I guess not me.

1314
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,680
They'll see you right back.

1315
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:20,080
Thank you so much.

1316
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:38,840
Alright, so the title should probably either be about PipeWire, which would be my inclination,

1317
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:45,480
but also I like this as a title because it's true, Linux Journalism is in a Nosedive, ahhh.

1318
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,480
Yeah.

1319
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,600
Thank you Mumble Room, you guys were great, appreciate it very much.

1320
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,520
Thank you Chris for having us.

1321
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,920
We will, well they will be back very soon, I have to go soon so we should pick our title.

1322
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,840
Well, I just want to point out that on next week's show and future shows, I should be

1323
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,240
on my new honkin' desktop with that case I just got today.

1324
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,240
Woo-woo!

1325
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,240
Excellent.

1326
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,240
Congrats.

1327
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,120
And it's probably going to run Gen 2 10.01.

1328
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,120
Maniac mode engaged.

1329
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,640
Chugga chugga chugga chugga.

1330
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:16,640
Gen 2!

1331
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:21,480
Alright, yeah be titles, and also you can toss it in the Discord like I have if you

1332
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,280
like for a title suggestion.

1333
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,600
I installed Discord and I don't even know what the freaking room is.

1334
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:33,160
Dev PipeWire is title number one right now, Chris hates us all, great suggestion, Popey's

1335
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,160
porn problem.

1336
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,160
That was good.

1337
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,320
Did you notice how Popey just admitted to watching porn on the show?

1338
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
And then he left.

1339
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
That's terrible.

1340
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,360
That's the best thing ever actually.

1341
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,880
We should call it, pipe out the crap, pipe in the light.

1342
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:47,880
Yeah.

1343
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,880
Oh beard.

1344
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,360
Hey Chris, what's the link to the Discord?

1345
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,820
Discord dot me slash Jupiter colony will give you the invite link, and if you just want

1346
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:15,520
to use the web app instead of the Electron, it's Discord.
