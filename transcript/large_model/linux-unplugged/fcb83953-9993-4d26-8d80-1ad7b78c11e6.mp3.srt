1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay, I've been waiting since we hit the record button I wanted to ask both of you what your naming conventions are for your home

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,760
Machines on your land and drew I want to start with you. I

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,240
Named them after astronauts

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,160
so the laptop that I'm using right now is Aldrin and then I've got you know Grissom is my phone and

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,400
Lovell is my tower. That's clever

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,760
That's pretty good and not too far off from mine

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,140
If you want to switch it up, like say you've got some servers off somewhere. You can just choose a different mission

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,800
That's pretty good. Okay, Wes, what about you?

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,080
Star Trek ships, of course, and I always make sure to name my admin account

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,880
Oh do mine feel kind of boring now in retrospect because I don't have a ton of machines on my land

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,000
I named my machines after the moons of Jupiter of which there are many

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,800
So the computer I'm talking to you on is just really simple

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I oh just I oh and so it's like one of my favorite host names to connect to because it's very short

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,120
Hello friends and welcome in to get another fresh episode of your unplugged program. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,760
Hello, Wes and hello drew. Hello. Hello

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,400
Oh gentlemen, we have a fine show today. We solved a problem. They said would cost thousands of dollars

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,540
This is one of those episodes where we'll often talk about the pros and cons of commercial platforms

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,760
But this is one of those things that Linux does that the other OS is can't touch

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:39,680
Wes and I have come up with a couple of clever ways to use a Raspberry Pi to bond multiple LTE connections

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,600
into either a load balanced failover or we'll even talk about a way you can completely bond them and

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,400
To sort of prove a point. I am broadcasting from the woods today

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,960
So we'll talk about that plus we have community news and all of that to get into I want to say

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,720
Thank you to a cloud guru

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,720
This episode is brought to you by the all-new cloud grew the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,520
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs get certified get hired and get learning at a cloud guru

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,440
Com and also made possible by our core contributors. Thank you to our members

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,800
I'll give you an update on that a little bit in the show as well. But also time-appropriate greetings to the mumble room

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,960
I was late on the draw there. So I wanted to get you get you guys in before we went too far

29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,880
I appreciate I appreciate you being good sports about it. Hello everybody good to talk to you

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,840
Let's start off with some community news that I'm pretty elated to talk about and that is Lenovo has begun rolling out

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,560
Their Fedora Linux laptops and Ubuntu ones are coming soon

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,780
The first models are appearing with Fedora as an option. The first one being the ThinkPad x1 Carbon Gen 8

33
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,480
Not only has it rolled out with Fedora, but it's right there front and center and it's also the best price and

34
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:07,280
Best of all, it doesn't come with a whole bunch of bloat as to quote the Fedora team Lenovo respects our open-source principles

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,240
The only software they will have is from the included repositories. No extra fluff now so far

36
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,200
It looks like you'll have to be in the US to get one of these but fingers crossed that more markets come soon

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,120
I love that. It's vanilla Fedora. I think that's really great gaming on Linux has a great write-up and

38
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,280
Liam writes we also know from what's already been said to expect Fedora Linux to be rolled out to the ThinkPad p1 gen 2 and

39
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,840
The ThinkPad p53. It seems like Ubuntu is not too far off either and will probably land on the ThinkPad x1 Carbon

40
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Gen 8 soon and then other systems as well

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Love this. This is pretty exciting

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,460
This is like the moment, you know where we start to see real Linux adoption happen at the OEM level

43
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,240
Neal it's available in other places outside the US you're saying so when I talked to

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,560
Mark Pearson who's the Lenovo guy who's managing this relationship with Fedora?

45
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,740
He it's it's a matter of getting all the web teams for each of the individual regions to update

46
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,120
There's the websites to get them showing up

47
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,040
It is available in the web portals for the United States and Canada today

48
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
It is available through

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,240
Telesales or basically if you call them it's available globally. It will show up in the web portals are in various regions

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,280
I think over the course of the next couple of weeks or so, but don't hold me to that

51
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,920
I don't know for sure. I don't work for Lenovo. Yeah, sure. No, no, very good

52
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Good to know it does remind me drew that there's been some background

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,760
Projects getting in place to kind of make this a first-class experience. Yeah, I think it's worth mentioning that

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,920
Lenovo were some fairly early adopters of the LVFS project, too

55
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,360
So this has been a long time coming and they've been fairly good community members in my opinion

56
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,200
Just in the fact that they did launch into that LVFS system so early in the process

57
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,480
It's nice to see you know, like some formal support too because what so many of us have been using these as great Linux

58
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,920
Laptops for years and seems like Lenovo's finally caught on that. Hey, yeah people love this stuff. Yeah, there is that aspect

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,520
It's like yeah catch up guys. Come on

60
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,080
but what do we think this means for the vendors that have shown up for Linux and been here for

61
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Maybe like a decade like system 76. Is this gonna hurt them? Do you think I don't know if hurt would be the right word

62
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,760
I think it's good for the overall community that we have more choice

63
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
but it does

64
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,520
Maybe say a little something about the vendors who have been doing this for a long time

65
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:46,040
Are they going to be sidelined now that you know Dell and Lenovo are both offering, you know, first-class Linux support. I

66
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,800
Don't know. I'm hoping not because I'd like to see things like, you know, tuxedo and system 76 continue to thrive

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
and

68
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,440
I kind of doubt that that's really going to impact them too largely just because

69
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:09,280
Well system 76 is still a big player in our community, you know, and I looked at these laptops

70
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,480
There's like the advocate in me. That's like I need to put an order in

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,120
my Linux laptop was supplied by a cloud guru and

72
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,080
So I need you know, I'm like I would really like to have a Linux laptop

73
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,880
I would very much like to have one but when I look at the lineup

74
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,120
Even though I'm compelled to like support this initiative. I've always believed in voting with my wallet, you know right now

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,400
Like these first three months of JB being indie or like the just most critical

76
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,880
Like if I can survive these three months and then make it the next six months and then make it to the year mark like

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,960
That's gonna be a real accomplishment. So I it's like I really I'm really in a hard spot

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,560
I look at it and like it just doesn't quite do enough for me

79
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,320
Now this isn't an ad. This is totally just my opinion, but I look at something like the oryx pro and I think

80
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,160
That's a lot more meat on that bone. And if I'm only going to be able to spend my very limited funds once I

81
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,760
Get a lot more for that dollar from something like the oryx pro

82
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,640
Maybe it'd be maybe because for me like a GPU is kind of important if I only have you know one machine like that

83
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,880
You're probably also going to get you know things like a better support experience. Yes

84
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,200
Lenovo is now supporting Linux directly on these systems, but you know

85
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,420
It's a big organization with supporting multiple different platforms and operating systems versus, you know

86
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,120
A smaller shop like system 76 with where Linux is what they do and they're all passionate about it

87
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,040
Well and Lenovo is pretty new to supporting Linux, too

88
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,560
So, you know, what's the quality going to be I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying it's an unknown, right?

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,080
They're gonna be figuring some of that out still

90
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,320
Yeah, and I tend to agree with you here. I've been a longtime ThinkPad user, but especially lately

91
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,240
It feels like you've been getting less bang for your buck with the Lenovo models than you would with say a smaller distributor

92
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,600
I still think it's significant because it it is a brand legitimization

93
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,760
It is an option that a lot of developers are going to be comfortable with and enterprises

94
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,220
But there should be some knock-on upstream effects that might help the other OEMs as well right now the advantage of having a big

95
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,900
OEM like Lenovo directly and properly supporting it

96
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Linux in a very direct way

97
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:27,460
Across the globe is that they are directing all of their suppliers to also support Linux the right way

98
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,740
That is driving them to move work upstream

99
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,540
Contribute to the correct projects get their drivers in there make sure the hardware enablements there it shifts the prioritization

100
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:43,620
For their suppliers to like, you know, I I still hold out a tiny flame of hope

101
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,420
You know

102
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:52,220
It's very small flame of hope that Nvidia could be convinced to make their open source drivers for Nvidia cards work a lot better and

103
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,700
and my hope is that because

104
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,220
Lenovo is such a big user of Nvidia cards on all of their professional lines and

105
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:05,580
Two of the professional lines that are going to come with Fedora later on are going to have Nvidia cards in them that it might help

106
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,900
You know drive this case towards we should better support Linux out of the gate rather than you know

107
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,060
this crap situation that we're all stuck in right now and

108
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,300
That's good for Lenovo. That's good for the Linux consumer

109
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,700
But it's also good for all the smaller OEMs that just don't have

110
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,820
The purchasing power and the might to get a part supplier to respect them and then to be frank

111
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,860
I love a lot of what system 76 does

112
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,540
But they just don't have that might that is required to force the supplier to do things the right way and Lenovo does

113
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,540
And like I hoped, you know ten years ago when Dell was starting to do this project Sputnik that they would do the same thing

114
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,540
It hasn't panned out to the degree that I'd hoped for

115
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,040
It will be interesting to see if we see any messaging from Dell in response to this

116
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,440
Poppy I feel like I want to go to you to get some historical thoughts on these think pads and these Lenovo's

117
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:04,080
Officially launching these Linux lines and if we zoom out in in a few months, we'll have Ubuntu versions as well

118
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:11,260
What do you think about all this? Well, obviously I love the idea that my preferred laptop vendor of choice you

119
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:19,700
Yeah, I know right I'm making it easy for me to make that purchasing decision and later this year I get my

120
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:28,140
Laptop refresh money from my employer and I get to choose which laptop I'm gonna spend my money on and obviously I'm gonna spend my money

121
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:35,720
on a laptop from a vendor that supports Linux and so there's now choice I get a laptop refresh

122
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,340
amount of money every three years and

123
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:46,300
Every three years there are more places that I could spend those dollars. I'm delighted by this obviously that is an interesting

124
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,780
Measuring stick, you know when you come up for air every three years to start shopping again

125
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:57,940
And you could kind of take a poll on what's come since last time and you're right it it's more choice than ever. We're also seeing

126
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,520
Distributions work closer with hardware providers, too

127
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,540
So I think we're gonna see more stuff there. Yeah, when it does come time for me to get a dedicated Linux machine

128
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,620
Thankfully, I have my Pinebook Pro right now, but honestly, it's I'm a performance maniac

129
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,340
So when it does come time, I'm gonna have an even harder choice, which is a good thing

130
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,580
I think that's code for you break systems. I

131
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,980
Just am a demanding user

132
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,120
Thankfully speaking of upstream knock-on effects

133
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:30,180
performance on the Raspberry Pi 4 could be looking a lot better for those of you using SD storage a

134
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,860
Manjaro developer has brought to light that only the single data rate mode is currently being used

135
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
for micro SD cards and

136
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,860
Em MC storage with the Raspberry Pi 4 a model B, but get this ready with a two line

137
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,180
Yes, two line kernel patch

138
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,660
The double data rate mode can be enabled yet Tobias Schramm sent out a kernel mailing list post

139
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,460
Identifying that it looked like the controller in the board circuitry appear to support double data rate mode just fine

140
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,620
He also checked on the signal integrity on the data lines for the micro SD card slot and so far

141
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,140
It hasn't found any issues now so far no one from the project

142
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,460
It's really responded to the patches yet, but it was just posted this weekend

143
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,980
I think so we'll see but it is exciting

144
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,260
you know not everyone has the time to set up some sort of external hard drive or you just want to you know a

145
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
small form factor and

146
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,100
SD card makes the most sense. Yeah this machine. We're using today for this little tester

147
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,820
Roo that we're gonna tell you guys about we're running it off the SD

148
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,900
I mean, it's not great, but when you when you just want to get a pie going it's it's pretty nice

149
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,980
and

150
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,900
If you're running Manjaro on your pie, I think they're gonna patch this on their version of it, so

151
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,220
Those folks will get it take advantage of it. Yeah right away

152
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:52,700
Yeah, you know Manjaro is making a very compelling argument for the ARM platform however for these devices that we're using I've stuck with

153
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,440
2004 because I kind of use them for a little more like reliable like server type work

154
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,700
I want the LTS 2004

155
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,460
But I also want something that's built to be server grade and as much as I love arch and I've put it on our server

156
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,020
In the in the studio

157
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,740
I don't actually want to run arch on my raspberry pies that are right that are acting as network routers

158
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,060
Turns out one arch server is more than enough yeah

159
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,100
Yeah, really, but this is a great little thing to see and you know one of those little improvements by code

160
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,260
Which I love updates that make your system faster, right?

161
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,420
I mean like if hardware is just sitting there and suddenly with a little bit of tweaking you can make it better for everyone using it

162
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:36,220
That's really exciting all right. Well. I have something pretty exciting. I am very excited to announce that

163
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,060
We have one of our first sponsors since going independent has come on board the unplugged program

164
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,900
and it's a company that I've wanted to work with for a

165
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,660
Very long time and they were one of the first on my list when we started talking about going independent again

166
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,780
And I am thrilled to say this URL for the first time

167
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,420
Check out for a special offer for linux unplugged podcast listeners and new linode customers visit linode.com

Slash unplugged and receive $100 towards your new account. You know these new ads. We're doing they're gonna be tight efficient ads

169
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,940
this is not representative of what the ad will typically be but I wanted to take a moment with this first one and

170
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:25,220
Tell you personally that for me. This is a milestone in my career because I've I have followed Linode from afar for a very long time

171
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,340
and

172
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,780
When JB stopped doing all sponsorships

173
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,100
I wanted a pretty clear separation of church and state and so about two years ago for all my personal projects

174
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,100
I started spinning everything up on Linode because I thought you know nice and clear and separate all of the work stuffs on one all

175
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,340
Of my personal stuffs on the other and I watched I watched them become an extremely competitive

176
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Company where they really have evolved their product over the last couple of years to the point where it is

177
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,700
It is extremely sharp. It is extremely well put together

178
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,940
And the best part is they have been deep in the community for a long time

179
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,840
So they're one of those companies that is part of the Linux community

180
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,380
I have gone to many events and I've seen them at those events talking to people

181
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,140
So check out linode.com slash unplugged they have plans starting as low as five dollars a month

182
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,660
They have dedicated CPU plans. They have GPU plans. They have block storage

183
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,100
They have the one-click app marketplace that I love but something else that's really cool something

184
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,900
I played around with a lot with setting up different WordPress and I was able to play with different styles of WordPress setups is

185
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,140
They have these stack scripts that will deploy a stack for you and you can just audit the script

186
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,700
You can see this is where it's installing Debian. This is where it's deploying this package

187
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:45,060
Really easy to write your own as well native SSD storage 40 gigabit network connections industry leading processors

188
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,940
they have data centers all over and

189
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,620
They have job postings as well, which I want to mention for those of you

190
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,020
They're looking for work right now linode.com slash careers. It's not related to the sponsorship

191
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,380
I just think that's something you should know about if you want to get that $100 credit and you're a new customer at linode.com

192
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,820
Slash unplugged go spin up a box on Linode's infrastructure

193
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,840
It's really cool. And I am so happy to have Linode on it as a sponsor, but also

194
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,300
To have them here just as we're going independent again

195
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,820
So they're one of the first companies helping make that possible. They started in 2003

196
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:28,360
So they've been around a long time just like Jupiter broadcasting. They support the Kubuntu folks and other members of the community

197
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,780
I've wanted to work together with them for years

198
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,740
And so when when this deal worked out, I had a real moment

199
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,380
I had a moment where like okay this decision to go independent is gonna work like

200
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:46,540
It's it's really thrilling and I would encourage you to support our sponsor because they're making what we do possible right now

201
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,680
And I think this is a great fit linode.com slash unplugged get $100 off and a big

202
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,300
Thank you for Linode for sponsoring the unplugged program. I just recently set up a wordpress instance

203
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:03,180
I did it in seconds. I was I was seeing what I could do to just do a self completely self-contained self-hosted podcast platform

204
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,620
It's awesome. We'll be telling you more about it linode.com slash

205
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,060
Unplugged I just signed up. I just your code

206
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:17,860
I just signed up for Linode because I actually needed a quick and easy VPS to sign up for and

207
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:25,380
Having $100 thrown in was an absolute bonus for me because money is tight and I really appreciate that. So thank you

208
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,060
I've just signed up. Yeah. Thank you to Linode to do it. I'm looking at doing the same

209
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,700
They're really cool company and they're one of those that as a businessman

210
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,700
I've wanted to work with for years, but then there was like another relationship that kind of made that impossible for a while

211
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,920
And then we weren't doing ads. And so this is just a bit an opportunity that it's really exciting feels pretty great

212
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
It feels like a great fit for the show also

213
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:54,300
Want to say a huge thank you to our unplugged core contributors. We are already halfway to the goal of essentially the revenue of a

214
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:01,780
Single sponsor. We're about 50% now. It's like 48% the way there which is incredible. That's an amazing first response of the founder

215
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:09,600
Discounts went away super quick, but the membership is still available at unplugged core comm we have two feeds for you one feed

216
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,840
That is the entire bootleg live stream lots more show lots more show than what makes it in

217
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,120
Typically, the other version is an ad free feed with some there is some small ads in there that are contractually obligated

218
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:27,200
but it's like just the main fully produced show ad free and you get that as an as a podcast feed in your podcast catcher you

219
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
choose either one and

220
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
it's a great way to support the show and

221
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,880
Not only keep the ad load down, but let us be picky and choosy, too

222
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,560
So that's an unplugged core comm and thank you everybody who has become a core contributor

223
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,880
it has been a very emotional week for me and

224
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,280
That's one of the reasons I'm out in the woods seriously is just so I can kind of process everything that's happened and that support

225
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,000
You know, it helped me feel like I was gave me some confidence that I was doing the right thing here

226
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,800
The audience got your back they do they do they do let's also mention something else

227
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,760
We're working on and that is coming up next episode

228
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,680
So we're we're doing a fedora 33 bug-a-thon to test fedora 33 on September 8th

229
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,640
We're gonna do the show and then we're gonna just move over into testing

230
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
I want some people to show up and throw some hardware at the butter FS install

231
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
Let's try to find some issues

232
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,480
And if we do let's work with each other to do informative helpful bug reports

233
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,160
Our idea here is we're trying to line this up with a testing week with fedora

234
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,800
So we're doing this while the project is in a mode to receive these and we're gonna try to do

235
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,000
Well done bug reports that actually help them and hopefully we'll have some people advising us and guiding us on how to do that

236
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,080
And we'll be on the live stream working with people and can help bounce things around in the mumble room

237
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,680
I'd like to do some brainstorming in the uh, lup lug this sunday

238
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,560
And if you haven't tried it yet, maybe it's good time to go get fedora 33 and start banging on it

239
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,400
The test week is going on right now as we record and it wraps up on the 8th, which is the last day

240
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
So and that's the that's when lup is

241
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,520
So that's next week as we record this episode september 8th 2020 if you can make it to jblive.tv

242
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,240
Join us for the live show and then stick around to do some bug smashing or show up when you can

243
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,120
It'll be a live bug-a-thon. I don't expect this to be a tremendous success or anything like that

244
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,840
But i'm trying to learn how we can do this best so we can make this something we do a little more on the regular

245
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
For other projects and distributions try to do something

246
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,020
That targets the project schedules that can kind of land when it's most beneficial. So we're not overwhelming them with low information

247
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,480
Low value bug reports, but try to get it right and that's what this is about

248
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,880
And we're kind of doing our first tests with this next week september 8th, and you know how we love fedora

249
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Yeah, we love to give those guys a you know

250
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,400
A good community test because the butter fs switch is it's a it's it's a huge switch

251
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,440
And it's a very public thing and if we can maybe help avoid some issue that comes up that causes people heartburn

252
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
That's a win-win for everybody

253
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,080
Okay, so that's uh, that's everything let's talk about the little trick that wes and I pulled off

254
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,880
Using two separate internet connections with linux. We are using myfis

255
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,080
But in theory you could combine this with say a home broadband connection and a backup cellular connection. That's

256
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,280
Tethered to your phone even doesn't have to be a dedicated data device

257
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,360
There's a lot of ways you can actually mix and match this to bring maybe

258
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,920
Fairly reliable connectivity to an area that maybe is having an issue. I am utilizing it because

259
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
Uh, well, let's see how to put this you're a hill person

260
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,280
Yeah, I am out in the woods and I don't I don't have like a broadband internet connection. I don't have like

261
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,640
Comcast comes doesn't come to my rv. That's not that's not a thing. I thought you were going to say

262
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,000
That's not a thing. I thought you were just like dragging a fiber cable out the back

263
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Yeah, right, uh, or I have a big satellite pointed at elon's starlink array

264
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
Maybe someday. Yeah, maybe actually but right now

265
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,360
the most practical approach this is crazy, but the most practical approach is

266
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,120
I track down old grandfathered truly unlimited data plans

267
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,840
And I contract with them and I have an at&t. I have verizon

268
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,560
I have others too. I have actually have ting back in the mix now, but I have I have several others but

269
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,880
For this I wanted to see if I could take a benefit if there was any benefit

270
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,040
From using both my at&t my fi and verizon my fi at the same time and use a raspberry pi

271
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,200
To sort everything out in between and there's issues here that have to be accommodated for like, you know

272
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,980
My fives are pieces of crap that often requires stupid interaction

273
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:39,300
Uh, you know and those kinds of things but there overall the idea was these are two very expensive connections

274
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,060
Can I leverage them at the same time instead of traditionally connecting to one using that and then speed testing it?

275
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,940
Connect to the other one use that speed test it and then okay. Well i'll use this my fight today

276
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,220
And then tomorrow i'll use that my fi instead let linux sort it out and just use them both

277
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,580
Just use them both and there's there's a lot of ways to crack this between like vpn bonding

278
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:08,520
Which would require uh, like a node on a on a linode somewhere or some kind of remote gateway that would combine your connections

279
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,460
But that's not the direction we went for this so you could

280
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,620
And some have even talked about doing with wire guard didn't we see that as well west? Yeah, you know

281
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,340
There are a few ways to make this happen because well it's linux and and that's how these things work

282
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,660
Especially with networking and I think this would work really well for a lot of places

283
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,620
Especially if you weren't like chris and constantly roving around this large country

284
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,660
Because you do need a vps at the end and you basically, you know

285
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,780
You've got your two internet connections and then you you set up a tunnel

286
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,460
To the vps over both internet connections and then you just use the regular kernel, you know

287
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:47,620
Interface bonding support that exists just right in the kernel itself to bond those together on your local side

288
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,860
And since they both end up at the same place

289
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:56,260
It just works and then the vps acts as the final gateway to the internet now a big plus with this too is

290
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,960
Is you only show up as one external ip address, right? You just show up as the ip address of that vps

291
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,700
But it's a little more complicated

292
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,820
You also have to have a vps in play which not everyone does

293
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,100
And it might be tricky for you because where you are in the country might not correspond to where that vps is

294
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,100
And you know if you the latency there dominates everything maybe that's not so great

295
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,500
So before we talk about what we did instead

296
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,940
To accomplish what west and I were able to pull off just using free linux and a raspberry pi

297
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:31,160
There is a commercial product made by a company called peplink. And these are the products you'll usually find in buses trains

298
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,420
Um boats and in this product is called the max transit duo

299
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,340
And it combines two lde connections and it has external antenna connections and it's a little router

300
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,540
It may even be running linux itself. It has a bit of a ui to manage all of this

301
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,140
It makes a lot of what west and I did simple the catch is

302
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,580
The product is like eleven hundred dollars

303
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:59,860
Hundred dollars. Whoa. Yeah, and then the bonding service to bond the connection is about a thousand dollars a year

304
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,240
Wait, what? Yes, that's a little more than a vps

305
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,980
Yeah

306
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,860
So when I looked at those prices, I said I bet we can figure out a way to do this for free with linux

307
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:17,380
And sure enough so the approach that we went with is it's it's more I guess akin to load balancing

308
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,900
Wouldn't you say it's like a policy routing solution? Yeah, you know, um

309
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,940
If you're still using if config, well, that's just fine

310
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
But you really should check out ip route 2

311
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,260
And the ip command because it exposes a whole bunch of really neat kernel facilities that you might not otherwise be aware of

312
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,300
And one of those is more advanced policy routing now normally when you're you know routing packets

313
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,140
It's kind of all about the destination

314
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,020
But in our case if we have two outbound gateways two isps that are connecting us to the internet

315
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,020
Things can get rather confused if the connection comes in from one and then goes out on the other

316
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,940
Yeah, tcp doesn't like that. No, no, right. I mean, I wouldn't like that

317
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,380
But thanks to policy routing you can set things up

318
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,980
So that never happens if it comes in on an interface it goes out the same interface and the kernel actually has built-in native support

319
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,340
To have different weights and to load balance between those connections

320
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,380
So you can just set up multiple routing tables one for each of your different isps

321
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,580
then you set up some ip rules the command is ip rule and that sort of you know sets things up so that

322
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,020
You don't run into those confusing problems of things going out the wrong interface

323
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,740
Make sure if it comes in on one goes out that same one

324
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,100
And then tell the kernel how you'd like to preference them either give them the same weight and it'll just split the traffic equally

325
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Or if you want to wait one more than the other because it's faster. Well, you can do that, too

326
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,700
now

327
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,700
This isn't perfect in a lot of ways right because for any one connection

328
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,940
It's not going to use the bandwidth of both links

329
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:48,020
But if you've got multiple users on your LAN say or you're just downloading for things from multiple sites at the same time

330
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:53,700
Well there it will work. And so this is something that we played around with because here where i'm parked in the woods

331
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,300
Amazingly, there's a tower not too far away and I get

332
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,740
95 ish megabits on one connection and about 60 megabits on the other what yeah, it's great

333
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,140
So we thought well, let's wait the 90 megabit connection a little heavier

334
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:16,340
And then that'll be the primary connection and then the 60 megabit connection is the one that gets used when the other connection is busy

335
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:23,700
and the next level kind of trick to this was to set up that little raspberry pi as a router for the LAN and then

336
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,660
Just set the default route on my boxes on the LAN to point to the raspberry pi

337
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,300
Yeah

338
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,380
What's also nice about doing this yourself with linux is it makes it pretty easy if you wanted to say like

339
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,220
Let's say you've got the kids at the rv

340
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,100
Chris and you want them to use the slow connection because it doesn't really matter for you know, whatever video they're streaming

341
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,740
Well, you can use the faster connection to actually get some work done. Well, you could set that up too

342
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:50,500
Now drew tells me that there's something similar to this that the ubiquity products do. Yeah, so you can do

343
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,980
pretty much all of this in their edge max line and

344
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,780
It's running viata, which is essentially just like debian but

345
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,100
Repurposed for routing. Oh cool. So you can buy like a little edge max router

346
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,300
Some of them are only like 100 bucks. That's what I use at home

347
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:16,500
And literally log into a shell install debian packages adjust the routing manually do all of that

348
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,100
Within a little box that's designed for routing already has multiple ports, you know

349
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,620
Whichever model you buy is going to determine which port how many ports you have

350
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,300
Uh, it's really cool tech that is neat. Okay, I would definitely check that out

351
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,580
Well, like all great things in linux, so all this stuff is like built in but there's also some projects

352
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:43,940
Projects that sit in front of some of these tools like the one we were using west was if I recall net isp balance

353
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,340
Right. Yeah, and so where things you know

354
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,860
You might might want a little more support and I should also note that um some other linux firewall based projects

355
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,060
Like open wrt or shore wall. They've got tools in place to kind of manage this for you, too

356
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,320
We didn't want to go that route. We were kind of rolling it ourselves to play with the underlying technology

357
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,300
But if you want to get fancier

358
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,220
You want to make sure let's say that one of these mi-fi craps out and just totally drops off for a while

359
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,500
Has to be power cycled and come back online. You want to make sure that those cases are handled in a robust way

360
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,740
So there's a couple tools out there. Um, we'll have them all linked in the show notes, of course

361
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,460
one of them was just an easy link status monitor that

362
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,740
Did the hard work of sending pings out your various interfaces and then running external scripts?

363
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,900
When something changed and that seemed super useful really nice to customize

364
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:34,340
But I think for your case we wanted something that was a little more plug and play and just forget about

365
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:42,100
That's where net isp balance came in which is basically just um a fancy pearl script that sets all of this ip based

366
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:48,760
Policy routing up for you and has a few ip tables tricks up its sleeve too to make this automatic

367
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,140
It's also got a nice failover mode

368
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,020
So if you don't want to load balance, you just want to say have a backup connection

369
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,540
Maybe that's maybe that's a mi-fi and you have a regular cable connection or something that works, too. Yeah

370
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,260
That's the part where I could see it being really useful for

371
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,060
Remote offices that are maybe have connectivity that have a broadband connection, but it's a little flaky

372
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,020
I've definitely had clients that have been in that situation before or people at home

373
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,740
That always want to be able to have some connectivity

374
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,220
Maybe it's for their alarm system monitoring to their camera system

375
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:20,260
You could have it fail over to something like a ting mi-fi that you're only paying for when you use the data

376
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:26,740
Um, or what i'm doing here is google fi is like the third backup if for some reason I have no verizon and at&t

377
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,980
It's unlikely that i'll have google fi but it'll give it a shot and that's pretty neat

378
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,980
And you just have this really easy to set up config file and it makes it simple

379
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,300
I assume you probably have to have mailing set up on your machine, but it makes it very simple to generate alerts

380
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,340
When an event occurs as well, which is really nice

381
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,500
So you don't have to sit there and watch it. It'll just send something to like an email inbox, right?

382
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,940
You can get an email saying like hey, just so you know your main connection went down

383
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:56,100
I'm now using your more expensive backup connection just to be aware

384
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
Yeah, so that's net isp balance

385
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,420
And it's it's one of the it's just one of those great open source tools because a lot of the heavy liftings actually being

386
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,820
Done by the kernel and the os tools

387
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,540
But like west said this this pearl script really kind of wraps it all up and makes it nice and approachable for you

388
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,740
Yes, and it it'll handle some of that monitoring for you too, right?

389
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,940
So it's going to be doing you know

390
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,700
You can configure it with endpoints that you want to test it's going to send out periodic pings

391
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,260
You can also configure it to say like oh well if packet loss exceeds a certain threshold well

392
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,460
Then consider that link down all kinds of options like that and another sign that I really liked

393
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,660
I mean as you said chris, it's just basically using a whole bunch of you know built-in stuff to the operating system

394
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,420
It's got a debug mode

395
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,380
so if you want to go investigate what commands it's running or just use it as a script to orchestrate this and then

396
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,500
Customize it run those commands yourself. That's possible, too

397
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,980
Mm-hmm. Yeah, good point. So, okay. Let's let's talk a little bit about

398
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,980
Uh policy routing a bit more because that was kind of key to make this work

399
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,460
Traditional ip routing systems just route packets by comparing the destination address

400
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,020
Against a predefined list of routes that it can go to and at certain points as well

401
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,180
I've got nowhere else to send this i'll send it to the default gateway and that's my understanding of routing

402
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,500
So how does that differ from policy routing? Well policy routing is just more flexible

403
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,180
It lets you it lets you use other information that's available. Maybe the source of the packet. Maybe the protocol that's going on

404
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:23,220
basically a whole bunch of other options instead of just the destination and usually the way this works is you've got you've got basically this

405
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,620
Set of rules that you can have and then you can add additional routing tables

406
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,780
this might be familiar for folks who are used to you know, maybe more network grade routers that have a

407
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,060
vrfs virtual routing and forwarding tables that exist

408
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,780
And it just adds a lot of flexibility because originally you just have that one main routing table

409
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,860
But actually under etsy ip route 2 slash rt underscore tables

410
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,220
Just by adding a line in that file you can add to basically as many as you want

411
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,380
And then once you've got these tables set up they act as little routing namespaces

412
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,620
So you can configure default different default routes

413
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,620
You can set up access and then you can set up some rules that make sure things

414
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,740
Based on either the source or the protocol or whatever fields that you have access to through policy routing

415
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,700
go to the right table and then those tables just have

416
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,780
Routes that work as normal and then direct the traffic on so you can make sure that say like if you have different lands that

417
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,980
You need to get to you can set it up. So those go the shortest hop possible

418
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,820
And in our case, that's the magic that says oh look you came from this interface over here

419
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,460
Let's make sure that you choose the routing table that sends you back out that same interface

420
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,100
And in the past you could do this too. Um ip tables has a marking facility

421
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,260
so you could use ip tables that would set a mark on a package if it came in over that interface and then I

422
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,620
On the outside it would identify that mark and then know how to send it. But this is just a much cleaner approach

423
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:49,060
Now from like the totally other end, uh, this is something we didn't play around with but we did come across speedify

424
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:56,740
which is a commercial graphical user application that promises to combine multiple connections on your linux desktop or on

425
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,660
I think other os's as well including maybe mobile and and it also include vpns in that potentially and it

426
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:07,860
It combines all of the connections into one vpn back to their server. It's a commercial product. It's like three dollars a month

427
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,660
Um, but they kind of promised to do this only you don't have to have a separate device

428
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,940
It's acting as a default gateway

429
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,460
You just like throw it on your laptop and you connect a couple devices up

430
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,140
And then this this app gives you a gooey to bring them together didn't try it

431
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,100
But it's certainly from the screenshots looks pretty decent

432
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,920
So that's something if you're interested if you're interested in this but don't want to go through all that rigamarole

433
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,440
You could give that a go but for me it was worth all of the rigamarole to get a linux box set up

434
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,640
and and get all this done and and and figure out how to do all this because that's sort of like

435
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,600
Um the groundwork for a good edge device that then I could say make a wire guard endpoint

436
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,640
Or perhaps I could put a squid proxy on so that way i'm not

437
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,440
sending as many web requests out over the myfis and instead i'm answering them locally from a cache and

438
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,040
Setting it up as a local dns cache seems like a no-brainer as well

439
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,880
And maybe it's an edge cache for steam possibly as well if I throw a usb hard disk on there all of a sudden

440
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,740
This little raspberry pi that's managing these multiple connections

441
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,880
Can start doing other things that are clever to take the load

442
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,280
Off of my myfis and make the overall experience faster as well

443
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,600
And so that's why I thought it was worth the effort, right?

444
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,800
And you know, I think it's a good use case here too because you might ask

445
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,680
Well, is the pi really up to something like this? But since you don't have a fancy, you know gigabit fiber connection the speeds on your

446
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,880
On your outbound really aren't too bad. So it seems to be working nicely

447
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,760
Yeah, I think it's a good point to make is if you were if you were maybe connecting to something considerably faster

448
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You might want a faster machine as the router

449
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,760
I also want to clarify here too that you know net isp balance was really neat to find also because

450
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,080
While policy routing is not too complicated in the simple case that we were talking about and

451
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Um, we'll have linked in the show notes just the sort of the basic guide that we followed when we were setting it all

452
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,360
Up by hand, but if you're new to networking or networking with linux and this all sounds a little bit over your head

453
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,560
you don't really have to worry about that with net isp balance because

454
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,640
Basically the bare minimums that you need are you got to have your multiple connections?

455
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,460
They got to have ip addresses in our case. That was just dhcp

456
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,120
To the myfis and then it literally took care of the rest

457
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,680
I mean you did have to set up in the config file. You've got to tell it

458
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,600
What type of service you got, you know, like which are your lan interfaces and which ones are isps and which device does that correspond?

459
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,640
To then you can also that's where you can customize the weights and like what ip to ping to check if the connection is up

460
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,520
But that was all we configured and it set up everything else. Yeah, and it's really simple because it refers to stuff as lan

461
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,720
Isp one isp2 and so it's not confusing at all

462
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,280
You know exactly what connections you're dealing with which I thought was really nice and it made it super simple to read

463
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,920
I could see us doing other things down the road to accommodate the fact that these are crappy myfis

464
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,320
like

465
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,720
using tools like full sm to

466
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,560
Monitor the links of them and then when it detects that some sort of link has failed triggering another script that does a usb

467
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,840
port reset to reconnect the myfi I could I could see little workarounds needing to come up because

468
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,560
Really for me ideally like the one thing that the peplink device has is the the sim card slots

469
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,920
Are fully integrated into the actual device. They're not these usb myfi devices. They're running their own crappy oses

470
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,160
That's probably the biggest limitation here is yeah, it's not like a real interface or anything or a fancy high-end sim interface

471
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,760
It's just a chromey myfi. Yeah, another thing that came to my mind

472
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,800
That would be a neat stretch goal here is uh, you know set something up to do speed tests across the various links

473
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,400
And then shift the weights as those speed test results change. Yeah

474
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,000
That would have been useful today because before we started recording

475
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,320
I did all the tests and the at&t connection was far and above the connection to use for our remote voip setup here

476
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,960
15 minutes before we went on air the at&t connection was unusable

477
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,760
It was dropping packets to our voice server like crazy for some reason out of nowhere just every second or third packet gone

478
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
Sometimes multiple packets in a row gone

479
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,400
And the verizon connection out of the batch all of a sudden was the best connection

480
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,720
And it got me thinking like boy it'd be really cool to have some sort of health check script

481
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,640
That just does a sanity check back to the studio and then picks the connection

482
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,440
That performed the best in that health check. Yeah, wouldn't that that would just be so slick

483
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,120
So pro it'd be so pro. I tell you what, uh colonel points out that there is the uh,

484
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,360
G il or g g g g i net devices like I have their little mini slate

485
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,120
They do have one with dual sims and I saw that I was looking at that one actually

486
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,000
So i'll probably eventually switch this up in the meantime. I kind of want to see how far we can take it

487
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,240
So we're going to play with it a bit, but it was it was really fascinating to get

488
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:39,640
I would say at least the core functionality of that thousand dollar device for totally free with linux, right?

489
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,640
That was one of those things like windows can't really do this mac os can't really do this

490
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,920
This is pretty awesome. Like the fact that the kernel is just totally

491
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Helping us out by keeping track of the routes and it's easy to bond these connections

492
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,560
And then it's easy for an open source developer to create a pearl script that sits on top of all of this that

493
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,640
I mean, it's it's pretty awesome stuff and like the policy routing is like you're saying it's like enterprise grade routing stuff

494
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,160
So it's and I have it right here on a tiny little 40 pie. Yeah, that's what that's what's really exciting to me

495
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,200
Is it's just like the kernel has a really rich networking stack and yeah, okay if you've got, you know

496
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,600
Crazy high line rate speeds. Maybe it's not going to cut it for you. But for anything we're doing

497
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,120
Totally more than enough. Yeah, so we'll have links to the projects and some of the other projects that we saw that could be useful

498
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:29,160
Uh in the show notes if you're curious about maybe setting up a backup connection or combining two connections those resources

499
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Should be a good starting spot

500
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,440
Well, mr. Payne, uh, what do you say we move to the feedback and uh, we have something submitted by jay that we may adopt

501
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,440
We may fork this ourselves

502
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:48,120
This is a getting started with the jupiter broadcasting matrix guide a quick start including

503
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:54,280
A video walkthrough to make it super easy, but also just a step-by-step guide for getting on the jupiter broadcasting matrix

504
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,720
And uh, we have a link to jay's blog where he wrote all this up and he said you guys feel free to take as much

505
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,680
Or as little of this as you want and I just wanted to get it out there right now

506
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,160
We may combine that with a guide that we've already started

507
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,600
But uh, we're kind of doing 100 things at once right now

508
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,920
So it's just great to have somebody write that up. So thank you jay, and if you'd like to join us on the new

509
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,040
Matrix server check that out. We have a link to it the linuxunplug.com. I think this is just a great

510
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,560
You know just enough of a guide to where I found element decently easy to use and get started with but for folks

511
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,720
Who've never tried it before go check out the video

512
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,520
It'll have you up and up and chatting with us on matrix in no time

513
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
Let's talk about this pick that we've been

514
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,880
Sitting on for a couple of weeks because we've been super busy

515
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,020
But this pick is really special for for one reason and one reason alone. It's written in rust

516
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,560
For for one reason and one reason alone. It's written in rust

517
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,460
So i'm going to give a i'm going to give a guess west it's pronounced ton shell

518
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,860
Because you know, it's like tunnel and shell. Yeah, I think you got it. Okay, it's pretty neat

519
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,260
Um, it's a simple secure method to remote shell into ephemeral environments

520
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,620
And I like that they've got this question right at the top of the readme

521
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,980
Why would I use this over my well-established ssh client good question

522
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:18,140
You wouldn't the use case for ton shell is predominantly quick ad hoc remote access to hosts

523
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:22,780
Which you may not have ssh access to so let's say you've embraced the craze

524
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,940
You're using aws lambdas for just about everything now something goes wrong

525
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:32,140
That's not really an environment you control and usually that's part of the value proposition, right?

526
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,940
It's a quote-unquote serverless or at least hey, it's amazon servers. They're just running your app for you

527
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,500
But sometimes you might need a little more information, but you can't set up an ssh server

528
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:49,420
Well now you can because ton shell is a statically linked pre-compiled single binary that all you need to do is just download it

529
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,380
Run it and boom now you've got ssh access

530
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,860
I love that don't have ssh access. Well, we can fix that

531
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
That's pretty neat i'm glad we finally got to this one

532
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,260
Um, we have others that are in the winds. Is that the right? They're in the in the in the rafters

533
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,340
What are you in the wings in the wings? Is that what what does that mean? What does in the wings mean?

534
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,060
What does that even mean wes? I say I call bs on that saying wes ouch

535
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,580
You know i've decided right here on the show, uh, but that doesn't mean we couldn't use some more suggestions

536
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,980
so head over to linuxonplug.com slash contact if uh,

537
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:29,500
If you've got a pick for us diddle, uh, you say, you know what uh in the wings means

538
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,120
Uh, yeah, it's a theater term in the wings means uh backstage

539
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:41,260
Okay, that makes sense waiting to make their debut right? They're backstage about to come out on stage. Okay. No. All right

540
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,820
I retract my statement. I like it actually

541
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,300
I think that's pretty great. Uh, all right. Well, yeah, we'll link to that in the uh show notes ton shell

542
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:57,260
And it's the remote shell into an environment that uh, it's like a subspace environment, you know, this is how this is how in star trek

543
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:03,740
They would get into a computer that was inside a subspace envelope as they would use ton shell because it's an ephemeral subspace environment

544
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,300
You know this one for me actually I discovered it too late

545
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,460
Just a few weeks ago. I was trying to debug some problems in an ephemeral environment

546
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,580
And I didn't have a tool like this and it was driving me crazy

547
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,020
So I think this is going to be one of those picks that actually makes it into my toolbox. All right

548
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,140
Well, don't forget about that bugathon on september 8th after unplug show up for the show if you can and then stick around

549
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,820
To help us make fedora 33 even better. We need your help

550
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,900
I think it's a great way to kind of contribute, you know

551
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,500
We use linux and desktop linux

552
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,380
We take advantage of all these great projects and work of open source developers and even if you're not a fedora user

553
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,420
It's not a bad way to just sort of stop by and give back a little bit and participate in the community as well

554
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:46,300
So that'll be next tuesday as we record this and we encourage you to show up also again. Thank you to our

555
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,860
core contributors you guys

556
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,540
wow, um

557
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,020
Amazing and also just a little interesting stat west

558
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,100
Uh, it seems to me when I looked like it's split 50 50 like 50 people

559
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,260
50 of people are using the bootleg feed and 50 of people are going with the ad free feed

560
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,100
It's it's not like one is particularly more popular over the other

561
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:10,220
Well when you've got two great options can be mighty hard to juice. Oh my god, wes

562
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,100
Unplugged core.com

563
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,300
Uh, we appreciate your support over there. Also, uh big

564
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,300
Thank you to a cloud guru check out the new cloud guru cloud guru.com and also

565
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,380
A big huge. Thank you to lanode, uh for sponsoring this show and making it possible for us to come back indie

566
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:33,420
I am thrilled lanode.com slash unplugged go check out poppy on the ubuntu podcast and the new show

567
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:39,340
Which uh, we'll have links. Hey, yo over there. Yeah. Hey, yo, hey, yo, go check that out over there

568
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,180
It's uh, it's a good time mr. Payne

569
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,220
What else should we mention? Maybe the show has a twitter account

570
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,220
We hardly ever mention that at linux unplugged good way to get show updates anything else

571
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,740
Come hang out with us on our new month matrix server. Sure. We've got to get good about the plugs on that one

572
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,500
I'm at chris less. He's at west pain. The network is at jupiter signal

573
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,100
And drew is at drew of doom. Thanks so much for tuning to this week's episode of the unplug program. Oh

574
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:16,160
Linux action news is back. Check your feeds. See you next tuesday

575
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,420
So

576
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,020
West pain, I can't believe I forgot to mention linux action news is coming back. So as we record

577
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,140
Monday probably the next monday you're hearing this

578
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:58,300
There'll be a fresh brand new linux action news in your feeds

579
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,100
I I feel so bad. I should have totally put that in the show. There's so much going on right now

580
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,900
It's a good problem to have but I don't want to overwhelm people with the pluggy plugs either, but that's a big one

581
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:13,580
I'm, very excited about lan. It's a literally huge news. It is very big and um, you know for me

582
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,900
It's like uh, it's like it's a lifestyle change

583
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:22,220
It is it's like I went a decade plus doing shows on sundays and then just stopped and now it's coming back

584
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,620
The only the biggest downside for me is it lands during the lup lug

585
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,940
So that'll be tricky, but i'll probably i'll try to maybe pop in early. I'm not sure

586
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,380
I'm not sure what to do because we record at noon on sunday

587
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,980
Which was funny because the lup lug started sort of right as the next sunday

588
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,300
I would have been doing lan became lup lug time

589
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,900
I think this just means you need to drag joe into the lup lug for a bit

590
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,100
You know just dabble hang out for a few and then go get your work started

591
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,500
We all know you like to chat before you work. Anyway could yeah, I could run two instances of mumble

592
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,580
He wouldn't even have to do a thing. Don't give him the choice

593
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:59,680
Yes, he'll love that surprise
