1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
I hope you saved up your Bitcoin, Wes, because Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,200
Wide Web, is auctioning off his initial source code as an NFT.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,200
Of course.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
Nice, right?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,480
I mean, 9500 lines of code of basically the original building blocks for the HTTP protocol

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,760
and HTML and the Universal Document Identifier, aka the URI.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,200
It's all being bundled up in one nice, expensive package.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,440
Yeah, you also get an animated visualization of the code and a digital quote-unquote poster

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,960
that is quote-unquote signed by Berners-Lee via a graphic signature.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,000
There's also, more interestingly to me though, a take-home letter written by Berners-Lee

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
in which he reflects on the code and its creation.

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
Okay, okay.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,360
That might actually be a little bit of history right there.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,360
Yeah, no, I'm just totally getting hung up on the whole NFT thing.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
This is wild, what's happening.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,200
I mean, this feels like sacred stuff, but I guess it's kind of cute.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,040
You're getting like a keepsake in a way, a very, very expensive personalized keepsake.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,360
Bidding opens at $1,000 on June 23rd, and the auction will run online until the end

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
of the month.

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,520
So, you know, like I said, get your Bitcoins ready.

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,760
It's going to be spendy because it starts at $1,000.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:28,440
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
My name is Chris.

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
My name is Wes.

25
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Hello, Wes.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,200
I see you're wearing your nostalgia pants today.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Smart move.

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I don't know if I mentioned, they're also chaps.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,440
Of course they are, Wes.

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,080
You wouldn't go anywhere else.

31
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,040
This episode is brought to you by the all-new Cloud Guru, the leader alerting for the Cloud

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,680
Linux and other modern tech skills.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,760
And of course, there's thousands of hands-on labs.

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
Get certified.

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Get hired.

36
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,060
Get learning at a cloudguru.com.

37
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,640
Coming up on the show today, we're living up to our episode number.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,400
It was inspired by one of our virtual love members, Colonel, he said, you know, have

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,000
you ever looked up what error code 410 is?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,160
Which it basically just means gone.

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,640
What you're looking for here is gone.

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,920
And that set the theme for today's episode.

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,060
We're going to look at great Linux distros that are no longer with us.

44
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,680
The distros that shaped Wes and I into the Linux users we are today.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,000
So put on your nostalgia pants with us and go back in time because it is a wild ride.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,780
I thought when we got into this, this would be mostly be an exercise in checking out old

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,800
and busted software.

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
And some of these pack surprising features.

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,660
In fact, one of the distros I checked out from 2004 has features that just recently

50
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,560
landed in Ubuntu.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,120
But first, with the powers vested in me, I declare a retro time appropriate greetings

52
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
to our virtual log.

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Hello, Mumble Room.

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Hello.

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Hello.

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Hello.

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Hello.

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Hello, everybody.

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
It is good to see you.

60
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,360
In fact, I'd love to be able to see some of you soon in person.

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,120
I don't know if you felt it in the wind.

62
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,640
But a JB road trip approaches an epic road trip of a scale like we've never done before.

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,440
A quest for our people to reunite a mini JB team reunion.

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,600
It can't yet be the full team, but a mini team reunion is happening in August.

65
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,800
And during this, we'd like to have dinner with you.

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,180
So right now, we are making plans for two meetups in the month of August.

67
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,000
The first meetup will be in Salt Lake City, August 7.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,080
The second meetup will be in Denver on August 20.

69
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,000
Links to both meetups will be in our show notes.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,940
They are now up on the Jupiter Broadcasting meetup page.

71
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,660
If you are interested in going to either one of these, please consider letting us know

72
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,320
by joining that meetup because, for example, really, if no one really signs up for Salt

73
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,020
Lake City, we probably would just not route to Salt Lake City.

74
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,880
But we have a crowd down there.

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,480
And we had promised to return to Salt Lake City because we missed it once in the past.

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,180
And there is a pretty big Jupiter Broadcasting crowd down there.

77
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,180
And we're going to try to do it safe.

78
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,020
And we're going to try to meet up again and start connecting with our community.

79
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,560
And we will be hosting an event.

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,160
We'll have more details as they come together on the meetup page because it is a bit away.

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,640
But we wanted to lock the dates in.

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,100
So the first one, Salt Lake City, August 7.

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,200
And then the second meeting with meetup will be in Denver on August 20.

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,660
And of course, if anything changes, we'll definitely reflect the changes on the meetup

85
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,660
page.

86
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
That's the beauty of it.

87
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,560
And we'll keep you guys kind of in the loop via the show, too.

88
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,800
But details and nitty gritties will be on the meetup page.

89
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,920
And I am just elated at the opportunity for members of the team to get back together again.

90
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,760
We have plans for content production, special editions of shows that will be on the road.

91
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,160
All of it's still in the works.

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,640
And of course, we're following all the news and safety stuff very closely and trying to

93
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,000
make sure we do the right thing there.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,360
And so all of it's got to remain flexible.

95
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,840
We've learned that over the last year and a half or so, two years.

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,640
But that's in the works right now.

97
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,560
And details will be linked up in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 410.

98
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,960
And Wes Payne, are you going to bring the dogs out to Denver or are they going to have

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
to stay home?

100
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, you know, I'll have to think about that.

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,960
It might depend on how I get there.

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,080
But I'm excited already.

103
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
And you know what?

104
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,400
We're telling you now so you don't have an excuse not to join us if you can.

105
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,600
The first day you and I arrive, so as we have to plan for this schedule wise, we're doing

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
a Linux unplugged in Denver.

107
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Oh, boy.

108
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Of course.

109
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,320
You know, that's kind of stressful when I think about it.

110
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,840
But I guess, see, my plan is I'm taking Lady Joops out there.

111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,420
So I will bring equipment for you and I to record with me.

112
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,680
So you don't have to worry about that.

113
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,680
You gentlemen.

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Joops is right now in the shop, getting a bunch of work done to fix like my slide failure

115
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,780
that I had on my last road trip to get her ready for this Colorado trip.

116
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,080
So we're going to leave Washington, go down through Salt Lake City, and then up to Denver.

117
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,860
And I'm going to attempt to get the Lady Joops tracker going again.

118
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,880
So if people want to do a meet up along the way when possible, we'll try to arrange that

119
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,240
as well.

120
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
So more details to come.

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
But I wanted to get it out early while we had it.

122
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,680
Now it's kind of appropriate today that our first community news item features a piece

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,880
of software that I have some real nostalgic connection to.

124
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,800
And that is Pidgin.

125
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,540
Pidgin is a chat program that lets you log into accounts on multiple chat networks from

126
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,600
one app.

127
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,200
And it means you can chat with your friends that are on, well, back in my day, it was

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,680
AOL Instant Messenger and an IRC at the same time.

129
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,840
And Pidgin, I first started using game.

130
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,080
I moved to Pidgin.

131
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,820
And it is one of those apps that has played a huge role in my use of the Linux desktop.

132
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,920
And today, the primary developer, Gary, help me with your last name.

133
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Is it?

134
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,120
Well, help me with the last name so I don't embarrass myself.

135
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
It's Kramlich.

136
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,520
Gary Kramlich, also known as Grim Online, joins us to talk about what quite bluntly

137
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,380
is probably one of the more destructive trends that could begin to happen to free software.

138
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,300
And I think is easily one of the worst grifts to ever happen on our community.

139
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,920
And it's horrible.

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,560
And Gary, I don't even really know where to begin with this story.

141
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,700
From my perspective, what we have here is something that is probably a trend that's

142
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,080
going to continue and get worse.

143
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,600
Can you explain to everyone the highlights of what's happening to the Pidgin project

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
right now?

145
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Sure.

146
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,160
So on June 1st, I got a tweet from a follower, or I got a mention on Twitter from a follower

147
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:48,700
from a company named Zero Diem that posted a bounty for a remote code execution bug in

148
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,880
Pidgin and they were offering up to 100,000 US dollars for it.

149
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,960
We had to do a bunch of research because we didn't really know what Zero Diem was.

150
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,680
And it turns out they're an exploit broker, which the way I like to put it is that they're

151
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,280
basically a digital arms dealer.

152
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,360
So what they do is they put bounties out on open source projects to find bugs in them,

153
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,060
and then they pay people for those exploits, and then they sell those exploits to people

154
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,280
that want to use them.

155
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,280
In this case, their customers are typically governments located in North America and Europe.

156
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,000
That's a disturbing thought.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,360
So they're offering a $100,000 bounty for a zero day exploit on Windows or Linux in

158
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:38,000
Pidgin, and the extremely sad reality is that $100,000 bug bounty for that one bug is more

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,960
than the project was able to raise, I would imagine, in multiple years.

160
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah, definitely.

161
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,560
For the past two years, I've actually been working on Pidgin full time, and that started

162
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,920
with me going through savings, and I blew through that pretty fast, obviously.

163
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,280
But then last year, I was able to raise $25,000 for the project, and now all one person has

164
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,540
to do is find a bug in my work and they get four times as much money as the entire project

165
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
got in a year.

166
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,600
Yeah, and they're not necessarily going to disclose this bug.

167
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,040
In fact, it's not worth the value to them because if they're offering a bounty of 100,000,

168
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,720
they can sell it for more than that, and they're not going to turn around and give you a bug

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,600
report on what gets submitted to them.

170
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
They don't want it fixed.

171
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Right, exactly.

172
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,200
That's one of the huge parts, and the other thing I want to note too is they're not necessarily

173
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,140
stopping at one bug, right?

174
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,360
They're looking for as many as they can because they don't want us to fix it.

175
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,400
Right, they'll take multiple submissions.

176
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Right, exactly.

177
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,400
So, when we first heard about this, I went through and started running every single static

178
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:38,800
analysis tool I could, and we pushed out a release in two days to fix tons of stuff that

179
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,880
the scan built as a tool out of Clang, what that found, and stuff like that, but it's

180
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,520
like we're now getting into fuzzing and stuff like that to try to find other issues that

181
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,400
we can fix that aren't as obvious or found by static analysis.

182
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,520
Yeah, but geez, what a cat and mouse game that is, and again, it's not like these things

183
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,800
don't need to be fixed, but at the same time, the project needs to be able to prioritize

184
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,880
what it's working on, and so this, I imagine, is going to consume essentially all of your

185
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,920
development time.

186
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,720
It's not going to do all, but it has consumed a lot of it.

187
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,240
The one benefit is the bounty is only open from June 1st to August 31st, so there is

188
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,040
a light at the end of the tunnel, but that's still three months of development that is

189
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,720
completely messed up because of this.

190
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,920
I think my concern here, if you'll excuse the pun for Pigeon, is you are a canary in

191
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
the coal mine, and that this could become a new form of patent trolling on free software

192
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,540
projects that don't have the infrastructure to fight this.

193
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:38,120
If Zerodium went after a commercial chat program like Slack, Slack at least has lawyers, and

194
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,440
they could issue non-disclosures, they could fight to shut this down, they could make a

195
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,720
big stink.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,840
Free software projects don't have those kinds of resources to fight like that, and so they're

197
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,560
essentially just left to be picked by vultures, and when we go over all of the things in the

198
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,160
history of this show that can lead to free software developer burnout, this just seems

199
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,960
like a big number one at the top of the list if this starts taking off more.

200
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,720
That's a very, very fair point, but I will point out that we are a very interesting open

201
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,480
source project because we have been litigated against in the past.

202
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,000
That's one of the reasons why the name changed, right?

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,760
And we do have a non-profit legal entity above us to deal with this stuff, but how do you

204
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
even start?

205
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,640
They're a private company, they're not necessarily doing anything wrong or illegal, right?

206
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Right.

207
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,440
They don't even have to notify you, you just found out because somebody pings you on Twitter.

208
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Right, exactly.

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,960
So is there a legal basis for us to try to stop it?

210
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,920
I don't think so, but again, I'm not a lawyer, right?

211
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,320
And there's no way for you to get them to release the information that they do get.

212
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,320
You just have to hope that in your efforts you discover the same bug and fix it.

213
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Right, exactly.

214
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,960
And you imagine this must be happening at a much wider scale and people aren't just

215
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,760
brazenly talking about it on Twitter.

216
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,360
I mean, Zerodium themselves directly tweeted this.

217
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,040
They have this directly posted on their website at zerodium.com slash temporary.html.

218
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,260
They have it right there publicly.

219
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,000
They're not trying to hide it.

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Others may not be so overt about it.

221
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,960
This may be a bigger problem than we realize, especially just how brazenly they seem to

222
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,800
be able to operate.

223
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,900
And I'm wondering what's next.

224
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,240
Are you hoping to just hunker down, fix every bug you can, and ride this out until this

225
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
window closes?

226
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,840
Regardless, as you mentioned, people are going to be doing this stuff all the time.

227
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,800
Our biggest concern is, of course, our users.

228
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,000
There's a lot of people that were joking around like, oh, I know how to fix the problem.

229
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,480
Just release with a zero day and then fix it and claim the bounty.

230
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,240
And fund the project for two years.

231
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,240
Right.

232
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
That would be great.

233
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,120
But morally and ethically, I don't think so.

234
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,560
But the other concern is there's so much going on.

235
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,520
Like I said, our biggest concern is making sure our users are safe.

236
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,560
So while the governments or whoever might be targeting a specific person, this puts

237
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,640
every single user at risk.

238
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,360
And we're not going to sit here and let all of our users be at risk.

239
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Yeah.

240
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,480
So Gary, if there's somebody in the audience who feels like they may be in a position to

241
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,940
help you, what's the most efficient way for them to get a hold of you to try to do that?

242
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,720
Being the developer of a universal chat client, I am essentially everywhere and nowhere.

243
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,800
Including the Jupiter Broadcasting IRC chat room.

244
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Yes, exactly.

245
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
There you go.

246
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,520
And on top of that, I'm also in the Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram and Matrix and everywhere

247
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,880
because universal chat clients.

248
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,240
But the easiest way is to find our contact form on Pigeon.im.

249
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,760
You can find a bunch of ways to contact us there.

250
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Okay.

251
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,920
My heart really goes out to you guys because this project, you know, it's a beloved piece

252
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,960
of software and it is such a shame.

253
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,480
It feels like the cheapest, lowest grift possible.

254
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,200
This zero idiom company doesn't even find the exploit themselves.

255
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,460
They pay other people and they sell it as a middleman and then they just devastate free

256
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,640
software projects in their path.

257
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,440
And I appreciate you being willing to come on and talk frankly about all of this.

258
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,080
So that way our audience can be educated about it because there's some that are not able

259
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,960
to talk about it or they're in a different position.

260
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,360
So I hope this goes okay.

261
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,120
And I'd love an update when you have, if you have something that comes up and just want

262
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,040
to ping me and just let me know so I can give the audience an update.

263
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
All right, we'll do.

264
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Sounds great.

265
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,880
And thank you for the opportunity to talk to everyone.

266
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Yep.

267
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Yeah, I am.

268
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,960
I am really sad to hear this.

269
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
But thank you.

270
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,800
Thank you for all the hard work and thank you for fighting this.

271
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
No kidding.

272
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,680
Let's see the parts of open source development no one tells you to expect when you get into

273
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
it.

274
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Yeah.

275
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Yeah.

276
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
So let's talk about something that's really great to see.

277
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,280
And that is that in Linux 514 when that ships, it will have mainline support for the Raspberry

278
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Pi 400.

279
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,360
Now you recall that is the device that launched in last November as a full Raspberry Pi computer

280
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,640
inside a keyboard.

281
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,840
And I got one and I actually was extremely impressed.

282
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,200
In fact, I think it should be the Raspberry Pi for most people because you just plug in

283
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,360
an HDMI monitor and an Ethernet if you want, you're good to go.

284
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,560
It's a great little device.

285
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,600
And beginning with Linux 514, it looks like everything's just going to play fine right

286
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,560
out of the box with a vanilla kernel.

287
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Yeah.

288
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,880
If you don't recall, the Pi 400 costs around $100 US greenbacks.

289
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,700
But you get a keyboard with a Raspberry Pi built in with four gigs of RAM, a 1.8 gigahertz

290
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:23,640
quad core Broadcom processor, 16 gigs of storage and crucially, as Chris hinted at there, enough

291
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,580
ports and peripherals to have a fully working computer with just a monitor.

292
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,800
But you're not sacrificing on the Raspberry Pi side.

293
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,080
You're just getting extra.

294
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,280
It feels like a more finished product where the Raspberry Pi feels like a Tinkercad.

295
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,700
And I guess that's a good differentiator, too.

296
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,400
If you want something that's a finished product or the person you're giving it to, maybe they

297
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,600
need something that's more of a finished product.

298
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,560
And everybody that I showed was so impressed that an entire keyboard, a computer was in

299
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,520
the keyboard, like they'd never seen anything like it before.

300
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,640
And I'm like, OK, I guess it's cool.

301
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
But they were like, wow.

302
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,920
And I guess now that you're going to have just vanilla 514 support, which means any

303
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,040
distro that uses 514 or later in the future, you can just run on that.

304
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,120
It's nice to see that.

305
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,520
It's kind of a bummer, I guess, that we haven't had it there already since it's been out for

306
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,520
a bit.

307
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
But it takes a long time for these kernel versions to filter out to people anyways.

308
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,580
Yeah, that is true.

309
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,640
It's a bit strange because it didn't take that much work to get here.

310
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,400
There wasn't a new kernel driver or anything fancy.

311
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,420
I mean, there was some some new device tree additions specifically for the Pi 400.

312
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,480
But that was just some updates to change the clock speed, use a different Wi-Fi chip and

313
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,120
how power handling worked like it's a pretty small update.

314
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
But we've got to know.

315
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,600
Well, we're talking 514.

316
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,000
My favorite file system, XFS, is getting a nice boost.

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,840
Feronix Michael Arboman, he covers this stuff like a machine.

318
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,520
He likes XFS almost as much as you do, I think.

319
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,840
Yeah, I think it does.

320
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
I think you're right.

321
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,560
I had a big patch series that was sent out by Red Hat is queued for merging in the 514

322
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
cycle.

323
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,300
And it's great to see it because there's a lot of scalability improvements in there for

324
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,160
those of us that want to take XFS to bigger and larger things.

325
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Yeah.

326
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,280
How do you like seeing transaction rates go up from around 700k to 1.7 million commits

327
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,320
per second and a reduction in flush operations by two orders of magnitude for metadata heavy

328
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,680
workloads anyway?

329
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,720
You know, Wes, I know how important those flush operations are to you.

330
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,040
I know you got to keep things clean in your file system.

331
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,380
It's complex, difficult to understand and full of tricky stuff.

332
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,920
So that's why I'm really grateful that Larbal went and dug through some of this.

333
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,720
But it looks like we're getting now this into a nice, simple, more usable path.

334
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,820
It's taken a long journey and it has, he's followed it.

335
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,840
It's gotten cleaner and more consistent looking, more compact looking, like faster code and

336
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
all of that.

337
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,680
So it's getting to a really good spot now.

338
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,480
I think it's a win win win here where we get a shiny new 514 relatively soon, cleaner code

339
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,280
and better performance.

340
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:05,560
Man, with ButterFS, ZFS and XFS, I actually I could really see a use case for each one

341
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,120
of those in a disk in my system that makes me want to build like the ultimate Linux storage

342
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
box.

343
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,120
Sorry, not sorry, EXT4.

344
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,720
Linode.com slash unplugged.

345
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,360
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account and you support this here

346
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
show.

347
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,880
You make it possible for us to do this here podcast and you get $100 in credit on Linode.

348
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,340
It's a great deal.

349
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,760
Linode is our hosting provider for everything we've built in the last couple of years.

350
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,520
Their infrastructure is solid.

351
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
It's fast.

352
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,920
It's flexible and you can focus on your project, not your infrastructure.

353
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,480
I also encourage your notes if you want to send them in on your experiences of trying

354
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
out Linode.

355
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,040
A listener wrote in to me just the other day and told me that he did a little head to head

356
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,560
with AWS and Linode and Linode's pulled ahead again in performance like they do.

357
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,120
I love getting those kinds of notes and you get 11 data centers to choose from and every

358
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,440
service level is backed by the best customer service.

359
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,180
So if you get a $5 a month rig or you get some fancy AMD epic CPU thing with all this

360
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,320
storage and CPU and compute, you're going to get really great customer service.

361
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,760
I just spun up a machine and what was it?

362
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,120
Just last episode we talked about file run.

363
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,520
I think it was two episodes ago.

364
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
It was really recent.

365
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, we just spun that thing up.

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.

367
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,200
It's a, how would you describe it Wes?

368
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,340
Like it's got user permissions.

369
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,600
It's a file manager in your web browser.

370
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Yeah.

371
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,560
You want like a quick web UI to expose and interact with your file system.

372
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,200
All the stuff you might get on a local system, but exposed over the internet.

373
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,720
And it's really straightforward for people to adopt that just need to exchange a few

374
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
files.

375
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,280
We're helping the elementary OS guys get ready for their EDW that's coming up very soon.

376
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,120
And they needed a way to exchange files with participants.

377
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,880
And so we stood that up on a Linode for them and made it really easy for them to get access

378
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
to it.

379
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,560
And we thought about other solutions like file sync solutions and standard SFTP and

380
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
things like that.

381
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,760
And this was really the most straightforward for everyone and just got them collaborating

382
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
immediately.

383
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
And Linode makes it so simple.

384
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,680
I deployed the one click Docker system.

385
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
You get a couple of distro options when you do that.

386
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,980
I chose Debian.

387
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,600
So I just went with Debian and I hit the one click deploy.

388
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,300
That got all the base system configured, running Docker, good to go.

389
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,880
And then within a couple of minutes, I grabbed the project's Docker compose file, changed

390
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,200
the variables to meet our, you know, our setup needs and fired it up.

391
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,360
It took less time getting this new Linode file exchange box ready to go than it did

392
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
for the DNS to change over.

393
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,780
It's really efficient.

394
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,240
You can get in and get your project up and running in an impressive amount of time.

395
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,400
And you can really get in there because the dashboard makes it possible to get down to

396
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,960
the details if you really want or to keep it simple if that's your preference.

397
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
So go check them out.

398
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,380
Linode's been around since 2003, every step of the way, making Linux on virtual machines

399
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,600
excellent.

400
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,640
They're dedicated to it and the dedication to Linux is baked into the product as well.

401
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,020
And that resonates and that makes me really comfortable recommending them to you guys.

402
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,720
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100 in your account and try out

403
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,620
all of the stuff we've been talking about.

404
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,960
Maybe just go learn something for a little bit or experiment with a distro you've never

405
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,840
tried up on some seriously fast hardware.

406
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,280
There's only one way to start and that's at linode.com slash unplugged.

407
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,040
And now a little bit of housekeeping before we move on.

408
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,400
You heard me talking about meetups or anything really that we mentioned on the show.

409
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,560
If you want more details, you can always hit up our telegram.

410
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,020
There's usually somebody from our community that can answer or one of us is in there that

411
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,020
can answer.

412
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,660
You can find that at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram and also your emails.

413
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,800
Keep them coming.

414
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,440
I've been I've been trying to work in a new workflow with emails, so it's a great time

415
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
to send them into the show.

416
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
I'll just put it that way.

417
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,340
Linux unplugged dot com slash contact to get your emails in here.

418
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,040
And you heard me mention the meetup page.

419
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,540
We should probably give you that URL, too, so you can join us in Salt Lake City or Denver.

420
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,520
That's at meetup dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

421
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,180
Really easy, really simple.

422
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,340
You can find all the details over there and we'd love to see you.

423
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:16,460
And now, Wes, we go back in time to distros of past.

424
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,100
You and I wanted to kind of experience classic Linux in a way that we haven't felt or seen

425
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,440
in a really long time.

426
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,120
And one of the unique opportunities is a lot of this stuff can be found online and you

427
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,300
can get it running either in a VM or on a piece of hardware.

428
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,740
But then several awesome members of our community stepped up and also provided us with some

429
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,580
ISOs that we were having a hard time getting our hands on from their personal archives,

430
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
no less.

431
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
Yeah, nerds.

432
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
It's awesome.

433
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,040
Do you want to start with Ubuntu 606 just as kind of a baseline?

434
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,220
Because that's where our intro music there just came from.

435
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,880
And it was kind of the first Ubuntu while Ubuntu is still around.

436
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,240
We wanted to set this baseline here and then we're going to talk about distros that are

437
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,460
truly long and gone.

438
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,760
Yeah, I was harkening back and trying to remember what was the first Ubuntu that I actually

439
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,580
used seriously, you know, like day to day.

440
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,500
And it must have been 606 LTS Dapper Drake.

441
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,360
And what a release.

442
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,480
As you go through on Wikipedia and you look at some of the, they've got a great series

443
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,180
of collection of screenshots sort of showing Ubuntu's evolution over the years.

444
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,480
And 606 is where it really starts feeling maybe not modern, but something you immediately

445
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,600
recognize as Ubuntu.

446
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,520
And it got a lot of its, you know, things that we now take for granted in there, like

447
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,940
a network manager that was able to easily switch between wired and wireless has that

448
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,300
for modern.

449
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
What a luxury, Wes.

450
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,300
What a luxury.

451
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,560
You mean you don't have to do that at the command line anymore?

452
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,920
I know.

453
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:51,680
It also kind of stood out to me because already by that time, Ubuntu had a reputation for

454
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,040
working well on desktops, right?

455
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,200
It kind of came out and was like, hey, we're making Debian, we're taking that great collection

456
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,320
of packages, we're simplifying it down, we're making it more human so that if you're new

457
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,520
to all this, you don't want to deal with the command line as much.

458
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,000
We've got that option.

459
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,400
But at the launch, Mark Shuttleworth noted that in 606 LTS, they had worked to bring

460
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,020
that same ease of deployment and configuration to the server.

461
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,640
And so I think 606 also sort of marks not the dominance part, but the rise, the start

462
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,280
of rise of Ubuntu starting to take over the server.

463
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,560
Yeah, absolutely.

464
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,720
And at that point, their influence in a way in the rest of the desktop space was positive

465
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,560
because it encouraged distribution makers to slim down the amount of software packages

466
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,660
they were including.

467
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,720
So early on, you'd have three email clients and four web browsers and three terminals

468
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,740
and just crazy because why not have it all, right?

469
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,840
And internet connections were slow and so you didn't want necessarily to force people

470
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
to download stuff.

471
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,560
So you just load it right off the CD, you know, have at it.

472
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
The CD is there.

473
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,400
You can have four or five CDs, who cares?

474
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,400
And they just loaded distros up and Ubuntu changed that.

475
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
They set a different tone.

476
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,360
Yeah, you could get software off the internet if you wanted.

477
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,600
Now, of course, it does still support the CD and that was a retro thing.

478
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,760
I noticed right off the bat as it detected, I still had the ISO in there and was like,

479
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,400
oh, hey, do you want to use that to install some software, which, yeah, I did.

480
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,760
I got a open office early version going, which was pretty nice.

481
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,440
I was also impressed already by the installer.

482
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,120
It still had a lot of the same features that had that map to pick your time zone.

483
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
And if anything, it was more pleasant than modern day.

484
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,200
Sure, it couldn't do as much partition wise, but it was so simple.

485
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Mmm, quick, very quick.

486
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,280
All of these old interfaces are very quick.

487
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,640
I'm just gonna say that right up front so that way we don't have to repeat it over and

488
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
over again.

489
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,080
They were stupid fast and they were simpler, but they were stupid fast.

490
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,800
OK, now we're going to talk about distros that are no longer with us and that were very

491
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
special.

492
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,560
And I have to start on sacred ground.

493
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,080
I know this is a very special distribution to a lot of you.

494
00:25:53,080 --> 00:26:00,480
Stay a while and listen, Mandrake Mandrake was created in 1998 with the goal of making

495
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,780
Linux easier to use for everyone.

496
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,400
Mandrake was my first Linux love.

497
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,000
I dated Red Hat and Debian on and off a couple of times for a while.

498
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,960
I deployed a Debian server here, a Red Hat box there, tried out something every now and

499
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,440
then in the computer lab, but it wasn't really clicking for me in the desktop space.

500
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,260
But with Mandrake, with Mandrake, I fell in love and we moved in together.

501
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:34,920
Version 10.1 was their last release before this long saga of transformations and transitions.

502
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,240
It required a partly 32 megabytes of memory.

503
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
That's all it needed.

504
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,320
If you wanted some graphical features, they recommended 64 megabytes of RAM.

505
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,720
And Mandrake had a few standout features that other distributions did not have.

506
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,300
And throughout this process, I had an opportunity to try them again.

507
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,480
And they really kind of hold up for most of the some of them are no longer required like

508
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,920
the X11 config stuff, but some of them very much hold up.

509
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,680
And by the way, I will have links in the show notes for a visual tour of Mandrake.

510
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,080
I took screenshots of some of my favorite moments when I was revisiting Mandrake.

511
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,240
And if you're an old Mandrake user like me, you may want to go check it out because I

512
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,620
didn't know what to expect, honestly.

513
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,620
Maybe it was my mood.

514
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,620
I don't know.

515
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
I thought I was going to be a little bit disappointed.

516
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,600
I thought I was going to feel a little old and busted, you know, old KDE 3.

517
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,320
It's like playing an old video game or watching an old movie, reading a book you read as a

518
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
kid.

519
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,120
They never quite hold up the same, right?

520
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
Yeah, exactly.

521
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,080
Be like watching, you know, favorite old movie that just didn't hold up exactly.

522
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,040
And it was quite the experience.

523
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,240
The moment grub came up on the screen with the with the Mandrake theme immediately felt

524
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
nostalgic.

525
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,200
I immediately triggered the feels.

526
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,920
Then the boot splash came up and it immediately triggered the feels.

527
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,140
Every step was like I couldn't believe how wired those moments were in my brain because

528
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,200
I haven't thought about those things.

529
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,120
I haven't pictured those things in years.

530
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,820
And then the moment I saw them, it all just came flooding back.

531
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,880
And so 10.1 was a special, special kind of peak Mandrake, in my opinion.

532
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,840
It had Drac Conf, which was a great way to configure multiple aspects of the system.

533
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
I'll talk more about that in a moment.

534
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,440
And it had URPMI.

535
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,200
This was the magic that made me fall in love.

536
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,360
It's a wrapper around the RPM package manager, which back in the day, in the late 90s, early

537
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
2000s, RPM was rough.

538
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,160
You had to manually resolve your dependencies, you had to go hunt stuff down.

539
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:45,200
It was called dependency hell and URPMI solved it, essentially turning RPM into apt.

540
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,220
You could search package repos.

541
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,560
You could update your package list, add new repos, which was just an awesome concept at

542
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,560
the time.

543
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,120
It just did stuff other RPM distros could not do, but maintain compatibility with a

544
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,800
lot of the big RPM distros.

545
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,480
It really also had some of the best theming.

546
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,580
It had just these beautiful blues that still just really pop.

547
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,720
The installer is clean and simple and always was.

548
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,600
I mean, having to configure your X settings is always a bit dodgy.

549
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
And it just is a classic experience of Linux.

550
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,240
Like when you boot up, it reads out your BOGO MIPS score and tells you how fast your computer

551
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,360
is in BOGO MIPS.

552
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,960
Which I haven't said BOGO MIPS in years, and it used to be like how we measured everything.

553
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,160
And this thing's packing Linux 2.68.

554
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,020
Your whole system, Wes, will crash if you boot it on a dual core system, but you don't

555
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,600
select the SMP kernel.

556
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,160
Remember when you had to do that?

557
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Of course.

558
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Wow.

559
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,520
I mean, you had to be more familiar with your hardware, that's for sure.

560
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Yeah.

561
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,000
But you know, when it didn't work, when X didn't work, I was able to run dracconf on

562
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,160
the command line, which I got screenshots of this, and configure my X11 settings and

563
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,320
save them.

564
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,400
And then just ran init level five, and my desktop loaded right up, and I was back up

565
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
and working.

566
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,760
And I have not used dracconf in 100 years, and I was able to fire that thing open and

567
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,380
resolve my ancient Linux problems within a minute.

568
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,080
And I'm just sitting there going, you know what, this tool still holds up.

569
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,960
It's still a good tool.

570
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,980
When you first log into the Mandrake desktop, because this is towards the end of their run,

571
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,080
you get hit with like this long survey that wants to ask you about your Linux experience

572
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,400
so they can try to figure out who you are.

573
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,740
Then you get a pitch to join the Mandrake club, which I was a member of, I will admit.

574
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,480
The Mandrake club is a website that's dedicated to Mandrake users.

575
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,800
They write, signing up for membership brings you exclusive benefits, exclusive access to

576
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,360
forms, exclusive RPMs, product downloads, and discount on Mandrake Linux products and

577
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,040
much more.

578
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,280
And then they pitched the Mandrake online service, which is the latest service provided

579
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,760
by Mandrake soft.

580
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,840
It allows you to keep your computer up to date through centralized automated service.

581
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,040
Yeah, they tried.

582
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
They tried.

583
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,320
But KDE 3, you know, it was a classic look back then.

584
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,940
It doesn't quite hold up.

585
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,240
That doesn't look so great.

586
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,020
They had neat things in dracconf, like security audit tools that would check various aspects

587
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,260
of your system to see if they meet standards.

588
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,120
They had backups and restore in dracconf, which it's really nice to have your distribution

589
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,940
solve that back in the day.

590
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,600
They had weird things to like configure your desktop was an entry in the menu bar.

591
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:30,160
And that opened up KDE 3 system settings, but configure your computer.

592
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,960
So not configure your desktop, but configure your computer would open up the Mandrake Linux

593
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
control center.

594
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,460
I guess just I guess that makes sense, but only because I understand how Linux desktops

595
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,460
put together.

596
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,100
Otherwise, that would be so confusing.

597
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,760
That's sort of like one of those things at first when you haven't used it in 100 years,

598
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,640
you look at it and you go, which one do I?

599
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Oh, okay.

600
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Yeah, right.

601
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,700
I'm configuring the entire computer and then you get software update wizards and stuff

602
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
like that.

603
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,200
But, you know, when you look back at what it took to get Linux up and running, I can

604
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,160
see why Mandrake with URPMI and dracconf was such a winner.

605
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,480
And when I was talking on social media and on Telegram and whatever, when I was just

606
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,120
mentioning online that we're doing this and asking for ISOs, so many people told me that

607
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,500
Mandrake was their first Linux love and it was nice to visit it and not be disappointed.

608
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,600
I felt like it really was pretty great.

609
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,620
I think the UI looks a little dated, but my next distro was a totally different experience.

610
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,480
But I'd like to hear about your experience with damn small Linux first.

611
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,160
It's so small.

612
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,580
Remember the business card live CD?

613
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,880
That's the whole pitch for that.

614
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Yeah, really.

615
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,640
Like you can fit this stuff on a 50 megabyte live CD.

616
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,440
Now you have to find yourself a CD ROM drive, so I went virtualized on this one.

617
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,640
Yeah, yeah, sure.

618
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,160
But it really is quite impressive.

619
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,680
Now for some history, it had been around for a while, but kind of stopped development in

620
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,800
2012.

621
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,880
So I checked out the latest RC from that just to see what would have the next and last greatest

622
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,960
version of damn small Linux.

623
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
What might it be?

624
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,760
And it's kind of interesting because you can tell they've had to keep some of the system

625
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
intact.

626
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,800
Like it's still shipping a rather ancient kernel for that time, kernel 2.4, maybe.

627
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,420
Maybe it was 2.6.

628
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,100
Either way, quite old, but there were some modern applications like Firefox.

629
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,440
And despite the UI being, I don't know, unique, how would you describe it, Chris?

630
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,160
Oh, man, not even retro.

631
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,360
Like the most bare bones UI you could have that still like functions as a modern paradigm

632
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,840
of a desktop, I think?

633
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Yeah, I think, yeah.

634
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,960
It's it's it's that it is that it is barely that it is something I mean, you can really

635
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,520
tell they were trying to keep that size down, but it's quite functional.

636
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,400
I spent I don't know, most of an evening just trying to get as much done in damn small Linux

637
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
as I could.

638
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,480
And besides not being able to resolve most websites with SSL because it's just too new

639
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,480
of a version or had to accept on like 1000 security certificates, of course, I was impressed

640
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,360
with just how much I could get done.

641
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,200
I mean, you can install this thing to a hard drive if you want, but you can install software

642
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,520
and get it all configured while it's running in memory, too.

643
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
And that still works.

644
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,000
I could go in there, configure settings and install new software still to this day.

645
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,680
And that that really impressed me.

646
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,680
That's a high bar.

647
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,520
Actually, not many of these distros can actually claim that I did do a little bit in the next

648
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,620
one I'm about to talk about.

649
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:30,080
But damn small is such a fascinating story because it's it was based originally on Knoppix

650
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,880
and then it kind of grew in to have some very cool features like around like you're talking

651
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,640
about software installation and backup and stuff.

652
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,500
It eventually got up to about 128 megabytes in size.

653
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,480
But the idea that kind of was popular for a hot minute back in the, you know, 2010,

654
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:52,100
2011 days, 2012, was this idea that you had these smaller CDs that you could fit in your

655
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,560
wallet that you would hand out at a convention or a business meeting and you could have a

656
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,160
custom damn small environment on there that would maybe like, you know, boot up and bring

657
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,120
them up to a presentation in a web browser or something like that.

658
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Right.

659
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,560
Maybe it's got a demo of your software preinstalled.

660
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Who knows?

661
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Yeah.

662
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,680
Oh, and, you know, for a hot minute, maybe.

663
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,840
But then the thumb drive came along and malware just basically scared everybody, everyone

664
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,200
away from.

665
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
That's just it.

666
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,840
I do think it's kind of an interesting era, though, to where you could make Linux small.

667
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,260
You know, I'm sure that stood out to you trying some of these things, too, is just like, OK,

668
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,200
they don't take that much space on disk.

669
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,540
It's great and it's refreshing.

670
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,000
But damn small took that to the next level and I think is from an era where that was

671
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,380
more possible than maybe it is today, at least with the sort of experience we might expect.

672
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,620
So how was the nostalgia factor for that one for you?

673
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,720
Did it hit you in the feels or was it just sort of like kind of like a science experiment?

674
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,400
That seems to be kind of the way these can go.

675
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,840
Yeah, it was a little bit more of a science experiment.

676
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,960
I mean, I definitely did have experience with damn small Linux back in the day, but it was

677
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,760
even back then it felt more like a science experience and it wasn't quite one that I

678
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,980
would use day to day, despite being impressed with a lot of the tech stuff that they've

679
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
packed in there.

680
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,200
And yeah, the extensibility is really nice.

681
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,460
That was something they planned in.

682
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,280
They have a whole my damn small Linux program to get things going.

683
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
It's impressive.

684
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,160
But ultimately, no, I think if I had to pick, I'd stick on Ubuntu 6.06 for now.

685
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,520
Well, then we go back.

686
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,120
We go way, way back.

687
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:35,540
I'd like to talk about a distro that was instrumental in me professionally using Linux.

688
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,240
And it was a distribution that was purpose built.

689
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,080
It was a commercial distribution that sometimes cost as much as $100 that you would buy in

690
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:49,880
a box and then you would install it on your machine and you would input a serial code

691
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,000
into a Linux distro to install it and activate it.

692
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah.

693
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It wasn't quite activated like Windows activation back in the day, but they were very serious

694
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
about it.

695
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:07,200
And it was called Xandros and each edition of Xandros I bought one, two, 3.0 in really

696
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,800
kind of just desperation to get compatibility with a Windows network.

697
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,600
One of the reasons they charged for Xandros was because they included crossover office,

698
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,680
which allowed you to run Windows applications.

699
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,400
And they wired it up such that when you put the office installer into your CD-ROM and

700
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,740
you pop that disc into your box, it would actually execute the auto run on that CD and

701
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,840
begin the setup process exactly like if you would put it on a Windows machine.

702
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,480
Because back in the day, you'd put these CD-ROMs in there, they'd auto run the installer for

703
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
you.

704
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Yeah.

705
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,780
That lovely experience was recreated on Xandros with Windows software.

706
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,400
That's the level they were trying to get to with compatibility.

707
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,600
They then later on, and reasons why I continued to purchase it, added features like authenticating

708
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:57,760
to active directory domains, using PPTP to connect to VPNs on a Windows network, supporting

709
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,200
browsing a Windows file network right there in the browser, in the file browser.

710
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
It was a pretty good product and it actually delivered.

711
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,980
So version three that I checked out for this was released in 2004.

712
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,880
This is the last version that Xandros ever released and it's the last version I ever

713
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,880
used.

714
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,600
Xandros 3 was last updated in 2005 and the version I ran was somewhere right there in

715
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,720
the middle.

716
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,480
There's the business edition and there's all these different kinds, but it was really onto

717
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,480
something.

718
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,240
I have to say, 2004 never looked so damn fresh.

719
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,120
I was very impressed.

720
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
I'm not joking.

721
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,880
It installed fast and very easy.

722
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,040
The graphical boot splash is clean, but still shows the text output of your boot in a really

723
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,240
elegant way that I think actually looks better than most boot splashes I see today.

724
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Ouch.

725
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
It is really good.

726
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:55,440
It ships with Mozilla 1.7.3, so pre-Firefox, and that means it also ships with Mozilla

727
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,960
Mail, so pre-Thunderbird, and they look surprisingly still the same, at least the Thunderbird one

728
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
does.

729
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,800
It had kernel 2.6.9 and it was rocking KDE 3.3.0.

730
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,880
I was able to get that sucker on the network.

731
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,760
I was able to download files off of the internet and browse the local LAN and actually just

732
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,260
kind of sit back and get some work done for a bit.

733
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,840
It's laid out in a really intelligent way that I immediately was able to pick up and

734
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
keep using.

735
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:30,200
It is very much if a group of people focused on just making a viable Windows alternative

736
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,520
for the business market that looked and operates a lot like Windows, including when I logged

737
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,280
in in the morning, I logged in with my Windows NT or Active Directory credentials into my

738
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,120
Xandros desktop.

739
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,360
That level of integration meant that I could then log in and I could launch Outlook, not

740
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,880
Evolution, Outlook, which meant I could do everything my coworkers who were all using

741
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,960
the exchange system could.

742
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,360
Being able to do that and being able to show my boss, because they were very skeptical

743
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,560
of Linux back then because of SCO, and they totally bought into all the SCO hype because

744
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,200
they were a bank, so they were totally afraid of all of the IP stuff, but I was able to

745
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,280
show my boss Xandros as a company, here's the box set that I buy, this is all what they

746
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,720
focus on, and they bought off on it.

747
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,580
They allowed the exception for me to run Linux on my daily driver at work, and that was when

748
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:24,760
I was freed from Windows back in 2004 in the workplace, and it changed my life.

749
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,700
I was willing to pay $100 a year if it meant I got a new version of Xandros with improved

750
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,320
Windows compatibility.

751
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,560
It had a very special spot for me because it enabled me to go full time.

752
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,620
I could run Linux at home, and I didn't run Xandros at home, I ran Mandrake at home, Mandrake

753
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,640
or Gentoo, and then at work I would run Xandros, which was based on Debian, so I had access

754
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,300
to deb files and I could do apt.

755
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,500
They actually had a pretty good software store where they were selling software and also

756
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,440
had free software available in a software center that they made right there on the desktop

757
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,840
and it was just their own custom app and it worked really well, and the whole package

758
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,740
came together in a way with their own custom theming on top of KDE 3 that I would absolutely

759
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:14,000
say that that Xandros 3.0 UI holds up today for people who like the traditional desktop

760
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,320
setup for XFCE types.

761
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
It's really clean.

762
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
I would use that.

763
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,960
You could see a version of Monte that was laid out that way, right?

764
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,040
Yeah, absolutely, and they've done small little tweaks to make it really easy to use.

765
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,800
I'll put the, again, I have a link to the gallery of some of the screenshots I took

766
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,840
that got my nostalgia feels going.

767
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,280
It never really survived.

768
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,400
I don't think they could make it.

769
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,320
I don't think they could make enough money, and now here we are in the future and Fedora

770
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,080
and Ubuntu and other distributions like SUSE have built in Active Directory support.

771
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:52,440
In fact, that was one of the reasons we eventually transitioned to SUSE Enterprise Linux in that

772
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:58,560
environment was because of YAS built in Active Directory support for joining or being a domain

773
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,560
controller.

774
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,600
And Xandros was sort of the proof of concept to the executives that a Linux distribution

775
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
could do it.

776
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,080
And I have even NTFS file permissions would show up in my file browser when I was looking

777
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,840
at permissions on files, and I was showing this to my boss, and that gave him the confidence

778
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,940
to say, well, okay, if Xandros can do it, then maybe these SUSE guys are onto something

779
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,280
with this YAS, and they moved ahead.

780
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,160
And for a long time, we deployed SUSE Enterprise, simply because Xandros proved the use case

781
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,100
and that was a big deal.

782
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,400
So we can blame Xandros for SUSE.

783
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,800
Okay, got it.

784
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,000
I think so, Wes.

785
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,560
I think that's exactly what the takeaway is from there.

786
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,040
Now, you had a chance to play with a distribution that was also an old favorite of mine.

787
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Yeah, Backtrack.

788
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,360
You know, it just stood out to me because, I don't know, Kali gets talked about a lot,

789
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,840
maybe just because people tell new users not to use it.

790
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,160
But Wi-Fi was still kind of new when I was early days in Linux, you know, it was an exciting

791
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,240
new development, just sort of getting it really deployed, at least at, you know, the nerdy

792
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,400
friends houses anyway.

793
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,280
And naturally, Linux was an avenue where I could go explore and play with that kind of

794
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,280
stuff.

795
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,360
And at the time, Backtrack was hot.

796
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:15,800
It was first released back in May 2006, and lasted all the way until August of 2012, which

797
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,080
there was a lot of changes in that time period over Linux, but Backtrack was useful, I think,

798
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
throughout most of it.

799
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:25,200
Yeah, and it eventually emerged into what is now Kali Linux, so essentially does live

800
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
on.

801
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,640
But Backtrack, it was a little different.

802
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,640
It felt a little different.

803
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,640
Yeah, it did.

804
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,920
I got it going just to test it out on a quick shell and it had a very nice sort of graphical

805
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,640
environment that just presented a terminal to you.

806
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,160
It was framed around in a nice image, it had a little poll quote there at the bottom and

807
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,720
then otherwise let you get straight to business running Aircrack NG, say.

808
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,120
Or Nessus, in my case, or Metasploit, yeah.

809
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,320
I actually used Backtrack to make money.

810
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,240
I was really grateful for the project.

811
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,880
I had paid clients and Backtrack was one of the tools, and one of my favorite things to

812
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:04,800
do was to use Backtrack to come in and pop someone's FTP server and leave a little file

813
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
on there that said, gotcha.

814
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
Oh, dear.

815
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah, it was great because it just shocks the client into like, oh, this is something

816
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,320
we need to take seriously and it immediately changed the conversation into this is instead

817
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,840
of a waste of my money and time into this is something we need to address.

818
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,880
I'd bring Backtrack in, I'd bring a couple of laptops in, actually, because I had to

819
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,360
have a Windows box with me too for some of the stuff.

820
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,400
I'd have a couple of laptops, I'd have my own network connection and Backtrack running

821
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,440
on one of them.

822
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,520
It was just such a great tool.

823
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,160
Now, of course, Kali Linux still totally fills that role, but Backtrack was where I got my

824
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
start.

825
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Yeah.

826
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,840
It was before I had tuned in really to the sort of philosophical side of free software

827
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,840
that came a little later.

828
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,100
And it was before I had really decided, you know, I still had fun playing with Windows

829
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,560
and I was gaming more at that time.

830
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,120
So I wasn't necessarily all in on the Linux desktop, but Backtrack kind of cemented in

831
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,840
my mind that Linux was useful for more things than that.

832
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:01,480
And here was this like very flexible, powerful sort of computer sciency tool that I could

833
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,840
have access to for free.

834
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,440
And that's still exciting.

835
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Now will you allow for one more?

836
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Okay.

837
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,600
I feel like there's so many we could talk about.

838
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,400
And if anybody has some suggestions that they want to send in the contact page, we'd consider

839
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,600
another round of this at some point in the future.

840
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:22,380
But I feel like I should mention Red Hat 9, not Red Hat Enterprise 9, which is what you'll

841
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,140
find if you search for Red Hat 9.

842
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,360
But I'm talking about Red Hat 9, the old Red Hat.

843
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,100
And I again have a album linked in the show notes.

844
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:38,080
But this is the Red Hat before they went to Fedora, before they went all enterprise.

845
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,160
Red Hat used to actually ship a desktop Linux.

846
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,320
And classic Red Hat desktop started in 1995 and it got all the way to version 9.

847
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,260
So this was the last.

848
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:56,840
And it was released in March of 2003 with kernel 2.4.20 and GNOME 2.2.

849
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:02,840
In 2003, Red Hat discontinued Red Hat Linux in favor of Red Hat Linux Enterprise Edition.

850
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,080
And Red Hat Linux 9 was supported for a while.

851
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,760
It's kind of this interesting story.

852
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,040
While it was officially end of life in April 2004, there was a Fedora legacy project that

853
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,880
kept patches going for Red Hat 9 until 2007.

854
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,060
So Red Hat 9 kind of became an infamous release because it was the last.

855
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,020
And then the legacy ports project kept it going for many, many years.

856
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,740
And then it technically stuck around for even longer because it was also the base for Red

857
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,040
Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

858
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:38,640
Ah, so the CentOS stuff we're going through now, well, we've all done this before.

859
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,880
Yeah, there is like a lot of echoes of history here.

860
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,840
And this distribution itself is sort of infamous for a lot of us old time Linux users because

861
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,520
it's the one.

862
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,440
And the one I tried out was Red Hat 9a Magazine Edition.

863
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,200
This was a thing we used to do back in the day with the CDs, with the magazine and stuff.

864
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,080
And distros would make a magazine edition and do a little bit of branding in there.

865
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,120
And so that part of it, all of that real early part of the startup feels really old school.

866
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,220
But once the graphical install starts up, it's kind of nice.

867
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,420
And I forgot how common it was with these old distros to like prompt you for what type

868
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:22,320
of install, a personal desktop, which is perfect for computers and laptops at home, or is it

869
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,720
a workstation, a graphical desktop with development and admin tools?

870
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,320
Or would you like to set up a server that has an optional graphical environment and

871
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,540
a few common server services?

872
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,040
Or would you like something custom?

873
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,720
Which is almost always the, I almost just always chose custom anyways.

874
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,560
And like Mandrake, Red Hat asked some basic security questions in their installers that

875
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,540
they no longer ask, like settings for your firewall, what ports you want open, what basic

876
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,720
level of paranoia you want.

877
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,820
And then at the end of the Red Hat 9 install, when everything is all like all the packages

878
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,680
are copied to the file system, you're asked some basic X config options.

879
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,000
Again, always feels like a roll of the dice.

880
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,040
But by this point, I knew how to get that working.

881
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,260
So it was really no problem.

882
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,120
You didn't break your virtualized monitor?

883
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,920
No, you know, that used to be a thing.

884
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,840
But this time I had it down.

885
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:13,040
And so I reboot, it boots up into X, I get a first time welcome screen that walks me

886
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,320
through a new user setup, much like we get today.

887
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,220
And it asked me if I want to register with the Red Hat network, which is how you got

888
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,640
updates back then, which it does not register with the network, it fails to do so.

889
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,000
And their codec story is rough back then, especially compared to Mandrake and Xandros

890
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,760
trying to play an mp3 file or something like that is such a joke.

891
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,040
It's real bad.

892
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,320
There's just a lot of problems because the copyright and patent situation was really

893
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,320
risky back then.

894
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,000
And so Red Hat really played it safe.

895
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,200
And things like support for NTFS and all of that just was not in there.

896
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,860
You had to go figure that out on your own after the case.

897
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:54,280
But besides that stuff, which ironically seems like less of an issue today, it holds up.

898
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,880
I think out of all of the distros I looked at, Red Hat 9 has probably the most iconic

899
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
classic look.

900
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,280
Version 9 uses the blue curve theme.

901
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,160
And it's kind of an iconic theme.

902
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,160
It holds up.

903
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,160
It's clean.

904
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,000
I bet you there are folks out there that are listening to this podcast and their desktop

905
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,760
looks exactly like this desktop still.

906
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,760
It's just that kind of iconic classic desktop.

907
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,160
It's fun because the other distros I tried were all KDE based.

908
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,480
And Red Hat was Gnome based.

909
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,240
And I really liked those other distro desktops.

910
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,200
But this one, there's something that just felt really clean.

911
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,240
The fonts looked really good.

912
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,640
And it just really felt polished in a way that the others don't.

913
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,560
And some of that is still the same vibe I get off the door today, which is wild to see

914
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
it today.

915
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,680
To still be able to connect with that same vibe from something that was released, what

916
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,400
was it, back in 2003.

917
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,280
Red Hat 9 was remarkable in that way.

918
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,160
It really made for a great long term desktop for a lot of people because of that Fedora

919
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,760
legacy ports and then because of RHEL 3.

920
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,260
And so it was that special transition.

921
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:07,000
And I wouldn't have it any other way than we do now because current distributions obviously

922
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,280
blow all this stuff away and where the Fedora project at, it's just great right now.

923
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,200
But it was so much fun to revisit this and find that it was really quite competent.

924
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,500
It's not a joke.

925
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
It's not a grind.

926
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,240
It wasn't old and busted.

927
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:26,360
I think it shows how much, both how not far we've come in the sense that not really that

928
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:30,000
much has changed in the computing industry, but I think it also shows how much work it

929
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,680
has taken to get where we are today.

930
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,040
I mean, a lot of work has happened.

931
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,460
It's a little unsettling that what do we have to show for it is shiny your desktops.

932
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,840
But I think that hides a lot of the real, you know, the power, the hardware we take

933
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:48,680
advantage of now and just how much more consistent and reliable everything is.

934
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,300
Thank you to our core contributors.

935
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,360
This episode, the last episode and the next episode have all been down one sponsor.

936
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,360
So that's three weeks without a potential sponsor that we could have sold in this spot

937
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:02,540
right now where I'm talking, but we're going to get by and we're going to get by thanks

938
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,540
to our members.

939
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:04,540
We could use more support.

940
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,360
I mean, I do dream of a day where we just eliminate the sponsor spot right here on the

941
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,640
show and it's entirely financed by our core contributors.

942
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,080
Uh, but so since we're in a tight spot and we're short on sponsors this month, if you'd

943
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,180
like to join and support our core contributors, I am making a summer promo code available.

944
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,240
The promo code is summer simple.

945
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,700
You'll take $1 off the membership cost for the lifetime of your membership.

946
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,700
So that really adds up.

947
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,760
It's still, still supports the show and gives you a great deal for the lifetime of your

948
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,760
membership.

949
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,520
You get access to the limited ad feed or the full live stream bootleg, just like all the

950
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,520
members do.

951
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,420
You get discount codes for selected Jupiter garage items and you help the show stay on

952
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,200
the air and independent.

953
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,440
We'll have a direct link to the summer deal in the show notes, or you can just go to our

954
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,760
core contributor website and, uh, sign up right there, which is at unplugged core.com

955
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,560
and use the promo code summer.

956
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,480
And thank you for your support and thank you to our members for making it possible for

957
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,360
us to do this here show unplugged core.com.

958
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,840
Keep the show on the air.

959
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,120
Well let's reach into the mailbag for some feedback.

960
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:19,800
Cool Jimmy writes in, I've been running TLP on my T480 since I got it two plus years ago

961
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:28,160
with a start charge at 50% and a stop at 80% I have the internal battery at 97.8% and external

962
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,840
battery at 98.4% capacity respectively.

963
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
Hey congrats.

964
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,840
Cool Jimmy.

965
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,840
That is really good.

966
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,880
And you know, Wes, I think one of the reasons we've been talking about managing your battery

967
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,400
like this is because once the damage is done, it's kind of too late.

968
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,600
Like you got to kind of solve it ahead of time.

969
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,320
So for those of you that don't recall, TLP is a really feature rich command line utility

970
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,320
for Linux.

971
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:55,280
It helps you manage power and like you'd expect with Linux, it's super customizable.

972
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,560
It really lets you go all in and I've been trying it on my ThinkPad since before my trip

973
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,520
to Montana and well, I had mixed results.

974
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,080
Zach writes in, he says, I just heard the latest episode about TLP and wanted to comment

975
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,680
that there are commands to temporarily disable the charging thresholds.

976
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:19,160
So I manually set charging thresholds in my TLP config, much like our previous writer

977
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,160
did.

978
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,160
Right.

979
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,160
But you don't have to like go modify that every time just to adjust it, right?

980
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,440
No, and I guess I should have realized that it was in the docs and I missed it.

981
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,880
But thankfully, Zach writes and he says there's a command to temporarily set different charge

982
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,480
thresholds without having to modify your config file.

983
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,840
You do pseudo TLP full charge and that just tells TLP to allow your system to charge all

984
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,240
the way up to full one time.

985
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,040
You can also do things like pseudo TLP set charge to 70 or you can do things like set

986
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,500
to like, you know, 50 percent or totally drain the batteries.

987
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,600
There's another option, there's also a recalibrate option to bring it down and up, which is really

988
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
nice to see.

989
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,500
So thank you to Cool Jimmy and Zach for sending those in.

990
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,520
My usage of TLP hasn't gone perfect.

991
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:07,040
A couple of times it did bite me on my trip to Montana because I would plug my laptop

992
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
in.

993
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:12,880
I had it set to, you know, not charged past, I think, 60 percent and then I would unplug

994
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,480
it, set aside for a day and then go open it up right when I really need it.

995
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,800
And I'd only have like 30 percent battery and I wouldn't be able to get my work done.

996
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,200
So a TLP charge, that changed my game, though, and that helped a lot.

997
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,240
But the other thing about TLP that you have to be careful with is I may have overdone

998
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,420
it a little bit when it came to the CPU scaling.

999
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,900
I think the performance impact is noticeable.

1000
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,940
There wasn't a lot of headroom for performance loss to begin with, with my X1 Carbon.

1001
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:43,720
And so when I then slowed down the cores and turned off turbo boost and stuff like that,

1002
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,680
I sort of robbed myself of really any kind of performance that was getting me by.

1003
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,380
And so I felt it more than I was hoping I would.

1004
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,960
So instead what I'm considering is adopting a new tool that I think you guys would be

1005
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
interested in.

1006
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,660
Oh, new tool, huh?

1007
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,000
New tool, Wes, new tool.

1008
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,060
And it's called Auto CPU Freq.

1009
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:04,680
It's a frequency, right?

1010
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:11,080
It's an automatic CPU scaler based on your battery state, CPU usage, the temperature

1011
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:16,480
of your system, your system load, kind of looks at all of that stuff sort of similar

1012
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,540
to the way Mac OS does and rescales things on demand.

1013
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:26,920
It can work in place of TLP or it can work with TLP, which is how I'm using it right

1014
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,920
now.

1015
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,100
And I definitely have seen an increase in battery life.

1016
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,900
But what I'd really like to try is a setup where I don't have TLP installed, I don't

1017
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,800
have to bother with it, but I do have the automatic CPU frequency installed.

1018
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,480
So I have links to that in the show notes.

1019
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,480
Yeah.

1020
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,480
See if that's enough to get you by, huh?

1021
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,480
Yeah, I'm hoping.

1022
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,800
I'm hoping without the performance hit because it scales a little bit faster, it's a little

1023
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,800
more dynamic.

1024
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,680
And you can, when you're running it, you can put it in a mode where you're getting a report

1025
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,580
and where it's watching your system and it'll give you information about your CPU cores

1026
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:59,920
and if turbo boost is enabled or disabled and it will dynamically enable and disable

1027
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,120
features that you need or don't need.

1028
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:06,200
And so when you're not pushing your system very much, it'll clock the cores down, it'll

1029
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,580
turn off turbo boost, and it'll let your laptop sit power.

1030
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:14,280
But then when you launch something that needs horsepower, it immediately turns turbo boost

1031
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,000
back on, it clocks things back up.

1032
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,580
It's really dynamic like that.

1033
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,580
This looks great.

1034
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,200
I'm definitely giving it a try.

1035
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,920
Well we have a retro pick for everyone before we go today.

1036
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,320
Wes found a way for you all to get your hands on WordPerfect on Linux.

1037
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,180
Well really, there's a lot of ways.

1038
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:39,000
This is a great article over on LiveJournal from Liam on Linux, and it just struck me

1039
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,840
as a perfect retro pick for our retro episode because I don't know about you, Chris, but

1040
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,200
WordPerfect was really my first word processor on DOS, no less, and it kind of introduced

1041
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,360
me to the whole concept of word processing.

1042
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:56,280
On the pre-pre-show today, we were watching a Computer Chronicles where WordPerfect was

1043
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:00,880
talked about as just like this total dominant force in the global software marketplace.

1044
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,720
They just went on and on.

1045
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:08,580
It's kind of laughing now because I haven't seen it in years, but you know, it would be

1046
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,680
really nice to be able to check it out.

1047
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,760
How have they done this, Wes?

1048
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,760
It's not Wine.

1049
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,180
It's not FreeDOS.

1050
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,360
It's a whole other way to get WordPerfect.

1051
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,600
You know, I want to talk about the Xandros connection.

1052
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,920
Did Corel buy Xandros?

1053
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,360
Is that what I'm barely vaguely remembering?

1054
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,360
It's the other way around.

1055
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,360
Oh.

1056
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,040
Corel had to discontinue all its Linux efforts, so it sold off Corel Linux OS, which became

1057
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
Xandros.

1058
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:39,120
Corel Linux OS is the predecessor to Xandros, and then Xandros was then acquired, then acquired

1059
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,160
Linspire and merged it into itself, and then ultimately it was acquired and then they shut

1060
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,160
it down.

1061
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,160
Okay.

1062
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,440
I'm surprised you didn't know that, Chris.

1063
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,440
Like it was...

1064
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,440
I may have at some point.

1065
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,440
I just didn't.

1066
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,160
Too much retro history.

1067
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,720
It was part of the Groklaw thing.

1068
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:59,960
Like the whole stupid SCO thing was, whereas all that stuff kind of was unearthed.

1069
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:04,280
Neil, I've forgotten more about all that than I probably could even keep track of, but it

1070
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,800
does vaguely all ring a bell.

1071
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,600
That all does kind of ring a bell.

1072
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,080
The more you guys talk about it, it does.

1073
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,200
That was what I entered the open source world in.

1074
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,760
So like it will remain fresh on my mind basically forever.

1075
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,400
They've done like a script here that you basically, you grab this script, right?

1076
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,680
And it pulls down, I don't know, like a DOS environment.

1077
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,680
What's it doing, Linus?

1078
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,040
How's it making this happen?

1079
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,040
Well, it depends.

1080
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,120
There's, if you want to go explore, there is a word perfect for ancient Mac classic.

1081
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,720
If you want to try that, that's a little tricky.

1082
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,240
The one that lived the longest, I guess, is the Linux version.

1083
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,040
So that's what a lot of the article kind of explores.

1084
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,600
It explores the neat history with Corel and some of the contributions even that Corel

1085
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,800
had contributed to the wine project, say.

1086
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,520
So definitely go read the whole article because there's a lot in there.

1087
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,680
At the end, there's kind of a call for help to figure out the best way to get the Linux

1088
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,520
stuff running.

1089
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,160
The author did get it going in a very old version of Linux on a VM and tried to get

1090
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,160
it containerized.

1091
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,200
But so far, that's proving tricky because it's like pre Ubuntu 8.04.

1092
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,360
Man, if it's not StarOffice, I just couldn't care, I guess.

1093
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,360
That's what was exposed today.

1094
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,000
I'm a StarOffice guy, always have been.

1095
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Big StarOffice fan.

1096
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,480
All right, well, if you have any nostalgia picks for us or distros that you recommend

1097
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,880
we check out, you can tweet them at the show too if you like.

1098
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,080
We are at Linux Unplugged or you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1099
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:29,960
The whole network is on Twitter at Jupiter Signal and there's a whole network of shows

1100
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,960
out there.

1101
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,000
I got a telegram this morning from a long time listener in Australia, a shout out to

1102
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,100
you sir, who said, I've been listening to Linux Unplugged forever and I didn't even

1103
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,460
know self-hosted existed and I just checked it out and now I'm binging it.

1104
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,840
So I mean like, you know, I feel like maybe I should mention that we have some other podcasts

1105
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,000
like a Linux news podcast that covers all of the important Linux news every week.

1106
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,920
If there's something you didn't hear us talk about here, well, we probably covered it in

1107
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,560
Linux Action News in detail.

1108
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,260
So check out linuxactionnews.com as well.

1109
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,800
And we'd love to have you join us live.

1110
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,240
We do this here podcast live on Tuesdays.

1111
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,440
See you next week.

1112
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,760
Same bat time, same bat station.

1113
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,760
That's right.

1114
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,000
Join us at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv or I guess you can do that thing

1115
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,360
on Twitch.

1116
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,080
You probably know how it works better than I do.

1117
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,680
Twitch.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that low latency stream.

1118
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,680
That's right.

1119
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,680
It's the low latency video.

1120
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,680
There's also YouTube.

1121
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,680
Who knew?

1122
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,840
But you could subscribe over there, I guess, and get notifications when we're live.

1123
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,120
Man, who just doesn't love notifications?

1124
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,760
Get them all while you can.

1125
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,760
Go get them.

1126
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,560
Go get notified or just download it when we release every Tuesday where it sounds better

1127
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,000
and Joe's put a lot of work into it.

1128
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That works too.

1129
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,080
Thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program and we'll see you

1130
01:00:45,080 --> 01:01:00,320
right back here next Tuesday.

1131
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:26,320
Okay, JBtitles.com.

1132
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:29,840
You know, that doubly goes for all these retro distros we talked about today.

1133
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,440
It's really about how you use it.

1134
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,560
It really was.

1135
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:37,880
That was sometimes the best part was solving a series of problems like Xandros by default

1136
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,280
wasn't grabbing an IP over DHCP.

1137
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:45,920
It saw my network adapter once I got the right driver loaded, but didn't just go get an IP.

1138
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:51,400
I had to go into the config and tell it to use, yes, it's okay to use DHCP.

1139
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:57,680
And then it didn't take the DNS servers from DHCP, even though obviously my DHCP server

1140
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,960
offers them up.

1141
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,080
But I had to then go into the DNS configuration in their little GUI and tell it, use these

1142
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,080
DNS servers.

1143
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,640
It just totally disregarded what the DHCP server supplied.

1144
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:15,120
Well, because back then there wasn't necessarily support for DNS auto configuration via DHCP.

1145
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,120
Yeah.

1146
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,600
And like, and the wireless support was so new.

1147
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,160
It was just so hit and miss.

1148
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:22,160
Yeah.

1149
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,160
Oh my God.

1150
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:32,280
I used Endus wrapper until 2009 because Wi-Fi was so bad up until like 2011 or so.

1151
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,280
Yeah.

1152
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,400
It was such a factor back then.

1153
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,120
And you could see each distribution was taking a different crack at trying to solve the problem,

1154
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,880
but it was just like, there was only so much they could do.

1155
01:02:42,880 --> 01:03:05,880
It was pretty bad.
