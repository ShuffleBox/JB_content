00:00.000 --> 00:05.400
You know, the problem with smartwatches is having notifications buzz my wrist just really isn't enough.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.900
I wish there was a way a guy could have them right up in his face, right in his peepers, Wes.

00:09.900 --> 00:14.400
Oh, well, Bosch has a solution for you with their new smart glasses.

00:14.400 --> 00:19.600
You're probably tired of having to see everyone in the meeting or who you're even talking to or around in the city.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.400
Yeah, I mean, you can totally see when I'm glancing down at my smartphone. It's so inconvenient.

00:23.400 --> 00:34.500
Good thing these new smart glasses use a tiny laser array that paints images directly onto your retina.

00:34.500 --> 00:45.900
And they have got a really corporate generic video that shows you getting horrible notifications about really unimportant things right on your eyeballs.

00:45.900 --> 00:52.900
Yeah, I mean, just imagine like whatever mundane texts that you get, notifications, emails popping up directly in your vision.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.900
These are also the ugliest peepers I've ever seen.

00:55.900 --> 01:04.300
I mean, I appreciate they're racking a lot of tech into this, but it seems like no coincidence that two hours before we started recording this here podcast,

01:04.300 --> 01:08.500
Google announced that you can get their latest AR glasses for direct purchase.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.100
You don't have to be like a special qualifying business anymore.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.300
And a big difference there, the Bosch versions?

01:13.300 --> 01:16.100
Well, those you have to get custom fitted, not so for Google.

01:16.100 --> 01:21.900
No, but you know, Bosch has that huge developer ecosystem and that app store that's world famous for making all that money.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.000
So I'm sure it's going to work out real good.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
Hello, friends, and welcome in to Linux Unplugged episode two hundred, no, three hundred and thirty nine.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.700
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Not gonna lie, Wes, it all kind of blurs together.

01:41.700 --> 01:49.700
Although I am kind of weirdly excited about 340 because, you know, I realized it's not every episode that it's been 10 episodes.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.200
No, no. In fact, it's only one out of ten.

01:53.200 --> 01:58.500
So speaking of things that don't happen too often, this week we're taking a look at Linux Mint,

01:58.500 --> 02:06.700
the latest Linux Mint, which by my rough math hasn't happened since episode one hundred.

02:06.700 --> 02:11.000
And I had a real moment where I thought, geez, it's been way too long.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.300
This is still a super popular distribution.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.100
And I wanted to give it a real fair shake.

02:16.100 --> 02:20.600
So I said, I'm going all in. I put it here on the production systems for this episode.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.000
You're running it right now. Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.600
So we'll give you our take on the absolute latest Linux Mint,

02:25.600 --> 02:29.700
some new developments that are going on there, as well as our community news,

02:29.700 --> 02:31.400
follow up and feedback and all those goodies.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.200
But before we go any further, I got to say time approves greetings to that mumble room.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.500
Hello, virtual log, time appropriate greetings.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.400
Hello. Hi there.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.200
I'm still flabbergasted by this earlier Tuesday showing.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.600
We've really got a great forest.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.600
You know, like I thought for sure when we went to noon on Tuesdays that nobody would show up.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.200
But this has just been awesome. So thank you, everybody.

02:53.200 --> 02:56.500
We have a bunch of people in the quiet listening to Tyler.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.100
It's great to see you. It's been forever since you've made it for an episode.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.700
You're here for a special one, my friend. Glad to be here.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.300
All right. Well, let's get into some big news.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.700
It's going to really shape the community.

03:06.700 --> 03:10.000
I think we've all been kind of waiting for this shoot to drop.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
And this last week it was announced that IBM's CEO was stepping down.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.500
Welcome back. We've got some breaking news on IBM.

03:17.500 --> 03:23.400
And that news is that in April, Chairman and CEO Ginni Rometty will step down as the CEO role,

03:23.400 --> 03:26.700
at least and remain chairman temporarily.

03:26.700 --> 03:32.200
Of course, been CEO since 2012, been at the company for some 40 years.

03:32.200 --> 03:38.700
Before that, the new CEO that will take over is the current head of the cloud and cognitive software business.

03:38.700 --> 03:44.800
That's Arvind Krishna, who's also seen as quite instrumental behind the acquisition.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.700
I want to pause here for a second because this has been a common narrative now.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.800
Oh, this was really the guy behind the acquisition.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.300
So if you think that Red Hat purchase is a good idea, this is your guy.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.700
Which is, I don't know, maybe that's true.

03:57.700 --> 04:01.200
Maybe it's at least partially true because he is directly involved with their cloud stuff.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.300
Right. And that's a lot of where Red Hat's value is coming from.

04:04.300 --> 04:12.000
But under Rometty's reign, they acquired 65 different companies, mostly small ones.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.900
And of course, the biggest was that $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.700
Now listen how they're positioning this.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.500
So I paused the clip because I think this is extremely telling.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.500
The market has reacted very positively.

04:22.500 --> 04:25.700
And this is from a market analyst show.

04:25.700 --> 04:31.800
Red Hat, James Whitehurst, who was the CEO of Red Hat, will also be elected to the board

04:31.800 --> 04:35.800
and become IBM president in part of this process.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.300
But quite a significant move in the share price, Mike, after hours.

04:39.300 --> 04:45.200
Of course, it's underperformed significantly, but up 5% on this news of the transition to a cloud leader.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.100
Did you hear right there, because the guy was over talking at the end,

04:48.100 --> 04:51.900
they're positioning this as a transition to a cloud leader.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.500
Which is, that's a big statement.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.400
Do you just get to say that? Is that how it works?

04:55.400 --> 04:56.700
We're becoming a cloud leader.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.100
Apparently the market, their stock price is up.

04:59.100 --> 05:02.200
So this all will actually go down on April 6th.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.600
That's when this transition happens.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.300
And you heard in there, the other big part of this

05:07.300 --> 05:11.800
is Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, will become IBM's president on the same day.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.900
I mean, this does seem like a big recognition that Red Hat and some of the roles that it plays,

05:15.900 --> 05:21.700
the industries it's in, kind of need to be the direction that IBM goes and transforms itself to.

05:21.700 --> 05:24.600
There's a lot of speculation too, when that acquisition went down,

05:24.600 --> 05:28.800
that people were thinking maybe Jim would eventually be running IBM.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.300
This is up there.

05:29.300 --> 05:34.700
I mean, it's very, very much in the tradition of IBM to promote from within.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.700
Krishna has been at IBM since 1990.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.700
He has a PhD from the University of Illinois.

05:42.700 --> 05:46.500
He's been a senior vice president at IBM since 2015.

05:46.500 --> 05:52.200
And he is a leader in IBM's cloud computing business division since 2017.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.000
Technical background, has been around the business.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.700
I mean, that's not a bad candidate.

05:55.700 --> 06:01.000
And he's not too unfamiliar with the whole open source and Red Hat scene either.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.100
I found a clip of him doing a keynote at Red Hat Summit in 2013.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.800
Good evening, everyone.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.200
So, you know, it's always a tough act to follow.

06:11.200 --> 06:17.700
Not quite a teenager, but you go from 20 years to 102.

06:17.700 --> 06:21.900
So, Jim talked a lot about innovation, about openness,

06:21.900 --> 06:25.200
and I think you'll hear quite a bit of the same from us,

06:25.200 --> 06:30.900
as well as some of IBM's observations on the paradigm shift that's happening in the world.

06:30.900 --> 06:35.500
And how actually open and the innovation, the results from open,

06:35.500 --> 06:38.700
helps all of us deal with that paradigm shift.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.600
Of course, I'll have the entire keynote linked in the show notes,

06:40.600 --> 06:42.400
but I just play that little introduction there,

06:42.400 --> 06:48.200
because I think it's interesting to see him running a keynote at Red Hat Summit in 2013.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.700
And now we come full circle in 2020.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.700
Post acquisition, it's been a year,

06:52.700 --> 06:58.200
and their CEO is going up to president and he's running the company.

06:58.200 --> 07:04.200
And he was on stage talking about how open source is important for innovation in our industry.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.100
Who knows long term how this guy will play out?

07:07.100 --> 07:09.600
He's got a massive ship. He's got it right now.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.500
Absolutely, but maybe this means good things for the future.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
Help of Red Hat as we knew it.

07:14.500 --> 07:19.300
Yeah, and he seems like a sharp individual who is very well spoken

07:19.300 --> 07:23.900
and able to answer a lot of questions that the media throw at him.

07:23.900 --> 07:28.300
I watched a couple of different analyst shows that he went on over the last few years

07:28.300 --> 07:34.800
just to get a sense of the guy and he can immediately overwhelm the reporter sitting at the desk.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.400
There was one of them, I didn't link it,

07:36.400 --> 07:38.900
but there's one of them where he starts giving an answer

07:38.900 --> 07:41.300
and the reporter didn't realize they're still on the wide shot.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.200
He looks over at the co-anchor and just goes,

07:43.200 --> 07:46.000
oh my gosh, and he rolls his whole face.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.600
And then when they come back, he's trying to recompose

07:47.600 --> 07:51.700
and he's trying to grasp what the man is telling him.

07:51.700 --> 07:55.500
So he's a very intelligent individual obviously as well.

07:55.500 --> 08:00.000
So I think and that's something I wanted to draw attention to is

08:00.000 --> 08:06.700
traditionally these leaders at IBM haven't been from an extremely technical background.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.300
In fact, it's been the exact opposite.

08:08.300 --> 08:12.900
They've come from more like the sales background or the business growth background.

08:12.900 --> 08:16.000
He's actually coming, I mean, he's got a degree in engineering.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.500
He's worked in the engineering area.

08:17.500 --> 08:22.900
So he's actually got an engineering background which is a little unusual

08:22.900 --> 08:29.900
for the last few CEOs and even heads IBM's research unit among other duties.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.200
Yeah, so who knows?

08:31.200 --> 08:32.200
Who knows?

08:32.200 --> 08:35.000
But it's one of those things that I think I wanted to touch on

08:35.000 --> 08:37.900
because I feel like it will have long-term knock-on effects.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.500
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of a marker of the next stage for IBM.

08:41.500 --> 08:48.600
Yeah, and a lot of pressure on that new guy to show results in services and cloud.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.500
Got to show results.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.600
Now, let's talk about something else that's showing some results.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.400
We talked about this one a little while ago too, although not as long as Linux Mint.

08:56.400 --> 09:00.100
System D, Home D is merged right in.

09:00.100 --> 09:04.700
Now, of course, it's not in a System D that's on a distribution near you yet,

09:04.700 --> 09:06.900
but it will be coming to future versions of System D.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.100
It is in the 2.45 releasing up.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.600
Yeah, if you don't recall, and you might not because we only talked about it,

09:12.600 --> 09:17.500
I mean, just recently back in episode 320, System D, Home D makes it easier to support things

09:17.500 --> 09:21.300
like migratable home directories, self-containment within home directories,

09:21.300 --> 09:25.600
better password and encryption handling, and other modern features.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.300
Now, you should probably check out 320 if you want very in-depth details.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.900
Yeah, we've got some clips from Leonard's talk introducing it.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.600
It's kind of surprising how fast this has been merged.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.600
But as we mentioned, it's an optional feature that's just landing upstream.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.300
So it'll be a while before we see any distros taking advantage of it, I'm sure.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.400
And think of it as like two major pieces.

09:43.400 --> 09:47.500
You have System D, Home D, which is the server for managing the home directories and user accounts.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.600
And then you have a user space tool for interacting with this new service,

09:50.600 --> 09:54.700
which is, surprise, surprise, called Home CTL.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.900
Home Cuddle, isn't that one version?

09:56.900 --> 10:00.100
You got to have a new Cuddle if you have a new server.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.800
I don't like that.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.100
I don't like that at all.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.600
I do not like that.

10:04.600 --> 10:09.300
I like that even less than I like calling QT cute.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.300
And I hate that.

10:10.300 --> 10:15.300
So we're not called, it's one of the reasons we're not even doing the cute story today.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.900
Because I just hate saying cute.

10:16.900 --> 10:22.900
Anyways, you know how whenever you talk about things that Apple has open sourced and hasn't screwed up,

10:22.900 --> 10:27.100
and then eventually after you talk about WebKit, eventually you get down to CUPS,

10:27.100 --> 10:29.100
and you're like, oh yeah, remember they bought CUPS?

10:29.100 --> 10:31.200
The common Unix printing server?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.000
Yeah, that one.

10:33.000 --> 10:40.000
Well, more than a decade after Apple acquired the CUPS source code and its lead developer, Michael Sweet,

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
he has left Apple. CUPS' lead developer is moving on.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.100
Yeah, I guess this announcement came just before Christmas.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.700
He'll be taking a break and then plans to begin forming a new business with his wife.

10:50.700 --> 10:51.700
That's great.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.900
Yeah, and I mean, he's already been busy.

10:53.900 --> 11:02.400
Already since leaving Apple this month, Sweet went on to announce Lprint as a new label printer software package for Linux and Mac OS.

11:02.400 --> 11:07.500
Lprint is a print spooler designed for label printing on hardware like Dymo label makers.

11:07.500 --> 11:12.300
Already, he's been quickly advancing Lprint with a 1.0 release on the horizon soon.

11:12.300 --> 11:15.700
Label printers are the bane of printing, so it's nice to see something that's...

11:15.700 --> 11:20.100
And it is sort of exactly one of those weird use cases where it's probably some horrible Windows program

11:20.100 --> 11:25.100
that you have to load just for this one machine, and of course, there's no Linux support, but hey, maybe now there is.

11:25.100 --> 11:33.100
I would like to see some sort of bracketed fight between you, Sweet, and Bacon.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.300
Payne, Sweet, and Bacon.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.200
Which truly is the best DJ name?

11:38.200 --> 11:41.000
And I'd like to see like some sort of bracketed sort of...

11:41.000 --> 11:42.300
There'll have to be some contests, I think.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.800
I mean, Payne is very hard to beat.

11:44.800 --> 11:49.300
Bacon's good, and Sweet is nice, but Payne...

11:49.300 --> 11:51.700
Payne is like an action hero name, I've always thought.

11:51.700 --> 11:55.200
So like if you ever wanted to get into like rock and roll, Wes Payne bringing you the hits.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.000
You should see my Matrix moves.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.500
Oh, I have Wes Payne. I have indeed.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.900
So now we'll see what happens with cups.

12:01.900 --> 12:08.400
Will Apple promote from within or seek somebody outside to take over the reign?

12:08.400 --> 12:15.000
Will Apple decide that printing is so 1990 and then just remove it from its systems and print through the iCloud print service?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.300
Who knows?

12:16.300 --> 12:17.700
I don't think there is an iCloud print service.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.700
Maybe an Apple printer coming soon, huh?

12:20.700 --> 12:22.700
Oh, my gosh.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.500
Yeah, it's going to be $1,000.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.900
And it'll only print special paper.

12:28.900 --> 12:31.700
But very glossy.

12:31.700 --> 12:39.500
This last item here is just sort of acknowledging that we received a lot of different types of feedback,

12:39.500 --> 12:44.700
all really good constructive feedback about our burnout discussion in a recent episode.

12:44.700 --> 12:55.500
And it seems like we kind of touched on something that's pretty universal and we're left with a sense that there might be more we could do on this topic.

12:55.500 --> 13:00.500
But I struggle to think of what something could be a genuine contribution to people that are struggling with burnout.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.800
Right, we kind of fell on the conversation, but it does seem like there might be more here.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.800
But what's the right?

13:04.800 --> 13:05.700
Oh, there's definitely more.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.700
What's the format for this?

13:06.700 --> 13:10.200
And we talked about in the context of open source and free software developers burning out.

13:10.200 --> 13:18.100
But from so many people we heard, it was all kinds of system sysadmins and just all types, parents, I mean, all types.

13:18.100 --> 13:21.700
So we are looking for ideas at Linuxonplug.com contact.

13:21.700 --> 13:26.700
Mostly I heard from people on Telegram and Twitter, which is which is great because it was like, OK, we hit on something here.

13:26.700 --> 13:32.700
But then like later when Wes and I wanted to kind of collate it all, we realized it'd be probably pretty good if we got that stuff in email.

13:32.700 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, especially for things like like suggestions for content that makes it really easy to go find and reference.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.300
So that's Linuxonplug.com contact to do that.

13:41.300 --> 13:47.900
And I I'm going to I'm going to set a challenge for those of you that are feeling like you're too busy to do anything.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.500
You're burning out. I push you to do something.

13:50.500 --> 13:54.100
Enjoy it for a week just for until the next episode.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.800
When something comes up, consider saying yes to it.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.300
Think of it as like you're forking your thought process for one week only.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.700
So it's not a lifestyle change. It's not something you have to commit to.

14:04.700 --> 14:09.500
But for a week, what I what I what I encourage you to do is break out of that narrative.

14:09.500 --> 14:13.100
Are you thinking to yourself, I wish I could, Chris, but I don't have that luxury. I'm too busy.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.700
Big reports do, man. You're exactly who I'm talking to.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.700
You have to break that narrative. You have to get out of that.

14:18.700 --> 14:30.500
I got a couple of links about how glorification of business and being busy impacts the way we think about things and how we kind of frame these thoughts in our head.

14:30.500 --> 14:35.300
Got a link in the show notes for that. Creating the habit of not being busy or just another approach it habits.

14:35.300 --> 14:40.600
I'm doing this myself. I launched chrislast.com, which is a little side project with the Chris Last cast.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.600
You got to come on there sometime, Wes. That sounds fun.

14:42.600 --> 14:47.100
Talk about anything but Linux. Anything we talk about on work. It's all just like all the other things.

14:47.100 --> 14:51.300
Plenty of other things. Dogs. Oh, you know, I love dogs now.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.100
Just well, I love my dog. Anyways, so I'm doing that.

14:54.100 --> 14:59.000
I'm going to just do it for a little while. It's like a little side thing because podcasts I started as a hobby.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.100
Then it became my now it's a career.

15:02.100 --> 15:06.100
And so now it was why I have to do it a certain way in a certain like, you know, all these standards.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.400
We've set it for ourselves. And I was like, well, what if I just wanted to have fun?

15:09.400 --> 15:12.900
Because it's still my preferred way to express myself.

15:12.900 --> 15:19.200
And I think that recognition is going to make this a lot more sustainable for me because I feel like a huge weight has been lifted.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.500
That's just it there, right? It's about sustainability.

15:21.500 --> 15:25.700
When you're always, you know, when you don't make time for yourself, then you can't work.

15:25.700 --> 15:31.100
I've never even bothered to set up my own website before because I thought I don't have time for that.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.600
I got to put everything I have in these shows I'm doing every single day.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.800
Like that's what I got to spend my attention on.

15:35.800 --> 15:41.400
But then I realized like I was kind of robbing from Peter to pay Paul.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.100
And if I don't have some sort of creative outlet like that,

15:45.100 --> 15:50.500
it turns into just this total grind fest that I end up resenting and hating and not feeling motivated about.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.100
And it was just sort of a it just took a little bit of a perspective shift.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.900
And that's why I really want to encourage people that if you're feeling burned out,

15:56.900 --> 16:02.100
do something that you are at first are resistant to and just try it for one week until the next episode.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.400
And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

16:03.400 --> 16:09.300
But just think of it as forking your way of thinking or maybe setting a theme for a week.

16:09.300 --> 16:14.800
I like that. And I mean, that's the thing is it's not easy that you got to you got to be intentional about it.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.300
Yeah. And and the moment you start thinking to yourself, I'm too busy for that.

16:18.300 --> 16:22.300
That's the moment to catch yourself and think or should I just try this for a bit

16:22.300 --> 16:24.400
and just go with it because what's the frickin worst that could happen?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.600
I'm already miserable. Right. So give that a go.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.700
I don't know. We're getting a little meta, but I just it touched me how much feedback we got.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.600
And I felt like Jesus is something people are really struggling with.

16:33.600 --> 16:39.200
And it is something that I myself have cycles and cycles and cycles of experience with now over the years.

16:39.200 --> 16:44.300
And, you know, it comes up in different ways. So maybe it's something we can help a little about.

16:44.300 --> 16:47.700
Maybe that's something I'll do in my side stuff or something. I don't know.

16:47.700 --> 16:51.800
In the meantime, I do know we got some housekeeping. Not a lot this week.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.800
I want to give a shout out to Mr. Cheesy Bacon. You might notice he's not here.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.300
He just went through a let's just say a procedure I wouldn't want to go through.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.900
And he's recovering right now. Like a boss.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.800
He showed up for his weekly meeting.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.200
We tried to kick him out and say go rest, but he was having none of it.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.500
So everybody sends your your get well vibes to Mr. Cheese Bacon. Shout out to Cheesy.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.100
We miss you, buddy. But we know you're here with us.

17:14.100 --> 17:18.200
And you can catch him on Telegram at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.700
That's been growing great.

17:19.700 --> 17:24.700
One of the things Cheesy helped us do, along with our fricking amazing community,

17:24.700 --> 17:27.500
is implement some bots in some of these channels.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.100
So it's cut down on the spam, which has meant the actual genuine conversations have.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.600
It's amazing. Have really blossomed in there.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.600
So Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram for that.

17:35.600 --> 17:41.000
And then last but not least, if you like Linux and you like to know what's going on in this industry, I do.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.700
Do you? Yeah. Well, good news, Wes.

17:42.700 --> 17:47.400
You should check out Linux Headlines at Linux Headlines dot show every single weekday.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.800
That's not like a really long sort of boring news show. Three minutes or less, Wes.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.500
Perfect. Three minutes or less.

17:52.500 --> 17:59.300
And it's a fantastic, well-researched breakdown that is vetted by the team before it gets published.

17:59.300 --> 18:04.000
So check that out at Linux Headlines dot show every single weekday in three minutes or less.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.900
Now also publishing to the Jupiter Broadcasting YouTube channel,

18:07.900 --> 18:10.300
YouTube dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.400
You'll see the most recent Brunch with Brent over there.

18:13.400 --> 18:19.000
Oh, yeah. So Brent just had an incredible Brunch with Peter Adams.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.400
That name sounds familiar.

18:20.400 --> 18:26.100
It's because he is the guy behind the Faces of Open Source project.

18:26.100 --> 18:30.900
What a great chat because it's it's Brent who's a photographer talking with another photographer

18:30.900 --> 18:36.400
about how they both leverage their skills to promote and showcase open source.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.000
I loved it. That could have been a launch episode right there, Brent.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Well, we're hoping to have many more of those coming up.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.600
So we'll have many launch episodes coming, maybe.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.700
Yeah. A lot of good things in the Brunch pipeline.

18:45.700 --> 18:49.100
I'm excited. People are really loving it. Extras dot show for that.

18:49.100 --> 18:52.100
And you can look at the category. There's ways to get feeds just for Brunch.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.900
I mean, maybe one day you won't have to mess with that.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.900
But in the meantime, Extras dot show. Go catch that.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.700
And it's also on the YouTube channel. Peter Adams. Super fascinating guy.

19:01.700 --> 19:05.600
Really well known photographer in the open source community.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.800
And just a great talk. Two of you really hit it off.

19:07.800 --> 19:12.300
And I enjoyed the hell out of that. Extras dot show or YouTube dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

19:12.300 --> 19:17.100
That, my friends, is the totally improv housekeeping.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.600
That wasn't too bad. No, we got through it OK.

19:19.600 --> 19:26.300
So you know what else is unique about episode 100 besides it being the last time we reviewed Linux Mint?

19:26.300 --> 19:28.100
You know what else is unique about that episode?

19:28.100 --> 19:31.300
I could be wrong, but I seem to recall it was Wes Payne's first episode.

19:31.300 --> 19:35.400
That's right. So that was also a post barbecue episode.

19:35.400 --> 19:39.300
I mean, it's snowing outside so it doesn't make sense, but I wish we were barbecuing.

19:39.300 --> 19:43.700
It's really kind of snaning right now. You know, it's snaning, not necessarily snowing.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.700
Yeah, that was a fun episode.

19:46.700 --> 19:52.100
And so we'll link that on the old noteskis if you're interested in our previous take.

19:52.100 --> 19:59.100
At the time, though, I was concerned that I didn't feel like it was something you could recommend

19:59.100 --> 20:02.600
because it just seemed more logical to go with Ubuntu proper,

20:02.600 --> 20:07.300
which had Canonical behind it, had hardware vendors in the marketplace,

20:07.300 --> 20:12.800
and had an obvious long-term support cycle that you could depend upon.

20:12.800 --> 20:17.700
That was one of my concerns about Mint back then, which, how long ago, when was that?

20:17.700 --> 20:20.800
I got to go look at the date just so we have a reference point here.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.500
That was back on July 7th, 2015.

20:24.500 --> 20:28.500
Linux Mint 17.2, I think we were talking about.

20:28.500 --> 20:32.800
Colonel 3.15? Yeah, 17.2.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.500
Yeah, you're right. Oh my gosh. Look at that.

20:36.500 --> 20:41.200
Anyways, I think those concerns did not bear out. Linux Mint has continued on.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.100
Right. I mean, because they don't have the same sort of control that Ubuntu does

20:44.100 --> 20:47.200
because they're using so much of Ubuntu's packaging.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.900
But you're right. It's not like it's been a super unstable.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.800
We don't hear a lot of complaints about from Linux Mint users.

20:52.800 --> 20:59.300
Right. And, you know, they recently received nearly 25,

20:59.300 --> 21:03.100
no, they did receive over $25,000 in a single month of donations.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.400
That's some pretty great support.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.400
And they've just released their latest version last month,

21:07.400 --> 21:10.000
and they've just published a new set of updates to it.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.200
And we thought, all right, it's time to give 19.3 a go.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.900
It's been too long. Let's see what it's like.

21:14.900 --> 21:19.200
And so I wanted to get kind of a pulse from the audience type thing

21:19.200 --> 21:22.500
because a lot of times I think people typecast Linux Mint as,

21:22.500 --> 21:27.100
oh, it's a good Windows replacement or, you know, if you're new to Linux,

21:27.100 --> 21:28.800
you should use Linux Mint. And I hate that.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.600
I hate when we do that because every distro can be for anybody.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.300
Just depends on your approach.

21:34.300 --> 21:38.000
Sure, some distros have a much steeper ramp,

21:38.000 --> 21:42.600
but if you're well-read, willing to do your research, ask questions,

21:42.600 --> 21:45.900
you can basically just about any dang distro going,

21:45.900 --> 21:50.800
no matter what your previous skill level is, with some exceptions.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.400
So when I wanted to get a feel for why people in our audience

21:53.400 --> 21:57.900
were using Linux Mint, here's a little bit of what I got back when I asked.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.600
This comes from at all on Twitter.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.700
He says, I transitioned from Windows 10 to Mint

22:02.700 --> 22:05.300
after I failed to migrate from Windows 7,

22:05.300 --> 22:09.700
and I thought performance was too crappy on Windows 7.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.100
I expected a bit of blowback from usability and other things

22:12.100 --> 22:15.600
arising from migrating to any Linux-based hashtag distro,

22:15.600 --> 22:19.700
but it's been quiet and it's been going for four weeks fine.

22:19.700 --> 22:23.400
So he did it because Windows 10 didn't upgrade properly for him.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.700
So I thought, well, screw this.

22:24.700 --> 22:25.200
That's great.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.000
I mean, yeah, why not?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.300
What you got is broke.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.100
Dave writes in, I donate $15 a month

22:31.100 --> 22:33.600
because it allows me to do pretty much all of my work

22:33.600 --> 22:35.000
without getting in the way.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.500
I look forward to each new release instead of dreading updates.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.300
That's a nice property right there.

22:41.300 --> 22:46.000
And I got a couple of different forms of that that came in.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.200
The number one sentiment was, it lets me do all of my work

22:49.200 --> 22:50.300
without getting in the way.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.900
And that's worth money to me.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.100
That was what I noticed over and over and over again.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.800
It's actually something we talked about way back in episode 100

22:56.800 --> 23:01.600
because they recently started rebasing on LTS 14.04 at the time.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.200
And that meant that they could have,

23:03.200 --> 23:04.600
you could finally upgrade Linux Mint

23:04.600 --> 23:05.700
without worrying that it would break.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.800
It brought that level of stability.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.100
Right, that used to be a thing.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.100
I had completely forgotten about this.

23:11.100 --> 23:13.400
Alex wrote in a long time ago, different Alex

23:13.400 --> 23:15.700
than self-hosted Alex.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.000
But he wrote in, I've responded to him offline,

23:18.000 --> 23:19.700
but I wanted to read a bit of this because I thought,

23:19.700 --> 23:21.400
this sort of also shows you a use cases.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.700
I'm a university professor.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.900
And I plan on organizing a new course for my students this fall.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.200
He's pretty excited about it.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.800
The title will be something along the line of Introduction to Linux

23:30.800 --> 23:33.400
and Open Source Software in Geosciences.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.600
Some of the students have never used or installed Linux before.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.400
I've used Ubuntu for many years.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.700
Then last year I switched to Debian

23:40.700 --> 23:42.300
and now back on Ubuntu and Pop OS.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.200
This summer I had some fun distro hopping.

23:44.200 --> 23:47.300
I tried Ubuntu and Kubuntu 18.04, 18.10, and 19.04,

23:47.300 --> 23:53.100
OpenSUSE, Fedora, KDE, Neon, and finally Linux Mint 19.1.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.100
That's some first-class distro hopping right there.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.900
It seriously was busy.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.700
After this experience, I switched to Linux Mint for a few weeks.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.800
My main reason was I needed a distro based on Ubuntu,

24:02.800 --> 24:04.600
my habit of command line use,

24:04.600 --> 24:06.600
and I needed libraries in Ubuntu 18.04

24:06.600 --> 24:09.000
for software that we developed.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.700
And finally, I needed the ability to use the same kernel as Ubuntu 19.04

24:12.700 --> 24:17.000
due to trackpad problems on my Lenovo Carbon X1.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.100
I have to say that Linux Mint is the easiest for newbies.

24:20.100 --> 24:22.900
For example, installing Dropbox, Skype, Melody,

24:22.900 --> 24:26.000
and all kinds of things can be done with one click in the software center.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.200
The backup system snapshots option is fast and easy.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.600
This is something else that was echoed by a couple of people.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.600
It has been a year and I have not done a conventional backup.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.300
Now I'm actually motivated to do so.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.400
So this snapshot system that they integrated,

24:39.400 --> 24:42.400
we got several people that wrote in and liked this.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.800
Like Jeff here said, you asked for opinions about timeshift.

24:46.800 --> 24:50.200
I too had concerns based on the horrible experiences of system restore in Windows.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.900
That's what I was like, is it as bad as Windows restore?

24:52.900 --> 24:56.700
However, timeshift has twice worked successfully on my Mint system

24:56.700 --> 24:59.300
to roll back problematic updates.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.300
I was so impressed that I installed it on my Arch machine

25:02.300 --> 25:06.300
and have used it after I had a problematic update on Arch just a few days ago.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.400
Timeshift appears to be the real deal

25:08.400 --> 25:11.700
and now I consider it vital for any new system I build.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.000
Well, that's a heck of an endorsement.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Yeah.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.400
Yeah, so you can see there's things about Mint that go beyond the Cinnamon, XFCE,

25:18.400 --> 25:21.600
what type of desktop environment that people seem to be really drawn to

25:21.600 --> 25:25.800
so much so that they're willing to put their hard-earned money right where it matters.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.800
And you can see it, I mean, they've got over $25,000 in donation.

25:29.800 --> 25:35.800
So now we're looking at 19.3, which is the latest release, just updated recently.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.000
There's XFCE, Cinnamon and MATE spins.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.600
Because I didn't have a lot of time and I wanted to go all in,

25:41.600 --> 25:43.800
I decided to try out the Cinnamon edition again

25:43.800 --> 25:47.300
because I look at that as sort of the premier flagship Mint.

25:47.300 --> 25:50.900
And, you know, it's the desktop environment they're the most directly involved in.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.500
It's pretty great.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.300
Along with these desktop environment options,

25:54.300 --> 25:57.600
you have Celluloid instead of XPlayer, Gnote instead of Tomboy,

25:57.600 --> 26:01.100
and System Reports, which is able to detect some kind of typical problems

26:01.100 --> 26:02.700
and then give you suggestions.

26:02.700 --> 26:06.600
And there's almost complete, almost complete, high DPI support,

26:06.600 --> 26:11.100
plus a lot more in here, including a more modern version of the Linux kernel.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.800
And this new system tray fix that seems to be kind of working

26:14.800 --> 26:18.100
that they've introduced to try to get all the icons from different apps

26:18.100 --> 26:21.700
at the right size crammed down in the corner like you're used to back in the day.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.100
And everything just worked.

26:23.100 --> 26:27.900
Problem is that some apps are not still working, like Nextcloud.

26:27.900 --> 26:31.000
And NixNote don't work, and the HP printer demon little app thing

26:31.000 --> 26:32.500
doesn't show up down there.

26:32.500 --> 26:36.700
In fact, it can even cause the HP GUI just to crash altogether.

26:36.700 --> 26:39.600
Yeah, so it's not perfect, but they're aware of those issues.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.200
But they're trying to just address some of those things

26:42.200 --> 26:44.700
that I think users come to expect.

26:44.700 --> 26:50.200
Now, as far as my bias is when I went into this,

26:50.200 --> 26:53.800
my opinion of Cinnamon in the past is it's really nice.

26:53.800 --> 26:58.700
It's a lot like a sweet spot between GNOME and Plasma,

26:58.700 --> 27:00.900
but it just misses some refinement.

27:00.900 --> 27:05.900
Just misses like things are a little unstable, things don't seem quite finished.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.800
It's not like seeing its full potential.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.000
I do not feel that way in my usage so far.

27:12.000 --> 27:22.000
This release feels like it's carrying forward years of refinement now.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.800
And this version of, so this is Cinnamon 4.45 that ships in this.

27:27.800 --> 27:31.400
And the performance is great.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.600
The experience, I'd say, feels classy.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.700
Feels classy.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.000
Feels refined.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.800
Within seconds, I had my theme set up the way I like.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.000
I had my icons changed over.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.200
And of course, Linux Mint still feels a little bit like one of those,

27:45.200 --> 27:48.700
everything including the kitchen sink distros to a degree.

27:48.700 --> 27:52.100
And so all the themes and icon styles and everything I might want

27:52.100 --> 27:53.600
were already pre-installed.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.700
So it's ready to go.

27:54.700 --> 27:56.600
Firefox ready to go.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.900
The panel was always my biggest niggle in Cinnamon.

28:00.900 --> 28:03.300
And now it feels like one of the most solid panels out there.

28:03.300 --> 28:06.700
I don't think I've really used Linux Mint since then.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.200
You know, maybe checked in here or there.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.200
And it feels like a whole new panel.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.200
It's minimal without being too minimal.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.200
Feels very clean.

28:13.200 --> 28:18.000
And honestly, I was very surprised by how snappy everything felt.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.800
And they've brought forward the feature I like the most from the plasma panel

28:21.800 --> 28:25.300
is that's where you go into dedicated edit mode where the UI actually

28:25.300 --> 28:28.000
reflects that you're in a mode to change the panel.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.200
And it kind of has color theme matched highlights that it does,

28:32.200 --> 28:34.400
hotspot areas that it lights up.

28:34.400 --> 28:35.800
And you can toggle that mode.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.800
And so it's locked in when you're not in that mode.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.700
And it takes up the minimum amount of space.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.400
And it just looks really good.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.900
It functions exactly like you'd expect.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.500
Everything's where you'd want it.

28:45.500 --> 28:48.600
When I sat down and started using Cinnamon,

28:48.600 --> 28:50.900
it was like I had been using it since episode 100.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.200
Like I never stopped.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.200
There has not been a moment yet where I've been hunting for something.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.000
Everything's where I expect it.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.200
It took me seconds to get my displays.

28:59.200 --> 29:04.100
I have multiple displays on this system, get them working.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.600
Absolutely think this has gotten to a point of refinement.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.600
I really do.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.200
I don't know if it's for me still.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.600
What do you think about that?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.900
Well, one thing that struck me is, you know,

29:13.900 --> 29:16.200
it definitely looks a lot more polished and nice,

29:16.200 --> 29:20.500
but it's not, you know, in the latest Ubuntu and I'm sure 2004,

29:20.500 --> 29:23.500
Ubuntu's got a pop with Yaru looking really great

29:23.500 --> 29:27.100
and sort of the bright colors, the oranges and the purples,

29:27.100 --> 29:29.000
especially on a high DPI screen.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.900
It's just a beautiful desktop these days.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.100
It's gorgeous.

29:32.100 --> 29:35.400
Linux Mint doesn't quite have that, but not, I don't think in a bad way.

29:35.400 --> 29:39.000
It's just, it's just very understated, understated.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.900
Yeah, but it gets out of your way.

29:40.900 --> 29:43.500
It's not trying to capture your attention with itself,

29:43.500 --> 29:45.700
but it also now I think with that polish means

29:45.700 --> 29:47.900
it also doesn't have some of those distracting flaws.

29:47.900 --> 29:50.500
So like you said, you just sit down, you get right to work.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.900
You just get to work.

29:51.900 --> 29:55.100
You're right. And it's the low, it's low key.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.000
It's a low key visual style. That's what it is.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.800
Even the grub menu, which looks nice.

29:58.800 --> 30:00.400
Not a ton of contrast.

30:00.400 --> 30:05.000
Yeah. And you know, you hear in the, when people are writing in you,

30:05.000 --> 30:07.600
what we saw echoed was it just gets out of my way.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.800
And I, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a visual element of,

30:11.800 --> 30:13.400
it's not flashing at me.

30:13.400 --> 30:17.000
Now, you know, I say all that, I kind of like the new looks too.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.200
See, I'm the kind of guy who can appreciate wobbly windows

30:20.200 --> 30:22.800
and I can appreciate a regular setup

30:22.800 --> 30:25.700
where everything snaps to a, to a spot in the screen.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.700
So I have a pretty wide range of tolerance

30:27.700 --> 30:30.900
and I can generally find something I like about all of them.

30:30.900 --> 30:34.500
This Cinnamon setup is a little cliche to say,

30:34.500 --> 30:39.000
but if I had a family member or a friend that was on Windows 7 right now

30:39.000 --> 30:43.200
or Windows 8 and didn't want to go to 10 or God forbid Vista,

30:43.200 --> 30:46.300
I would seriously consider Cinnamon. This is nice.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.500
I think the thing is it works like you would expect.

30:48.500 --> 30:52.700
It's just a very intuitive interface, especially I think to Windows users.

30:52.700 --> 30:56.100
Nemo is a fine looking file manager

30:56.100 --> 30:59.600
and I found the whole experience to be just sort of friendly.

30:59.600 --> 31:04.000
You know, the software was easy to find and install, backups are made quite available.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.400
It feels like it's been thought of for people coming in and starting to use the system.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.900
I want to jump on that for just a second.

31:10.900 --> 31:14.900
It's all right there, like boot repair menu where you can just, you know,

31:14.900 --> 31:17.600
check your bootloader and see if there's something wrong with it and repair it.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.500
Backup is just called system backup.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.700
The driver manager is just called driver manager.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.800
And when you like log in the first time it asks like,

31:23.800 --> 31:26.800
oh, you might need to set up some of your hardware. Here's the driver manager.

31:26.800 --> 31:30.700
Now, it did manage to think that my Intel Wi-Fi needed a thing

31:30.700 --> 31:32.100
and didn't think the device was working.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.700
But the flip side, it's for whatever reason,

31:35.700 --> 31:40.100
joining the Wi-Fi seems way faster on Linux Mint than it has under KDE neon.

31:40.100 --> 31:43.000
I wonder if, I mean, they're using the network manager, I assume, right?

31:43.000 --> 31:48.900
Yeah, I was also very impressed just setting it up to get installed

31:48.900 --> 31:53.000
because on my ThinkPad here, you know, I've got a whole bunch of distros installed

31:53.000 --> 31:55.900
and I like to test things out and see how well does the installer cope

31:55.900 --> 31:58.000
with having other Linux distributions there.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.300
Does it detect it? Does it handle it right? Does it offer?

32:01.300 --> 32:04.000
It did very well. It found all my existing users.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.700
It offered to sort of automatically shrink a partition

32:06.700 --> 32:09.600
and add itself in there without overriding stuff.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.200
And when I mess things up and, you know, I'm disappointed to say that

32:13.200 --> 32:18.200
because it's based on 1804, it still has that bug where if you try to put grub on XFS,

32:18.200 --> 32:21.800
it doesn't work because it doesn't install the XFS module and it can't find grub.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.300
It reinstalled with ext4 and it detected that there was Linux Mint there

32:25.300 --> 32:28.000
and was just perfectly ready to, oh, do you just want to reinstall right over

32:28.000 --> 32:30.600
where you just installed Mint?

32:30.600 --> 32:31.800
That's good. It's perfect.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.900
Not too complicated, easy to sort out.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.800
When you first launch their update manager, it says Linux Mint recommends

32:36.800 --> 32:40.700
you set up automated system snapshots and apply all available updates.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.400
This way, if your computer is always secure and you can go back in time

32:43.400 --> 32:45.700
and recover from any potential regression.

32:45.700 --> 32:48.600
And then it gives you, these are the three types of updates,

32:48.600 --> 32:52.100
security updates, software updates, and system snapshots.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.900
Pretty nice. Brent, do you have some semi recent experience with Mint yourself?

32:55.900 --> 32:58.600
That's probably a really accurate way of describing it.

32:58.600 --> 33:02.400
I actually was a huge Mint user for many, many years before.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.200
Oh, really?

33:03.200 --> 33:06.700
Yeah, it was, you know, if anyone knows my history,

33:06.700 --> 33:12.400
I kind of moved from the Mac environment to Zubuntu.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.900
But after a year or two moved to Mint for all of many of the reasons

33:15.900 --> 33:18.600
that you're describing, it's super user-friendly.

33:18.600 --> 33:23.400
Cinnamon was a really nice interface and still is.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.000
And so I probably used it for like three, four years

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
and recommended it to tons of people and got lots of people on it.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.900
And that was right up until, I'd say about, for me personally,

33:32.900 --> 33:34.400
two and a half years ago,

33:34.400 --> 33:40.800
but I've been interacting with friends and family with it up till last year.

33:40.800 --> 33:45.100
And I kept running into these small little issues

33:45.100 --> 33:51.900
that were basically based around just some of the software being held back a little bit.

33:51.900 --> 33:56.600
So part of their model is to have a little bit of an older kernel based on,

33:56.600 --> 34:03.300
you know, an LTS that's a little bit older as a trade-off to that sustainability, right?

34:03.300 --> 34:05.100
Stability, I should say.

34:05.100 --> 34:10.200
And that ended up causing some problems, you know, that for me, okay,

34:10.200 --> 34:14.600
I'm maybe pushing the envelope a little bit compared to, you know, new users,

34:14.600 --> 34:19.700
but it was even little things like running into issues with KDE Connect,

34:19.700 --> 34:22.900
which I suggest for people who have Android phones to do backups

34:22.900 --> 34:24.800
and access their files and stuff like that.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.400
And things with Nextcloud that it was just, I don't know,

34:27.400 --> 34:33.900
these little tiny bugs that are often referred to as, you know, those paper cuts that just add up.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.900
So even though I loved that distro for many years,

34:36.900 --> 34:40.700
it was just, it just kind of started getting there

34:40.700 --> 34:43.500
where I was just, all these little frustrations added up

34:43.500 --> 34:46.700
and that's kind of what caused me to move away.

34:46.700 --> 34:51.100
So it sounds to me almost like maybe, you know,

34:51.100 --> 34:56.100
what Wes described that maybe that hasn't quite been totally surmounted yet.

34:56.100 --> 35:03.700
Maybe it's just based on their philosophies of being a little bit slower to have those compromises.

35:03.700 --> 35:04.900
It makes me think there too, Brent.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.500
I mean, way back in episode 100, I'd been a regular Mint user.

35:08.500 --> 35:13.500
It was the distro I was using on my workstation at work.

35:13.500 --> 35:17.400
I wonder if there's like, you know, I think Mint is still great for a lot of use cases,

35:17.400 --> 35:21.200
but it's not, I'm still, even having this great experience right now,

35:21.200 --> 35:24.700
using it and running it right now, I'm still not, I'm not going to switch to it.

35:24.700 --> 35:28.900
It just doesn't, as a sort of advanced tinkerer Linux user,

35:28.900 --> 35:33.000
it's not the right fit for me and in a way that I don't feel necessarily about Ubuntu.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.300
I'm not really sure why.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.900
Maybe it's the server use case, but it just feels like what Linux Mint is doing,

35:37.900 --> 35:40.700
I respect and I like and I enjoy, but I don't need.

35:40.700 --> 35:42.300
I think you just nailed it.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.200
I think that's exactly what it is because on the desktop side,

35:45.200 --> 35:48.800
you can run an Ubuntu interim release that has much fresher packages.

35:48.800 --> 35:49.800
Right.

35:49.800 --> 35:52.800
And on the server side, you're not going to run Linux Mint.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.800
And you do want something that is of a more stable cadence.

35:56.800 --> 36:01.200
And for us, Mint just doesn't fit within that spectrum.

36:01.200 --> 36:07.300
However, if I was using this as a research station to write papers

36:07.300 --> 36:09.400
and to collect information on the web,

36:09.400 --> 36:12.300
or if I was using this as a way to terminal into systems,

36:12.300 --> 36:16.200
or if I wanted to deploy a terminal services environment,

36:16.200 --> 36:18.600
I might go with the Monte edition, but you know what I mean?

36:18.600 --> 36:21.700
Like there are use cases I absolutely could see for Mint

36:21.700 --> 36:24.100
where people would fit within the spectrum use case of it

36:24.100 --> 36:26.500
and that's clearly bared out by the donations.

36:26.500 --> 36:30.800
And I picture it not as newbies, which is I think probably a portion of them.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.300
So I think it's fair to say newbies like Mint.

36:33.300 --> 36:35.800
And it seems to be that like there's some cultural channels

36:35.800 --> 36:41.200
that people find themselves in that sort of push them towards Mint if they're new.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.400
But I also think it's people that just want to get the damn work done.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.100
And I think there's way more of them than we give credit to.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.600
Yes, if you don't need to have the latest desktop software, right?

36:50.600 --> 36:53.100
You're not trying to go find the latest version of KDE Connect

36:53.100 --> 36:55.300
that has the feature you heard about that you want to try.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.200
You just want to make sure that you can get LibreOffice

36:58.200 --> 37:00.600
and you feel like your computer is secure

37:00.600 --> 37:03.400
and you've got the science tools you need or whatever.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.600
It's perfect for that.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.000
It seems like to me Mint too is still that distribution

37:07.000 --> 37:10.300
that promises to shave off a few rough edges

37:10.300 --> 37:14.300
that I think you could argue are there or not.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.300
So I'll give you an example.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.900
When you launch the Update Manager again,

37:17.900 --> 37:19.500
this is because it's such a great,

37:19.500 --> 37:23.100
their Update Manager is such a great personification

37:23.100 --> 37:25.000
of the distribution's philosophy.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.200
So it's such a great way to just totally encapsulate

37:28.200 --> 37:30.900
the distribution's outlook on things.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.600
So when you open it,

37:32.600 --> 37:35.200
first it gives you that advisory I read earlier.

37:35.200 --> 37:39.500
Then it says, hey, why don't you use a local mirror?

37:39.500 --> 37:42.100
Hit this button here and go get a local mirror

37:42.100 --> 37:44.700
so that way you get the fastest downloads.

37:44.700 --> 37:46.900
Totally possible on any distro, right?

37:46.900 --> 37:49.500
But they're shaving off that 5% extra effort

37:49.500 --> 37:51.600
you'd have to take to go copy-paste to the command line

37:51.600 --> 37:53.000
to do it yourself.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.300
Just making it right there up in front

37:54.300 --> 37:56.300
and discoverable as a result.

37:56.300 --> 37:59.200
Right, that's a huge thing that we don't give credit to.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.000
Then when you're in there in the settings

38:01.000 --> 38:02.300
after you've said, yeah, I want to do that,

38:02.300 --> 38:04.500
they have other things in here that I think,

38:04.500 --> 38:05.900
even if they're not necessary,

38:05.900 --> 38:08.900
promise the user that it's solving problems for you

38:08.900 --> 38:10.500
that you don't want to have to manage.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.500
And I think we can't understate how important that is

38:12.500 --> 38:14.400
because the operating system is supposed to manage

38:14.400 --> 38:16.600
the computer for you so you can get your work done.

38:16.600 --> 38:18.100
And that's kind of what Mint is promising here.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.900
Like when you go to the maintenance thing,

38:19.900 --> 38:23.500
you can do things like purge residual configuration

38:23.500 --> 38:27.900
or add missing GPG keys or remove a foreign package

38:27.900 --> 38:29.700
or downgrade a foreign package

38:29.700 --> 38:32.000
with these buttons in the software sources application.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.400
They're all things you could do with apt on the command line.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.300
Right, but it's that model that is more similar

38:37.300 --> 38:39.500
to how some of the other operating systems do it.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.600
And I think it fits in with all the bottom models

38:41.600 --> 38:42.900
people already have.

38:42.900 --> 38:45.000
And by putting it in a section called maintenance,

38:45.000 --> 38:48.100
the implication is, is they're handling something for you

38:48.100 --> 38:50.200
that needs to be maintained on the machine

38:50.200 --> 38:52.800
that likely other distributions aren't.

38:52.800 --> 38:56.900
And that has to be valuable to some people when they see that.

38:56.900 --> 38:58.700
When they see something out there that looks like,

38:58.700 --> 39:00.800
okay, it's solving problems for me.

39:00.800 --> 39:05.400
And they've done that across a series of applications on Mint.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.300
And I think when you just kind of look at that sort of,

39:08.300 --> 39:11.000
that one, when you take that one thing in isolation

39:11.000 --> 39:13.600
and look at it, there's a lot to unpack there.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.200
And what I see is a distribution that promises

39:16.200 --> 39:19.500
to get out of your way, let you get your work done,

39:19.500 --> 39:24.400
and save 5% of your time here and there

39:24.400 --> 39:26.600
a couple of times a month.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.500
And when you use something over a year or two

39:29.500 --> 39:31.900
and every couple of months or every couple of weeks, really,

39:31.900 --> 39:36.800
it's saving you 5% of time versus maybe if you were using

39:36.800 --> 39:39.500
Ubuntu proper, right?

39:39.500 --> 39:42.900
I would see building a real fondness for that.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.000
And I could see really appreciating the value that brings

39:46.000 --> 39:47.700
because there's nothing more valuable than time.

39:47.700 --> 39:50.300
And I could see wanting to contribute to keeping that going.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.600
And there's something great about it being an indie project

39:53.600 --> 39:56.300
that is obviously riding on the shoulders of giants,

39:56.300 --> 39:58.500
no doubt about it, but has also created something

39:58.500 --> 39:59.600
beloved themselves.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.600
Yeah, I mean, they've been around for a long time.

40:01.600 --> 40:05.100
They've survived a lot of changes in the desktop Linux ecosystem.

40:05.100 --> 40:07.200
I used to be very concerned about Clem's staying power,

40:07.200 --> 40:09.300
but I think time has spoken.

40:09.300 --> 40:12.100
And here they are still cranking it out.

40:12.100 --> 40:14.900
By my account from a software, I have no idea

40:14.900 --> 40:18.700
how they're doing morally or how they're holding up as a team.

40:18.700 --> 40:22.400
But from an output side, this is the best looking mint

40:22.400 --> 40:23.400
I've ever seen.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.400
Absolutely.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.100
And that's not a small thing.

40:26.100 --> 40:29.100
I can genuinely appreciate the value of this distribution now.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.600
Even if it's not for us, it doesn't

40:30.600 --> 40:31.900
fit within our use case spectrum.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.700
Isn't it great that we have an ecosystem

40:33.700 --> 40:35.100
that this is even possible?

40:35.100 --> 40:39.000
That Canonical and Debian and all the ecosystems

40:39.000 --> 40:40.300
of open source and free software,

40:40.300 --> 40:43.400
that they have an idea, the team has

40:43.400 --> 40:45.400
a vision for how the desktop can be,

40:45.400 --> 40:49.600
and they're actually able to build that.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.000
Yeah, and I think if you want something

40:51.000 --> 40:53.600
that you can stick on their run for a while, it's great for that.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.600
For me, that's funny, that's the same use case

40:56.600 --> 40:58.800
I attribute to a Manjaro or an Arch,

40:58.800 --> 41:00.600
is I stick it on a machine and I just leave it.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.800
And it just goes and goes and goes for years,

41:02.800 --> 41:05.100
much in the same way Mint does, but solving

41:05.100 --> 41:06.500
two different problems.

41:06.500 --> 41:09.100
Arch is solving the, I like to tinker with software,

41:09.100 --> 41:09.900
I like to have the latest stuff.

41:09.900 --> 41:13.000
It's solving Brent's problem of older things on the system

41:13.000 --> 41:15.500
are incompatible with newer projects that you want to do.

41:15.500 --> 41:19.000
It solves both those problems differently.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.400
It's fascinating to me.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.500
If you were able to just roll with what

41:22.500 --> 41:24.800
comes loaded on Mint forever,

41:24.800 --> 41:28.700
you'd be satisfied as long as 19.3 is supported.

41:28.700 --> 41:31.000
And on Arch, you look back and then you go,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
oh, how can you do that?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.100
It's just so funny.

41:34.100 --> 41:36.600
It's so funny that we're using the same fundamental systems,

41:36.600 --> 41:38.700
we have the same fundamental philosophies,

41:38.700 --> 41:40.800
and yet the two are as far apart

41:40.800 --> 41:43.100
in terms of workflow as you can get.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.600
And it's a real crazy thing to me.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.200
I'm not keeping it on here.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.700
We're going to go back into Kubuntu.

41:48.700 --> 41:51.400
It does make me think it might be,

41:51.400 --> 41:53.900
I sort of forgot about Cinnamon, I'll be honest.

41:53.900 --> 41:56.000
It almost makes me think it's like the XFCE

41:56.000 --> 41:57.100
I could actually use.

41:57.100 --> 42:01.600
Yeah, I do feel like I need to give Cinnamon another crack

42:01.600 --> 42:03.100
because I have experienced in the past

42:03.100 --> 42:05.200
when I load Cinnamon up on other distros,

42:05.200 --> 42:06.600
it's not as nice.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.400
That is one.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.000
I don't know, I haven't tried it for a while.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.100
It probably deserves to be tried.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.500
And if you got a spin,

42:11.500 --> 42:13.900
what's that, there's that Ubuntu Cinnamon edition, right?

42:13.900 --> 42:15.200
You know, you got a spin or something

42:15.200 --> 42:17.400
that is designed to run it,

42:17.400 --> 42:18.600
where they've put a little effort

42:18.600 --> 42:20.900
into making that old Cinnamon taste good.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.400
You got to go with Cinnamon, you got to go with that.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.200
Oh, yeah.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.200
Cinnamon and Mint, you know,

42:24.200 --> 42:25.900
there's like a flavor theme going on here.

42:25.900 --> 42:27.100
Maybe a mixed drink.

42:27.100 --> 42:28.300
Yeah, I can see that.

42:28.300 --> 42:29.500
I can see that.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.500
Linux Mint is a bit of a mixed drink.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.700
I did not get a chance to try the XFCE edition.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.700
And that kind of burns me

42:35.700 --> 42:38.600
because the other kind of consistent bit of feedback

42:38.600 --> 42:40.600
we got in when I asked about this

42:40.600 --> 42:44.600
was it's one of the best XFCE implementations out there.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.000
I think we have some homework, though.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.300
Yeah, yeah, we could.

42:47.300 --> 42:48.400
Yeah, we could do that.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.700
Because I did grab both ISOs.

42:50.700 --> 42:53.000
Which, we don't talk about this anymore,

42:53.000 --> 42:56.300
but some projects still are not great at delivering ISOs.

42:56.300 --> 42:57.600
Other projects like Mint, though,

42:57.600 --> 43:00.200
these ISOs rock down, like boom.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.000
They had a lot of handy mirrors,

43:02.000 --> 43:03.800
or the torrent, plenty of seats.

43:03.800 --> 43:04.700
Yeah, I grabbed the torrent,

43:04.700 --> 43:07.000
and I think they must have had a CDN web seat

43:07.000 --> 43:07.800
on that thing or something

43:07.800 --> 43:10.600
because I downloaded that entire ISO in seconds.

43:10.600 --> 43:11.600
I don't even think it took a minute.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.100
I mean, it was ridiculous.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.000
So, you know, it's funny because sometimes you go try,

43:15.000 --> 43:17.600
even now in 2020, you go download a Linux distro to review it,

43:17.600 --> 43:19.500
and you're getting like just the worst download.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.300
You're like, oh, yeah, it is still hard

43:21.300 --> 43:23.600
to move these large files around sometimes,

43:23.600 --> 43:25.800
but they feel really polished.

43:25.800 --> 43:27.000
As long as you don't go to the website.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.300
Just...

43:29.300 --> 43:31.000
We kid, guys, we kid, we joke.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.100
It's mostly fine.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.400
And I'd love to know what your thoughts are.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.000
Let me know, at ChrisLAS on the old Twitters,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.300
if you've given it a go.

43:40.300 --> 43:42.500
And yes, we did look into the Debian edition.

43:42.500 --> 43:45.800
They do have a new release that's in the works right now.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.800
You know, I have used the Debian edition,

43:48.800 --> 43:53.600
which is kind of their rolling version, if you will,

43:53.600 --> 43:56.000
which was my attempt before moving to Arch

43:56.000 --> 43:57.600
to kind of get the best of both worlds.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.300
And it was pretty slick for a while,

43:59.300 --> 44:01.100
and then it broke very catastrophically.

44:01.100 --> 44:02.800
So mileage may vary.

44:02.800 --> 44:03.800
That was a little while ago,

44:03.800 --> 44:06.200
but it's really cool that they're offering

44:06.200 --> 44:08.700
that sort of testing style of release

44:08.700 --> 44:10.400
that just kind of rolls and rolls and rolls.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.600
Smart.

44:11.600 --> 44:12.700
It's smart to keep that going too.

44:12.700 --> 44:13.900
I think Brent's hooked on rolling.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.600
Yeah.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.800
That could be a podcast name,

44:17.800 --> 44:19.800
Hooked on Rolling.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.800
Because I'll tell you what,

44:21.800 --> 44:23.100
although people wouldn't know what kind of rolling

44:23.100 --> 44:24.800
you're talking about outside the Linux industry.

44:24.800 --> 44:25.900
Got to listen to find out.

44:25.900 --> 44:26.900
That's true.

44:26.900 --> 44:28.500
Probably would get a big audience because of it.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.100
Yeah.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.100
I think it's the classy distro.

44:32.100 --> 44:33.100
I think it truly is.

44:33.100 --> 44:34.400
It's like the classy distro.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.700
It's an understated classy distro

44:36.700 --> 44:39.100
that doesn't go out of its way to be super flashy,

44:39.100 --> 44:40.500
but once you start using it, you're like,

44:40.500 --> 44:42.400
oh, there's some charm here.

44:42.400 --> 44:45.600
It's understated, but there's some charm.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.100
If you haven't hopped to it for a while,

44:47.100 --> 44:48.600
it's worth a visit.

44:48.600 --> 44:49.900
Really, I think it is.

44:49.900 --> 44:51.700
19.3, it's only been out for a little bit,

44:51.700 --> 44:54.600
and so it's gotten some fresh updates now.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.600
The one thing we didn't really talk about much

44:56.600 --> 45:00.200
is the system report tool that they launched,

45:00.200 --> 45:02.800
which will help you if you have like missing language packs

45:02.800 --> 45:05.000
or something's not configured correctly,

45:05.000 --> 45:08.800
and that's also something that is hard to appreciate

45:08.800 --> 45:10.100
when you know how to fix those things,

45:10.100 --> 45:12.800
but I think, you know, this is bringing back those feelings

45:12.800 --> 45:15.000
of like when I was, I wouldn't even call myself a newbie.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.300
I'd been using Linux for a while,

45:16.300 --> 45:20.300
but I just didn't understand the Linux desktop, you know?

45:20.300 --> 45:21.800
Like I could do change, you know,

45:21.800 --> 45:22.900
move around the command line,

45:22.900 --> 45:24.700
but there's a lot going on in Dbus,

45:24.700 --> 45:27.300
all the things that make up the Linux desktop,

45:27.300 --> 45:29.000
and you're right, just having things that are friendly,

45:29.000 --> 45:30.900
that pop up, that sort of say like,

45:30.900 --> 45:33.500
look, we got this, there's a way that you can do it.

45:33.500 --> 45:34.600
We'll make it easy.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.400
So check it out.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.300
It doesn't have to be a new users-only distro.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.100
I think it's for people that have used Linux for years,

45:41.100 --> 45:43.200
but just want a nice work environment.

45:43.200 --> 45:44.400
What's that for you, Mumble Room?

45:44.400 --> 45:46.600
I'm curious, anybody want to chime in with their workhorse

45:46.600 --> 45:47.900
distribution of choice?

45:47.900 --> 45:49.700
Neon, without a doubt.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.000
Steve says Neon for sure.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Neon has been really solid, I agree.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.200
What about you, Byte?

45:54.200 --> 45:55.000
Budgie.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.400
Oh, Budgie, very nice.

45:57.400 --> 45:58.300
I could definitely see that.

45:58.300 --> 45:59.500
Tech Mav, do you have one?

45:59.500 --> 46:01.400
I'm on Neon on the main rig,

46:01.400 --> 46:06.300
and then on the hybrid pro, I'm using Manjaro with i3.

46:06.300 --> 46:08.300
What a showing for Neon.

46:08.300 --> 46:09.600
Yeah.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
Yeah, have you all been doing it

46:10.600 --> 46:12.400
since the Plasma Challenge forever ago,

46:12.400 --> 46:14.700
or is it just something you stumbled upon recently?

46:14.700 --> 46:16.300
I've been on Neon for quite some time.

46:16.300 --> 46:19.800
I have, it's rare I switch away from it.

46:19.800 --> 46:20.700
That's great.

46:20.700 --> 46:21.900
Plasma Challenge for me.

46:21.900 --> 46:23.300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:23.300 --> 46:25.900
Yeah, since you reviewed it, I've been using it since then.

46:25.900 --> 46:28.200
Yeah, it has, it's stuck with a lot of people.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.900
And one of these machines in the studio is still Neon too.

46:30.900 --> 46:33.400
I just can't keep track anymore.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.200
Tyler, what about you?

46:34.200 --> 46:36.100
Do you have a workhorse distro of choice?

46:36.100 --> 46:38.700
I run Kubuntu on both my machines,

46:38.700 --> 46:41.700
but it's so customized that if I need something quick

46:41.700 --> 46:44.600
and ready to go, I'll actually go with Ubuntu Gnome.

46:44.600 --> 46:45.800
Sure, sure.

46:45.800 --> 46:49.500
Am I mistaken, or has everybody said Plasma

46:49.500 --> 46:53.800
with the exception of i3 as the primary driver?

46:53.800 --> 46:54.700
I think everybody had like-

46:54.700 --> 46:55.200
Wow.

46:55.200 --> 46:56.100
Yeah.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.000
Whoa.

46:57.000 --> 46:57.900
No.

46:57.900 --> 46:58.300
No?

46:58.300 --> 46:59.900
Okay, well, oh, Budgie, right, Budgie.

46:59.900 --> 47:00.700
Budgie, yeah.

47:00.700 --> 47:01.900
Right, right, Budgie, head Budgie.

47:01.900 --> 47:03.900
You know, Tyler's comment there does kind of make me think,

47:03.900 --> 47:06.500
one thing we didn't list here in Cinnamon's favor

47:06.500 --> 47:10.400
is much like Gnome, you can just work with the defaults.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.200
I mean, you customize it a little bit,

47:12.200 --> 47:13.600
but I don't even think you need to, right?

47:13.600 --> 47:15.300
Like if you just needed to get some work done.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.900
Yeah, and I like GTK apps too.

47:17.900 --> 47:21.300
They look good, and the theming's well done.

47:21.300 --> 47:23.300
I like how much you don't want to let yourself admit that.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.700
Well, it's because I do like Plasma,

47:25.700 --> 47:26.800
and I love stupid QT.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.900
You can like both.

47:27.900 --> 47:30.300
I do, and that's my problem,

47:30.300 --> 47:32.300
is I'm torn between lovers.

47:32.300 --> 47:33.700
As soon as I spend too much time with one,

47:33.700 --> 47:34.900
the other says they're getting jealous, Wes.

47:34.900 --> 47:35.900
And most have a lot of needs.

47:35.900 --> 47:39.300
Yeah, they do, including resources, I tell you what.

47:39.300 --> 47:41.000
Anyways, that's it for today, I think.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.300
I think that's all we'll have on Mint.

47:43.300 --> 47:45.700
It was nice to visit it again.

47:45.700 --> 47:47.900
Any thoughts you think we should revisit maybe

47:47.900 --> 47:49.300
in like another two releases or something?

47:49.300 --> 47:50.400
We shouldn't let it go so long.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.100
Right.

47:51.100 --> 47:54.100
No, I think the next major version at least,

47:54.100 --> 47:57.500
or maybe the next time there's a release of the Debian version.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.300
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's sooner than later.

47:59.300 --> 48:01.700
I wouldn't mind looking at the Debian version, actually.

48:01.700 --> 48:03.900
We'll put that on the possibility list.

48:03.900 --> 48:06.000
You know, the only challenge with that

48:06.000 --> 48:08.800
is we're coming up on Fest season, hardcore.

48:08.800 --> 48:12.500
Fest season 2004 is right around the corner.

48:12.500 --> 48:15.100
Right now, we are in the early stage.

48:15.100 --> 48:18.000
Well, just past early stages.

48:18.000 --> 48:18.700
Mid-early.

48:18.700 --> 48:21.800
Mid-early planning stages of Linux Fest Northwest.

48:21.800 --> 48:24.100
I have been looking at barbecue rentals.

48:24.100 --> 48:28.600
So I found for like a hundred and something bucks,

48:28.600 --> 48:30.400
you can get a three-day rental.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.100
It might be a hundred and something bucks a day.

48:32.100 --> 48:36.600
And you can get a three-day rental of a big, long barbecue.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.800
And I'm thinking that's the way to go.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.000
That seems right.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.500
Are we going to need to get like a whole pig then, too?

48:42.500 --> 48:44.900
Oh, man, or at least a lot of brats.

48:44.900 --> 48:46.400
You know, get a lot of brats in there

48:46.400 --> 48:49.800
and get them up to that front of the line.

48:49.800 --> 48:51.400
And we just got the new batteries installed.

48:51.400 --> 48:52.500
So we were off last week.

48:52.500 --> 48:54.800
While you were gallivanting around electrifying yourself.

48:54.800 --> 48:55.400
Yeah.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.800
Got 600 amp hours of lithium ion batteries installed

48:58.800 --> 49:02.100
and 1.2 kilowatts of solar installed on the roof.

49:02.100 --> 49:03.100
That's so cool.

49:03.100 --> 49:07.300
So the LadyJoobs is now a mobile battle station,

49:07.300 --> 49:11.100
a mobile workstation with multiple internet connections.

49:11.100 --> 49:13.600
And of course, this is all part of your long-running.

49:13.600 --> 49:17.800
Project Off-Grid, which I've been talking about on Self-Hosted.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.100
And I'll probably talk a little bit on the Chris Lastcast.

49:20.100 --> 49:20.900
Chris Lastcast.

49:20.900 --> 49:23.100
It's a big part of your life.

49:23.100 --> 49:24.000
It is.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.700
It was a very big, very big expense, too.

49:27.700 --> 49:30.000
But holy crap is it cool, Wes.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.400
Like, it's totally off-grid.

49:31.400 --> 49:34.300
Even on a bad Pacific Northwest day,

49:34.300 --> 49:38.300
like right now, when it's snating outside,

49:38.300 --> 49:42.500
I pull in enough solar to run all of my automation

49:42.500 --> 49:46.400
and Raspberry Pis and all of my smart LED lighting systems.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.100
Yeah, isn't that amazing?

49:47.100 --> 49:48.700
I mean, even in the rainy Pacific Northwest,

49:48.700 --> 49:50.200
solar panels have gotten a lot better.

49:50.200 --> 49:50.900
Yeah.

49:50.900 --> 49:56.200
So all of the always-running devices are covered by solar now.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.100
How cool is that?

49:58.100 --> 50:00.300
So I can't wait to talk more about it on Self-Hosted

50:00.300 --> 50:02.100
because something I've been wanting to do

50:02.100 --> 50:04.100
is build a system that ran on Linux.

50:04.100 --> 50:06.400
It could go totally offline so we could go off-grid.

50:06.400 --> 50:09.300
I think you might need to record while you're off-grid.

50:09.300 --> 50:09.800
Oh, yeah.

50:09.800 --> 50:10.500
Test the system.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.000
Oh, yeah.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.900
Totally do a podcast on solar.

50:12.900 --> 50:13.200
Yeah.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.100
Oh, that's got to happen, for sure, Wes.

50:15.100 --> 50:16.600
That's totally got to happen.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.100
Anyways, that'll be in the future.

50:18.100 --> 50:19.500
Check that out, selfhosted.show.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.200
And please let us know your thoughts on the Burnout topic

50:22.200 --> 50:26.900
or anything else we've covered at linuxoneplug.com contact.

50:26.900 --> 50:28.700
Yeah, I'd love to hear some more about how

50:28.700 --> 50:30.400
Linux Mint fits in your life.

50:30.400 --> 50:30.900
Yeah.

50:30.900 --> 50:31.800
It was really helpful.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.400
I appreciate people that took the time

50:33.400 --> 50:34.600
to help explain it to us.

50:34.600 --> 50:38.400
And a note that that Burnout feedback

50:38.400 --> 50:40.600
is best over the contact form so we can collate it.

50:40.600 --> 50:42.000
Because that was the challenge this week

50:42.000 --> 50:43.900
because we were pulling from Twitter and Telegram

50:43.900 --> 50:44.700
for all this stuff.

50:44.700 --> 50:46.200
It was just kind of crazy.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.700
So we'll just make that for the official channel.

50:48.700 --> 50:49.800
Keep an eye on that.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.700
Go get more Wes over at techsnap.systems.

50:52.700 --> 50:54.600
He's rocking over there with Jim Salter.

50:54.600 --> 50:55.400
Rocking it.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.200
And of course, brunch with Brent over at extras.show.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.500
I'm at Chris LAS.

51:00.500 --> 51:01.600
He's at Westpac.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.400
Yeah, that's right.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.000
And the whole network's at Jupiter Signal.

51:04.000 --> 51:04.800
Thanks for being here.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.800
We'll see you next Tuesday.

51:36.800 --> 51:45.760
the unplugged program oh thank you everybody JB titles calm let's go vote

51:45.760 --> 51:51.280
cheese who's here in the chat room just not here on on air because you can't as

51:51.280 --> 51:56.360
if they work while going down the road and they do what is so cool about going

51:56.360 --> 52:02.560
down the road is not only do the panels still charge the bats but the alternator

52:02.560 --> 52:06.780
they upgraded as well so I'm going down the road and I'm putting like three to

52:06.780 --> 52:10.480
four hundred amp hours back into my battery bank as I'm driving that's so

52:10.480 --> 52:15.000
cool so few hours of driving and I'll recharge the entire bank it's pretty

52:15.000 --> 52:22.400
great it's pretty pretty great I've really been just like I've been really

52:22.400 --> 52:25.880
kind of adapting to how how nuts it is to have all this all of a sudden after

52:25.880 --> 52:30.360
so many years of having this RV and not having that bite was asking about the

52:30.360 --> 52:37.920
efficiency of the panels they are 170 watt panels they're tested 184 watts

52:37.920 --> 52:45.240
with a plus minus three percent variance so they just put them at 170 watts and

52:45.240 --> 52:50.040
they're beautiful they are legitimately gorgeous like when I saw them they look

52:50.040 --> 52:56.120
like jewelry and they're made in Bend Oregon oh neat mm-hmm locally made by

52:56.120 --> 53:00.240
Zamp solar you are so much better prepared for like when we have like the

53:00.240 --> 53:04.440
big earthquake this region's overdue or the flooding that's happening in Mount

53:04.440 --> 53:09.320
Vernon right now holy holy crap I've pretty much got all that packed into my

53:09.320 --> 53:13.720
four-wheel drive and can go off-grid for about two weeks Wow oh yeah man that's

53:13.720 --> 53:18.920
that is super super sweet the Raspberry Pi running the whole thing and the kids

53:18.920 --> 53:25.440
can pick up streaming movies from MB with an LTA LTE antenna back to my house

53:25.440 --> 53:29.280
dude we should talk you and I need to talk oh my god we need to like seriously

53:29.280 --> 53:31.880
you need to Chris Chris last cast it up with me because we need to talk about

53:31.880 --> 53:38.840
this this is oh my god this is totally a melee and I am such an idiot that not

53:38.840 --> 53:43.040
only would I like to have a huge RS RV but I'd also love to have like an

53:43.040 --> 53:47.160
off-road like mobile camper too so I'd love to have two different RVs a tiny

53:47.160 --> 53:50.780
one and a big one how the hell would you afford all this you don't that's why I

53:50.780 --> 53:56.480
don't do it perpetually broke yeah I spend way too much money on vehicles

53:56.480 --> 54:01.600
it's it's I have a hard time saying no to lady jupes cuz it's my home it's my

54:01.600 --> 54:06.440
family memory machine it's where I work out of like it's it's kind of your whole

54:06.440 --> 54:11.080
life I don't know why you even have a house I don't I own I own a house but I

54:11.080 --> 54:15.200
don't actually live in it I rent it out to the production I don't actually stay

54:15.200 --> 54:22.960
in studio that does not surprise me even yeah I know yeah that's why I have a

54:22.960 --> 54:29.320
tent with a small solar panel 12 volts and a brick-sized 12-volt battery with

54:29.320 --> 54:34.880
solar charge in between so when I step out of my tent I put the solar panel on

54:34.880 --> 54:38.480
my tent walk out do my thing come back in the

54:38.480 --> 54:43.320
evening put my solar panel back in and I can charge my phone and stuff I used to

54:43.320 --> 54:47.000
have something very similar when I lived in Mississippi because there was this you

54:47.000 --> 54:50.440
know fear of hurricanes and then Hurricane Katrina did happen reinforcing

54:50.440 --> 54:55.280
said fear and so we had you know a number of things for supporting well the

54:55.280 --> 54:59.800
grids gone what do we do when I moved to Connecticut I didn't bring most of that

54:59.800 --> 55:04.240
with me but you're just kind of making me remind myself of all the things that

55:04.240 --> 55:10.080
I should probably have but don't right now yeah I I don't know I am NOT really

55:10.080 --> 55:14.360
doing it in case you know a Zombo pock or something like that but it is nice to

55:14.360 --> 55:18.280
have that you know that kind of insurance like if we have a major

55:18.280 --> 55:22.520
disaster or if I have to leave the junkyard for some reason immediately I'm

55:22.520 --> 55:28.160
not totally so well I still have three backup cellular mobile data connections

55:28.160 --> 55:33.640
that are that have legacy accounts that can actually like lots more data like

55:33.640 --> 55:38.360
and so I have a Verizon hotspot I have two extra T mobile lines that give me

55:38.360 --> 55:44.600
that have legacy accounts that give me way more data and in a pinch I can

55:44.600 --> 55:50.120
actually probably operate without you know wireline infrastructure at all for

55:50.120 --> 55:54.840
including power for about a week because I also have a back I have a UPS that's

55:54.840 --> 55:58.840
got a humongous battery and if I unplug the computer and plug everything else

55:58.840 --> 56:07.200
and it'll last JB titles so it's only that in Australia if you want to go

56:07.200 --> 56:10.200
anywhere you're six hours from anything right you need a little bit of

56:10.200 --> 56:14.060
self-sufficiency this there's no fuel there's no phone connection there's

56:14.060 --> 56:18.500
nothing makes sense so you're okay with this stuff running yeah that that I love

56:18.500 --> 56:23.320
that you have it though in a nice mobile rig that's that's so great spice it with

56:23.320 --> 56:29.400
mint we did minty fresh for the last one right so we got a the mint mindset look

56:29.400 --> 56:35.420
at you busting that out that's not bad that is not bad I like that for some

56:35.420 --> 56:37.720
reason why do I like that someone I don't know I actually did it before we

56:37.720 --> 56:41.720
started the show too so if I remembered what the name of those those Girl Scout

56:41.720 --> 56:46.120
cookies that are with mints in them I would remember what they're called

56:46.120 --> 56:50.160
they're so good though yes thin mints yeah although I don't know if I would

56:50.160 --> 56:56.520
attribute thin with mint necessarily not so thin mints yeah yeah you see thin

56:56.520 --> 57:01.040
mint that's the perfect variant for a thin client it's true it's true I wonder

57:01.040 --> 57:05.160
how that mint box is doing I saw a recent picture of it looks like a nice

57:05.160 --> 57:08.440
little machine it does it's unfortunately grotesquely underpowered

57:08.440 --> 57:15.680
but it is a it is a nice looking machine yeah dang what is this apple it's

57:15.680 --> 57:18.640
horrible all right well I kind of want to go with West's and what let's see how

57:18.640 --> 57:22.000
they because we can't do minty fresh we've done that before everybody loves

57:22.000 --> 57:27.160
minty fresh it's good I mean it's the pun to end puns it is I'm sure that they

57:27.160 --> 57:31.160
get that all can you imagine how often the team must Clem gets so tired when

57:31.160 --> 57:35.360
somebody brings it up I bet this releases the mintiest freshest yet I

57:35.360 --> 57:41.660
mean that must be such oh my gosh cliches are the worst all right let's go

57:41.660 --> 58:06.280
with a boon to 2004 review yes
