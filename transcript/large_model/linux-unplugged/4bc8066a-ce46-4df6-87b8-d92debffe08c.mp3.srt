1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hey Chris, did you see the Gnome Foundation received a whole bunch of money lately?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,560
Yeah, they got $400,000 in total, like $300,000 is going to the foundation and another $100,000 is going to GIMP.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,680
That's awesome. It's all coming from this mysterious handshake.org.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,240
I gotta be honest, Wes, I did not know about handshake.org, I don't think, before I saw this.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,200
Kind of a sleeper project, but it's interesting.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,960
Yeah, it is. It's kind of promising what has always been hoped for, which is decentralized, permissionless naming.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,400
Like DNS and certificate trusts, and it works with DNS in a way.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,880
Put that another way, an experimental peer-to-peer root DNS server.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,440
This is very fascinating and a great idea.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,760
I'd love to know more about them, so we might reach out in the future and have a chat with them, but yeah, this is great.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
Even if we haven't heard about them, that they have this kind of money to slosh around,

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,320
not only seems to benefit us a lot, but does make me think like, okay, what's going on over there?

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,560
Hmm, perhaps this will relate to something else we're going to talk about today.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,240
Strokes the beard randomly.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 261 for August 7th, 2018.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's fully staffed and ready to podcast.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,040
My name is Chris.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,120
My name is Wes.

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
And my name is Brent.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,400
Hello, guys, we have a great show coming up today.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,800
261 is packed full of great community good news, really, including new features that are coming to Linux,

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,840
great news for friends of the show, new features that are surprising even Microsoft,

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,600
and hope for those of us that want to play Windows games on Linux,

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,200
as well as a couple of great apps, an update on our community PeerTube instance,

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,720
and a breakdown of what's got our attention in the new Android Pie release.

26
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,400
That's a ton of stuff this week.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,760
Absolutely packed.

28
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,000
And not only do you have your humble hosts, myself, Wes, and Brent,

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,040
but you have that virtual log, time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

30
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,520
Hello, what's up?

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,720
Greetings, hello.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,920
I don't know if it comes across, but that's a full room this week.

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm excited too, I think they're raring to go.

34
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,760
I'm raring to go, Wes.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,360
Tell you what, I've been out there in the heat, charging myself like Superman,

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
preparing myself to podcast this week,

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,800
because the news has even reached the halls of Microsoft.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,200
It's undeniable the power of developers on Linux.

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:44,520
July ended with 3.97 million starts of PowerShell Core,

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,360
82% of which were all on Linux.

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,880
They were expecting those numbers to be reversed,

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,360
and they thought it would be on Windows 10.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,200
This is from a little birdie tells me that would be in a position to know

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,920
that they were expecting the numbers to be the exact opposite.

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,640
They thought that Linux would be around 20%,

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,320
and Windows 10 would be around 80-ish percent.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,720
I mean, that's how it normally goes.

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,320
And they got the numbers back from the, you know,

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,200
insight metrics that they collect,

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:22,680
and 82% of the PowerShell start instances happened on Linux boxes.

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,480
That's a, I mean, that's Microsoft's own shell, okay?

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,160
I mean, that's why that really gets me.

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,880
It's not like it's Bash, okay?

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,040
It's PowerShell.

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,920
I'm really curious to know what all those people are using it for.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,880
I mean, not that they are not legitimate uses.

57
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm just genuinely interested.

58
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,760
See, I've always had a theory, the whole PowerShell Core coming to Linux thing

59
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,720
was really a gift to system administrators who wanted to use Linux

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,440
and still manage a bunch of Windows boxes.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,920
And I wonder if that's a bit of what's going on here.

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,400
Oh, sure. Yeah, it's your little open source tie-in into that system.

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,560
There's also certain things about PowerShell that are very appealing

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,880
when you compare it to certain other shell environments,

65
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,760
which I am not an expert to get into,

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,800
but we did cover that in a past episode, if people want to know.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,880
I just thought that was a fascinating stat to start with right there.

68
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,520
I also love hearing that 82% of anything is on Linux.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,080
I think that's a really good thing for us.

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,240
That's very true. That is very true.

71
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to give a special shout out to not one,

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
but two fine gentlemen from the Elementary OS Project.

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
Hello to Dan and Cassidy. Good to have you guys here.

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,440
How's it going, Bill?

75
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,280
Guys, I feel like we should start on a journey.

76
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to go on a journey with you guys to talk about where we're at.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,280
But the reason why they're both here, one of the reasons, at least I assume,

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,960
is last week Cassidy announced that after quite a while at System76,

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,480
he is going full time at Elementary OS.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,200
And that's massive.

81
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,480
For anybody who's ever had a side passion project

82
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,400
that they were super committed to,

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,080
there's always been that agony to go full time.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm pretty familiar with that.

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,080
So Cassidy, I'm just super happy for you, man,

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,880
because I can imagine how good that must feel.

87
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
So congratulations.

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,120
Thank you. Yeah, I'm really stoked.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,320
So we are going to get to that,

90
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,240
as well as some other potentially interesting community news.

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,160
But the crew voted,

92
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,840
and we decided to start with just a bit of a TechSnap security notice in a way.

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,720
Really here, it's this vulnerability notice

94
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
for a flaw in the Linux kernel TCP implementation,

95
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,880
which makes it vulnerable to an easy denial of service attack.

96
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,160
Linux kernel versions 4.9 and above can be forced to make a very expensive call

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,720
to the TCP collapse queue and the TCP prune queue calls

98
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,040
for every single incoming packet,

99
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,280
which would lead to a denial of service.

100
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,600
They say can, but of course that would.

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,200
An attacker can induce a denial of service condition

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,120
by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions.

103
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
Maintaining the denial of service condition requires continuous 2A TCP sessions

104
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,880
on a reachable port.

105
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,600
Thus, the attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IPs.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,040
But the impact is a remote attacker may be able to trigger

107
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,920
a denial of service condition against a system with an open port

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,320
and it's on anything above kernel 4.9.

109
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,800
Yeah, that's rough, especially if you're running a server out there on the internet.

110
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,240
It looks like with less than two kilopackets per second of an attack traffic,

111
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,120
you can then just totally, totally load a box, delay all the network traffic.

112
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,880
That's not really good if you are trying to surf webpages.

113
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
This is how podcast wars will be fought in the future

114
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,360
once they become big business franchises.

115
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,840
That's so funny to even think.

116
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,360
The podcast wars, when it's just five podcast companies left,

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,200
they began exploiting old Linux boxes on the internet

118
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,640
with denial of service attacks.

119
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,120
I mean, when you're too busy making podcasts to patch your box,

120
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,960
that's your problem.

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,080
Who can patch?

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,680
Who can patch?

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,080
Anyways, the crew wanted to get you.

124
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,760
The crew being those of us that chatted about it earlier today,

125
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,720
which was a few of us thought, you know what?

126
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
If we're going to talk about this on the show,

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,200
we should probably get it out there in sort of like the more you know kind of thing.

128
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,840
And there's no real workaround except an updated kernel.

129
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,880
So go look for those.

130
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,400
Yeah.

131
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
OK, now here's the news I've been avoiding,

132
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,960
even though it's the beginning of the show,

133
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,640
I've been delaying to get to this point

134
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,560
because I feel like it's going to be perceived as an attack

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,520
and it is not an attack, it is an analysis.

136
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,960
And we start with a piece that was written

137
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,160
about common causes of Fedora workstation crashes

138
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,520
and the fact that they have been traced back to Gnome, Shell,

139
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,280
JavaCrypt extension, JavaScript extensions crashing.

140
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,760
So here's the scenario.

141
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,800
And this is a write up that we'll have linked in the show notes

142
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,200
at linuxunplug.com slash 261 if you would like to read it yourself

143
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,400
or if you've been experiencing some instability issues.

144
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,880
Now this is predominantly the worst on Fedora 28

145
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,160
because it's using Wayland.

146
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
And here's the scenario.

147
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,480
A Gnome shell extension crashes.

148
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,400
That takes out the shell.

149
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
When the shell goes out, it takes out Mutter,

150
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,720
which is the thing that's talking Wayland,

151
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,360
that is the display server, and you lose your entire desktop

152
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,000
because a shell extension crashed.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
That's very upsetting.

154
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,320
And so the developers have started

155
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,960
talking about ways to potentially resolve this issue.

156
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,400
There's been a few different discussions really.

157
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,200
So this isn't any one particular developer's idea.

158
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,880
It's been kicked around a lot, even at this year's Gwadek.

159
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,720
The idea could be to perhaps just sort of enhance

160
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,400
the existing behavior in Gnome Shell

161
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,280
where when it crashes and it comes back,

162
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,680
the shell, when it comes back, all extensions are disabled.

163
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,480
And it is up to the user to sort of go through and play

164
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,800
Russian roulette and re-enable their extensions

165
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
until they get to the thing that crashes.

166
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,440
Of course, we all know in the real world,

167
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,800
you don't crash immediately often.

168
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,160
It's a day or two later.

169
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,360
So it's really hard to actually figure out which one it is,

170
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,920
even if you're checking the logs.

171
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,560
But that's sort of the most easy course to take

172
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,600
is you just sort of change the way

173
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,880
the shell crash behavior works.

174
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,520
Another possibility that has been considered

175
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,200
is decoupling Gnome Shell and Mutter.

176
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
But obviously, that would require major architecture

177
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
changes, something we've talked about on this show before,

178
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,960
and also likely changes in the way extensions behave

179
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,440
and the creation of some sort of IPC communication

180
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
system in the background.

181
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,360
Then there's a third proposal, perhaps in some ways

182
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,960
the easiest proposal, but the most controversial proposal.

183
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,120
And that's discontinuing unlimited extensions,

184
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,880
introducing a limited API they can use.

185
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,600
Instead of hot patching, because this is how it works right now,

186
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,800
like the old Mac OS Classic extensions that literally hot

187
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,240
patched Mac Classic, right now extensions on Gnome Shell

188
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,040
are hot patching the Gnome Shell code itself.

189
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,440
Obviously, this is risky.

190
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,040
And if you introduced an API that the extensions could use,

191
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,160
and you could even limit that API,

192
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,920
it would mean that basically all of the existing extensions

193
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,120
would have to be completely re-implemented,

194
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,680
and likely some of their feature sets

195
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,920
that they take advantage of now, because they can just

196
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,680
insert themselves into the code of the shell,

197
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,040
they would lose that access, and that functionality

198
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,160
would be gone.

199
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,120
So this is a difficult point that Gnome is approaching.

200
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,440
And they're not necessarily taking any action right now.

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,480
These are just things that they're concerned about.

202
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,560
And there's also a conversation at the same time.

203
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,280
And again, just discussions.

204
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,160
And this is how this is supposed to work.

205
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,120
And we should give them the space and the room

206
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,600
to make these discussions.

207
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,080
But also ongoing right now are discussions

208
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,680
around removing the theme capability from Gnome.

209
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm going to let that sit in for a second.

210
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,320
One theme, their theme.

211
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,560
No more custom distro themes.

212
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,040
And that's a big one.

213
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,000
Think about how Canonical sort of makes their Gnome shell

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,600
theirs.

215
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,480
Fedora puts their touch on it as well.

216
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,080
Everybody does.

217
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,600
And that's sort of a kind of distinguishing feature

218
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,800
of Gnome 3 in a way.

219
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
And really that distinguishing choice

220
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,160
is one of the standout features of the Linux desktop,

221
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,400
to have to have that level of choice.

222
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,680
But I have seen what an absolute shit show that code really is.

223
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
You're hot patching CSS.

224
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,440
You're going in there, and you're yanking out

225
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,520
lines of code in CSS and putting in new ones.

226
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,080
And then you're reloading the shell

227
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,360
and seeing what the hell happens if the shell even loads again.

228
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,960
That's how you create a Gnome shell theme.

229
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,840
And the way anybody gets it done right now is they fork.

230
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
That's why everybody forks themes now.

231
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,480
Because so much of that super crazy ass hard initial work

232
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,520
has been done.

233
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,080
So people are just building on top of other themes now.

234
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,800
Because you got to kind of be a masochist

235
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,520
to go back and do that to yourself.

236
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,000
And I watched somebody do it at a canonical event.

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,480
Let me tell you, that was one of the things that,

238
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,600
I'm not joking, made me switch to Plasma.

239
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,440
When I saw how that was being done, I completely lost faith.

240
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,160
And that was one of the things that made me switch to Plasma.

241
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,720
When I saw that, I went, holy shit.

242
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,160
So I can understand why they would

243
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,400
want to get rid of that functionality entirely.

244
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,880
Not only that, but it creates consistency

245
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
for developers.

246
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,760
And it solves security potentially and stability

247
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
issues potentially.

248
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,280
And it solves a problem they call visual fragmentation,

249
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,180
which sounds just great.

250
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,000
Across the Gnome desktop ecosystem

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
exists visual fragmentation.

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,520
And it's very real.

253
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,720
And it's a problem for app developers.

254
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,440
Since very few distributions ship Gnome as is,

255
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,760
it's hard to determine what visual identity Gnome is.

256
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
And therefore, it's difficult to know what visual system

257
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,680
to build your applications for.

258
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,740
The biggest offenders continue to be downstream projects

259
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,340
that theme Gnome extensively by overriding the default icons

260
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,320
and style sheets and insist that part of their own brand

261
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,480
identity.

262
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,600
But so long as that practice carries on,

263
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,440
this fragmentation will continue.

264
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,040
Now, I thought to myself, holy crap.

265
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
That would be a massive change.

266
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,200
And I was really curious to know what won Mr. Daniel

267
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,240
Ford, I thought.

268
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,720
So I went to his Twitter feed.

269
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,520
And he says, you have to think about the fact

270
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,720
that Gtk, I should say, Gtk+, is used outside of Gnome.

271
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,520
And that right there, I think, brings

272
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,960
this whole thing into perspective

273
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,000
is it really underscores how in the bag Gtk is, Gtk+,

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
that toolkit is, for Gnome.

275
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,000
It really is the Gnome Shell desktop toolkit.

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,760
And what do you think about this entire proposal, Dan?

277
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,340
Do you think it's going to go anywhere?

278
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,040
Do you think it's just sort of skunkworks talk right now?

279
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,640
Or are you concerned this may actually

280
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,800
progress into something that could

281
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,680
be difficult for elementary OS to deal with?

282
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,200
Because I would have to imagine you guys really

283
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,960
rely on these mechanisms quite a bit

284
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,880
to create the elementary look.

285
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,200
So we actually went out to Guadec.

286
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,880
And we participated in the talk, the theming kind of discussion

287
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,200
API overall talk.

288
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,880
The takeaway is that there's a lot of different parties

289
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,360
that have competing interests.

290
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
There's Gnome as a platform.

291
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,560
There are other Gtk platforms like elementary.

292
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:34,040
There are Gnome downstreams like Ubuntu and Pop OS.

293
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,680
We have app developers.

294
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,640
And we have users.

295
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,920
And they all have different things they care about.

296
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,520
And the kind of overarching theme of the discussion

297
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,500
is, how can we make everyone happy?

298
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,440
And I don't think that there's anyone

299
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
on the either inside or outside of Gnome

300
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,800
that wants to introduce a sweeping change that's

301
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,080
going to make any of these parties really upset.

302
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,120
I think we're all trying to work together.

303
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,800
And the kind of overarching idea that came out of that talk

304
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,800
was, we need to make it easier for downstreams from Gnome

305
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,240
to write style sheets that are fully compatible with Adwaita

306
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,680
so they can keep doing their branding

307
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,160
without adding an extra burden for developers.

308
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,080
So is that your way of saying something's going to change,

309
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,600
but it probably won't be the end of the world for people

310
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,880
that want to have their own downstream identity?

311
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,580
I'm not necessarily sure something

312
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,280
will change as far as the internals of Gtk.

313
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,360
But I think that in terms of more and better documentation

314
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
or more and better tooling.

315
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,760
Oh, OK, I follow you.

316
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,520
That would be a really positive development.

317
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,200
Yeah, so I think that everybody wants

318
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,920
to make sure that everybody's freedoms are still

319
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,880
preserved, right?

320
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,400
It's a real pain for developers if we start locking down

321
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,760
things, because then it makes our development environment

322
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,880
hostile, right?

323
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,000
That's not fun.

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,560
So nobody really wants to do that.

325
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,800
We want to make sure that third-party developers have

326
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,760
a stable and consistent platform to target.

327
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,280
So if they choose to write an app for GNOME,

328
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,140
that it works how GNOME apps should work.

329
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,320
And if they choose to write an app for elementary,

330
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,040
that it works how elementary apps should work.

331
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
We just want to make sure that our developers have

332
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
something sane to target.

333
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,120
And it seems that the way to do that

334
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,140
is to make it easy for people to write

335
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,160
style sheets that are compatible with Adwaita or style

336
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,400
sheets that are more compatible with elementary OS.

337
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,120
All right, OK.

338
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,640
So you've convinced me I won't be making a prediction

339
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,760
at the end of the year that elementary OS announces

340
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,680
the switch to Qt in 2020.

341
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,700
So OK, all right, I'm convinced for now.

342
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,640
So do you have any other comments or thoughts

343
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,280
on this story?

344
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,880
I know one of their concerns was visual fragmentation.

345
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,580
Do you have any thoughts about that

346
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,140
as an issue for the GNOME desktop?

347
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,340
You have your Ubuntu look now.

348
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,440
You got your Fedora look now.

349
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,840
SUSE looks a certain way.

350
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Antigros looks there a certain way.

351
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,140
They all are shipping a GNOME shell,

352
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,440
but they all do look a little different.

353
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Even the way they function is a bit different

354
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,480
due to different extension implementations

355
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,600
or lack thereof in some cases.

356
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,820
Do you have any thoughts on that particular concern

357
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,880
just as GNOME shell as a brand, as an identity itself?

358
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,120
Yeah, I think that people who try

359
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,740
to make the conversation about branding

360
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,480
like don't understand the problem.

361
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,000
It's not about branding at all.

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,800
And people try to get down on designers

363
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,960
and talk about control.

364
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,160
And it's not really about control either.

365
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,320
The thing is, when we started that discussion,

366
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,400
everybody in the room had an example

367
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
of an application on their computer

368
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,280
that was broken because it was developed against a style

369
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,800
sheet that they weren't running.

370
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,720
And so that's what the problem is that's trying to be solved.

371
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,200
It's not necessarily about branding.

372
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,760
Like, yeah, Ubuntu wants to have their brand, but it's also

373
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,300
about trying to make a good experience.

374
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,160
Yeah, it isn't about trying to take away people's ability

375
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,040
or enforce a brand or anything like that.

376
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,360
It's about making sure that applications aren't broken

377
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,600
is what we all care about.

378
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
A fundamental level of consistency

379
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
so that you actually have a platform.

380
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,720
Yeah, we just want you to load an application

381
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,560
and not have a spinner that's crazy huge

382
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,080
or text that's invisible.

383
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,920
Or style sheets are super powerful,

384
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,640
and they can make your app look really crappy.

385
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,800
And then developers get complaints from users.

386
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
And then they're like, hey, what the hell?

387
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,560
You changed the style sheet that I built my app against,

388
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,600
and now it doesn't work.

389
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,600
And we're trying to make people happy,

390
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,160
and it's a super hard problem.

391
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,800
Yeah, Pobi, I don't know about you,

392
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,880
but I feel like I've seen this movie before.

393
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,080
It kind of goes something like this.

394
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,420
Hey, here's an idea, and then the internet freaks out.

395
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,440
You're going to take away my toy.

396
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,880
And then it kind of ends up being not quite as big of a deal

397
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,960
as everybody expected it.

398
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
Do you think that's what's happening here,

399
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
or do you think this could be a major shift?

400
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,440
Considering the talk about extensions, too.

401
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,880
So this is one of the pitfalls of us

402
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,120
doing open source development.

403
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,400
You can imagine that there are massive bun fights

404
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,160
inside Apple and inside Google and inside Microsoft

405
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,200
when they're talking about their OSs.

406
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,920
And all the relevant parties and all the people

407
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,560
who have vested interest in whatever that feature is

408
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,200
will all be discussing this.

409
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,680
And then it comes to a conclusion,

410
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,700
and a decision is made, and the solution is published.

411
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,360
Whereas with open source, you have

412
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,160
people who have different vested interests

413
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,680
from different parties, like Dan and Cassidy

414
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,720
from Elementary and people from Endless

415
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,040
and people from Canonical and people from Red Hat,

416
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,600
all getting together and discussing this stuff in the open.

417
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,320
And when there's a whole load of peanut gallery outside

418
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,240
who are getting snippets of conversations from one party,

419
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,560
from one side of the conversation,

420
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,160
and then rebroadcasting that, it doesn't help,

421
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,440
because everyone has a slightly different perspective.

422
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,160
Dan has a different perspective than I would, I'm sure.

423
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,200
So yeah, it's totally exactly.

424
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,240
What's the name of that gal who went and observed

425
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,480
the monkeys forever?

426
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
What was that gal?

427
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
She fell in love with a monkey.

428
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,160
She loved a monkey.

429
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,400
What was that?

430
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:01,760
Come on.

431
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,040
Come on.

432
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,160
That's Jane Goodall.

433
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,640
Yeah.

434
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:03,840
Yeah.

435
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,320
Thank you, Brent.

436
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,200
Yeah.

437
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
Yeah, I feel like that's got to be our approach with this stuff.

438
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,220
We can get the binoculars out.

439
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,640
We can get ourselves a fancy jungle suit

440
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,920
and all that kind of stuff.

441
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,960
But we only can really observe.

442
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
We can only observe here.

443
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,120
The process is the process.

444
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,920
They will go through whatever process that is.

445
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,960
And we just happen to get to watch it.

446
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,720
And it's a neat opportunity for us, especially for podcasters.

447
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,840
But it is a really hard line to walk,

448
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,920
because taking away themes and taking away extensions

449
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,200
causes an emotional reaction.

450
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,520
And then you want to respond to that.

451
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,680
So I think it's a, my point is it's just,

452
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,140
I think sometimes these things start somewhere

453
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,040
that can be scary to the end user in a degree.

454
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,800
And I don't mean to say that to belittle people,

455
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,760
but it is kind of like a, it's a jarring thing.

456
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,800
Maybe that's a better word.

457
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,480
It's jarring to the end user.

458
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,240
I don't know.

459
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
I think part of your observation,

460
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,940
like the fact that we can observe what's going on, yes,

461
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,440
we can.

462
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,280
But it's open source.

463
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,680
You could also get involved.

464
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,720
There's nothing stopping someone doing a Google Summer of Code

465
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,000
project to isolate and separate out extensions

466
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,320
or build something that does some validation of extensions

467
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,400
or captures the trace of an extension

468
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
at the point when it falls over or something.

469
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,640
There's plenty of opportunities to improve what we have.

470
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,440
It doesn't have to be, well, we're

471
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,880
going to have to throw this away.

472
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,960
There's an opportunity, because it's open source,

473
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,120
for people to get involved.

474
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,000
But it's difficult when there's lots of parties.

475
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,560
Yeah, OK.

476
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,440
So just, we don't have to spend a lot more time on this.

477
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,400
But while I have your ear, one more question to you

478
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,320
is, wouldn't we be better off if it was all just one look

479
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,520
and one standard and it was sort of the way Windows and Mac

480
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,040
are?

481
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm not saying I want it that way.

482
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,880
But I am saying, if your goal is to attract more developers

483
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,800
and more end users, wouldn't that be better?

484
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,680
I don't know, would it?

485
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,760
I mean, which project gets to decide

486
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,200
what that one look would be?

487
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,360
Well, the Gnome project.

488
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,920
Right.

489
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,040
And maybe other people have, so long

490
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,320
as there's a feedback loop there that

491
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,760
allows people who are consumers of the work

492
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,160
that the Gnome project do to feedback.

493
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,200
And there is at Guardec, and there are mailing lists,

494
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
and there's IRC, and all kinds of ways to feedback to Gnome

495
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,680
to say, hey, look, that's not working.

496
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,880
We need to do something else.

497
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,520
That's exactly what is happening now,

498
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,800
is this extension thing isn't working.

499
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,160
This theme thing isn't working.

500
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,400
People are providing feedback.

501
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,080
It doesn't have to be, yeah, they

502
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,440
could come up with one theme.

503
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,320
But consumers would decide whether that's a good theme

504
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,600
or not, really, and you'd find out.

505
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,640
And this is part of the process.

506
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,960
As much as we sometimes, you and I hate it,

507
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,720
but it is part of the process just to watch

508
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,440
and see where they go and talk about it a little bit,

509
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,680
I think it is worth exploring.

510
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,240
I think it's worth exploring the way they do extensions.

511
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,920
I think they're a reasonable way to extend a desktop when

512
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,520
you have a team that does have limited resources.

513
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,000
I mean, they did just get some money,

514
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,840
but it's only going to last them so long.

515
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,320
And development takes time and money.

516
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,480
It takes years.

517
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,680
So when you have those realities,

518
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,000
extensions bypass that, and you don't

519
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,620
have to wait on that core team to bring

520
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,960
in functionality to the desktop.

521
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,440
So I think they have merit.

522
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,760
And ironically, I'm sure just totally coincidentally,

523
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,040
really, there was a post on how the Plasma project does

524
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
their extensions.

525
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,640
Is that right?

526
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,560
Yeah, and it was, you'd be surprised to learn

527
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,520
it may be technically superior.

528
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,720
Yeah, surprise, surprise, spoiler alert.

529
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,920
And anyways, this conversation goes on.

530
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,040
And I say, let's all just wait and see.

531
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,800
Don't worry.

532
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,040
And these developers are also users of the desktop.

533
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,920
They're not going to break their own desktop.

534
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,640
So we'll see where this goes.

535
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,980
I actually am really happy to see them asking

536
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,180
some of these hard questions.

537
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,360
I cover it more on Coder Radio this week.

538
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,520
Not safe for work, in a not safe for work way,

539
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,400
just as a warning to you if you want to go listen to it.

540
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,040
And I think this is a technical debt

541
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,160
that Gnome has needed to pay off for a long time.

542
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,660
And now they're looking at that bill and going, OK, right.

543
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,520
So how are we actually going to pay for this?

544
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,480
What solution do we want to implement?

545
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,400
What pain are we willing to endure?

546
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,280
And that's the conversation's beginning.

547
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,680
And it's a necessary one.

548
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
So I'm all for it.

549
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,000
I think that's where this is leading.

550
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,520
It just starts at a place where it may startle you a little bit.

551
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,720
It may be a bit jarring.

552
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,000
Right, and as always, we see the parts

553
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,360
that bubble up into the surface of drama.

554
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,960
And work continues all the while.

555
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,160
Yeah, no kidding, right?

556
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,840
Yeah.

557
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Speaking of work continuing, so Mr. Cassidy joins us.

558
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,440
He's here as now a full-time employee of Elementary OS.

559
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,360
Normally, I would say Cassidy James is here from System 76,

560
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,200
and he works over at Elementary OS.

561
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,360
But now I say, formerly of System 76,

562
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,200
now joining us on the show is Mr. Cassidy James

563
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,360
of Elementary OS.

564
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,320
Hey, how's it going?

565
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,760
Hey, congratulations.

566
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,960
So I grok that the project was the benefactor

567
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,480
of a recent contribution.

568
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
And you guys must have looked at the numbers

569
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,520
and said, hey, I think I can make that work full time.

570
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,080
Is that essentially what happened?

571
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,960
Yeah, I mean, it's multiple things

572
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,920
that came together kind of all at once.

573
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,200
We've had great success with OS purchases from the website,

574
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,120
app purchases from App Center, and other avenues

575
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,900
like Patreon and Bounty Source.

576
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,920
And then on top of that, we had a really generous person

577
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,800
from the community, from the elementary community,

578
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,040
who liked what we were doing and reached out and said,

579
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,760
hey, I'd like to help you guys out.

580
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,560
What can I do?

581
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,360
And we worked with them and just figured out

582
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,680
that bringing another person on full time

583
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,440
was the right thing at the right time, and that's me.

584
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,920
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

585
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,840
Congratulations.

586
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,340
Huge.

587
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:53,840
Thank you.

588
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,800
Super exciting.

589
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,040
And I think you guys, one of the reasons I love it

590
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,200
is, first of all, both you and Daniel

591
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,380
obviously super committed to the project here.

592
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,840
And you have a good product.

593
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,600
I have my son on it still, and it's just been a solid product.

594
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,640
It's a good product.

595
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,680
I think what you guys have needed is more execute power.

596
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Let me tell you, somebody who is in that same exact position,

597
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,080
I think that's what you've needed.

598
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,360
And bringing you on gives the project more power

599
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,760
to execute on certain things.

600
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,040
So it sounds like some of those things,

601
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
because you call them out in your blog,

602
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,560
is spending time with app developers and other parties

603
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,200
to keep elementary OS financially sustainable.

604
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,680
So that sort of came across to me as a bit vague.

605
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,240
Essentially, what I read from that

606
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,760
is you're going to do a little developer advocacy,

607
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,900
try to maybe reach out to a few developers

608
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,960
and convince them to bring their application over to elementary.

609
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,440
Am I interpreting that right?

610
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah.

611
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,420
So there's really three areas of focus

612
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,760
I've had over the past few years and looking

613
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,560
to continue focusing on those areas.

614
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,720
It's the writing and communicating with people.

615
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,040
We do monthly App Center spotlights on our medium,

616
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,200
monthly progress reports of development.

617
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,320
We do developer tips, articles, things like that.

618
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,960
So writing, I love to write.

619
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,980
And Dan and I both tag team on the Medium site quite a bit.

620
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,760
So that's one way of outreaching to developers.

621
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,120
But then there's also the more direct interaction

622
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,800
with developers.

623
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,200
That's helping people bring their apps to App Center,

624
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,320
focusing on the developer experience of App Center

625
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,480
dashboard itself.

626
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,940
Those areas are really interesting,

627
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,240
and I haven't had as much time to focus on them.

628
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,740
And so it's great to be full time now

629
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,120
being able to focus on that.

630
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,560
And then the third thing, which is

631
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,120
I've always been doing with elementary,

632
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,720
is design guidance and input, obviously.

633
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,800
Work on the human interface guidelines, sketches.

634
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,500
Something I've started doing more recently

635
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,880
is organization-wide projects to improve the overall experience.

636
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,440
So it's kind of a scattershot, and it's kind of all over.

637
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,720
But that's kind of what's exciting about it,

638
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,280
is that I'm pretty deeply involved

639
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,800
in different parts of elementary.

640
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,040
And now being able to focus full time on that, I think,

641
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,360
means a lot more meaningful results from that.

642
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,160
Yeah, and you may find you start digging in on something,

643
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,240
and you get a lot of traction there.

644
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,160
And that's something you'll have flexibility

645
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
to dedicate time to now.

646
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,680
Whereas before, it would have been like, well,

647
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,000
how the hell am I ever going to be able to pull that off?

648
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,720
Exactly.

649
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,620
There's one in there that we haven't really talked about.

650
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,320
And I bet you're not going to tell me much,

651
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,200
but I just got to ask, dedicate time

652
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,040
to working with OEMs with an S.

653
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
What was that about?

654
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,800
So this is something I've been doing on the side.

655
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,120
There's several OEMs out there who ship elementary OS

656
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,800
as an option.

657
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,560
I think, what is it?

658
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,600
Tuxedo computers.

659
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,440
There's one called Obsidian.

660
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,200
There's Slimbook that you can order elementary OS on.

661
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,960
And I've been talking with them, obviously,

662
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,360
because we're really interested in getting their feedback

663
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,920
as an OEM.

664
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,320
That's a really unique perspective

665
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,360
where you're directly interacting with customers,

666
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,760
paying customers of hardware who are paying $1,000 or however

667
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,200
much for a computer.

668
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,680
So I haven't had the time personally

669
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,440
to dedicate to that in the past, but being

670
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,200
able to actually interact with them and talk to them about it

671
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,040
would be a great thing, I think, for everybody,

672
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,520
for people who want to purchase a computer with elementary

673
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,240
preloaded.

674
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,000
Right.

675
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,200
I hope to see that expand.

676
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,440
That'd be really cool.

677
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,920
All right.

678
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,560
So let's get Dan in here for a second.

679
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,640
So Dan, I mean, obviously, you and Cassidy are friends,

680
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,720
but there must have been other people you could hire.

681
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,840
So what made you think Cassidy was the right one

682
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,640
with some limited resources?

683
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,280
You got time.

684
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,520
You got some flexibility now.

685
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,980
All of a sudden, this guy comes in.

686
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,120
He says, hey, if I can help out somehow.

687
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
Was it specifically, but you have to hire Cassidy?

688
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,000
Or was it your thought, no, you know what?

689
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,960
This is the way to go.

690
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,000
This is the right call.

691
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,960
So we've had a lot of internal discussions

692
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,260
about what kind of skill set should our next hire have.

693
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,640
And there's been a lot of talk about, well,

694
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,720
they need to be a developer.

695
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,960
Or, well, maybe we need somebody who is good at marketing.

696
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,760
Or, well, maybe we need another designer,

697
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,280
because our design team has so many things that we just

698
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,440
don't have time to get to.

699
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,400
And our developers are making it up,

700
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,440
and we're stacking technical debt, right?

701
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

702
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,040
And so there's all these conversations about,

703
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,880
who should our next hire be, and what should they be good at?

704
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,600
And kind of the beautiful thing about hiring Cass

705
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,080
is he'll never admit it, but he's great at everything.

706
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,160
Cass is an amazing UX designer.

707
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,320
Cass actually is a developer, and he has published a couple

708
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,960
apps in App Center.

709
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,800
You see all of his blog posts on our blog.

710
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,560
He helps me manage all of our social media accounts.

711
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,720
He's really good at putting people together.

712
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,920
He has all this great insider knowledge

713
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,560
of how a hardware company works.

714
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,600
He's kind of this amalgam of knowledge of everything.

715
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,240
It's a really, really great opportunity

716
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,880
to be able to hire him on, to be honest.

717
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,720
Yeah, I think so.

718
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,280
And the man grows a good beard, too, which never hurts.

719
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,000
That doesn't hurt.

720
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,320
Plus 10 hireability right there.

721
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah, yeah.

722
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,920
So Cassie, are you going to stay in the Colorado area,

723
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,400
or what are your plans long term?

724
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,720
Are you going to move out to the coast,

725
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,920
or are you going to stay put?

726
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,840
Well, I'm pretty rooted here in Denver, Colorado.

727
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,520
I love it here.

728
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,800
My family vacationed here growing up almost every year,

729
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
so I really love it here.

730
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,260
So I'm planning on staying here.

731
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,680
My wife has a job out here as well,

732
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,880
so we're pretty rooted here.

733
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,840
I know Dan has been lightweight looking at apartments

734
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,440
and things in the Denver area, so that

735
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,560
might be an interesting move at some point.

736
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,320
We'll have to see.

737
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,840
Yeah, that's not a bad idea, Dan.

738
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,920
Although right now, you're kind of on my route

739
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,080
for certain places I go, so we get

740
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,920
to hang out from time to time.

741
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,320
I'd be a little disappointed, but I could make a trip

742
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,240
to Denver, I suppose.

743
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,880
Then I get to hang out with both of you guys, so.

744
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,800
And then you'd be there with System76, too.

745
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,280
Yeah.

746
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,760
Exactly.

747
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,480
Now it's a party.

748
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Now that would definitely be a party.

749
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,640
I'll bring the fish.

750
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,280
It'll be a good time.

751
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,880
All right, guys.

752
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,280
Well, congrats to both of you.

753
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,160
I think it's going to be really good for the project.

754
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,920
Looking forward to the new release, too.

755
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
I mean, think about it.

756
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,660
The future releases with both of you

757
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,160
there working on that kind of stuff.

758
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,120
And I hope you find a path to sustainability,

759
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,780
so that way this position remains.

760
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,200
It's something you can keep doing, Cassidy,

761
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,480
because I think that'd be really great, too.

762
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,920
Obviously, for not just you, but for the project as well.

763
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,280
So everybody go, when the new release comes out,

764
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,440
put a little dollar amount in there for Cassidy

765
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,440
and for Daniel for the whole project, because.

766
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,720
Keep this gravy train coming.

767
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,580
Yeah, well, at least keep food on their plates, I suppose.

768
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,620
Speaking of keeping foods on plates,

769
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,160
why don't we do a little food keeping here for the program?

770
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,240
do.co slash unplugged.

771
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,160
You can go there and get a $100 credit for the Digital Ocean

772
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,800
platform.

773
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,680
Infrastructure on demand in less than 55 seconds.

774
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,120
You can build and deploy a lot in 60 days with a $100 credit.

775
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,520
So go to do.co slash unplugged.

776
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,160
I'm trying to come up with a new way to describe Digital Ocean.

777
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,240
Do you have anything that comes to mind?

778
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,720
Because I can say it's like super crazy fast,

779
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,560
all SSD-based infrastructure that you can spin up on demand.

780
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,800
That is accurate, yeah.

781
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,480
But I feel like I need something new.

782
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,520
Some spice?

783
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,920
Yeah, something to change it up.

784
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,760
You know what I mean?

785
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,960
Like something that has a beat, something that's exciting,

786
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,360
something that's fresher than me.

787
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,200
Because I feel like we could use a little freshness.

788
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,280
I don't know.

789
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,440
I'll tell you what, I'll just mix a little something live.

790
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,080
Oh, you've got a little secret sauce for us?

791
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,480
Yeah, you just play backup, OK?

792
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,200
You do my backups.

793
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,600
Digital Ocean's cloud computing platform

794
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,960

Man, you nailed that, Wes.

817
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,600
Good job, dude.

818
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,760
I know what I'm doing.

819
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,320
So also, just to give you a mention,

820
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,840
they have a new guide up they posted a couple days ago

821
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,640
by using a CDN to speed up static content delivery.

822
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,680
And when you look at the pricing of Digital Ocean

823
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,080
and you look at the ways you could utilize Digital Ocean

824
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,600
and the benefits of using a CDN, it's a no-brainer way

825
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,720
to use Digital Ocean, especially if you go to dio.co

826
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,320
slash unplugged to get that $100 credit.

827
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,200
Did you say $100?

828
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,080
$100 credit.

829
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,720
What?

830
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,920
I say $100 sometimes.

831
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,640
I know.

832
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,040
You know what else is fantastic is those great folks.

833
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
So great I had to move my microphone arm in there.

834
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,960
Did you catch that?

835
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,040
I wanted to give you a little studio ambiance.

836
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,580
It's Linux Academy.

837
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,000
Those people over at Linux Academy,

838
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,520
they are hardworking folk.

839
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,920
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

840
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,040
I just got a little sneak peek at something

841
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,200
that's coming down the pipe.

842
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, niggly piggly.

843
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,360
It's so cool.

844
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,960
I might reach out to them and try

845
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
to set up an interview here in the near future

846
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
to have them do a little overview of one

847
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,360
of these things they're working on.

848
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,200
I just so desperately want to say what it is,

849
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,840
but I don't think I'm allowed to because it's in development.

850
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,540
You know how they feel about that stuff.

851
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,000
But they're always working on stuff.

852
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,160
It's a platform to learn about Linux.

853
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,800
Anything that Linux runs on or that you can run Linux with

854
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,040
or on top of or inside of it, I mean, it's, yeah.

855
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,200
That's a giant list.

856
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,960
Turns out it's most of Microsoft's stuff these days.

857
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,460
Woo.

858
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,320
Cool.

859
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,200
Yeah, and they've got courseware on that as well as AWS

860
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,880
and OpenStack and, of course, the Linux Essentials

861
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,000
and the Google Cloud Platform and Docker

862
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,080
and trying to wrap your head around big data

863
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,760
or just basic DevOps concepts, really.

864
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,440
And now, really, some great courseware for reals, really.

865
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,360
I like saying really.

866
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,340

00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,800
They'll work with your busy day and days and days and days.

878
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,680
I understand.

879
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,880
But they'll work with you on that.

880
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,480
That's like the hardest part, when you're like, OK,

881
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,720
I want to learn something.

882
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,800
Now I've got to go find the resources to learn.

883
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,680
No, it's just right there.

884
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,160
It pops up.

885
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,000
You log in.

886
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,880
You keep reading.

887
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,360
There's also something that just makes it real,

888
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,440
when you just see, this concept is going

889
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,400
to take me two hours to master.

890
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,240
And then I go, oh, OK, two hours.

891
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,800
I can do that.

892
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,680
Yeah, I can do that.

893
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,840
And then you can get study tools.

894
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,800
And you can get lesson audio.

895
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,720
And they've got videos and interactive diagrams

896
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,600
and all of that stuff.

897
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,840
So it's a great platform.

898
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,480
And it gets you ready for the big certs.

899
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,720
It's got instructor mentoring, human beings that help you

900
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,320
if you need help.

901
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,600
Yeah, it's great.

902
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,400
Human beings.

903
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,200
You're real humans.

904
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,280
I would never have thought.

905
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,000
I know.

906
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,880
Powered by Linux.

907
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,960
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

908
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,800
Speaking of powered by Linux, Ting.

909
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,840
Yeah, the Ting infrastructure runs on Linux.

910
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,800
linux.ting.com.

911
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,320
linux.ting.com.

912
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,540
That's where you go to save $25 off a device

913
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,040
if you want to buy one from Ting.

914
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,280
And I'll tell you more about that here in a second,

915
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,540
because they've got a good one.

916
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,540
Or if you bring one, they've got CDMA and GSM.

917
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,720
You get $25 in service credit.

918
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,400
Pay for what you use wireless as Ting's secret sauce.

919
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,800
It's a fair price for however much you talk, text, and data

920
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,700
you use.

921
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,740
And there's no contracts, no early termination fees,

922
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,360
no quote unquote agreements.

923
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,880
And you can manage the entire thing.

924
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,360
Turn stuff on and off, individual services even,

925
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,720
like text messages on or off, right from their control panel.

926
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,480
It's super, super easy.

927
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,800
You can set usage alerts.

928
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
They have fantastic customer service.

929
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,920
But I wanted to tell you about a great deal right now.

930
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,680
If you just want to get a nice, clean, performant Android

931
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,920
phone that's going to get updates for a little while,

932
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
friends, I'd like you to consider the Motorola G6 Play.

933
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,880
I've talked about the Moto series before.

934
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,940
They're the ones where I legitimately

935
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,240
don't mind the skin.

936
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,120
It's so minimal.

937
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,640
It's not getting in your way.

938
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,920
You don't feel like spending $800 on a smartphone.

939
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,600
Which I don't.

940
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,800
But you'd like to have something that's no contract,

941
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,480
that you're not paying for monthly.

942
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,120
I do.

943
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,360
Yeah, linux.ting.com.

944
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,700
Then you go to their store page.

945
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,040
You can get the Moto G6 Play for $174.

946
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,180
You own it.

947
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,360
And then you just pay for your usage.

948
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:19,920
That's it.

949
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,600
That's awesome.

950
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,880
Yeah, no contract.

951
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,900
It's multi-network too.

952
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,240
So if GSM is better in your area or CDMA,

953
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,640
you can utilize that.

954
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,040
It's really, really nice.

955
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,400
It's got a fingerprint scanner.

956
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,320
It's got a bunch of nice features built in,

957
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,400
like an SD card reader, 13 megapixel rear camera,

958
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,920
4,000 milliamp battery.

959
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,080
They say you can get 36 hours on a single charge

960
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,440
with that sucker.

961
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,080
And it's got a Snapdragon quad core processor in it.

962
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,440
It's a great phone.

963
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,240
And you can own the whole dang thing for $174.

964
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,200
That's not bad.

965
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,920
That is not bad.

966
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,360
And you can go up to 128 gigs with microSD.

967
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,000
Whoa.

968
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,640
I think it comes with 32 gigs built in,

969
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,960
but you can go up to 128.

970
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,280
If you can get off that got to have the latest and greatest

971
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
sort of ride, then this is a secret weapon

972
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,240
to save in some money.

973
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,800
It really is nice, 5.7 IPS screen.

974
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,200
It's a higher, it's a 1440 by 720,

975
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,480
which is not bad for a 5.7 when you're not trying

976
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,960
to kill battery life all day.

977
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,480
You know, if this podcasting thing doesn't work out,

978
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
you could be just a phone salesman.

979
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,720
I think you've got it.

980
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,440
I really like these phones.

981
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,280
When you find the right phone, it's like, I don't know.

982
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,760
Something about it, it's like, this

983
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,000
because everybody's always buying

984
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,920
like the iPhone or the Samsungs or the Pixels.

985
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,960
The easy choices.

986
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
Yeah, and it's like, oh, cool.

987
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,840
So you spend $1,000 on a phone.

988
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,960
But if you didn't need X, Y, whatever that one thing is,

989
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,280
you could get these motos, and they're just great phones.

990
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
$174, linux.ting.com.

991
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,520
All right, I've said my piece.

992
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,120
I just think that's a great phone and a great service.

993
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,040
I get excited, Wes.

994
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,840
I can't help it.

995
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
I love gadgets.

996
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,200
Not as much as I love Linux and free software.

997
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,920
So I don't mix those two together.

998
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,600
I have not bought an Android device since the Nexus 6P.

999
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,080
It's been a while.

1000
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,560
It may change.

1001
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,960
After a while, the OnePlus is starting

1002
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,640
to look better and better.

1003
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,400
It is.

1004
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,960
But I got to save my pennies right now

1005
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,640
because I think this week's news has sealed the deal for me

1006
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,440
on buying a ThinkPad.

1007
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,680
As you guys know, I've been on the fence for weeks.

1008
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,200
We had Barton on last week.

1009
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,960
And we were talking about the XPSs,

1010
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,400
plus my XPS has been one of the best computers I've ever owned.

1011
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,520
It's still my daily driver for so many things.

1012
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,920
I prepped today's show on my XPS 13.

1013
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,240
I took it down to Texas.

1014
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,640
Just a solid system.

1015
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,240
And one of the things I love about my XPS 13

1016
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,160
is I get firmware updates through Nome Software.

1017
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,800
And Plasma Project has announced that they're

1018
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,960
bringing that same functionality to Discover.

1019
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,160
So you'll be able to get beautiful firmware updates

1020
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,480
on the Plasma desktop.

1021
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,600
And I know it's silly.

1022
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,080
But that's something that really matters to me.

1023
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,200
It makes it feel like a complete consumer product in a way

1024
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,480
that just hasn't really been there on Linux before.

1025
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480
I just love LVFS.

1026
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,160
And I love that my XPS 13 got firmware updates that way.

1027
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
You mean saying that I don't have to boot into DOS

1028
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,840
to update my firmware anymore is somehow good for Linux?

1029
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,480
I don't get it.

1030
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,520
Or the modern version of that really

1031
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,080
is you have to keep your Windows partition around.

1032
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,960
That sucks.

1033
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,560
And so it is such a censure for me

1034
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,080
now that Lenovo has joined the LVFS project.

1035
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,080
And the laptop I've been looking at, the T480,

1036
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,320
is on the supported list of hardware.

1037
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,440
And I got a couple of notes, emails,

1038
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,520
with screenshots from listeners.

1039
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
They're like, hey, I just got this on my ThinkPad

1040
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,320
two days before this went public.

1041
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,360
Oh, it just shows up.

1042
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,480
Yeah, I guess the timing went that the images started

1043
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,080
showing up in the stable repos while Richard was on vacation

1044
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,680
so he couldn't get back to write the blog post on time.

1045
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,480
But he writes, bringing Lenovo to LVFS has been a lot of work.

1046
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,920
It needed changes to the low-level FW update

1047
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,960
library, which is fwupd, and even LVFS admin portal itself

1048
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,800
for various vendor-defined reasons.

1049
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,720
I love that term.

1050
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,180
In other words, they had particulars

1051
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,920
they wanted taken care of.

1052
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,520
He says, we've been working in semi-secret for a long time,

1053
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,640
and I'm sure it's been frustrating to all involved

1054
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,600
not being able to speak openly about the grand plan.

1055
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,480
But I do think Lenovo should be applauded for their work done

1056
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,120
so far due to the enormity of the task

1057
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,760
rather than chastise about being to the party

1058
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,840
a little late.

1059
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,400
Then he writes, if anyone from HP is reading this,

1060
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,720
you're now officially late.

1061
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:32,120
This is, to me, this is the censure for that T480.

1062
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,720
But there's only one person here who

1063
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,760
I believe has authority to speak on this topic,

1064
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,360
and that would be Popey, because he owns 35.

1065
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,880
Hello, Popey.

1066
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,700
Did you have any hint this was coming?

1067
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,280
And when you saw the news, how excited were you?

1068
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,440
I was very excited.

1069
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,400
It's always good to see more hardware appearing in the LVFS.

1070
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,600
Do you think this is indicative of other things that

1071
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,520
may be in the works at Lenovo?

1072
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,280
I don't know.

1073
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,000
I know it's something that Richard has

1074
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,400
been working on for a long time.

1075
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,960
We had him in the office recently

1076
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,720
when we had a GNOME software design sprint.

1077
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,120
He came in for a day, and we chatted over some stuff,

1078
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,680
and he was telling us a little bit about the amount of work

1079
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,000
that goes on to get companies on board with LVFS.

1080
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,200
And it's certainly a labor of love for him.

1081
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,080
So it's really good to see he's succeeded with Lenovo.

1082
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,240
Boy, do we appreciate it.

1083
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,000
Amazing.

1084
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,320
It just makes a difference for so many users in such a big way.

1085
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,960
It's such an appreciated.

1086
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,040
Not having to boot into Windows or create some shonky boot disk

1087
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,560
and get your firmware that way.

1088
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,360
Just pressing a button, reboot.

1089
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,080
And it's cross-distro, which is also

1090
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,800
so great for somebody like me who

1091
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,880
seems to not be able to last more than a year on a distro

1092
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,400
anymore, which is actually a lot better than it used to be.

1093
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,320
Just accept it now.

1094
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,080
There's nothing wrong with it.

1095
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,560
I am really elated by this news.

1096
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,400
What do you think of my choice poppy on the T480?

1097
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,280
You think that's a solid choice for a travel laptop?

1098
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
It's an excellent choice, of course.

1099
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,480
Hey, that's all I need.

1100
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,360
Validation.

1101
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,160
Yeah.

1102
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,200
OK.

1103
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,160
I feel good.

1104
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,640
With the poppy-approved little stamp out.

1105
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,960
That's like when I discovered that Jeremy Clarkson bought

1106
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,800
a VW Golf.

1107
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,360
I'm like, oh, that kind of validates my new interest.

1108
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,560
That's how I feel poppy is with the ThinkPads.

1109
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,640
He's like my Jeremy Clarkson for ThinkPads.

1110
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,440
He has earned it.

1111
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,440
Oh, my god.

1112
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,520
Please, no.

1113
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,240
I thought you'd like that.

1114
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,440
All right, well, moving on, just a few other things.

1115
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,400
Eric, the IT guy, is in the Mumble Room today.

1116
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,640
And you may recall that name because not only does he

1117
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,400
chime in from time to time, but he chatted with me

1118
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,120
a few weeks back about Jupiter Broadcasting's efforts

1119
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,160
around setting up PeerTube.

1120
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,680
And he is back with many encoding jobs

1121
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,280
later to give us kind of an update on where things are at

1122
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,160
and some other things that are in the works.

1123
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,400
So Eric, thanks once again for all your work on the PeerTube

1124
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,200
stuff.

1125
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,160
And where do you think we should start with the update?

1126
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,320
Yeah, I try and chime in whenever my son's not

1127
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,480
playing with my mixer.

1128
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,360
Yeah, that is always fun when he reaches for the EQ.

1129
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,680
So just you know what I do is I just swat at them.

1130
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,440
I find that where he just swatted them.

1131
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,960
They seem to learn.

1132
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,440
Wes is looking at me like, I think you're joking.

1133
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,920
But he's like, no one, Chris.

1134
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,440
I'm not sure.

1135
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,280
Well, it helps that Dylan's a natural broadcaster.

1136
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,360
So you don't need to worry about him.

1137
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:19,960
He's quick.

1138
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,560
He dodges.

1139
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,720
That's what, that's what.

1140
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,000
Yeah, yeah, all right.

1141
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,040
So what do you think, Eric?

1142
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,080
Where do we start with the PeerTube?

1143
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,040
Is there any significant new developments?

1144
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,920
I know there's been some back end changes.

1145
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,800
We've had a whole bunch of encoding jobs going.

1146
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,640
Kind of the 30,000 foot view, we've

1147
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,880
rebuilt PeerTube about three times

1148
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,840
on three different setups and operating systems.

1149
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,160
And we've settled on Ubuntu.

1150
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,480
And we've got a nice big VM, thanks to some

1151
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,080
of the guys in the community.

1152
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,800
They've donated a huge VM with, I think, 16 cores.

1153
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,240
If you're on the Macedon server, you've

1154
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,560
seen that about every couple of hours,

1155
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,240
a new video is being posted as I'm

1156
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,880
going through 10 plus years of Jupyter broadcasting

1157
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,520
backlog, where in the next few days,

1158
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,920
transcoding jobs should finish for BSD now.

1159
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,120
I don't know if anybody watches that, but it's there.

1160
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,400
Nice.

1161
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:16,960
I kid.

1162
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,440
I kid.

1163
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,080
I love you guys.

1164
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,240
That was solid, dude.

1165
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,400
Well done.

1166
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,240
Nicely delivered.

1167
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,400
So we're, I think, I think, ask Noah's up there.

1168
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,040
BSD now is almost done.

1169
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,480
Several of the other shows are done,

1170
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,920
and then the rest are on their way.

1171
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,320
So once the active shows have all

1172
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,160
had their backlogs ported over, then I

1173
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,600
want to try and start on some of the shows that

1174
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,560
aren't active anymore.

1175
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,400
So we've got the entire catalog there at some point.

1176
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,240
Yeah, and this started as, hey, YouTube

1177
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,760
is pulling down our stuff sometimes,

1178
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,920
or man, wouldn't it be great to just help lend

1179
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,880
some attention towards a project that is helping replace YouTube?

1180
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,720
Because we've talked about the issues of that,

1181
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,400
especially for free software coverage.

1182
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,320
And so that's really, I think, where Eric and I started

1183
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:04,840
with this.

1184
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,440
But then we started going, wouldn't it

1185
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,640
be really great if you could go to one place

1186
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,360
and have the entire archive available, at least as far

1187
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,720
as we have it in video?

1188
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,560
And so that, I mean, I can't imagine the amount of CPU heat

1189
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,960
that work must be creating, Eric.

1190
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,640
So how long does that take?

1191
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,720
Is that a manual process?

1192
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,680
Are you SCPing MP4 files around, or how are you

1193
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,560
doing that part?

1194
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,040
So what's fun is it's a two-step process right now.

1195
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,400
So for the backlog, PeerTube is using YouTube DL.

1196
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:42,200
And it's got a scripted job that I run and just point to.

1197
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,120
There's the Jupyter feed web page

1198
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,040
that I just point the YouTube DL script towards.

1199
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,440
And so it'll pull in the backlog.

1200
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,800
But then manually, once I catch the tweet

1201
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,680
that a new show has been published,

1202
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,960
I go up, pull down the current.

1203
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,200
So when this episode gets published,

1204
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,480
I'll go down and pull that down with WGIT

1205
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,080
and then SCP it up to the server and manually,

1206
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,200
or actually manually, add it in through the web UI.

1207
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,360
And there's been some people notice that when I do that,

1208
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,080
there's a disclaimer that the video hasn't

1209
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,640
been transcoded yet, so quality is not so great.

1210
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,200
We've actually, as a community, been submitting pull requests

1211
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,340
for new features.

1212
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,040
And one of the new features that we have requested

1213
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,800
is the ability to basically set importance.

1214
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,600
So I want the server to be busy all the time.

1215
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,200
So if you don't have anything that's

1216
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,040
been published in the last week, chew on the backlog.

1217
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,420
But as soon as one of the new shows gets published,

1218
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,760
I want you to drop everything else you're working on

1219
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,480
and go and transcode this.

1220
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,040
That's a great idea.

1221
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,440
I need to double check on it.

1222
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,480
But they just sent out an email, PeerTube did,

1223
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,920
earlier this afternoon, stating that version 1.0 beta 3 was

1224
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,600
just released.

1225
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,320
So we should be expecting a full version here

1226
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,600
within the next couple of weeks with a lot of really nice

1227
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,000
features and bug fixes.

1228
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,600
And they're changing up some of the things on the back end.

1229
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,160
I mean, this project has exploded.

1230
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,520
I don't think they had a clue just how popular this

1231
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,760
was going to be.

1232
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,400
Well, yeah.

1233
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,920
I was just looking at their active instance site, which

1234
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,300
I'll have linked in the show notes.

1235
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,000
You can see the other PeerTube instances out there.

1236
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,880
And there's a whole bunch of them taken off.

1237
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,120
A lot of 1.0 versions.

1238
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,880
So it's good to see that they're still chugging away.

1239
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,160
Because I know that they've been super busy with their fundraiser

1240
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,840
stuff.

1241
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,240
Well, so what's the site people go

1242
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,640
to to kind of see some of the hard work you've been doing?

1243
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,620
What's the URL?

1244
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,600
So the official URL is getjupiter.com.

1245
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:51,240
And that's a restricted instance.

1246
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,720
That is official Jupyter broadcasting content only.

1247
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,560
But if you jump over to peertube.linuxrocks.online,

1248
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,660
it's tied into the Linux Rocks Macedon instance.

1249
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,280
And that is where community members

1250
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,200
can submit videos, things they've seen,

1251
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,520
things they've produced.

1252
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,160
I know there's a couple of us, like myself, who haven't done,

1253
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,560
who are getting our feet wet with podcasts that have uploaded

1254
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,720
a few videos just so we've got somewhere to publish it and say,

1255
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,040
hey, go check out this video and tell me what you think.

1256
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,520
And did we end up implementing the chapters, or not

1257
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,720
the chapters, but the channel?

1258
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,180
So if you want to just see all of Linux unplugged,

1259
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,520
you can just go to that channel.

1260
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,080
How does that work?

1261
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,800
Because if you go there right now, it's all BSD now

1262
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,160
all the time.

1263
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,720
And like you said, nobody watches that.

1264
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,720
So is there a facility for that on PeerTube?

1265
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,920
They're still fleshing out some of the functionality

1266
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,960
around channels.

1267
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,400
But if you go to getjupiter.com and you register for an account,

1268
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,440
I know, another account.

1269
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,200
I'm sorry, but that's how it works.

1270
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,120
If you register a new account, you can actually

1271
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,600
subscribe to individual channels.

1272
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,200
So if you want to get that Noah guy,

1273
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,160
you can just go and subscribe to Ask Noah and get those.

1274
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,200
That's the only thing people listen to around here.

1275
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,080
So OK.

1276
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,600
Well, Eric, thank you very much.

1277
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,240
We should probably keep moving because we

1278
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,160
want to also talk about Android P and get to some pics.

1279
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,040
But I really do appreciate that work.

1280
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,680
So getjupiter.com is where people will see it.

1281
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,640
And I think it's good timing because I

1282
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,040
think it's going to play into our overall plan

1283
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,840
to get our back catalog in shape one day.

1284
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,920
Well, and one last quick note, that effort for PeerTube

1285
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,000
has actually led to another project

1286
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,680
that we've been working on, a couple of us,

1287
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,880
where Jupyter Broadcasting now has an official GitLab

1288
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,520
instance that we're managing.

1289
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,760
So at some point, we're going to move all the PeerTube scripts,

1290
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,480
perhaps a code for JBots, the caster soundboard,

1291
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,560
things like that, we're going to be hosting on Jupyter

1292
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,440
Broadcasting hosted instances.

1293
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,200
With a cool URL.

1294
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,000
It's the great GitHub Exodus.

1295
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,280
We're just a little late to the party.

1296
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,480
We're a little late to the Exodus party.

1297
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,480
But yeah, we're setting it all up.

1298
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,600
We'll have our own official site.

1299
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,320
So if you hear us talking about, which I have a suspicion,

1300
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,000
there will be more projects added to that list

1301
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,960
in the near future.

1302
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,360
Well, maybe not in the near future,

1303
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,520
but in the distant future.

1304
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,280
It'll just be one resource you go to.

1305
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,160
So if it's the soundboard, if it's the, yeah.

1306
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:06,840
It's so easy.

1307
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,360
Yeah, the bot and all that kind of stuff.

1308
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,240
Yeah, so that's all stuff Eric's been helping us with,

1309
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,400
set up the back end stuff.

1310
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,960
And it's kind of bringing together

1311
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,720
several initiatives, which is great.

1312
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,440
So all right.

1313
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,960
Well, check out more of that, and I'll

1314
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,440
have links to what Eric was talking about in the show notes.

1315
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,240
Keep up the good work, Eric, and everybody else helping Eric.

1316
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,040
And let's talk about Android P for a moment.

1317
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,280
It was released this week.

1318
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,200
And I don't have a lot to really cover on it,

1319
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,000
other than I noticed a few things that stand out,

1320
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,880
other than your typical new features,

1321
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,080
like adaptive battery and adaptive brightness.

1322
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,000
So adaptive.

1323
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,240
There's a lot of, there's a big vibe

1324
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,000
of monitoring you in this thing.

1325
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,960
So like app actions, which will predict

1326
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,880
what you want to do next based on your other activity.

1327
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,080
Or application slices, which try to figure out

1328
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,040
what you're searching for and show you content from an app.

1329
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,960
And there's also this new dashboard

1330
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,800
that helps you understand how you're spending

1331
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,600
your time on your device.

1332
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,000
And the app timer that lets you set limits on apps

1333
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,720
and graze out the icon on your home screen

1334
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,280
when you've used it too much.

1335
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,600
Too much Twitter for you, Wes.

1336
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,240
I know.

1337
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:14,760
Oh, god.

1338
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,120
I'm so embarrassed.

1339
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,760
And then there's other nice features,

1340
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,080
like do not disturb, which silences visual interruptions.

1341
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,560
And then there's the wind down mode,

1342
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,360
which turns on a nightlight, and then turns on do not disturb,

1343
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,920
and then fades the screen to grayscale.

1344
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,040
I'm willing to try that out.

1345
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,160
We'll see.

1346
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,400
But the digital well-being stuff is a little scary to me.

1347
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,720
And I don't know if it's just me being RMS,

1348
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,520
or if this isn't just the mecca of metrics for Google

1349
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,880
to collect here.

1350
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,880
Imagine now all of the things they

1351
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
can add to the profile that's already enormous

1352
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,800
that they have about you, all of these things about how you

1353
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,360
because in order to monitor all of this stuff,

1354
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,080
they've had to build in hooks to watch.

1355
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,560
And then they have to be collecting this information

1356
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,680
and storing it and storing it in a dashboard.

1357
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,900
It seems like it would just be almost negligent for them

1358
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,540
not to also eventually have a copy of that information,

1359
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,440
even if in this first release they don't.

1360
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,640
I mean, right, yeah.

1361
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,680
You just want more data.

1362
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,120
That's kind of the rule.

1363
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,700
And it's all being sold to us under the premise

1364
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,360
of digital well-being.

1365
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,480
Well, I mean, you can't.

1366
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,400
How are you going to do all your machine learning

1367
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,940
if you don't have all the data, Chris?

1368
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,960
Yeah, that's true.

1369
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,520
You've got to have all the data.

1370
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,760
Bobi, have you flashed all of your Android devices

1371
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,520
with Android P?

1372
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,600
Are you running it on everything now and got the frame?

1373
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,520
No.

1374
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,480
No, because as is always the case,

1375
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,160
I am bottom of the pile because I've got a OnePlus 3T.

1376
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,160
So I seriously doubt that will get in Android P anytime soon.

1377
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,920
Yeah, I joke, though, but it is kind of a serious thing.

1378
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,320
It's like, now we wait.

1379
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,360
Now we wait for the code dump.

1380
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,440
And then we wait for all the other lag of the projects

1381
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,640
that are based off that code dump to actually catch up.

1382
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,040
It is not quite.

1383
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,840
I mean, it is far better than the alternative in many ways.

1384
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,840
But it is not quite the glorious free open source ecosystem

1385
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,480
that perhaps we once naively thought long ago.

1386
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,600
So Cassidy, you've been giving it a go, though, quite seriously.

1387
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,880
I'd be curious to know about your first impressions,

1388
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,340
including maybe some of the new nav stuff

1389
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,800
if you had a chance to give it a go.

1390
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,300
Yep.

1391
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,240
I got the update over the air yesterday.

1392
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,120
And I've actually really been enjoying it.

1393
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,400
The new navigation is optional and off by default

1394
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,620
on existing hardware.

1395
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,040
But I guess it's going to be the default on new hardware

1396
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,160
from Google, at least, in the future.

1397
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,040
But I turned it on.

1398
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,920
I really enjoy it.

1399
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,280
I actually really enjoy the digital well-being stuff.

1400
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,280
Oh, yeah.

1401
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,960
I think I have a different perspective on this maybe

1402
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,320
because we do something similar.

1403
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,800
And we've done it for a long time,

1404
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,240
just really not as well fleshed out, I guess,

1405
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,320
in elementary OS.

1406
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,160
And that's the tool called Zeitgeist,

1407
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,260
which is something that, on your device,

1408
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,900
it tracks what you open, what files you access,

1409
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,280
what applications you use.

1410
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,480
It keeps all of that information on the device.

1411
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,840
But then that can power some really interesting things

1412
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,640
in the OS.

1413
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,960
And we've been talking, actually, how we could expand

1414
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,840
our privacy settings to be more like this digital well-being

1415
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:13,140
where the user's in control of what apps they themselves can

1416
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,760
open when.

1417
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,600
And we have something called parental controls right now.

1418
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,600
And we've been talking about maybe rebranding

1419
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,360
that as something like digital well-being

1420
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,760
because I think it's a really interesting topic of setting

1421
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:30,560
restrictions for yourself for how you use your device.

1422
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,960
Devices these days are made to be so addicting

1423
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,600
that I think it can be important to impose limits on yourself

1424
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,000
as long as it's you doing it and it stays on the device locally.

1425
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,760
Yeah, I really have no problem with people setting

1426
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,400
their own limits on themselves if they

1427
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,040
have control over those limits.

1428
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,600
It seems like it kind of speaks a little bit about trust.

1429
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,800
The idea, as you describe it, coming from you,

1430
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,960
it sounds very interesting.

1431
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,880
But I think maybe some of this is just you.

1432
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,480
It's a concern.

1433
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,280
I don't know if it's actually even an issue.

1434
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,920
It, to me, is just when I hear it,

1435
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,640
I can't help but wonder it a little bit.

1436
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,260
And there's this voice in the back of my head

1437
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,000
that always goes, well, RMS was usually right about this stuff.

1438
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,280
It could be nothing, right?

1439
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,080
It could be nothing.

1440
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,200
And I think, too, if you have a hard time with controlling

1441
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,360
how much you use these devices, building something in

1442
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,280
is probably good.

1443
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,480
And I think the intention here from the companies

1444
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,960
is a good one, I think.

1445
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,280
So yeah.

1446
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,160
So Android P, coming to a phone near you in 2021.

1447
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,540
But you can go read about it with the link in our show

1448
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,280
notes.

1449
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,040
It does look like a nice refresh.

1450
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,840
If I had a phone it would run on, I'd give it a go.

1451
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,240
There's some good security improvements baked in as well,

1452
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,120
and runtime stuff.

1453
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,640
In fact, the one that I noticed, I think you called it out

1454
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,800
in our chat, was that it is now using TLS by default

1455
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,400
and DNS over TLS.

1456
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,160
That's nice.

1457
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,320
More encryption.

1458
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,040
Yeah.

1459
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,560
Yeah, I do not mean to besmirch the good name of Android P,

1460
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,480
because as everyone knows, we love P.

1461
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,000
Right?

1462
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,600
It's just complicated.

1463
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,480
It's, yeah.

1464
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah, it is.

1465
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,320
It's a complicated relationship.

1466
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,280
So let's make things easy for a little bit with a snap.

1467
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,960
There is a new app that I found this week in the Snap store,

1468
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:06,480
I guess.

1469
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,540
And it's called Transitions DJ.

1470
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:13,080
And it is a, to me, I guess, I don't mean to say it badly.

1471
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,360
I don't mean to talk it down, but it's

1472
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,800
like a light version of Mix, M-I-X-X-X.

1473
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,800
It's nice.

1474
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,560
It's a cool little app, and it's used for mixing music.

1475
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,920
It's great for live production or just making a mix

1476
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,720
that you like.

1477
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,680
It has cross fading, tempo adjustment, looping, cue points,

1478
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,560
tempo synchronization.

1479
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,280
And it also has a online database

1480
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,680
it can pull down of song structures that you can use.

1481
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,200
Really?

1482
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,040
You get the beats and the bars and the beats

1483
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,060
and the bars and the phrases to help you mix it up.

1484
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,920
And it's a snap to install.

1485
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,320
It's really, it's actually quite literally a snap.

1486
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,040
You just do snap, install, transitions, DJ.

1487
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,120
And then you'll be the star of the party.

1488
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,360
Yeah, so that looks pretty cool.

1489
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,080
That is neat.

1490
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,840
Yeah, you got a summer party.

1491
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,160
Then there's a tool that I didn't know anything about,

1492
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,540
but I knew it was something the Intercept was working on.

1493
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,600
That's the outfit that Glenn Greenwald works for and others.

1494
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,520
And their parent company, First Look Media,

1495
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,360
has been investing in a tool to help them manage

1496
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,160
PGP encrypted emails.

1497
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,840
But not the emails so much themselves, but the keys.

1498
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,760
From the beginning of First Look Media,

1499
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,620
they've been using PGP or GBG encryption

1500
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,280
for all of their emails.

1501
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,360
And they've tried to make it as simple as possible

1502
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,760
by creating a new open source tool called GPG Sync.

1503
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,640
They've developed it in order to offload

1504
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,160
the most complex part of encrypted email, the key

1505
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,480
management part of encrypted email.

1506
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,520
And they take it out really away from the users,

1507
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,360
the fiddling from the users, and they kind of move it

1508
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,680
into the IT staff realm.

1509
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,600
So this is sort of a pick for those of you in IT

1510
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,640
that might want to solve this for your end users.

1511
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,920
So here's how it works.

1512
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,360
GPG Sync is designed to make it so everyone

1513
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,920
within your organization always has

1514
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,880
the correct public keys for everyone else

1515
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,080
in your organization without even having to think about it.

1516
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,280
I want that.

1517
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,400
I want that right now.

1518
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,120
Yeah, I was thinking like, and I heard this, like,

1519
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,120
oh, we could use this here.

1520
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,120
That'd be kind of cool.

1521
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,780
We could all be talking encrypted.

1522
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,400
Although we just don't really.

1523
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,160
When's the last time you've emailed me or I've emailed you?

1524
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,120
Ever?

1525
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,920
Very rarely.

1526
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,680
Probably once.

1527
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,440
Maybe once, yeah.

1528
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,280
I think about it twice.

1529
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,240
Yeah, that's weird.

1530
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,080
It's very odd.

1531
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,400
Yeah, so the tech staff generates a PGP key called

1532
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,440
the authority key.

1533
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,880
And they also recommend you use YubiKey with this.

1534
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,640
They create a list of all the PGP fingerprints

1535
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,160
that all members of the organizations

1536
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,600
should keep updated called a key list.

1537
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,320
They digitally sign the key list with the authority key.

1538
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,760
And then they upload both the key list and the signature

1539
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,480
to a website that is accessible from a public URL.

1540
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,140
All members of the organizations then

1541
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:54,660
install GPG Sync and subscribe to that key list.

1542
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,080
You can also subscribe to as many key lists as you'd like.

1543
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,180
So if you had multiple projects or companies

1544
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,600
you were working with, they could all

1545
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,720
have their own key list.

1546
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,260
And you could subscribe to them.

1547
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,880
You can stay up to date on all of them

1548
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,240
from multiple organizations.

1549
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,000
When someone joins your organization,

1550
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,280
the tech staff helps them generate the PGP key,

1551
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,120
adds their fingerprint to the key list,

1552
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,860
and re-signs it with the authority key.

1553
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,100
And then they upload it to the same URL.

1554
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,400
If a user migrates to a new key, the tech staff

1555
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,860
adds their new fingerprint to the key list,

1556
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:25,600
and also leaves their old one on the list as well.

1557
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,260
And now each member of your organization

1558
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,600
doesn't have to track down everyone else's public keys

1559
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,080
and make sure they're authentic.

1560
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,120
You don't even have to hold regular key signing parties,

1561
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,360
though you probably could.

1562
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,600
The users don't actually have to do anything.

1563
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,800
They just write encrypted emails to their colleagues,

1564
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,480
and it just works.

1565
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,320
That's pretty neat.

1566
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,680
Yeah, so you're just delegating trust

1567
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,640
to IT, which you do for so many other things

1568
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,160
anyway in an organization like that.

1569
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,680
And it's just a nice way to keep it all in sync.

1570
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,080
And in a Windows organization, you

1571
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:54,280
are the domain admins have access to all that stuff.

1572
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,200
They get master keys.

1573
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,880
So yeah, there you go.

1574
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,400
There you go.

1575
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:01,720
It's called GPG sync, and version 0.20 came out this week.

1576
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,360
So congratulations to First Lock Media

1577
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,720
for putting that together.

1578
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,160
So there's a couple of app picks for you.

1579
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:07,720
How about that?

1580
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:08,480
Boom, boom, boom.

1581
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,680
A couple of app picks right there, pow, pow, pow.

1582
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,680
And you can find all of those at linuxunplug.com.

1583
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,880
Slash 261.

1584
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,920
Wow, how about that?

1585
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,200
261, Wes.

1586
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:19,960
Good job.

1587
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,400
Holy smokes, holy smokes.

1588
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,660
Well, that just about brings us to the end

1589
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,960
of this week's broadcast.

1590
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,840
If you want to get more Wes Payne, go check out what?

1591
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,320
Techsnap?

1592
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,280
Yeah, techsnap.systems.

1593
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,320
Nice.

1594
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,720
If you want a little more poppy, he

1595
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,280
was just recently on Late Night Linux

1596
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,520
in their most recent episode.

1597
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,560
Did a fine job there.

1598
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,080
And also, that excellent Ubuntu podcast.

1599
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,120
So you always can check out more poppy at there as well,

1600
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,800
ubuntupodcast.org.

1601
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,120
And you can find Cassidy and Dan.

1602
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,660
It will have links to their social profiles

1603
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,060
and their websites in our show notes.

1604
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,480
So you can get their stuff there.

1605
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,680
And Brent, is there anything you want

1606
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,160
to mention before we get out of here this week?

1607
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,560
Anywhere you want to send folks?

1608
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,600
Yeah, I think sending people to at BrentGervais on Twitter

1609
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:01,320
is a good place.

1610
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,440
Just come and say hi if you don't have anything better

1611
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:04,960
to say, but I'd love to say hi.

1612
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,840
Check that.

1613
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,280
All right, very good, sir.

1614
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,820
All right, you know, one of these days,

1615
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,240
we've got to get another barbecue planned.

1616
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,320
OK, get another barbecue planned.

1617
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:11,960
We need it.

1618
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:12,960
Yeah, smoked meats.

1619
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,800
We do need it.

1620
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,000
Hey, I encourage you to follow me on Twitter too.

1621
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,520
Why not?

1622
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,080
We're all doing it, at chrislas.

1623
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,920
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1624
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,660
And if you join us live on Tuesdays,

1625
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:24,360
you get a nice Linux rounded meal,

1626
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,280
because the pre-show starts around 1.30 Pacific time.

1627
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,360
And then the show starts around 2 PM-ish.

1628
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,440
And then we tend to go till about 3, 3.30-ish,

1629
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,480
whatever that might be.

1630
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,200
And then we hang out till that Noah Chalaya guy shows up.

1631
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,560
And then we do a little handoff to him,

1632
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,480
and the Ask Noah program fires up.

1633
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,640
It's a beautiful, beautiful afternoon of Linux.

1634
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,360
Now, a lot of people say, but Chris, I got to work.

1635
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,040
And to that I say, no, you don't.

1636
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,540
Just put this on in the background.

1637
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,640
And you say, and they come to you and say,

1638
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,200
why aren't you working?

1639
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,200
You say, boss, this is my extended training.

1640
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,560
Don't you want me to be better at my job?

1641
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,060
And if they say no to that, then you're

1642
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,320
working at the wrong place.

1643
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,840
All right, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

1644
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,840
of the Unplugged program.

1645
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,120
I hope you enjoyed everything.

1646
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:09,800
Don't forget, links are on the Linux Unplugged website.

1647
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,840
Our live stream is at jblive.tv.

1648
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,640
You can also get it on our YouTube channel

1649
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,600
at youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1650
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,760
Thanks so much for being here.

1651
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,960
See you back here next Tuesday.

1652
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:45,960
I'll see you guys next time.

1653
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:53,360
Here we go.

1654
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,440
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1655
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,480
We're bringing it in now for a landing.

1656
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,400
Soft, gentle, JB landing.

1657
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,800
Yeah, keep your seats buckled.

1658
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,320
And drink it if you still got it,

1659
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,460
because I'll probably smack into the ground a little hard.

1660
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,480
I tend to do that.

1661
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,160
Well, thank you, everybody, for making it to the show today.

1662
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,400
What are we going to do for $300?

1663
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,080
I know it's a ways off, but if we start talking about it now,

1664
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,080
you know what I'm saying?

1665
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,200
We have time to execute something great.

1666
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,960
I'm putting that out there.

1667
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,040
What are we going to do for $300?

1668
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,000
All right, jbtitles.com.

1669
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,760
And what are we going to do for titles?

1670
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,200
Write the heck down.

1671
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,600
Let's go.

1672
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,600
Thank you, Mumba Room.

1673
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,680
You guys were great.

1674
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,720
A rowdy riotous Mumba Room.

1675
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:28,960
Anybody cooking like we are?

1676
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,400
It's, what do you say, probably 83 in here, 84 in here

1677
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,560
right now, maybe?

1678
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,520
My entire state is on fire.

1679
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,320
That's, that is.

1680
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,000
Literally.

1681
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,800
Yeah.

1682
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,600
Yeah, that's awful.

1683
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,160
I mean, that's what we need here in Europe to rain.

1684
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,280
Rain would be really good.

1685
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,800
Yeah.

1686
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,400
Rain is hot as balls.

1687
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,760
I appreciate that everybody's suffering with this thing.

1688
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,320
That's nice.

1689
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:49,760
That's good.

1690
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,800
That's why we do this, to distract us all.

1691
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,000
I'm not suffering right now, and yet I still

1692
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,200
have my glass of wine.

1693
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,280
And now it's pretty decent, because we

1694
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,200
have half the midnight here.

1695
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,520
So it's pretty cool now.

1696
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,000
It's good.

1697
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,720
Yeah, I bet.

1698
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,160
Well, that's, you know, when you're

1699
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,840
on vacation and in the Mumba Room,

1700
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,040
that's real dedication right there, I got to say.

1701
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,640
You're the best.

1702
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,720
I'm your servant.

1703
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,200
All right.

1704
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,720
Well, now let's pick a title then.

1705
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,920
And then I think we've checked all of our boxes.

1706
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,480
I liked there was something, Gnome Gnome on the Range.

1707
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,240
That was one that went by at one point.

1708
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:24,000
Tech Mav.

1709
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,800
Yeah, we got to get the boat going.

1710
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
It's a long one.

1711
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,200
We need your help to sort this out.

1712
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,840
We can't pick from a series of ones.

1713
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,760
I resisted the urge to ask when the release is

1714
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,040
going to be Dan and Cassidy.

1715
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:35,760
You know, I didn't.

1716
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,200
I saw you squirming.

1717
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,200
It was on your mind.

1718
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,360
I just wanted to say, I believe Dan's birthday came and went,

1719
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,160
and that was the deadline, as far as I was concerned.

1720
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,120
When it's ready, as always.

1721
01:06:46,120 --> 01:07:12,280
Just a thanks to Jess when it's ready.
