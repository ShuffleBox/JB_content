00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 10 for October 15th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,840
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast observing the Linux

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,640
landscape from its unplugged observatory high above it all.

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,880
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
My name is Matt.

6
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,040
I don't know about all that high above it stuff, but I thought it sounded good.

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Sounds good to me.

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,680
Sometimes we kind of get down into it, actually.

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,680
This is true.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,100
You know, this week, one of the things I want to talk to you about, Matt, is how to shake

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,240
off this Ubuntu hangover that I have right now.

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Oh my goodness.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,840
Yeah, so to really fully appreciate this week's episode of Linux Unplugged, there is a little

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
homework involved.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
You don't have to.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,200
I think it'll stand on its own, but if you have the time, you should go back.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,260
On Sunday, we did Linux Action Show's Ubuntu 13.10 review, and that's sort of the jumping

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,480
off point for some of the stuff we're going to cover in this episode.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,160
Then on Monday, we did an episode of Coder Radio called Betting on Linux, which I managed

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:27,720
to turn into a therapy session and really, really dug into sort of the issues I have

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,720
around the Ubuntu Dash and why it sort of viscerally bothers me, and some of the issues

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,760
I think it might cast about the Ubuntu project in whole, but again, not critical that you

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,100
listen to that, but I think it might give you some context, because this week, we're

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,680
going to follow up on some comments that you guys have made on our review, some comments

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,240
on learning Linux, and then we're going to kind of roll that into the big picture of

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Linux, like maybe a world where Ubuntu isn't king, and a world where maybe not all distros

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,140
live forever, and they change, and sometimes people have to go somewhere else, and how

28
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,540
Linux users, especially the savvy ones, can kind of control that, and sort of instead

29
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,560
of be victim to it, sort of control what their destiny is.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
I like that idea.

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,920
I definitely think it's important to remember that, you know, different strokes, different

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
folks, right?

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,200
Yeah, and what goes up must come down, Matt.

34
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
That's right.

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Perhaps, perhaps.

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,880
But why don't we start with a little follow up for this here show, an ongoing topic.

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,960
We've gotten a lot of emails about it, and I've kind of had to be a little picky on what

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,660
we put in here, just because we've gotten so many, which is awesome.

39
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,280
But we talked a lot about recently with kids, and learning Linux, and learning computers

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,320
in general, and we got a lot of emails from teenagers, you know, young teens, and even

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,720
younger than teenage years, saying, hey, don't think it's all of us.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,640
That's awesome, and good for you guys, definitely.

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,820
Mike wrote in, and he says, learning the nuts and bolts, Matt and Chris, not everybody either

44
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,320
wants or can understand how things work.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,680
To some, their computer is an appliance and nothing else.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
So here's his background.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,860
He says, I happen to be one of the weird guys who does need to know.

48
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,040
As a kid in the late 50s, I built my own radios, learned how to read schematics and solder.

49
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,640
I was also the bicycle repair guy for the neighborhood.

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,960
At 16, my first paid job was an electric golf cart repair guy.

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,400
After two years in the Army as a draftee from 66 to 68, I got a job as a programmer trainee.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,680
In spite of not having a degree, I just scored very high in the IBM aptitude test.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,480
Next language I learned was the IBM 360 assembler.

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,240
He's also picked up five distinct assembly language.

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,160
Today, at 66, I still program and do web stuff and administer systems, including OpenSUSE,

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,280
Debian, and Ubuntu, and I'm still being paid to play with the toys.

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,160
I also have an advanced class in ham radio license, as well as a commercial pilot license

58
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
with instruments.

59
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,880
I can teach almost anybody to program, but if it's not fun and enjoyable, they'll suck

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
at it.

61
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Mike.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,680
So this is a great point that Mike makes here.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,560
And you know what else I loved about Mike's email is, so we have, we've gotten emails

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,720
from 10-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 16-year-olds saying, hey, don't count us out.

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,760
And now you got Mike here at the other end of the spectrum saying, you know, at 66, we

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
still like to do this stuff too.

67
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,520
And you know, my grandpa, who's quite a few years beyond Mike, also, you know, he loves

68
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
playing with Linux.

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,000
He loves playing with netbooks.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
And now he's getting into the open tablets.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I gave him-

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
That's cool.

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,960
I guess, I forget, I had a tablet that was going to be the Spark tablet for a while.

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Oh yeah, I remember that.

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,760
Yeah, I gave it to my grandpa so that way he could load it wherever he wants on it,

76
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,720
because he's just, he loves doing that kind of stuff.

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,080
And I think he's, he just hit 80, actually.

78
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
That's awesome.

79
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Yeah.

80
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
You know, it keeps you, it keeps you feeling young.

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,280
It keeps you involved and active and doing cool stuff.

82
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
You know?

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Yeah, totally.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
It's, it is good to see that.

85
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,540
And so while maybe, maybe the general populace, you know, and, and even in a decreasing number

86
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,640
of people will be specialists, there's still some out there.

87
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,160
Now Brian wrote in with response to last week's Linux Unplugged, where we call it, we titled

88
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,200
it the Ubuntu situation.

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,240
He says, I think everyone is overreacting.

90
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,000
I've been running Ubuntu 13.10 for a few weeks now and it keeps on getting better and better.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Other than the smart scopes, which I just choose not to use for the online results.

92
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,000
This is one of the best releases so far.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,160
Ubuntu needs to be stable and boring for a release, maybe even for a few cycles.

94
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,440
Unity changed everything and they're now getting to the point of polish and they shouldn't

95
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,800
screw that up.

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Everyone outside the hardcore Linux community wants a stable OS.

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
We are geeks.

98
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
We like the bleeding edge.

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Do we complain when OS 10 doesn't ship the latest X?

100
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
No, we do not.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,240
We don't even know about it.

102
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,440
That is the mindset that we need to keep in mind.

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,160
They want this to go big time.

104
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,500
The focus on mobile is important.

105
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,840
I can live with a stale OS for a few cycles and then good perspective to get on the show

106
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
since we've.

107
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Yeah.

108
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
Yeah.

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Yeah.

110
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,480
And then Zach wrote in with a, with another followup to the Ubuntu situation.

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,880
Zach wrote, Hey, Chris and Matt, I have a few comments regarding the most recent Linux

112
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Unplugged.

113
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Great show, by the way.

114
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
He says he likes the format.

115
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,920
He went to the big show first regarding Noah's email about young Padawan learning about Linux.

116
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,960
I would recommend probably not right now, but sometime in the future when he gets a

117
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,760
little more Linux under his belt, taking a look at Linux from scratch.

118
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,160
Yes, it's hardcore and pretty damn hard, especially for a newbie.

119
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,240
But between Linux from scratch and Gentoo, I learned so Goran much about Linux and how

120
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
it works.

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,520
When I first started out, see now he's mixing Star Wars and Firefly references.

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,120
I was going to say there's some Firefly.

123
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,120
Yeah.

124
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,760
I obviously wouldn't use it as a daily driver, but for learning and experiment, it's a great

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
tool.

126
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,720
If you could pass that along as a just name or mention the show, that would be awesome.

127
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,040
Second, Christopher, regarding your recent cock up with your KDE configs, why aren't

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,480
you using get to keep revisions of your dot files?

129
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,640
It's such a great tool and it's a great way to keep track of any text based configs, which

130
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,920
they all should be.

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,140
Make a get folder at the base of home and then make a get dot ignore that filters out

132
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,040
everything that you don't explicitly allow.

133
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
That's a good tip.

134
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
That's an excellent idea, actually.

135
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
Yeah.

136
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,560
I think that get dot ignore is an example and he includes it and he says you can also

137
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,160
use the syncing tool to keep the same config files between your machines.

138
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Just some thoughts.

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,440
Thanks for making the awesome shows and keep up the good work.

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,840
May the force be with you.

141
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,240
I did kind of admit that I probably should have been doing a better job of backing up

142
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,400
my KDE config.

143
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,200
I admit to that, but I'm happy with my gnome now.

144
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Exactly.

145
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,520
It's almost a mood issue.

146
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,440
I would also go so far as to say it's not a matter of not, I mean obviously know how,

147
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
but it's also a matter of you have X number of hours in the day.

148
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,700
You have X number of tasks to be done in that day and where are you spending that time and

149
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,500
honestly I don't know if setting that up really would have crossed your mind with as much

150
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
as you got going on.

151
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Yeah.

152
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,640
I suppose it didn't because I did know it was technically possible.

153
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Sure.

154
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,840
It also seems like one of those things that you could probably, if you just had some time

155
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,520
on a weekend to set it up once, you'd probably be good for a while.

156
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
It's a cool tip though.

157
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,960
I mean I got to give props for it.

158
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,880
It's really, really a creative idea.

159
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
I like it.

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
Yeah.

161
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,880
It's an interesting use of get too.

162
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,480
It's an interesting use of get and that's just another one.

163
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Okay.

164
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,040
So now we're going to kind of shift gears and get into some of the stuff that I think

165
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,840
is probably our jumping off point for our talk about the big picture around Linux this

166
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
week.

167
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,840
Danny wrote in and Danny said, please continue to beat the canonical drum beat.

168
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,160
You in this case are not wrong.

169
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,920
The issue here is greater than a simple feature that can be easily turned off.

170
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
The issue is a canonical trend.

171
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,280
I think Shuttleworth's vision is extraordinary.

172
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,880
I think he's right on with convergence, but canonical at present is incapable of delivering

173
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
on its promise.

174
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,100
Hubris then showed itself when instead of going and selling his vision to a hardware

175
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,660
partner capable of fulfilling it, instead he goes to the carriers and to interweb financing

176
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,640
to complete his vision.

177
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,480
This is when we meet the underwhelming and self-congratulatory execution.

178
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,240
The sad ballot has played itself out over and over again.

179
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,760
The Dash, Ubuntu TV, Unity Desktop, Upstart and Mir, the same sad song.

180
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,520
I ask you, where is the shame in perfecting the desktop experience?

181
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,880
Where is the pride in being the creator of the most popular Linux base?

182
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,480
Where is the love for the open source community which Ubuntu is built on top of and made it

183
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
what it is today?

184
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,800
So Chris, as long as the sad song plays, please continue to beat the drum.

185
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Get it out of here.

186
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, this is an issue.

187
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,360
What do you think about it?

188
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,880
Are we now seeing a history of sort of over promise, under delivering?

189
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,400
I think it's important to report on it.

190
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,120
I think it's important to maintain the discussion about it.

191
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,400
Where I draw the line though, because I think this needs to be talked about and shared and

192
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,040
whatnot, but I think where people need to draw the line is that if it's affecting you

193
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,560
on your personal desktop to the point where you draw the line in the sand and say no more,

194
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,440
move on to something that's not creating problems for you and then continue the discussion in

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,640
a rational adult way like what we're doing on the show.

196
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,520
I think that's an important way to handle it.

197
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,720
I think it's a healthy way to handle it.

198
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,920
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

199
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,560
That's basically the summary of it, yeah.

200
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, I completely agree with you.

201
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,480
Now, I think Danny could have a point here.

202
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,040
We are starting to see a bit of a trend.

203
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,000
Unity was sold to us as the ultimate touch interface for all and then we realized, okay,

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,480
we got to rewrite it a whole bunch of time.

205
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,960
Ubuntu TV was sold to us like three CESs ago and here we are, it's still not there.

206
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,040
I don't know if I necessarily agree with upstart and mirror.

207
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,600
I think the jury is still out on upstart.

208
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,360
It was out before system D. It solved a problem and a need and it's continued to function

209
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
well.

210
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,040
Some people would say swapping out something like that's a big change.

211
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,680
Mirror obviously not looking great at the moment, but it's already playing out okay

212
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,180
on mobile and I think it makes some sense there.

213
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
So we'll see.

214
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,040
On the desktop, I'm not convinced, but I'm willing to give it a little more time, a little

215
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
more time on mirror.

216
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,920
See, for me, I think that I would need to see it accomplish a specific task or some

217
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,400
sort of a purpose.

218
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,840
Perhaps it's providing an experience with steam that maybe I'm not getting with another

219
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,720
distro, which at this time it's not.

220
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,520
Let's say that does in fact happen over time.

221
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
It solves a problem for you.

222
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,080
Yeah, it solves some sort of problem that I've got to identify.

223
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Then okay, fine.

224
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,400
I might stick with Ubuntu.

225
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,320
Right now, I'm using it on this other desktop simply because it's installed, it works, it's

226
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,200
fine, it's doing what it needs to.

227
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
It's okay.

228
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I don't care.

229
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,920
I just don't get too excited about that because the fact Linux has so many choices, I choose

230
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,760
not to get all excited and butthurt over Ubuntu's decisions and the team that develops that.

231
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,240
If they want to do something stupid, hey, more power to you.

232
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Go ahead.

233
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Yeah.

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,200
What we are witnessing is not necessarily an Ubuntu problem.

235
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,800
I think this is going to happen over and over again.

236
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,760
I think if you look back at the history of Linux, this already has happened just in different

237
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,260
iterations.

238
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,280
This is where we get into the big picture aspect of Linux and why Linux is stronger

239
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,080
than any one distribution and why that actually really matters and why I actually think that

240
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,160
Linux users today are not taking advantage of that fact.

241
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,200
But before we get to that, before we kind of shift gears into our main topic today,

242
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,480
I want to thank our sponsor, Ting.com.

243
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,860
Ting is mobile that makes sense, my friends, and my mobile service provider and Matt's

244
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,860
mobile service provider.

245
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,860
That's right.

246
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,000
They got the new Note 3 out now, Matt.

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm just putting that out there, just letting you know.

248
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Oh, yeah.

249
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,840
Now, one of the things that I think is absolutely fantastic about Ting is how they do their

250
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
rates.

251
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,920
You don't have to pay into a big plan that you only use.

252
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
Say your cell phone bill is like 60 bucks a month.

253
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,600
Well, how do you know if you're only getting $30 of value of that?

254
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,240
Ting separates out your voice, your megabytes, and your messages into individual buckets

255
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,300
and you just pay for what you use at the end of the month.

256
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,740
That way, if you're not a heavy voice user one month, you don't end up paying a whole

257
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,840
bunch of money into a voice line that you don't need.

258
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,800
On top of that, it's contract free.

259
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
That's right.

260
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,160
No contract, no early termination fees.

261
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,560
You only pay for what you use.

262
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,400
It's a flat rate of $6 a month.

263
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,760
You can have as many phones on that line as you want, sharing the pooled minutes, and

264
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,240
then you buy your phone.

265
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,280
When you buy that phone, it's contract free.

266
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,040
You own that phone.

267
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,500
That's probably the top five things I love about Ting, but it gets even better from there.

268
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,060
If you go over to linux.ting.com, you'll save $25 off your first month or $25 off a first

269
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,040
device if you are not bringing a device, and they're doing something that's kind of fun.

270
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,480
It only goes on until the end of October.

271
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,040
October 31st, they're getting a little Willy Wonka up in here.

272
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,880
Ting has these new really cool pouches that they're shipping out devices in, and they're

273
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
reusable.

274
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,120
You could actually just use it to carry your recharging stuff for the car or whatever.

275
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,440
They're really nice devices or cases, and in these cases, they have golden tickets.

276
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
No kidding.

277
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
There's going to be three tickets that go in the cases that get sent out, and there's

278
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
going to be three digital tickets.

279
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,380
When you buy a device from Ting between now and October 31st, there could be a golden

280
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,840
ticket, and that golden ticket will get you a year of Ting service for free.

281
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,780
If you're already considering switching to Ting, why not do it now?

282
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,220
You could potentially end up with a year of service for free if you order between now

283
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,340
and October 31st, but those of you who are considering ordering online may be bringing

284
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,580
your own device, and don't worry, my friends, Ting has stashed three tickets aside for you

285
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
as well.

286
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,760
They'll also be giving out three tickets to anybody who does a digital order.

287
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,760
There's going to be digital tickets, and they'll be given to random people who go through the

288
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,980
bring your own device process before October 31st.

289
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,000
Pretty fun, pretty cool, and it's another neat way that Ting sort of makes it even more

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,760
fun to switch, and right now, I think it's better time than ever because there's a good

291
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,720
chance you could get a year of Ting for free.

292
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
When you combine that with the fact that they have early termination relief program, you

293
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,280
can get up to $75 per line off.

294
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,200
You just buy your phone, port your number, then submit your claim, and they'll give you

295
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,500
up to $75 for the early termination and the fact that you're going to get $25 off your

296
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,020
first device or your first month if you bring a device when you go to linux.ting.com.

297
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,480
My friends, it has literally never been a better time to switch to Ting.

298
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Start saving right now.

299
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,440
Go use that calculator right there to calculate your savings.

300
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,840
I think you'll be pretty impressed.

301
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,200
If you ever have any problems, anything you ever need sorted out, just give them a call.

302
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
1-855-846-4389.

303
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,440
A real personal answer to the phone and a real personal take care of your problem.

304
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,760
They claim responsibility and they own that for you.

305
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
They really get it solved.

306
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,640
I really appreciate that.

307
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,720
That's so awesome, and I love the fact that for the golden ticket program, it doesn't

308
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,240
matter how you come into the program.

309
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,060
Whether or not you're bringing your own device, you can go digital, or if you actually are

310
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,980
purchasing a device through them, then you get a real ticket.

311
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
That's awesome.

312
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
Everybody wins.

313
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,200
So go over to linux.ting.com, tell Ting, thanks for supporting Linux Unplugged, and then go

314
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,800
get yourself some great service and a fantastic phone.

315
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,940
Linux.ting.com, and thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

316
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,800
They get a winner bell for being awesome supporters.

317
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,600
All right Matt, so I wanted to continue in the vein of digging through some follow-up

318
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,040
which will bring us to our main topic this week.

319
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,120
We had a really good post in the subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com this week from

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:23,840
raccoon1215, and the post was titled, I use old, crusty Debian Stable, and I love it.

321
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,440
This is such a great post, I want to just read a couple of highlights to kind of kick

322
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
us off here.

323
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,000
He said, I was inspired by the recent discussion on Linux Unplugged and I thought I would talk

324
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,360
about my desktop and server distro of choice, Debian Stable, technically CrunchBang, and

325
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,600
why I prefer it to, say, the way of Arch doing things, i.e. bleeding edge.

326
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,200
You kids and your fancy new shiny gooys and your Unity and your Cinnamon with your Gnome

327
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,480
and your KDE, my desktop was bland, gray, and that's the way I like it.

328
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,800
And for reference, here's my default settings of my desktop.

329
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,360
It's a very nice looking, very clean looking desktop, minimal for sure.

330
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,800
He says it is bland, it is gray, and here's another example of it with like Conkey and

331
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
doing some awesome stuff.

332
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Oh yeah.

333
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I mean, it looks really nice.

334
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,860
It is definitely a very good looking desktop.

335
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,620
He goes on to say, on a separate point, I don't want my desktop and Window Manager to

336
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
change on me.

337
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,120
Chris brought up the example of running a system update and having Gnome update from

338
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,320
3.8 to 3.10.

339
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,480
If such a drastic change happened to me, I would panic.

340
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,520
I don't want that to happen.

341
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,400
To quote RMS, get it out of here, which is right there.

342
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,620
He goes on to say, yes, packages are old and they don't and won't ever get updated until

343
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,760
the next version of Debian, but that's a good thing.

344
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,080
I don't want some program I use every day to suddenly change its behavior.

345
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
It should be predictable.

346
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,680
I don't want the init system to suddenly change to systemd, even if it does look awesome,

347
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,240
until the next release cycle.

348
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,340
In addition to that, sometimes old packages are just better than newer ones.

349
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,240
Sometimes newer versions of things lose functionality.

350
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,820
In conclusion, if I had to sum it all up, it would be this, unplanned change is bad

351
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,440
and Debian understands this.

352
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,560
Well, I think he's finding something that works well for him and he's someone that

353
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,640
probably likes, well, not probably, he definitely likes his experience predictable.

354
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,600
He wants to wake up and know that even after an update and everything that's going on,

355
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,380
everything is going to look and feel as it did.

356
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,000
Everything is going to operate the way he expects it to.

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I think that's awesome for him.

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I guess so.

359
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I totally see that.

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,720
To me, it smacks a little bit of being afraid of upstream.

361
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,600
People I think, I don't know.

362
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm like him to a lesser degree.

363
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,480
Yeah, and I can see that.

364
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
I can see that.

365
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm not near as extreme.

366
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,000
There are some things I just really want a hell of a lot.

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,640
I want to get the arch into the arch repos and see some of the latest, greatest stuff.

368
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
I do.

369
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,320
So, I think I called it, there's an old school way.

370
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,360
This was Earthy Pornstar, I just read the nick, Earthy Pornstar.

371
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,420
Earthy Pornstar commented that I called it the old school way or people who haven't gone

372
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,440
rolling haven't tried it in years, I believe were comments I recently made.

373
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,440
He says it's not just about updates breaking stuff, it's about general stability, compatibility

374
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,760
and functionality.

375
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,600
He goes on, and I thought this was an interesting comment, I, like all Linux desktop users,

376
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,040
am clearly downright insane for not using OS X as a daily driver desktop.

377
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,240
Yeah, Apple Inc is evil and all of that, but if we look at this from a factual, architectural

378
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,800
and even practical viewpoint, there is no comparison.

379
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,640
All the best parts of Macintosh plus BSD Unix, all highly polished, highly stable workstation

380
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,920
quality because obviously OS X only runs on Macs, therefore Apple can write close to 100%

381
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,960
of the drivers.

382
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,840
He goes on to say the Linux, he says, oh actually I wanted to point this out, he says, a resulting

383
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,960
in old school workstation stability that is downright perfection to be honest, I don't

384
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
know if I agree with that.

385
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,240
I wouldn't say perfection, I would say an expected experience would probably be the

386
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
kindest I could say.

387
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Yeah, okay, good way to put it, right?

388
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,880
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

389
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:56,200
His point here is that OS X has apps and it has this Unix architecture, but I think that

390
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,220
is true to an extent and I think we have to, even as Linux fans, have to acknowledge that

391
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,760
there is a really good compelling solution on the Mac side, right?

392
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,400
But it comes at not only a premium price that not everyone's willing to pay, but it also

393
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,360
comes at a limited set of options.

394
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,200
Basically on the Mac side, you can either do it or you can't do it, right?

395
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,200
True, yeah, I would say that's true because I mean in the past on my wife's Mac for example,

396
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,600
the adventures of trying to get HP printers to work or not work or will this update break

397
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
it?

398
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
That's not perfection.

399
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,920
I quite honestly get greater stability out of any one of my Linux computers than we see

400
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,200
on the OS X, quite honestly.

401
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,040
That being said, that's with drivers.

402
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,340
I would also say it's very boring.

403
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,520
It's extraordinarily boring.

404
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,100
You really can't do a whole ton of tweaking with it.

405
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,540
The only reason that I ever find myself in front of one is if I need something software

406
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,760
specific that I'm not getting on Linux and that would be it.

407
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,320
I'll always use that over using Windows because I really can't stand it.

408
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,120
Here's the point and this is funny because it shows you there's several different ways

409
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,320
to think about this because I take his last point here and I see it a completely different

410
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
way.

411
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,360
He says, the Linux desktop is easily still a good five years behind Windows and OS X.

412
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,160
Without LTS, Linux wouldn't even be in the ballpark.

413
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,960
So let's take the five-year thing and really look at this logically.

414
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,840
Factually speaking, when Windows 7 first came out and I had my mom's ton of peripherals that

415
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,040
I wanted to see what would work, 80 to 85% of them would not work because there were

416
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,760
not compatible drivers.

417
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Fact.

418
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,360
Linux, all of them worked.

419
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,040
No, I wasn't running Linux on our computer.

420
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,360
Another thing, we look at wireless drivers.

421
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
Drivers specifically would be a big thing there.

422
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,660
Also just overall stability.

423
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,280
Even in Windows 8, it's more stable than it is in the past but it's not that awesome.

424
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,840
I think you're right in terms of drivers and kernel stability.

425
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,600
I think what he's talking about is because I think in this context, he's talking about

426
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,800
certain applications perhaps like Final Cut and Photoshop and things like that that are

427
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,120
just way ahead that are only available for Mac or Windows.

428
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,120
That's factually true but that should be stated as such, not that the platform is five years

429
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,000
behind but the fact that the companies that produce software for those platforms, it's

430
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
just non-existent.

431
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's fair.

432
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,720
Here's where I see the disconnect is because his argument is that the LTS Linux is out

433
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,980
there and LTS is canonical term but Red Hat Enterprise, SUSE Enterprise, all of these enterprise

434
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,320
grade distros, they are a picture of time.

435
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,000
They're like when we look out into space and we see planets come back into us, the reflection

436
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,420
of light from millions of years ago.

437
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,120
It does not represent the true state of the Linux desktop.

438
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,220
In a sense, in a way, you could argue that LTS also holds Linux back because as we are

439
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,360
rapidly evolving at a pace that is way beyond what commercial software evolves at, as we

440
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,640
are rapidly evolving, that is lost by these LTS snapshots.

441
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,860
That is a benefit in the enterprise and that is a benefit for folks that want Debian stable.

442
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,620
That is a good thing but in terms of actually pushing the envelope forward, seeing where

443
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,800
the innovation is in the Linux desktop, you lose it a little bit.

444
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,760
You lose it in the forest because you can't see it.

445
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,040
I think in a sense, LTS is actually doing the opposite of what his argument is.

446
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,180
It has a role.

447
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:27,120
It obviously has a role but I actually think for desktop users that are savvy enough, people

448
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:34,280
who are comfortable with Linux, I think using an LTS is shortchanging yourself.

449
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
I don't agree with that.

450
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
I think that it basically comes down to two happy mediums.

451
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,800
I would not want to be in a world where we only had an LTS because I think that would

452
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,480
be incredibly limiting nor would I want to be in a world where we only had rolling releases

453
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,680
and bleeding edge stuff either.

454
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,480
I think you need both because honestly, if I'm going to put one of my family members

455
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,640
on a Linux distro, it's going to be something long term and something I have to screw with,

456
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
quite frankly.

457
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,160
I don't want to roll updates for them.

458
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't want them doing anything to it other than letting me manage it when I have time

459
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,920
and that's a long term release.

460
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,560
For myself, I'll probably take a bleeding edge option.

461
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,960
Okay, so let me jump from there and then we'll roll into mumble folks here in a sec too.

462
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,320
For you and I who are hardy enough and of course millions of other people who are hardy

463
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,840
enough to sort of tuck and roll when something happens in our rolling distribution, I think

464
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,200
we are benefiting Linux more so in the long run.

465
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
If we zoom out and we look at what's happening to Ubuntu, there could be an argument at least

466
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
on the desktop side.

467
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,720
Maybe they're about to be a shooting star on mobile or whatever the future of these

468
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,780
converged devices, maybe they'll come out on top as like a shooting star of that category.

469
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,760
That maybe is yet to be seen, but if we accept that a lot more people these days are less

470
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,680
satisfied with the Ubuntu desktop and that in some regards is in a decline, watching

471
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,880
the events around Ubuntu unfold, I believe once again is teaching us that something who

472
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,700
anyone who has watched Linux for a long time has probably noticed and like myself refuses

473
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,680
to probably fully accept that maybe all of them, at least not most of them in the grand

474
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:12,280
scheme of things, most distros die or change for the worse and yet many Linux users are

475
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:17,200
still they remain afraid of the raw Linux experience without the protection of their

476
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
distro masters.

477
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,440
They fear total system havoc without some bearded gatekeeper at the repo preventing

478
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,680
mass chaos from entering their system via a system update and they believe that only

479
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,000
the distros can protect them from this, the great distro masters, you know, and the thing

480
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,180
is Matt is four months now into the arch experiment using arch as my daily driver in production

481
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:41,340
and play and yeah, we just had Skype crash on us on an arch rig.

482
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,340
Is that because of arch?

483
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,340
I don't think so.

484
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,340
I think it's because Skype is crap.

485
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,960
Skype hasn't updated in months, but using it as my daily driver, it's taught me a really

486
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,640
big lesson and it's not about how elite arch is and it's not about how wikis can actually

487
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
not suck.

488
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,320
Those are lessons I did learn, but that's not what I'm talking about.

489
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,160
What I did learn is that upstream is amazing.

490
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,360
The near real time work that is being done is inspiring and encouraging me as the host

491
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,080
of the Linux action show to push on.

492
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,200
It is fun to watch and a joy to use and all of that is lost when you live inside this

493
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,320
distro box and I think there could be a case to be made that if you like me enjoy toying

494
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:22,080
with your computer more than actually playing video games and perhaps using a rolling Linux

495
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,880
distro, it's better for Linux and it's better for all that upstream code, it's in everyone's

496
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,040
best interest if we all live outside the box and we live a little closer to upstream.

497
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:36,160
If we can bear it, if we can be exposed to the bumps that come along with that.

498
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
I would agree with that.

499
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,280
Yeah, I think the more people that are living on the bleeding edge, the better because that

500
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,920
just of course as bug reports come out and things like that, it's making a better experience

501
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,780
so that when the next long term release comes along on another distro or whatever that is,

502
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
it's better for everybody.

503
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,480
It's a great ecosystem to live in.

504
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,680
I think that's awesome and it's something that we miss in a Windows or OS X world.

505
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,320
You're talking about very limited testers and what not.

506
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,320
I think you lose it just kind of even just living in the distro box.

507
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,780
I'll give you two examples that applied to me this week.

508
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,940
Two new apps that have rolled out, both covered by OMG Ubuntu which is ironic because you

509
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,800
can't really use either one of them in Ubuntu.

510
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,800
First is Corebird, it is a really, really, really nice Twitter client that is completely

511
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:22,000
designed for GNOME 3, minimal, does exactly what you need, has great features, has notification

512
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,560
support, but if you want to install it on Ubuntu, you're kind of out of luck if you're

513
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,560
on 13.04 because it requires GNOME 3.10.

514
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,240
If you want to install it on Ubuntu 13.10, then you got to go get the GNOME 3.10 PPAs,

515
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,200
install those first and then break your Unity installation and then install Corebird, right?

516
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
That's one app.

517
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,040
That's one new app that's coming out that is really interesting to follow.

518
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,960
That new app that's coming out, Polari, an awesome new IRC app for GNOME which again

519
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,080
is like IRC, totally follows the GNOME design, looks absolutely, incredibly amazing.

520
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,840
I have it installed right now on my Archbox, can't get it on Ubuntu.

521
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Right, exactly.

522
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,600
And this is what I'm talking about where I enjoy watching these new stars be born and

523
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,280
as soon as I see a news article on it on my rolling distro, I go get it and I have it

524
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,900
installed and now I get to play with it.

525
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,040
And I think that – and see, you're the type of person that really values that experience.

526
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Right.

527
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,120
But there are a lot of people out there that don't and a lot of people there that do.

528
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
And so I think there's going to be a balance there.

529
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,260
I think that as the people that really want that leading edge experience, they'll test

530
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,920
these apps and they'll just get better and better and better and by the time they do

531
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,400
roll down to an Ubuntu type distribution, the people that are wanting to remain in that

532
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,040
space will also be able to enjoy it.

533
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,960
It's kind of like paying for cable and getting your TV now versus waiting for it to end up

534
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
on Netflix.

535
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
Yeah.

536
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
It really is.

537
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
There's no right answer.

538
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,440
It's just I think everybody's kind of got their –

539
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Yeah, it's interesting.

540
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
It's a good analogy.

541
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Or it's like –

542
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Yeah.

543
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
You know, it's funny.

544
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
It's like on Usenet Blu-ray movies of stuff like two months not even released yet will

545
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
show up on Usenet.

546
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
It's like, wow, really?

547
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
It's like you could get it –

548
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,840
Yeah.

549
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Handycam.

550
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Yeah.

551
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
And I don't know.

552
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
I mean, maybe I'm wrong here.

553
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
And we can ask.

554
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
I'm totally up to mumble room.

555
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Chime in.

556
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,480
But I feel like if Polari and Corebird have more users using them, then those apps get

557
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,600
better and then we have a better chance of fighting the proprietary commercial desktops.

558
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,000
But when we live inside these cages where our bearded masters make sure everything's

559
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,340
perfect for us, we don't really push the envelope forward as fast as we could.

560
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Your thoughts, mumble room?

561
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
Okay.

562
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:30,440
See, the thing is, since I guess I'm the only one talking here, the thing is it depends

563
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,800
on what your situation is, what context you're using Linux in.

564
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,640
If you want to take the risk of only upstream packages or you want a more stable solution

565
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
for it.

566
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:49,000
So while the upstream philosophy and the arch philosophy applies to some people, it may

567
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,080
not apply to other people.

568
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,160
So again, you have to look at your situation.

569
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,800
It does not actually matter what philosophy you drive your Linux box with.

570
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,800
It matters what that box does for you.

571
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,440
Finally, there are still risks to getting upstream.

572
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,960
And so you have to make a choice whether you want the latest and greatest and whether you

573
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,760
want just another, a new IRC client, or are you happy with your old one and you can take

574
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,160
the safe option of not breaking your desktop.

575
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Right.

576
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I agree.

577
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,160
And so I think what I'm talking about is the category of people that listen to this show.

578
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,960
The people who are a little more savvy, a little more comfortable.

579
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,960
And I would say like how many, haven't all of us seen the scenario where you have a problem

580
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,760
with like say X chat and you submit a bug and then it gets marked as it's not our problem,

581
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
it's downstream.

582
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Invalid.

583
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Yeah.

584
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Yeah.

585
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
We've all seen this.

586
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,840
I guess if I wanted to type in and say something, when I was distro hopping, I was fine with

587
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,160
getting the latest and greatest on a distro.

588
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,040
But now anymore, I just want to install something and let it sit.

589
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,440
If I want a newer package of a software, I will usually go search for that Debian file

590
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,920
or that RPM file and get it myself rather than relying on the distributions or a repository.

591
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,960
That only gets you so far though, because pretty soon you run into some sort of like

592
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,640
Gnome 3.10 dependency or you know, you eventually require your underlying system to be current

593
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,920
to take advantage of the new apps.

594
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,360
Eventually, but I do upgrade often enough to where that shouldn't be a problem.

595
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,040
Like once every maybe six to eight months.

596
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Yeah, okay.

597
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Yeah.

598
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,640
Those distro snapshots in a way are a figment of our Slackware past.

599
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,120
Yeah, they are, I think.

600
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,080
I think that's exactly what it is.

601
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:40,200
Like we have security updates and functionality updates, but it's not exactly how today is

602
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
best utilized.

603
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
That's what I'm thinking.

604
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,160
And if I wanted to, I could on my laptop switch to the tumble read repository and get the

605
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
latest packages.

606
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
Right.

607
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Oh yeah.

608
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I run tumble read and I run rawhide.

609
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Right.

610
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
It doesn't have to be Arch.

611
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
It doesn't have to be Arch.

612
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
It could be rawhide.

613
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Yeah.

614
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
It could be tumble read for sure.

615
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,880
I do daily Ubuntu, like for the, before you guys done your Ubuntu review, I was running

616
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:11,560
daily for a week just to make sure that I knew exactly what I was trying to get to.

617
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,320
I guess part of my argument might be though is when you look at distros, there's some

618
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,320
distros that patch kind of heavily and there's some distros that don't patch very heavily.

619
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,360
And that's where you starting to get into the blame game is when you have a distribution

620
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
who patches a lot.

621
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,480
Maybe they changed the way their whole notification system works.

622
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,360
And so every app that wants to use the notification system has to have some sort of tweak applied.

623
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Right.

624
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,120
That's the only, that's the only thing where I kind of, I guess, I guess what I wanted

625
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:43,400
to, the point I wanted to get across is I feel like I was a person who I for a long

626
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,960
time believed that if we couldn't make a Ubuntu a success, it wasn't possible for Linux to

627
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,720
be a success, not because it wasn't good enough, but because you needed to have a corporation

628
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,320
behind it with a little bit of money that, you know, a company like valve could call

629
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
up.

630
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,320
You needed to have a community organized around it.

631
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,400
You needed to have a good, you needed to have a good established base with a good reputation.

632
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,760
And I thought, you know, there's really not another distro while there's other really

633
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,440
good distros and even better distros like they, none of them have all of that stuff

634
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,600
and are also targeted at the desktop and cloud, et cetera, et cetera.

635
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,080
And, and what I realized over the last four months is like Arch isn't really a distro.

636
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,720
It is just straight upstream with a bunch of great scripts and, and some, and some shuffling

637
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
around it.

638
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Yeah.

639
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,720
It feels almost like a roll your own.

640
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
For sure.

641
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,720
All right.

642
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
All the other distros.

643
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Yeah.

644
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Right.

645
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,600
But what that has shown me is like just what the community itself is producing is pretty

646
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
great.

647
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,560
Well, the distros, all the other ones with corporate backing are pretty much server or

648
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,880
corporate desktop based distros like Novell and Red Hat.

649
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,520
Ubuntu is the only desktop, you know, distro, but the reality is they actually make their

650
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
money on cloud.

651
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
You're right.

652
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Yeah.

653
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,640
Now, when you, now I was thinking when you back, back when you said notification, that's

654
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,320
why I stick to like the standard desktop environment, like KDE or even the GNOME 3.10.

655
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,200
I don't go towards Cinnamon or towards a Unity just because, you know, they're the biggest

656
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,280
ones out there, GNOME and KDE, or even XFCE out there, then they tend to use the standard

657
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,840
components for notifications and such.

658
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Right.

659
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
libnotify.

660
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Yeah.

661
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Yeah.

662
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,840
See, the thing I was saying about Ubuntu is that there are still disadvantages to having

663
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:42,560
a super popular Linux distribution because there was a post in the Linux subreddit where

664
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,340
a man said Microsoft Word deserves to die because it captured the market.

665
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,920
So what I'm saying is that you need what Ubuntu has established is a monopoly.

666
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:01,680
And so that has its own disadvantages that may not be looked at in several places, meaning

667
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:08,840
if Ubuntu is, if you have one OS that is the king and it has 80 percent market share or

668
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,640
70 percent market share, then everybody, regardless of the OS's flaws and merits, has to develop

669
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
for that.

670
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Right.

671
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,640
And so that restricts them.

672
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
That restricts the market.

673
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I don't know if they've reached that.

674
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
I don't know if they have reached that.

675
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,960
And I think the thing that kind of made me think that was, and I could be, I could be

676
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,420
way off the mark on this, but to me the thing that kind of brought that home to me was if

677
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,040
Ubuntu had reached that monopoly point where you must write for Ubuntu, kind of like the

678
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,080
reason I put our videos on YouTube is because if you don't put them on YouTube then there's

679
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,760
thousands of people who won't see them and I hate it, but that's where I put them.

680
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,240
And there are a lot of advantages to being on YouTube, even if I have to fight them constantly.

681
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:52,160
I think that when Valve chose to create Steam OS, that was Valve making a vote of no confidence

682
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,200
in the long-term viability of Ubuntu on the desktop.

683
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,320
And the reason I say that is because if you're going to hyper-focus on making the best thing

684
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
possible, you don't really need the baggage of creating your own OS, right?

685
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,600
I mean, they never had to have Steam OS when Windows was around and the Mac was around.

686
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,520
And then it was like, I think maybe Gabe was sitting back, smoking a cigar and thinking,

687
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,920
man, am I going to bet the whole farm on this canonical clown show?

688
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,440
Or am I going to just take the great work they've done so far and create my own, you

689
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
know, direction?

690
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,440
Right.

691
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,880
And I believe that them going with Steam OS proves that they do not hold that monopoly.

692
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,880
Yeah, but certainly, I was thinking this whole time, like, okay, what if the canonical patch

693
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,600
is a kernel so much that it eventually ends up like, let's say, Android?

694
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:48,000
I think that Valve did Steam OS just because of the brand, because most people don't even

695
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
know about Linux.

696
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah, you could be right.

697
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It's the same about Chromebooks.

698
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,240
Chromebooks are because Chrome is so popular and people know about it.

699
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I agree.

700
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,200
Though I do think, though, if we just had a world where maybe, you know, Ubuntu's market

701
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,240
dominance was so clearly established that they might just say, well, they've got that

702
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,440
part taken care of.

703
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,320
See, it might be, though.

704
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:16,040
See, the thing is, Steam not putting confidence into Ubuntu might not just indicate that Ubuntu

705
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,720
is not as popular.

706
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:23,120
It might just indicate that Canonical is very much a clown show and they have no idea where

707
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,120
they're going.

708
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:30,640
It does not reflect, I think, on their popularity and dominance on the Linux desktop environment.

709
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,920
I disagree with that a little.

710
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:45,160
I would say that the whole thing of them taking on Steam OS might be because Ubuntu is focusing

711
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
on mobile.

712
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,960
They're focusing on the tablet and they're not focusing on the desktop as much.

713
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,600
Well, Steam, they want to focus on the desktop because that makes sense where mobile makes

714
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
no sense to Valve.

715
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
No, that's what I'm saying, actually.

716
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I don't know.

717
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,600
I believe I heard somewhere where Valve wants to get into the mobile market.

718
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, I'm still surprised they haven't.

719
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,080
Yeah, but see, the thing is that-

720
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
They're going to get into mobile.

721
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
They're going to go into that little thing.

722
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,680
I say you've got the NVIDIA shield and that, so there's definitely a gaming market for

723
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,680
mobile devices.

724
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
And that's Android.

725
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:26,440
Well, if they wanted to do Linux, choosing Ubuntu is not exactly choosing Linux any longer

726
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,640
because Ubuntu doesn't patch upstream like all the other distributions do.

727
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,060
They are Ubuntu and are siloed as themselves.

728
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,440
They can't benefit or give back to the other rest of the community.

729
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,000
So if they chose Ubuntu, then they would be kind of locked into Ubuntu.

730
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,040
But they did choose Ubuntu.

731
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,440
They're just tripping off the top layer.

732
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
Exactly.

733
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,360
See, the thing is that does not mean Ubuntu is not popular.

734
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,000
It just says there are other factors.

735
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,120
I'm saying unless you're using something like Unity, I don't think you're locked into Ubuntu

736
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
just yet.

737
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,720
But again, like I said, the whole lock into Unity, Ubuntu thing with Unity, that's why

738
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,000
I use KDE because that's pretty universal across whatever distro I use.

739
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,520
Well, they're even saying screw Kubuntu, screw Zubuntu, screw Ubuntu, they're themselves.

740
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,920
They don't want to help them with their other derivatives.

741
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,520
What Ubuntu does quite well is it takes Debian testing and freezes it.

742
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,960
So it gives you a fairly up-to-date platform to work with.

743
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,160
No, Debian is old.

744
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
It's stable.

745
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
It rocks.

746
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
No, that's what Ubuntu does.

747
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,960
It takes Debian testing, freezes it for six months, and then you can work on it.

748
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,400
So you get quite an up-to-date platform that's stable.

749
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,120
Debian's testing is also stable, too.

750
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,120
It's not like a bleeding heads distro.

751
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
But it's constantly changing.

752
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
All right.

753
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Okay.

754
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,840
So I want to change the conversation for a second.

755
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,440
I want to play a mental exercise, and I'm going to toss it to Matt first, and then I'll

756
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,440
toss it to the mumble room.

757
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
I'm not saying it's going to happen.

758
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean, Ubuntu still could pull it out.

759
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You never know.

760
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,080
But let's say, well, fast forward three years down the road, SteamOS has been shipped for

761
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,440
a year, all the other distros have gotten better at what they do, and Ubuntu has continued

762
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
to decline.

763
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,160
Who is the new dominant distro?

764
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
What do you think, Matt?

765
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,400
What is the distro that pulls ahead, and why?

766
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,840
As much as I hate to admit it, and as much as I want to say, oh, it's going to be Fedora,

767
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
or, oh, it's going to be OpenSUSE.

768
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
Oh, I thought you would say Fedora, actually.

769
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
No, I can't.

770
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,480
I mean, realistically, if I'm looking at Ubuntu's targeting of new users, I hate to admit it,

771
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,540
and yes, I'm not a fan, but I'm going to say Linux Mint, because they do have their

772
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,520
Debian stuff on the back burner for just such an occasion.

773
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,840
If Ubuntu does a poo-poo, they're going to go with their Debian release, and that's what

774
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
they're going to do.

775
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,340
And I think that they have enough stuff going on internalized that they could make that

776
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
switch work.

777
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,800
They're not ready yet.

778
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,280
Would it be better for everybody, though, if it was like Mangero or Antegros, like somebody

779
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
that...

780
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,040
Oh, it would be awesome, but I think that we...

781
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,000
People have to remember, part of why Linux works is because it is not, the kernel is

782
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
not a democracy.

783
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,440
What about elementary OS?

784
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
What about elementary OS?

785
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,660
Elementary OS, again, you got these community-based distributions, that's great, but they come

786
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,840
and go, quite honestly.

787
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,600
I've seen a lot of community distros come and go, and at least with a corporate-backed

788
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,860
distribution, as much as I don't like a lot of them, you have something identifiable.

789
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,920
You can spot, okay, it looks like they're going to go downhill, or it looks like they're

790
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,920
going to pull the plug.

791
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,880
Okay, all right, but could the problem with Mint be, as much as I have respect for Clem

792
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,120
and all that he's done and all he continues to do, if Clem gets really super burned out,

793
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
what happens to Mint?

794
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,640
I mean, you've got one guy, right, whereas OpenSUSE is an entire company, there's an

795
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,560
entire team, you know, people come and go, right, and Fedora has got the backing of Red

796
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
Hat.

797
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,320
You've got these, Mint and elementary OS, they all suffer from a very, very short bench.

798
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,480
No, that's true, but here's the problem, though, is that you have to look at...

799
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,440
Fedora doesn't target users in any universe.

800
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,920
OpenSUSE, again, great distribution for the enterprise, not for the new user.

801
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,920
It's just not.

802
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,520
The tools provided are not targeting grandma.

803
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
Linux Mint is.

804
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,520
That does not mean in its current state that they don't still have some of those community

805
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,720
issues, but I see enough interest, resources, and I mean financial resources being dumped

806
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,480
in their general direction to where I think at some point, if Ubuntu did go south, I could

807
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,560
see some sort of a structure stepping in or perhaps even being formed around it.

808
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I think that...

809
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,360
Okay, Mumble Room, let me ask you this question and whoever wants to chime in, answer it.

810
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,920
So I think there's a couple of ways we could take this.

811
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,880
I want to ask you guys, is it possible we could have a three or four year, three years

812
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,480
down the road, three years down the road, Manjaro continues to evolve and they've really

813
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,080
got something where they've got a good combination of up-to-date packages, but certain snapshotting

814
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,960
of key components to make things stable.

815
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:58,000
Could Manjaro pull ahead as a lead distro candidate?

816
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,960
I don't think Manjaro has the corporate backing or the money behind them to make that happen.

817
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,960
It's completely community and granted Mint is completely community too, but I mean their

818
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,360
sponsorship is up the wazoo.

819
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
It is.

820
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
Yeah.

821
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,360
That's almost better, isn't it?

822
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
Yeah.

823
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,640
Well, the thing with Ubuntu, Ubuntu isn't brilliant, but what Ubuntu is extremely good

824
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,640
at is marketing.

825
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:31,520
I don't think there's another distro that is as good at marketing as Ubuntu is.

826
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,480
Elementary got close with their countdown, but I agree.

827
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,280
When you search for past stuff, Canonical can capture the headlines, especially for

828
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,080
the Edge campaign, they captured the headlines.

829
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
Yeah.

830
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,080
Yeah.

831
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,080
They're a PR machine.

832
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,640
They can do marketing like no one else.

833
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,120
They're really good at it.

834
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,720
I was thinking, Mint I think would probably pull out front, but I got a funny feeling

835
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,800
that Kubuntu might do quite well because that's got quite a lot of backing.

836
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
That I like.

837
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Yeah.

838
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
That I would like.

839
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Yeah.

840
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
I see.

841
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
I can see that.

842
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,800
What is... Kubuntu has a new backing.

843
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Yeah.

844
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,800
They have a corporate sponsor now.

845
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Yeah.

846
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Kubuntu's got blue systems.

847
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Yeah.

848
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,800
That's a big deal.

849
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
It's a completely separate operating system now.

850
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,360
I know it's still based on Ubuntu, but the KDE fellows have very little...

851
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
Right.

852
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,360
There's some heat there as well.

853
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,160
They're leveraging the... Kubuntu will continue to leverage the big advances we're going to

854
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,200
see in QT and the big adoption we're going to see in QT because of mobile.

855
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,280
That's the other thing about... That could play a big part in three years is as mobile

856
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,560
continues to influence the direction of Linux, QT is going to continue to become a more and

857
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,640
more dominant framework that people use.

858
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,520
I wouldn't be surprised if KDE distros do pull ahead because of that, right?

859
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Yeah.

860
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
One thing-

861
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,840
Didn't that say that the default is king?

862
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Right.

863
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Yeah.

864
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,840
How is Kubuntu default?

865
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Yeah.

866
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,640
It may be.

867
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,920
Well, they have a huge corporate sponsor in blue systems, but for blue systems, I think

868
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,040
that's a means to an end because their goal is for Netrunner, which is a derivative of

869
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,040
Kubuntu.

870
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,680
They live and die with Kubuntu.

871
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,960
If anything, my choice would be SUSE.

872
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,160
Because it's got a good mix of corporate backing and community or what?

873
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,920
Yes, and they can PR the hell out of themselves.

874
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
Yeah.

875
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
You know what?

876
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,640
The SUSE camp is really good at PR outreach.

877
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,400
They've got support, but they're not up to the snuff yet.

878
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,680
Well, I mean, think about it like Matt, before a SUSE release, you and I usually get an email

879
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,640
from somebody at the team who tells us what's new.

880
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,720
They usually send us pre-release ISO links for us to download so that way we can get

881
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,600
it before the mirrors get smashed and they'll give us a chance for our review.

882
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,600
That stuff's-

883
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
And the other thing-

884
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,600
But for their audience, I would say so.

885
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,200
But for the people that have Ubuntu targets, not even close.

886
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
No, I agree.

887
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Yeah.

888
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200
For us, oh yeah.

889
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,200
For geeks, they're awesome.

890
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,200
God, they're great.

891
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,200
They're all over the place.

892
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Absolutely.

893
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,560
It's about not just a single thing.

894
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,120
It's going to be a combination of things.

895
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,960
It's going to be good PR.

896
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,200
It's going to be low barrier to entry, like do you need to know anything about Linux to

897
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,400
get into it?

898
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,560
Your grandmas, your lifetime Windows users and things like that, if it isn't simple for

899
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,480
them to just pop in a disk, install it, and then it's easy for them to understand.

900
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,600
I think OpenSUSE, maybe not all of us like it, but OpenSUSE has Yast, and when you're

901
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,800
a Windows user, you want the control panel.

902
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,680
You want to be able to bring up the control panel and go add, remove software, detect

903
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,680
your hardware.

904
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,120
Well, I mean, that's what Yast does.

905
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,560
And I'm not saying that SUSE couldn't pull it off.

906
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,720
I'm not saying that at all.

907
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,040
I'm just saying we're focusing on, well, it's this, we'll know it's this, we'll know it's

908
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,040
this.

909
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,640
And it's really just a combination of things.

910
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,500
Right now Ubuntu just has a stranglehold on that.

911
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,080
But SUSE has all the combinations.

912
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,120
They have the corporate backing.

913
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,500
They have the build service, which is bringing in a whole bunch of new software.

914
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,040
They have the gallery and ladies and gentlemen, probably the number one thing for me right

915
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,320
now, they have Tumbleweed.

916
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,640
So you can also be rolling, right?

917
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,360
I mean, it seems to me like OpenSUSE has got a pretty good collection of a lot of the things

918
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,360
I like.

919
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:09,800
But the problem is at the end of the day, I can't imagine using Linux now without Pacman.

920
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Yeah.

921
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,800
So that's my thing.

922
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,800
But OpenSUSE is definitely my fallback.

923
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,800
Yeah, but that's going to be your advanced users.

924
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,800
Yeah.

925
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,800
They have Greg.

926
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,360
He's straight up next in line to Linus.

927
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,880
He's a straight up kernel.

928
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
He's our kernel master.

929
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
Oh yeah.

930
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
And he's at SUSE.

931
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Oh yeah.

932
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
Oh yeah, for sure.

933
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,880
They can support the hell out of SUSE for the user if need be.

934
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,880
I'm going to use the M word here.

935
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,400
But one thing SUSE has backing it too is an agreement with Microsoft.

936
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,880
Oh yeah, they do.

937
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,880
Yeah.

938
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,880
Yeah.

939
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
In fact, they're OpenSUSE.

940
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,960
They have an OpenSUSE week or they have like a SUSE week coming up, you know, like a conference

941
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,960
and Microsoft's one of the top sponsors.

942
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,680
I completely forgot about their enterprise desktop.

943
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
Right.

944
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,840
And I have to say one of my favorite things about OpenSUSE would be the build service

945
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,440
that people could set their software on.

946
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,440
Right.

947
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,720
I'm going to chuck something out there.

948
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,400
How about an Android Chrome OS hybrid?

949
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,680
I mean, if Google actually ends up sort of producing that where you can run Android apps.

950
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,440
I feel like Google has too much skin in the game to be a trusted platform provider like

951
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,120
that.

952
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,760
My system controlled by Java.

953
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,080
I don't think they're going to do that.

954
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,080
It's Java script.

955
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,080
It's different.

956
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,080
No, but Android is Java.

957
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,560
It would succeed because of Google, but it wouldn't be good.

958
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
Hm.

959
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:35,680
Well, I mean, if we're talking a hybrid that works the same way that Ubuntu's, quote,

960
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,600
convergence would, the Android part would still be Java, but the Chrome OS part would

961
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,600
not.

962
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
There has to be no Android Java.

963
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,600
It's not Java.

964
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
It's JavaScript.

965
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Like car is like...

966
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
Chrome OS is JavaScript.

967
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
It's too complicated.

968
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
Android is Java.

969
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,600
Yep.

970
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,600
Yes.

971
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,600
All right.

972
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Well, now we're going down the Android path.

973
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,600
We're going to close out, but I just leave you with this.

974
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,840
I wanted to make the case that if you have the stomach for it, and there's no judgment

975
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,860
if you don't have the stomach for it, but if you have the stomach for it, maybe consider

976
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,680
going with one of the rolling releases from whichever distro provides it just to kind

977
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,960
of...

978
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,520
It is really exciting to be on the edge and see things that are coming out that like core

979
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,840
Bird and Polari that are so cool and to play with them and you know how great it is to

980
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,840
get Gnome 3.10.

981
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:25,160
I mean, the Gnome project, let's be honest, it has been really, really hard to use Gnome

982
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,400
for a while and with Gnome 3.8, it got there and Gnome 3.10, they made it even better and

983
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,440
Gnome 3.10.1 is really looking good.

984
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,200
I look at this and I go, this is it.

985
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,480
We're getting there again and KDE 4 series, man, they are just...

986
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,280
I love their plan to make KDE 4 just rock solid where they work on 5.

987
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,300
Both Gnome 3 and KDE 4, I feel like, are once again getting to that point we were before

988
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:54,200
we had the big upset, before we killed Gnome 2 and moved to Gnome 3.

989
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,920
I feel like we're getting back to that...

990
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,080
We're not there just yet, but we are probably within one or two releases to being back to

991
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:08,120
that level of awesomeness and it's got nothing to do with any particular distribution and

992
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,720
that's what's so awesome about it.

993
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,200
There you go.

994
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,200
All right.

995
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:18,440
So again, I think at the end of the day, it's about what suits you best.

996
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,840
But yes, Ars does have a very good advantage on this, but again, what suits you best?

997
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:29,160
Because Gnome and all the other upstream packages are working, they're in beta, they're in alpha

998
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,900
and they're still working.

999
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,320
If they break, then that's where the trouble starts and they don't, which is a good thing,

1000
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,840
but if they do, then you have to deal with it.

1001
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,120
That's the cost you pay.

1002
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:48,960
But I feel like it's helping because I fully figure that if that happens, then I'll submit

1003
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,200
the bug thing, I'll watch the bug report and I'll participate in that part because that's

1004
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,200
what I can do, right?

1005
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,480
I can either donate money, but I'm too broke to do that, so I'm going to donate my time

1006
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,800
to submit bug reports and then plus for me, it also works out, I can talk about it on

1007
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,280
the show and stuff like that, but I think it's an interesting position for us to be

1008
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,520
in to maybe not have a direct influence on the future of our desktop, but at least help

1009
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,680
push it in the right direction as a user, which is way more, which is just so more empowering

1010
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,720
than you get on Windows and Mac and when we go back to that email where you said, well,

1011
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,680
the Mac is great for this and that, it's like these number one things, being tuned into

1012
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,000
the open source community, being able to have an impact on the desktop, being able to choose

1013
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,560
these things where we can move around, those are indispensable features for me that only

1014
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,360
Linux provides, the Mac can, no matter what Apple ships in the next version of Mac OS

1015
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,280
10, they will never be able to ship that, they can't, right?

1016
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,800
That's true, although Apple is a master of copying various Ubuntu features and I could

1017
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,560
make a list for the person to send in the email if they'd like that.

1018
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,400
Yeah, I think the copying goes both ways in some cases, but yeah.

1019
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,560
But it's very visual up front, front and center experiences that they copy, not back in.

1020
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,840
Now they just need to copy the App Store a little more and they'll really have something.

1021
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,720
All right, Mumble Room, well thanks guys, you guys were great today and I'm gonna wrap

1022
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,960
it up with an email from G H, he wanted to write in in defense of KDE.

1023
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,280
He says, Chris and Matt, how contradictory is it for people to leave Windows or Apple

1024
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,820
because they're tired of their intrinsic limitations?

1025
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,040
Only then to move to Linux and choose the most limiting working environments like GNOME

1026
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
or Unity.

1027
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,920
Wouldn't it be more logical to move to an environment, say, KDE, that gives you the

1028
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,720
most options to configure in any way you want?

1029
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,680
Spock would nod in agreement.

1030
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,320
For me, choosing between GNOME and Unity and say the others versus KDE is like choosing

1031
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:43,160
for the same price of zero dollars between an F-150 and a sovereign class enterprise.

1032
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:47,340
And guys, you're choosing the truck because you find the spaceship too complicated to

1033
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:52,760
use and it has too many options and the truck can still take you places and has technology

1034
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,960
I can understand and use without too much effort.

1035
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,800
I assure you that if an option to choose was real, you'd pick the enterprise even if it

1036
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,800
took you the rest of your life to figure it out.

1037
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,000
Your friend, G H.

1038
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,200
Well, I heard from Mavura and she was very clear in saying, Captain, the communications

1039
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,120
are not working because false audio doesn't play well with the KDE sound system.

1040
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,800
So once I get my communications up on the Starship, but the radio in my truck seems

1041
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,800
to work pretty well.

1042
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:21,680
I also would point out, I would also point out that Gene Roddenberry went to great pains

1043
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,660
to work with his designers to make sure that the enterprise was clean and streamlined because

1044
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:31,240
Gene believed that technology had become so perfected that to truly enhance human life,

1045
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,400
it would be natural and comfortable to use.

1046
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,840
I'm just pointing that out.

1047
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,960
So however that is natural and comfortable for you is how you should use it, right Matt?

1048
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
That's right.

1049
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,200
Who needs to hear anything with headphones?

1050
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,200
That's so GNOME.

1051
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,840
Yeah, that's for GNOME users, whatever, whatever.

1052
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,760
I guess if I want to have a modern sound experience, I do need false audio.

1053
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,680
I don't want some antiquated poppy back and forth crap that every other, yeah, no.

1054
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,960
Matt, I have in my hot little hand, right here, my Synology box that arrived, the Disk

1055
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,920
Station Synology, and as experienced, running Linux, supports iSCSI file servers, backup,

1056
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,920
surveillance cams.

1057
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
It's the DS412+.

1058
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,800
I think we'll do a review this Sunday on the Linux Action Show.

1059
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,800
Oh, nice.

1060
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,520
It has four, four terabyte drives in it, running Linux.

1061
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,360
All right everyone, well thank you for joining us for Linux Unplugged.
