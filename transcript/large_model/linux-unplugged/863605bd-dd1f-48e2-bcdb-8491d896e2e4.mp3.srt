1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
Yeah, so I would give Google Domains a very solid try.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,280
I don't think it offers all of the feature sets that something like a Hover does, but

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,100
they do straight up real simple mail forwarding.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,420
You can do that.

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,800
To configure that, it's very easy to go right in there and set that up.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,760
They definitely have made the process of setting your domain name, pointing it to somebody

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,560
else's DNS server, so like for what I did, for example, is I registered my domain name

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,720
and then I went over to DigitalOcean and I got the name server information from DigitalOcean

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,160
and it was very easy to plug that into my Google DNS account and point my domain to

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
my droplet.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,920
So now I've got – I had a droplet that I hadn't assigned a domain name to for a long

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
time.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,040
I was just going by IP because it was just for me, but now I'm going to share it with

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,580
Ange and I wanted something that she could just type in the domain name.

15
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,760
So I thought, okay, it's a good excuse to try out Google Domains.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,800
So I went over to Google Domains because it just opened up to the U.S. public today.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,080
I bought the domain.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,040
The process is – it's very straightforward, just like you'd expect.

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,120
You essentially search for the domain.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,160
You use your Google Wallet account to pay for it, so whatever funding source you have

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,560
for like the Play Store is the funding source you'll use to buy the domain.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,080
Once that's set up, you go in there.

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,680
It's very simple, like five-button interface to manage it.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,480
One nice thing is it lists all your domains in a nice list and the last item in the column

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,440
is how many days remaining on that registration, so you get a – it's really very straightforward

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,340
like how long you have.

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,340
Very clear.

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,680
It's very minimal.

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,720
And once you click into it, the fields are very basic.

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,760
There's some help.

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,280
But like all Google products, if you want to dig any deeper, like for example, when

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,480
I wanted to find out if I could get privacy for a.us domain, they have a learn more link.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,740
Once you click that, of course, it sends you into the hell of Google help pages which just

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,460
go deeper and deeper and never really answer your question.

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,500
So just like all Google products, if you're comfortable, you'll be able to get something

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,080
done really quick.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,240
But if you go outside their area that they have support for, it's – you hit a wall.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,600
You're like, there's nobody you're going to call.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,960
For example, and this is an ad for Hover, they're not a sponsor, but with Hover, they

40
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,800
are my domain name registrar and I had a very complicated thing happen that was like mistakes

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,920
on multiple registrars and I – there was like literally I was trapped between three

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
different registrars who had had like an internal database that disagreed with an external.

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,100
It was very complicated and one call to Hover resolved the entire thing whereas with Google,

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,240
I would have been kind of just out of luck I think.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
I don't know exactly.

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,920
They say they have support, chat, phone or email support.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
I haven't tried that yet.

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm kind of skeptical but Google has been stepping that up recently so.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,080
So is it just a registrar or can you actually manage your DNS zone files from within Google

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,120
domains?

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,660
You can go in and manage some of it.

52
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,720
So a pre-specified amount of stuff like your name servers, you can set up DNSSEC, your

53
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,640
registered hosts, you can add synthetic records to do common things like domain forwarding

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,600
or you can go to Google apps, custom resource records so like your type A domains, your

55
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,160
C names, your MX records, PDRs.

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Oh, okay.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Okay, so you can.

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Okay.

59
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
Yeah, you can set all that stuff up.

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Very minimal interface.

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,400
I'd show it to you but it has all my IP info in it.

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
The pricing is very fair.

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,920
It was $12 for a.US domain, $20 I think for a.com – no, not 20.

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
It was very – Harold, you know what?

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
I'll search for one right now.

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Let's see.

67
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Give me a domain name.

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Let's see.

69
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Let's do Ubuntu Touch.

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
Let's see what we get.

71
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
All right.

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
One quick –

73
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
So here I can show you this UI.

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,560
So now it searches – it gives you a little frowny face for the UI – for the domains

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
that are not available.

76
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,960
So I get frowny faces for Ubuntu Touch.com and Ubuntu Touch.net but I get green smiley

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,600
faces for Ubuntu Touch.org and then it's also recommended Ubuntu Touch.equipment,

78
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,240
Ubuntu Touch.properties and Ubuntu Touch.systems.

79
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,600
So the Ubuntu Touch.org, $12 a year.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,720
Ubuntu Touch.equipment and properties and systems are like 20, 30 and 20 a year.

81
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,560
And so it looks like.coms are about 12 bucks a year.

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Same with.US.

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,200
One question I have is hover offers volume pricing.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
So like the more domains you have on your account in hover, the less you pay for renewals

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
for all of your domains.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
Yeah.

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,320
Does Google appear to offer anything like that?

88
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
I don't think so.

89
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,640
I don't – I haven't played with it long enough maybe to be able to fully answer that

90
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,640
but from the looks of it, you're just doing one domain at a time and it's just always

91
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,600
the same flat right every time.

92
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,720
You can add multiple domains.

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,760
There's like a cart but I don't think there's any discount but I could be wrong.

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,560
I gave – over the weekend I gave their latest testing ISO a spin.

95
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
And it's kind of slick.

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,540
So like one thing that's nice is it does some notifications that are pretty good.

97
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,700
And one of the things it'll do is it'll actually update the installer.

98
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,280
So I boot the live environment and I get a notification that comes up and says, hold

99
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,360
on a second, Antigros is updating the installer.

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
It updates –

101
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah, I just had that as well.

102
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Yeah.

103
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,720
And it closes and reopens it so you get the latest installer which is pretty nice.

104
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
And –

105
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
That's good.

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,280
So I started with the KDE 4 implementation and when I was done, what I got was it's

107
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,960
KDE 4 but with Numix and kind of a GTK look.

108
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,920
And before you freak out because that sounds horrible, I am surprised at how not horrible

109
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
it is.

110
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,460
It flattens KDE out a little bit.

111
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,520
It takes away the blue glow and the very oxygen look of it.

112
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,920
You're going Numix icons.

113
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,840
It's kind of a GTK look to it but I actually think it's – I don't know if I'm going

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
to stick with that look but I was surprised how well they were able to take that and translate

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
it to KDE.

116
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,520
And the benefit was the GTK apps also looked – everything looked kind of at home.

117
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,000
It was kind of – I was like, wow.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're giving me the itch.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,240
Do you want a little bit of Arch Linux inside info?

120
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Yes.

121
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Of course.

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,280
So we had voting for new Arch Linux to use yesterday and one of the six trusted user

123
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,000
– we're the people that look after the community repository and moderate the AUR

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and other stuff.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,080
Look after backend infrastructure.

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,000
But one of the new to use is the maintainer for LXQT.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, cool.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,600
So I guess what's coming to Arch Linux into the official archive soon.

130
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Yeah, no kidding.

131
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
And we'll probably have first class support.

132
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
That's great.

133
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Yeah.

134
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Yeah.

135
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,760
I know him quite well because he's on the old existing LXDE team and he's the guy that

136
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,640
does all of the package maintaining for LXDE for Lubuntu.

137
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,280
So he's come the other way.

138
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,920
So he's come from Ubuntu into Arch and I've just made the transition from Arch to Ubuntu.

139
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,040
So we've sort of passed each other in between there somewhere.

140
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,040
Poppy I was wondering, did you ever end up getting a new laptop?

141
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,000
I know that was on your shortlist.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,960
No, I postponed it because my warranty on the ThinkPad X220 doesn't run out until next

143
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,160
year and the and I wanted to keep hold of it just to keep it going until it dies really

144
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,760
because I don't really need a new laptop.

145
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,440
I was wondering if you saw that new XPS 13 from Dell.

146
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Yeah.

147
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,100
The new one looks awesome.

148
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:06,680
But also I like the new ThinkPads that have put back the old keyboard with the proper

149
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
keyboard.

150
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
It's a proper keyboard.

151
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Yeah.

152
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Yeah.

153
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Yeah.

154
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,120
Too bad the latest unbelievably I couldn't believe it.

155
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
But I have to double check.

156
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
I could be wrong.

157
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,240
It seems so impossible to believe.

158
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,000
I would definitely double check this.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,600
But I swear, after I saw the announcement of the new Lenovo's, I went look to the video

160
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,060
cards and their Intel 4800s.

161
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,060
How can that possibly?

162
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Is that bad?

163
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Yeah.

164
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,060
Yeah.

165
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Yeah.

166
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
That's really bad.

167
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,160
Because I mean, like the Dell XPS is the Intel 5500 and when you get to 5000 and you're in

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,200
the Iris series graphics, it's a whole new category of Intel graphics.

169
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,640
Oh, I didn't realize that.

170
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,880
5000 years from when to 5500 is the new Broadwell chip.

171
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Their Iris is 6000.

172
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
The Lenovo must be.

173
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Oh, OK.

174
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
The Lenovo must not be.

175
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,040
So they're still based on the Aswell.

176
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
That seems odd though, right?

177
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,080
Well, no, because Broadwell isn't even shipping yet, technically.

178
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,280
Like it's just starting to come out now, like it was announced at CES.

179
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,360
Oh, so these laptops are all having, these laptops today shipping are with a processor

180
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,400
that's already been replaced, essentially.

181
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Maybe a little bit, but.

182
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Yeah, I guess it's gotten so good at this point, doesn't matter too much, though.

183
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,960
And Barton said there will be an Ubuntu version, so that's good.

184
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Yeah.

185
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,960
Yeah.

186
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
So that's cool.

187
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,800
Did you guys all see Linus's rant on Google Plus that happened like back in December?

188
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
I missed it.

189
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,580
And I just wanted to read it real quick because I really hate HFS Plus a lot.

190
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,080
So there was this talk about, I love it.

191
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,360
It's this Google Plus thread and they're talking about a bug and a wild Linus Torvalds appears

192
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,120
with a great HFS rant.

193
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,460
He says, and he goes on to talk about how there's this bug, and he talks about how there's

194
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
issues with HFS.

195
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,200
He says, quite frankly, HFS Plus is probably the worst file system ever.

196
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
Christ, what shit it is.

197
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,040
NTFS used to have similar issues with canonicalizing UTF-8 using non-canonical representations

198
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
of slashes.

199
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,480
I think they at least fixed them.

200
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,680
The OS 10 problem seems to be fundamental.

201
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,780
He goes on to, which is like, okay, so fundamental problems, okay, all right.

202
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,920
So then the thread kind of gets hot, right?

203
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,600
And they start kind of, some people come in, come on, Linus, they're trying to call him

204
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
out.

205
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,000
Linus, then some people agree with him.

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,040
He comes back in to say, further in the common thread, the true horrors of HFS Plus are not

207
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,120
in how it's not a great file system, but in how it's actively designed to be a bad file

208
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,040
system by people who thought they had good ideas.

209
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,500
The case in sensitivity is just a horrible, horrible bad idea.

210
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,000
And Apple could have pushed fixing it back in that era.

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They didn't.

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,640
They doubled down on a bad idea and they actively extended it very, very badly to Unicode.

213
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,800
Okay, so NTFS did some of the same, but Apple really took it to the next level with HFS

214
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Plus.

215
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,180
There's some excuse for bad case in sensitivity in a legacy model.

216
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,520
We didn't know better.

217
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,000
But people who think Unicode equivalency comparisons are a good idea in a file system shouldn't

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,760
be allowed to play in that space.

219
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,320
Give them some paste and let them sit in the corner, eat it, and they'll be happy and they

220
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,880
won't be messing up your system.

221
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,800
He goes, and Apple lets these monkeys work on their file system, seriously?

222
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,600
It's not even a paste-eater quality thinking.

223
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,840
It's actually actively corrupting user data by design, Christ.

224
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,260
There are lots of good reasons not to move to ZFS though, cough Oracle, but they could

225
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,040
have pushed people to a case sensitive HFS, which would have then made it much easier

226
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,800
in the long run to migrate to anything else.

227
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,280
But no, this is not the choice Apple took.

228
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,080
There is a case sensitive option, but Apple actively hides it and doesn't support it.

229
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
The stupidity.

230
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
It burns.

231
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,500
Here's the thing though, when is Apple ever not doubled down on a bad idea?

232
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,480
Every time they've had an idea, they've always said, yeah, we're still doing this.

233
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,240
They've never admitted that they are wrong.

234
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,640
Yeah, they even found a way to ship a one button mouse that depending on what you do,

235
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,880
actually has six buttons.

236
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,120
So like, yeah, they've always just like, they won't admit when it's a bad idea.

237
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,400
I've got a Logitech mouse that's like that, but I love it.

238
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Yeah.

239
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Yeah.

240
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,680
I mean, it's not necessarily a horrible idea, but it does kind of feel like they, even there,

241
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
they won't admit they were wrong.

242
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Yeah, that's true.

243
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
That there's use there.

244
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
All right.

245
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
So there you go.

246
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,120
Linus Torvalds rant segment over.

247
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
We should have a Linus Torvalds rant jingle, I guess.

248
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
Honestly, it's really too bad that Apple gave up on porting ZFS.

249
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Yeah.

250
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,640
When Oracle, as soon as Oracle got involved, they're like, nope.

251
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

252
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,080
It's like, well, if they had just held onto that and waited and then, oh look, open ZFS

253
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,440
and they could have used that and every Apple user would be a happy camper.

254
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah.

255
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
It's funny.

256
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,880
You know, I guess, I guess I just would, I would have expected Apple to keep working

257
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:40,840
with Oracle since Jobs and Larry Ellison were BFF, but I don't know.

258
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,840
So yeah.

259
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
I mean, it really is.

260
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,580
And the only reason why I really want to even bring it up is because we were talking last

261
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,160
week about how power users are getting sick of the Mac.

262
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,480
Well, I mean, what I like is I have been bitching about HFS for a few years now because of production

263
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
problems.

264
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,000
And now more and more people are talking about it and it's going to be more of these kinds

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
of things that'll come out.

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah.

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
HFS is horrible.

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Horrible.

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's barely finding the microphone

270
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,620
in all of this Pacific Northwest fog.

271
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,880
My name is Chris.

272
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
And my name is Matt.

273
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,920
Matt, is it foggy up in your neck of the woods like it is down here?

274
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,200
It's just lingering.

275
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,080
I haven't stuck my head outside yet, but I see sunshine coming through my blinds.

276
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
I think we're okay.

277
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
You are such a geek.

278
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I am, right?

279
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
I haven't gone outside today.

280
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I know.

281
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,800
I really haven't gone outside if I hadn't had to drive into the studio either.

282
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
So I guess.

283
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,920
I mean, I only go as far as the wifi allows.

284
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
Right.

285
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
That's a good point.

286
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
That's a safe bet.

287
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Yeah.

288
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
It's been like this since last week.

289
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,000
We've been surrounded in a fog, but in this fog, we have that time to reflect on the state

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,800
of Linux, and we have a great show coming up for you today on the Linux Unplugged show.

291
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,440
So coming up, just a little bit, we're going to do some quick feedback this week.

292
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,560
And then I want to discuss the four best new Linux distributions, according to Jack Wallen

293
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,920
for 2015.

294
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,640
And at first, I came into this list, and I'm thinking, the four best lists.

295
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
These lists.

296
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
These lists.

297
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
I read the list, and I'm like, hold on.

298
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Hold on a second.

299
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
I think Jack's on to something.

300
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,560
These are some compelling distributions, and you might not have heard of a couple of them.

301
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,920
We're going to talk about that plus then, after we gave the Mac a good bashing last

302
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,760
week and in the pre-show.

303
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,920
It is only fair that we get a little real about some Linux issues, but I actually think

304
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,720
it's a really great thing.

305
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,200
And it's a list, yes, of problems, but of problems I think are addressable, and we'll

306
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
talk about that in the second half of the show.

307
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
So Matt.

308
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Yeah.

309
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
We probably should get started.

310
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Probably so.

311
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,840
I'll put everything aside, close my VLC window, stop watching YouTube, and maybe we'll take

312
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,640
a moment and welcome the Mumble crew to the Unplugged show.

313
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,480
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

314
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Good morning.

315
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Hello.

316
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Hello.

317
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Hello.

318
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Hello.

319
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Hey.

320
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Hi-oh.

321
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,640
So before I managed to hit record today, Popey admitted to the entire live stream that he's

322
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
switched over to Integra.

323
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,800
He's now a happy Integra user.

324
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,800
And I'm still gainfully employed.

325
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,520
I had to give you a hard time.

326
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,200
No, actually, I downloaded the latest Integra release.

327
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,880
They just actually got the testing ISO, but Wimpy reminded me they just released a new

328
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,960
stable ISO two days ago.

329
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,520
And I, Matt, I tried something that was crazy.

330
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:25,320
I did the KDE version of Integra, and when it installs, it's kind of a GTK-looking kind

331
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
of KDE.

332
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,360
Now, before you puke, it's Numix-themed, and it actually works.

333
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,080
It's sort of a flatter KDE.

334
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,200
It's still KDE, but with a slight GTK look.

335
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,920
And the result is both Qt and GTK apps look great on the desktop.

336
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
It's overall, it's really, it's really well done.

337
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
It's interesting.

338
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
I don't know if I like it a lot.

339
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,440
I don't know if I'm gonna stick with it, but I was pretty interested in it.

340
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,400
So anyways, go check out the latest Integra ISO, they just released them and-

341
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Screenshots where it didn't happen.

342
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,840
Oh, okay, okay.

343
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:59,800
Actually, Chris, the installer is running right now on a spare laptop.

344
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
And I was surprised.

345
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,060
I like you, you mentioned earlier the auto update thing the installer has, and I went

346
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,080
through the installer and it looked really familiar and I've realized where they borrowed

347
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
some of the design from.

348
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,800
It looks exactly like the Ubuntu installer.

349
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,040
I actually, when I first reviewed Integra ISO, I made the mistake of assuming they had

350
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,680
forked the Ubuntu installer.

351
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
I was very-

352
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,160
Right, no, it's their own thing, isn't it?

353
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Yeah.

354
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
And it's neat.

355
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,080
Like Popey says, when you boot up the live environment, it automatically updates so you

356
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,080
have the latest installer.

357
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,320
Not to mention, once installing all of the packages, they're the absolute latest version.

358
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,040
So if you're installing right now, you're gonna get kernel 3.18, which is crazy, and

359
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
it's great.

360
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
What were you gonna say, Wimpy?

361
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,760
I was gonna say that when they started making their installer, it was heavily influenced

362
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,920
on Ubiquiti and they actually had Ubiquiti's source in their tree as reference for quite

363
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,000
some time.

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,480
That was why I actually thought it was.

365
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,800
So in my review, I sort of matter-of-factly stated it was a fork of the Ubuntu installer

366
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,400
because I went to their Git repo and I saw the code for the Ubiquiti installer and then,

367
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,120
even once they made their own, they still took some assets and stuff.

368
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,320
So some of the files were actually named Ubuntu something.

369
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,760
And so I thought, well, dead ringer, it's just a fork, right?

370
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,640
I actually looked at the freaking code and I'm like, dead ringer.

371
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,320
And so I say it in the show and then I got a lot of people contacting me, including the

372
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,360
Anticross developers, like, no, actually, we wrote that from scratch and we're kind

373
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
of proud of it.

374
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

375
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Yeah, it's good.

376
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Yeah, it seems pretty nice.

377
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
It is really good.

378
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Because the Ubuntu installer's really nice, too.

379
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Give me the itch.

380
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,160
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

381
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
I had the itch, too.

383
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,200
I think they make a cream for that.

384
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
You know, there's a branding opportunity here.

385
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah, that's true.

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's very true.

387
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay.

388
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
All right.

389
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,160
So anyways, just wanted to give those guys a plug because they do great work and Popi

390
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,800
reminded me a little bit before the show started and then I had a weekend adventure that I

391
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
forgot to share with everybody.

392
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,400
So let's cover another distribution that's been getting a lot of attention.

393
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,960
And I think it's a favorite around here, Ubuntu Mate, or Matai, or Matati, or Mate.

394
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
So Eric writes in.

395
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
He says, it's awesome.

396
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,360
And I thought this was a great story.

397
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,440
Different Eric, not producer Eric.

398
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,600
And he was struggling.

399
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,120
He was not super happy with the direction of Unity after 12.04.

400
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,640
He says, when it came out, Ubuntu 12.04, I was very excited.

401
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,120
And he says, but then Unity had to show its face and I quickly found out what garbage

402
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,160
it is and my unhappiness began.

403
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,760
I downgraded to Ubuntu 10.04 and I found I liked it more than 12.04.

404
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,040
I tried Gnome 3 before downgrading to see if it was any better than Unity, but Gnome

405
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,080
3 is such a pig with different makeup, only really stupid.

406
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,440
Sorry, Chris, I know you like Gnome 3, but I'm just channeling my Endel Tervalds here.

407
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,800
Of course, that sounds like he's trying an old version if he's doing it on 12.04.

408
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,080
I'm so disappointed by the direction of the Gnome team took.

409
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,460
It feels like it's different just for the sake of being different with absolutely nothing

410
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,600
redeeming for the power user.

411
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,040
Everything useful is turned off by default.

412
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,080
By the time you're done turning things on, the desktop sort of resembles Gnome 2.

413
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,760
So why bother, I asked myself.

414
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,080
I tried Mint 17 and I was less frustrated by Cinnamon, but it still felt like a skinned

415
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Gnome 3.

416
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,400
Guys, I have been truly miserable since Ubuntu 12.04 and when I heard on your show about

417
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,800
Ubuntu Mate, there was a glimmer of hope.

418
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,480
I thought I'd give it a try.

419
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,880
Ubuntu Mate is what every Ubuntu since 12.04, including 12.04, should have been.

420
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
Mate is as fast and snappy as Gnome 2 was.

421
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,560
It's clean and I know where everything is, no need to search for anything.

422
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,760
Ubuntu Mate makes me feel like I spent the last few years in a nightmare and I finally

423
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
woke up.

424
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,100
I have my desktop, I have my apps like I did before, but now I have access to sites like

425
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,160
Netflix and apps like Steam.

426
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,160
No shitty UI, no crappy ads from Software Center suggesting what I should try, no random crashes

427
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,120
or UI elements disappearing, my system never uses more than a gigabyte of RAM.

428
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,720
I'm just so happy with Ubuntu, mate.

429
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,480
I'll just say it again, it's an effective desktop, yet I have way more than before.

430
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,320
Hopefully Windows 10 will do the same for Windows users that Mate did for Gnome and

431
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,600
just fix it while adding tons of more functionality.

432
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Eric.

433
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,040
Wow, that's pretty steep praise there.

434
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,040
I should say so.

435
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Yeah, it definitely feels like it.

436
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Sliding inside.

437
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Yes, yes.

438
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
You should be.

439
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
I think people will really appreciate that.

440
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,720
Eric, you take issue though with maybe basing it on a really old version of Gnome, right?

441
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:24,560
Yeah, basically 1204 has Gnome Shell 3.4, which is utter crap.

442
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,040
If he were to use a more current version, I'm sure he would have a better experience

443
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:36,400
because then you've got the client-side decorations, you've got the better...it's just better overall.

444
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,560
And like some Destros like Fedora are pre-shipping the Gnome Classic environment now, so it's

445
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
much...yeah.

446
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
True.

447
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,680
And you can obtain that in Ubuntu Gnome as well.

448
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,480
Wimpy, did you see our interview with the Mate developer on Sunday's Linux action show?

449
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,760
I did, yes.

450
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,240
What did you think about his comments on the transition to GTK 3?

451
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, I obviously agree.

452
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,360
I'm deeply familiar with the difficulties we've had.

453
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:11,120
And although I've prepared that unofficial repository with Mate built against GTK 3 for

454
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:19,200
Arch users, and that when Mate 1.10 ships, I will push the GTK 3 versions into the official

455
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,880
Arch repositories, but they are very clearly tagged as experimental.

456
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,080
And the reason for that is that whilst they're working fine against GTK 3.14 at the moment,

457
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,080
as with every GTK 3 release, we can't be sure what's going to happen, change, and break

458
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,040
with 3.16.

459
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:48,160
So we're kind of hoping for the day that Gnome 4 comes along, and GTK 4 comes along, so that

460
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,320
then we have a stable API to target.

461
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Wow.

462
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,400
Wow, I can't believe you're already hoping for GTK 4.

463
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Meanwhile, I'm...wow.

464
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
It's imminent, I think.

465
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I think it's imminent.

466
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,600
I think it's going to come soon.

467
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,720
And the other thing that...you asked Stefano about MIR support and Wayland support.

468
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,040
So Wayland support has been on our roadmap for some time, and definitely Stefano is very

469
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,720
keen to start work on Wayland, but quite recently, probably...I first heard about it around October

470
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:30,080
time last year, Canonical have started to commit MIR compatibility patches for GTK 3.

471
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,880
So if that continues and comes to fruition, technically, it should be possible through

472
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,720
GTK 3 to target Wayland and MIR.

473
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,120
And what we would need within the Marte team is somebody who's enthusiastic about actually

474
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,320
doing it, because it's a small team, and there's lots of jobs to be done.

475
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,440
So there's opportunity for somebody to come in there and own that.

476
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Yeah.

477
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
Yeah, I think it's dependent on Canonical finishing their work, actually adding the

478
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,080
support to GTK 3, but I should imagine that's going to happen given this push this year

479
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,880
for Unity Next.

480
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,240
Now to black out 24's question, and I don't know in the case of Wayland, but in the case

481
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,040
of Wayland or MIR, is there extra burden on the Marte project to do things like the compositor

482
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,700
or something like that?

483
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,960
Is there more work you'll have to do besides just toolkit stuff, or is the toolkit going

484
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,000
to bring most of that stuff for you?

485
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yeah.

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,200
Well, with regards to Wayland, this is one of the conversations I had last year.

487
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,240
GTK 3 alone is all we need to bring Wayland support to Marte.

488
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,560
We don't need to sit on top of Mutter or anything like that.

489
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Nice.

490
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Very fantastic.

491
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,520
Well, I'm really interested to see how that goes.

492
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,800
Do you think, is this going to be a transition that will be very, is there going to be a

493
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,520
big change for users when Marte goes to GTK 3, or is the theming going to hide a lot of

494
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
it?

495
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Or what's that going to look like?

496
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Could be a big change.

497
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Not really.

498
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,440
If you install it now, you can install that unofficial repository now.

499
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,640
So if you run up a virtual machine with, do it the easy way, go with Antergis, seeing

500
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,800
as though you were talking about that earlier.

501
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,760
They have Marte support, and I know they have Marte support because I helped add it.

502
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,560
You can start with that, and then they use the official Arch repositories.

503
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,720
You can then add my unofficial repository, and it's designed to clean the upgrade from

504
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
the official repository.

505
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:40,960
So you could jump from Antergis with Marte 1.8 built against GTK 2 to GTK 3 for Marte

506
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,480
1.9, and you'd be able to see firsthand what it looks like, and by and large, it looks

507
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
very similar.

508
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Interesting.

509
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Yeah.

510
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
Almost the same.

511
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
I mean very close.

512
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,360
There's a few applications where because GTK 3 just implements things differently, it looks

513
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,400
a bit different.

514
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,560
So when there's tabs in things, the tabs are laid out a little bit differently, but by

515
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,560
and large, it looks very, very similar, and there are a few Arch users that are actually

516
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,760
running that GTK 3 version and have been running a GTK 3 version for about six months now.

517
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,280
So it is good enough as a daily driver.

518
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,160
I saw the write-up on how to do it, and I thought about it.

519
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,400
I think I even linked to it in the Linux Action Show show notes for Sunday, and I thought

520
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,760
about doing it just for the interview so that way I could run it, but I ran out of time.

521
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
But it looks interesting.

522
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,480
I think I'm going to try it soon.

523
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
See what I notice.

524
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
All right.

525
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Yeah.

526
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,480
Okay.

527
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
You know what else you should all try soon?

528
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,480
Something that I love quite a bit, something that Matt and I use the heck out of.

529
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,640
In fact, a lot of the hosts here at the Jupiter Broadcasting use the heck out of, is Digital

530
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
Ocean.

531
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,120
Head over to digitalocean.com right now.

532
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,480
Go over there and check out Digital Ocean while you can, too, because I'll tell you

533
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
that.

534
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,640
Things are a-changing, my friends, in the world, and you can have your own server up

535
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,120
in the cloud.

536
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,240
Earlier today, Matt, today I was like Mr. Productive, Matt.

537
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,800
I don't know what it was.

538
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Maybe I tried butter coffee.

539
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
Have you ever had butter coffee before?

540
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Butter coffee?

541
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
No.

542
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
I was going to say maybe it was the fog.

543
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
But okay.

544
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Maybe.

545
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,400
I just decided not to go outside, so I stayed inside and got a bunch of stuff done.

546
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Right?

547
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
No.

548
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I got my butter coffee.

549
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,120
That's coffee with a little bit of butter in it and coconut oil.

550
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Yeah.

551
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,920
And then you immersion blend that, Matt, like a bouse.

552
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,440
You immersion blend that.

553
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,960
And then I decided, you know what?

554
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,440
Let's go out there and let's see if I can get a little work done.

555
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,540
So I tried out the new Google Domains, and I registered a domain and pointed it at my

556
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,240
Digital Ocean Droplet.

557
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,680
The Digital Ocean Droplet that I've been using for quite a while to do things like BitTorrent

558
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,640
Sync and my Quasal Core, you know, stuff that is just handy to have running in the background.

559
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,440
But I never really thought, I'll just set a couple things up.

560
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,000
I'll never really use this very long, so it's not a, you know, I don't need to register

561
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
a domain name.

562
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Well, today I got that done.

563
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Right.

564
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,720
This is the first Droplet that I ever created at Digital Ocean.

565
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,880
I went and registered a domain name for.

566
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
And now I feel official because they've all got domains.

567
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,800
It's really easy to set it up over at Digital Ocean because they have a DNS, part of their

568
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,940
control panel is a real nice DNS management system that makes it straightforward.

569
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,940
So here's what I want you to do.

570
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,120
I want you to remember our promo code, and then I'm going to tell you about Digital Ocean

571
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,520
because they're really awesome.

572
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
It's cool.

573
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
It's brand new.

574
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
And it's for the entire year of 2015.

575
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,400
So use it wisely, my friends.

576
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,880
D.O. Unplugged.

577
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
D.O.

578
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Unplugged.

579
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,880
All one word.

580
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,880
Lowercase.

581
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,880
D.O.

582
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Unplugged is our new promo code for Digital Ocean.

583
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,000
So what is Digital Ocean?

584
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Go check them out right now.

585
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,840
It's simple cloud hosting that's really done right.

586
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,240
I've got several systems up there now because it's straightforward.

587
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,600
I get going in no time.

588
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,560
It's intuitive and really easy to spin up your own cloud server.

589
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,760
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

590
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,120
The pricing plans start at only $5 a month for your own rig.

591
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,800
You get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

592
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,080
These droplets are running on top of Linux using KVM, all riding on SSD drives across

593
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
the board.

594
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,280
Digital Ocean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

595
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
and London.

596
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,480
But it's really the interface.

597
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,840
And I really, just today, just today, like before the show, I literally like, before

598
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,000
I came down, so I probably was doing this 45 minutes ago, before I came down here, and

599
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,800
it's just, I didn't even worry about like, oh well I need to go on air, I need to start

600
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,440
the show up, because I know how straightforward and intuitive the Digital Ocean control panel

601
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
is.

602
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,720
So I know that once I get in there, it's just going to be boom, boom, and I'm done.

603
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,760
And it really is crazy straightforward.

604
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,380
And they've got this API, and they've done a few iterations of it now.

605
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
It's really clean.

606
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,180
It's a really elegant API that the community has embraced and built a ton of apps around.

607
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,160
You can take advantage of that today, right now, or you can write something for yourself.

608
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,680
They've got a great set of documentation for it as well.

609
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,660
Head over to Digital Ocean, check out their tutorials.

610
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,800
They've got the best tutorials on the web, and they'll even pay you to write for them.

611
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,280
They've got editors that can work with you, and they'll pay up to $200 for a piece you

612
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,660
write for their tutorials section.

613
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,700
So if there's something that you're an expert on, setting something up that you see a gap

614
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,740
and people are searching for that, you could go make a little cash on the side, and write

615
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,740
it up for Digital Ocean.

616
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,620
There's just great resources over there, digitalocean.com.

617
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Go check it out.

618
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,500
DO1plugged is our new promo code to get the $10 credit.

619
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,100
You can try out the $5 rig two months for free.

620
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,100
DO1plugged.

621
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,940
It's a great deal.

622
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
Digitalocean.com.

623
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,580
And a big thank you to Digital Ocean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

624
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,260
It's so neat to have.

625
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,500
I feel like I have my own server farm up in the sky.

626
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
I know, right?

627
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:22,220
I'm actually still in the process of bringing stuff over from other folks that I work with,

628
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,780
because I'm like, can you just move it over to DO, because then I can just do it, and

629
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,200
I can just get in there and get things done without having to monkey with whatever you

630
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
got going on over there.

631
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
It's great.

632
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
All right, guys.

633
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
Matt, I think you might have a suggestion.

634
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,180
I have one suggestion, but we really have never solved this problem for the audience.

635
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
Let's take one more crack at it.

636
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,100
We can always take submissions from the audience, too, but Dukaked wrote in, and he's looking

637
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,540
for an open source solution for remote support, so I think that takes out TeamViewer and a

638
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,540
few others.

639
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Thanks for an amazing show, as always.

640
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,420
I wanted to ask you how you go about doing remote support and screen sharing and remote

641
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,580
control for users behind routers.

642
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,080
This is people like friends and family behind home routers and small businesses behind their

643
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,180
business routers and firewalls, with them probably using Windows.

644
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,580
The company I work for uses TeamViewer and Join.me, which work well for the purpose,

645
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,980
but I want a solution that's open source, not licensed, and has no subscription.

646
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,820
I'm considering connecting to a port forwarded SSH server, which might help, and then using

647
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,180
further forwarding to get into their machine over RDP, but there's got to be a simpler

648
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,220
way of doing this.

649
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,460
Is there a TeamViewer-like solution that I haven't heard of?

650
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,940
Thanks for any tips.

651
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Keep our Sundays rockin'.

652
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Dukaked.

653
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,940
What do you think, Matt, anything jumping out at you?

654
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,620
You know, he kind of hit the nail on the head as far as, if you want to go with an open

655
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,980
source solution, it is certainly doable, but it's going to require some work, some SSH,

656
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,420
some of this, a little bit of that, a little bit of forwarding, a little bit of IP magic.

657
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,100
There's nothing out of the box that I know of specifically that's going to do what he

658
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,500
wants that's open source, and I personally just happen to use TeamViewer or one of the

659
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,100
others, just whatever works at the time, so not off the top of my head, no.

660
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,180
Yeah, I was thinking maybe Chrome Remote Desktop, but again, that's not free.

661
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,660
And that's been kind of buggy sometimes.

662
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,180
I've had some issues, so.

663
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,540
Wimpy, is there a way to accomplish this with X2Go?

664
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
There is, yeah.

665
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,620
X2Go has desktop sharing feature.

666
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Oh my gosh.

667
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,140
So even if I'm not using it for like remote terminal services style things, somebody could

668
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,180
remote control my sessions still using the X2Go client?

669
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,420
Yeah, yeah.

670
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,160
So I have this on my father-in-law's machine at his house, so he's got port forwarding

671
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:32,460
on his router to his laptop, and when he needs help, I X2Go into his machine on a shared

672
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,100
session and we talk through what he needs to do.

673
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,860
How does the IP mapping and stuff like that work, like when he's behind his router?

674
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,420
Does it universal plug and play that?

675
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:47,140
No, what I've done is I've put his MAC address in the DHCP server on the router so he always

676
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,300
gets the same IP on his laptop, so the port forwarding always works.

677
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,620
Ah, so you set up port forwarding, so that's one disadvantage, but if you have the ability

678
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,940
to set up port forwarding, how else would you do that, because you'd have to have a

679
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:08,060
piece of software on the remote client that's updating the firewall in real time with your,

680
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,060
you know.

681
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:18,420
The only other one I know is you can do reverse VNC connections, so I would have to configure

682
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:26,220
at my side the port forwarding, and I can set VNC to listen, and then the client, my

683
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:33,140
father-in-law, can establish a remote connection to me, and I see his screen on mine, and I

684
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:39,180
use that for tech support at work, so our customers at work can effectively send their

685
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,180
screen to us.

686
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,580
So I'm trying to think, Skype offers some remote control features, but again, it's pretty

687
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,060
buggy and it uses Skype.

688
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
Oh, it's horrible.

689
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Yeah, I wouldn't use Skype.

690
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,860
Yeah, Skype's not open source, and VNC's really slow, and yeah, yeah.

691
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,380
I'm seeing Romania, R-E-M-M-I-N-A, mentioned by Kapi in the chat room.

692
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,780
Yeah, that was kind of where I was thinking, it's just one of those things where it requires

693
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,580
a little bit of massaging to get there, but yeah, that would work.

694
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,780
Right, and Bentley's reminding us that Universal Plug and Play will do the port forwarding,

695
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,380
but you have to have something that calls on Universal Plug and Play to do it.

696
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,380
And you have to have it enabled.

697
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,380
A lot of people don't.

698
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,380
Yeah.

699
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,380
And Bentley's here in the boardroom as well.

700
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Yeah, no, I know.

701
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,380
I know.

702
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,180
We've already mentioned Universal Plug and Play twice, so I think, and I know, so we

703
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,620
know there's ways to do it, right?

704
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,780
Like if there was a way to trigger Universal Plug and Play using a remote client, I like,

705
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:30,900
I like honestly, if you have the ability, X2GO is going to give you unquestionably the

706
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,340
best performance, probably better performance than any commercial packages out there.

707
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,380
The only downside is you got to have the port forwarding set up.

708
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,600
That doesn't, I mean, that might be, if you're doing a small group of people, that might

709
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
be doable.

710
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,220
Yeah, I was wondering too if Jitsi, I don't know if Jitsi offers a remote screen control.

711
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,820
I think it's just remote screen sharing with Jitsi, so I don't think that would do it.

712
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,460
But if anybody out in the audience knows the feedback thread in the Linux Action Show subreddit

713
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,300
or go over to the contact page on Jupiter Broadcasting and let us know.

714
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,460
I would love a fully fledged open source remote control product because right now I'm doing

715
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,220
a mix of Splashtop, which is hit and miss, Chrome remote desktop, which is, so I like

716
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,700
literally Matt, sometimes I have Chrome remote desktop and, and Splashtop on the same rig

717
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,260
because at any given time, one of them doesn't work.

718
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,860
See and that's been it for me is that like on Ubuntu boxes, Splashtop is great.

719
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,100
On anything other than Ubuntu, Splashtop is a face to a brick wall as far as on the Linux

720
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
side of things.

721
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,420
So I tend to go like with TeamViewer and like maybe if I'm running something like Arch-based

722
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,980
or something like that, I generally have had better luck in that space.

723
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,780
Usually it's TeamViewer or Splashtop for myself.

724
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,980
Oh, you know one that we've talked about like three years ago on the show is Guacamole,

725
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
which is an HTML file.

726
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Oh!

727
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Or maybe it was like two years ago.

728
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,060
I remember we talked about Guacamole really briefly.

729
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
I do.

730
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
Yeah, that was briefly.

731
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,060
Yeah.

732
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:50,340
And so that's another one to check out is Guacamole at guac.dev or guac-dev.org or something

733
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
like that.

734
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,100
Anyways, that's a good one that came in.

735
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,820
Most of the WebRTC ones I can think of are all just like views you can't modify.

736
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
Yeah.

737
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,820
Yeah.

738
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
Yeah.

739
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,500
Because you wouldn't want the browser to be able to give someone remote control.

740
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Guacamole.

741
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I like the name.

742
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,300
It's a great question and it's, it's something at the towards the end of the show, major

743
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,660
problems on the Linux desktop 2015 edition.

744
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,880
One of the things he calls out is remote desktop support solutions like this.

745
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,780
So I think Ducaite kind of nailed it a little bit.

746
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,680
I think he's kind of right.

747
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,600
And I know there's other things out there you could obviously do.

748
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,820
Like for example, at first I thought I always needed, if they're on Linux boxes, I always

749
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
thought, oh, I need remote desktop support.

750
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,380
And then you know what I realized?

751
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:35,220
A lot of the times I can just SSH into the box, kill a process, update a thing, uninstall

752
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,220
a thing.

753
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,220
Exactly.

754
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,380
And then you log in nearly as often as I thought I did when you're escaping the bloat too.

755
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,980
So that if the, if the hangup is in fact, gooey based, a lot of times you can slide

756
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,140
in under the radar like that and deal with whatever the hangup is.

757
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Yeah.

758
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
Yeah.

759
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Yeah.

760
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,220
Get so, I'm not familiar with get so, but there's a suggestion coming from, oh yeah,

761
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,220
that's that.

762
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,780
I think that's the reverse VNC thing actually.

763
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
Yeah.

764
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
That's exactly it.

765
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Yeah.

766
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,620
That's the, the, the client side of the reverse VNC.

767
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Yeah.

768
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,540
I'm making notes as we go here cause some of these are really useful.

769
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
Yeah.

770
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Yeah.

771
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,060
And I think that could be used to make a program to do this.

772
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,060
Oh, okay.

773
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,060
Thanks Bentley.

774
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
That's good.

775
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,620
So I guess there's, I guess you could string a few things together.

776
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,620
That's kind of my thought.

777
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,700
Yeah, that's definitely it.

778
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,260
Although the extra go stuff sounds really cool.

779
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Yeah.

780
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,620
If you just, all you need is just access to that port.

781
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,700
So anyways, if you give us your, give us your experiences out there, send them into the

782
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,360
show and we'll follow them up as a feedback next week.

783
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,740
One thing I talked about today on tech talk today, and again, Chrome remote desktop hit

784
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:37,380
and miss, not open source, but they did just announce the Chrome remote desktop client

785
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,380
for iOS.

786
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:43,060
So now you could like use an iPad and run it into your Linux box and have remote control.

787
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,060
So that's kind of cool.

788
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
I don't know.

789
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,140
And you could also do on your phone.

790
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:51,100
And speaking of phones, why don't we mention our next sponsor, Ting, and then we'll get

791
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,900
into the top four distributions to look at for 2015.

792
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,860
Linux.ting.com is where you go to support the Linux Unplugged show.

793
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,860
Linux.ting.com.

794
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,380
Mobile that makes sense.

795
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:05,020
No contract, no other termination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

796
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,980
Flat six dollars, pay for what you use.

797
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,880
They just take your minutes, your messages, megabytes, add them all up.

798
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,940
That's what you pay.

799
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,940
It's really straightforward.

800
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,220
Linux.ting.com will also get you $25 off your first device.

801
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,320
If you have a Ting compatible device, they'll give you a $25 credit and they're adding GSM

802
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
support in February.

803
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,240
So Ting service is going to get even better and better.

804
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,920
And it's all still going to be pay for what you use.

805
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,740
You can still have hotspot and tethering.

806
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,200
They're still going to have no hold customer support.

807
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,180
And also, they're still going to rock some great tips.

808
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,300
Ting has always got great tips on their blog and they're doing Ting tips right now for

809
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,500
Android.

810
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,380
And here is a great tip for probably most of the audience is if you have a podcast catcher

811
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:47,820
on Android, they've done a roundup of not only great podcast clients, but how you can

812
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,880
set these up, fully animated GIFs so you can look at it on the smartphone itself, where

813
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,260
you need to go so that makes your podcast only download on Wi-Fi.

814
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,540
Hey, look at that Linux Action Show HD right there.

815
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
Look at that.

816
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,980
So that way, you only get the show, especially when you're downloading Linux Action Show

817
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,060
HD over Wi-Fi, right?

818
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
That's a nice tip.

819
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,200
And again, think about this.

820
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,640
This is a mobile carrier telling you how to save money.

821
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,760
And the reason they're doing that is they've based their business model not on incentivizing

822
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,740
you to keep buying the bigger and bigger packages.

823
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,740
Oh, you know what?

824
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,740
I might need four gigs.

825
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,740
Ah, four gigs isn't enough, honey.

826
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,740
We better go to six gigs.

827
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Oh, you know what?

828
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,740
We're using six gigs a month now.

829
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,220
We better go to 10.

830
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,420
And then of course, you really end up using six, one month, four, one month, eight.

831
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
The next month.

832
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Exactly.

833
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,340
It's a huge range because your life is different every single month.

834
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,840
So that's where Ting comes in, right?

835
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,580
So their model is you just pay for what you use and that doesn't cost them any more if

836
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,280
you use less or more.

837
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
So they don't mind telling you how to save money.

838
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,820
And that's why these blog posts are so handy.

839
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,700
So this is a great roundup of how to set up your podcast catcher to only download while

840
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,580
it's over Wi-Fi on your phone to make sure you don't get any surprise bills.

841
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,500
It's among a bunch of other great tips.

842
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,760
Start by going to linux.ting.com, try out their savings calculator, see how much money

843
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,500
you would save, I'm getting like $2,000 in savings now with their savings calculator.

844
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,820
It's crazy because I've been a Ting customer for like two years, got my Nexus 5 now and

845
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,460
I'm just paying for what I use.

846
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,540
Linux.ting.com.

847
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,380
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

848
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,220
Linux.ting.com.

849
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,480
And thank you to all of our listeners out there who go there, check out Ting's offerings

850
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,180
and resources.

851
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,500
You really are helping us stay on the air by doing that.

852
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,700
So we really appreciate you supporting our sponsors.

853
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:28,220
Okay, so Jack Wallin wrote a piece for linux.com saying the four best new Linux distributions

854
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,860
to watch in 2015, and I almost always pass over these top lists because usually they're

855
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,780
for clicks and I don't think they're necessarily bad, but not my style.

856
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
It's usually fluff.

857
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
It's usually fluff.

858
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,740
Yeah, I kind of thought this was going to be the case with this one.

859
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,700
It's not necessarily not fluff, but it's good fluff, I guess.

860
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,180
So he says every year new Linux distributions pop up, something new and game changing.

861
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,820
So he's looking at some of the distributions for 2015.

862
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,840
And Mumbaroon, feel free to jump in if you disagree.

863
00:38:54,840 --> 00:39:00,460
Number one distribution to look forward to, he says, is Evolvo S. Ironically, I got an

864
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,800
email this morning that was raving about Evolvo S. He says it's incredibly simple to use.

865
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,360
It's inspired by the Chrome OS desktop with a user-friendly interface that anyone can

866
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,340
sit down and use immediately.

867
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,540
The developers of Evolvo S have taken a page from Chrome OS design look and created the

868
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,700
Bungie desktop.

869
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:20,020
Bungie is not a fork of another desktop, but is built from the ground up.

870
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,380
And I'm pulling up a screenshot right here for those of you watching the video version.

871
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,580
It does look very nice.

872
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,500
So Evolvo S, number one.

873
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,540
Number two, Sparky Linux Game Over Edition.

874
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,980
It's based on Debian testing.

875
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,860
It's a rolling release distribution.

876
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:39,580
Sparky Linux Game Over Edition adds Steam, Steam Launcher, Wine, Play on Linux to Sora

877
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,520
along with standard gaming tools and services like Game Over Edition.

878
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,020
Also has in it the PSX emulator, the Kega Fusion and Sega Mega Drive Genesis emulators

879
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,620
and PSP emulator.

880
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,820
So it comes with a lot of great stuff.

881
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,460
And also really low resource desktops.

882
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,460
So there's one for you.

883
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,380
And then number three, Korora Linux.

884
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,900
Korora Linux is a Fedora remix.

885
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,180
We've talked about it before.

886
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,460
You can choose between KDE, Mate, Cinnamon, GNOME, Xfce desktops.

887
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,140
It includes a number of packages that Fedora can't ship.

888
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,240
It's based on, like the current one's based on Fedora 21.

889
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,260
So it includes things like Adobe Flash, Dropbox, Google Chrome, Google Earth, Google Talk plugin,

890
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,000
RPM Fusion repos pre-setup, VirtualBox, all based on Fedora.

891
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,100
It's like Fedora that's ready to use.

892
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,500
In addition to all of this, Korora includes packages called Flarp, I guess, or Phalarp

893
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
or whatever it is.

894
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Phalarp?

895
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Yeah, I don't know.

896
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,580
It makes installing drivers like the Nvidia graphics driver super easy.

897
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,780
I like that.

898
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
Yeah.

899
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
So that's Korora.

900
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
That sounds pretty badass.

901
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,660
That sounds pretty badass actually.

902
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,940
And there they have great, he has a great screenshot here.

903
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,020
Ozone OS.

904
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,300
We first heard about this on the Linux action show.

905
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,300
There's very little to see at the moment, but Ozone OS will be based on Fedora and will

906
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,500
have a Numix flavored spin.

907
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
It's from the Numix guys.

908
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Oh, okay.

909
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,180
And it's going to be based on the GNOME desktop.

910
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
Totally Numix stuff.

911
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,020
What's even more interesting about this project is it's partnered with Nutrix, which sells

912
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,980
Numix themed desktop PCs, so you might be able to buy desktops already with this distribution

913
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,980
as well.

914
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:16,460
So four distributions, Evolvo OS, Sparky Linux, Game Over Edition, Korora, and Ozone OS.

915
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,740
All pretty different distributions.

916
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,980
I think they might have a shot.

917
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,180
Eric, do any of these excite your distro hopping bone that would make you want to maybe try

918
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
them out?

919
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,780
Well, not really the distro hopping bone, but one I would add to the list would be Kubuntu

920
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,860
4, because they will be shipping Plasma 5, so that's really kind of something to keep

921
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,860
an eye on, I think.

922
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,860
It's a game changer.

923
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,860
Yeah.

924
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,860
Yeah.

925
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:45,220
Derek Delvin, you feel like maybe a certain elementary OS is missing?

926
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,220
Yes.

927
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:54,180
Actually, in 2015, and I have some rumors from some of the devs that they're working

928
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:00,100
in making their desktop less tightly coupled with just specific Kubuntu, which could yield

929
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,900
good interesting results.

930
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,900
Hmm.

931
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,020
Like the elementary OS desktop environment, what is that called?

932
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
Luna, right?

933
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,020
Pantheon.

934
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,020
Oh, Pantheon.

935
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,020
Yeah, thank you.

936
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,020
Luna is one of the releases.

937
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
And there's also...

938
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:18,740
And in distribution-wise, there's also Deepin, which it's a Chinese company backing it up.

939
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:24,140
They have full-time developers working on it, and they're submitting code.

940
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:29,380
They actually have a very different desktop environment, basically multiple type of things,

941
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,180
but they have something unique coming out of there.

942
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,860
I feel like Karora should be getting more attention than it is.

943
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,860
You think?

944
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Yeah.

945
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Yeah, I do.

946
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,180
I think Fedora is compelling, but it's just not really usable without a lot of changes,

947
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,140
like number one, RPM fusion, and probably Dropbox and Flash.

948
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,140
Right.

949
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,420
But it's for someone that wants to open up the hood and get in there and actually do

950
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
things themselves, right?

951
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
I don't know.

952
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
I think Karora has some potential.

953
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,300
I've installed it, and I've been pretty impressed by it.

954
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,320
And it's close to a mainline distro, so you get all the benefits of a largely supported

955
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,500
big community distro, but with some niceties added to it.

956
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,220
I guess that was my question, but it's like, why does each feature have to have its own

957
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,260
different version of Linux?

958
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,740
Oh, Alan.

959
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,180
Well, no, I just mean even as a Linux user-

960
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,620
No, I think it's a fair question.

961
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,620
It's a fair question.

962
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:22,540
Honestly, I want that feature, but I want it on the Fedora that I'm used to or the

963
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,540
Ubuntu that I already have.

964
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,360
That's why the rest of us just run Arch, because then we just install Arch and then just install

965
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,460
whatever you want.

966
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,380
A lot of times it's because it's silly things, Alan.

967
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,680
It's like, well, this is based on this and this version of the desktop, which requires

968
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,500
this version of the toolkit.

969
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,620
And the main version of Ubuntu ships this version of the toolkit because they're shipping

970
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,900
this version of the desktop environment.

971
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,820
So therefore we're going to go off on our own direction.

972
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,300
It usually starts something simple like that, that is sort of-

973
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,900
Yeah, we've had similar complications on other systems with bundled software, and that's

974
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,820
why we've seen a lot of unbundling happening lately, getting everything out of the base

975
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:00,700
system as you can, so that the package repo determines what version of this toolkit you

976
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,700
get or what version of this that's going to work with that and so on.

977
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:14,180
I think my predictions is the top three distros for 2015 are Arch, Ubuntu Mate, and regular

978
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,960
Ubuntu, and followed by Fedora.

979
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,260
That's what I think the top three- I'm not saying in that order necessarily either, could

980
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:25,580
be a different order, but I mean these distros are great, but I think you just can't deny

981
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,700
the fact that every time we look at Arch numbers, they've exploded since the last time we looked

982
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,700
at Arch numbers.

983
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,700
So I think you got to figure that.

984
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,300
And Mate is obviously rocking people, like look at you Matt, you just switched over to

985
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
Ubuntu Mate.

986
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,860
Oh yeah, all my systems except for two.

987
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,740
I think I still have one running Arch proper, but everything else is running Ubuntu Mate,

988
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,740
so yeah.

989
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,740
Yeah.

990
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,740
For sure.

991
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,740
There you go.

992
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,740
There you go.

993
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,740
Chatroom says Quora is not that great.

994
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,740
All right, I'll take the word.

995
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,740
I don't actively use it.

996
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,880
Well, and one thing I want to touch on in that article is that I think articles like

997
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,860
that are cool in the sense that maybe they bring a little limelight to distros we might

998
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,700
not have otherwise heard of, and they're cool to check out, you know?

999
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,300
Yeah, that's very true.

1000
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,900
You know, I've heard some folks in the community talking about Evolvo S now to see this written

1001
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,500
up here, and I haven't really been following Sparky Linux Game Over Edition because it's

1002
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
called Sparky Linux.

1003
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Right?

1004
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,500
Yeah.

1005
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Yeah, it does sound a little unusual.

1006
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,500
It's like, okay.

1007
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,500
Yeah, I know.

1008
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,500
I know.

1009
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,220
I'm just going to plug it because I already plugged it.

1010
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,420
Linux says in the chatroom, no KDE Plasma 5 love, and yeah, you know, that's why I mentioned

1011
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,180
Kabuntu is because they're going to have a Plasma 5 straight up starting in April, so

1012
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,180
that'd be good.

1013
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,180
Yeah, definitely.

1014
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,180
Wimpy, what do you think?

1015
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,740
Do you think Deepin should be getting some love?

1016
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,980
Well, it's definitely interesting.

1017
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:41,460
I installed it a few months ago to have a play because I'd heard good things about it,

1018
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:48,060
and I have to say, if you've got a Mac switcher who's looking to go to a Linux platform, they're

1019
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,820
going to feel very comfortable with Linux Deepin.

1020
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:57,660
You need a fairly decent machine because it's composed to the hilt, but it's got some very

1021
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,680
sexy transitions, and it's got a unique take on control panels and what have you.

1022
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:09,060
It's a very tidily put together modern distribution that I have to say is different from everything

1023
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,060
else out there.

1024
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,060
Yeah.

1025
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,060
It's not at all like GNOME 3.

1026
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,020
It's not at all like KDE or KDE Plasma.

1027
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,240
It's not at all like Unity.

1028
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,340
You know, they've really done something different.

1029
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,340
Huh.

1030
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,620
Derek Devon, were you going to say something?

1031
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,620
Were you adding something?

1032
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:27,680
I was saying that it's not even looking like elementary.

1033
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,980
He mentioned, you know, the Mac familiarity.

1034
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,980
Yeah.

1035
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:31,980
Yeah.

1036
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,980
Yeah.

1037
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,980
Yeah, you're right.

1038
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,540
It is distinctive, and it's quite good.

1039
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,660
If you've got a decent machine, it's worth a look.

1040
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,980
Yeah, it does look very nice.

1041
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,100
It looks like they don't do very many releases, but that's not necessarily a bad thing at

1042
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,820
all.

1043
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:50,780
And I know I've even looked at it before, but I cannot remember what it is based on.

1044
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,900
I think it was Debian.

1045
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,020
Yeah, it's definitely a Debian-based system.

1046
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,380
I don't know if it's a bootstrap.

1047
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:04,380
And I seem to remember their software manager was very creative, very colorful.

1048
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,380
Yes.

1049
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,380
We liked that a lot, didn't we?

1050
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,380
We did.

1051
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,380
Yeah.

1052
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,380
Real robust.

1053
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,380
Yeah.

1054
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
The deep in store.

1055
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
Yeah.

1056
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,380
And the reason it's difficult to pin it down is because every time they have a release,

1057
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,820
the UI is completely different.

1058
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:20,380
So I don't know if they've settled on this current incarnation of the UI, but every version

1059
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,860
of Deepin has been distinct from the last.

1060
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,860
But maybe they've settled on this one now.

1061
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,420
It'd be worth a review if you're doing a distro review.

1062
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,260
Yeah, we should look at it again, because it's been a year, and they have a new release.

1063
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,180
And Urban 120 in the chatroom says it's Ubuntu-based, and I believe Urban.

1064
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,180
I trust them.

1065
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,180
Makes sense.

1066
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,180
Yeah.

1067
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,180
And they have some of their own tools, like Deepin Movie Player, Deepin Music, Deepin

1068
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:44,180
Shot, even.

1069
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,640
And they actually look like decent tools, too, which is nice.

1070
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,740
This is definitely worth another look, I think.

1071
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,540
So I will put this on the list.

1072
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,760
You're talking about my distro hopping bone.

1073
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,460
This kind of itches my distro hopping bone a little bit.

1074
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,900
I wonder which version of Ubuntu...

1075
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,860
I bet, you know, if we did some digging, we could probably figure out exactly which version

1076
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:03,860
it's based on.

1077
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:04,860
LTS all day.

1078
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,860
I would hope so.

1079
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:06,860
I'm sure of it.

1080
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,860
Yeah.

1081
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:08,860
I'm sure of it.

1082
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,860
If it is, then...

1083
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,860
I'm going to give it a go.

1084
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,860
I think I might give it a go.

1085
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,860
Yeah.

1086
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,860
I'm going to give it a go.

1087
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,860
Deepin...

1088
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,420
And by the way, the URL that you at home would like to check out, linuxdeepin.com, linux-d-e-p-i-n.com

1089
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,420
to check it out.

1090
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,340
And you can download the 2013 or 2014 edition.

1091
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,340
And let us know what you think.

1092
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,500
We'd love to hear your thoughts.

1093
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:33,460
I'm looking at the view package list right now, which just redirected me to distro watch.

1094
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,460
Oh, okay.

1095
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,300
I'll do some post-show digging, because it's been a little while since I've looked into

1096
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,580
it, and it looks pretty good.

1097
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,580
Okay.

1098
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,900
We've got our last topic of the day to get into.

1099
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,740
Major problems on the Linux desktop.

1100
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,660
And at first, I thought, oh, great.

1101
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,700
This is a troll.

1102
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,980
You know, I do appreciate, boy, the snow is making my browser freak out, though.

1103
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,980
I'll tell you that.

1104
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,020
So it's got a snow background, which I do appreciate quite a bit.

1105
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:02,140
And I do think the headline is not quite as provocative, major Linux problems on the desktop.

1106
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,420
I think we've heard other headlines out there for these types of things that are much more

1107
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,420
attention-grabbing.

1108
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,420
So I think that's reasonable.

1109
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,620
The snow, though, really puts it over the top for me.

1110
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,380
But it is an epic write-up.

1111
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,580
And it is a long-running release, too.

1112
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,380
This is the 2015 edition.

1113
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,700
And it's brutal.

1114
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,900
So we're going to talk about that.

1115
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,420
And I think, you know, maybe counter some of it, but acknowledge some of it, and maybe

1116
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,420
not all bad.

1117
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,420
Maybe not all bad.

1118
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:24,620
First, I want to talk about something that's great.

1119
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,620
And that's Linux Academy.

1120
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,620
I'll shake it up.

1121
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,620
Shake, shake, shake it up.

1122
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,660
I think that's a song, actually.

1123
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,660
LinuxAcademy.com.

1124
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,660
Shake, shake, shake it.

1125
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,660
Yeah.

1126
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,660
Yeah.

1127
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,660
Shake, shake it, right?

1128
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,660
LinuxAcademy.com.

1129
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,660
Hey, Matt.

1130
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,660
Yeah.

1131
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,660
Linux Academy just added some NGINX courses.

1132
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:41,080
Now, we've talked about NGINX quite a bit on TechSnap.

1133
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,180
And if you've heard us mention it, and you're like, what is it?

1134
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,340
Why is it so great?

1135
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,620
Why not go take some courseware?

1136
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,300
Docker courses were recently updated.

1137
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,300
Vagrant was recently updated.

1138
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,500
Puppet stuff was recently updated.

1139
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,980
I mean, it's really all the stuff that you really got to get current on.

1140
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,420
And the great thing is that Linux Academy folks are super passionate about all this

1141
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,420
material.

1142
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,580
So they're the experts to go to.

1143
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,020
They've got step-by-step video courses.

1144
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,340
You'll be able to take advantage of this.

1145
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,500
So once you go over to LinuxAcademy.com right now, unplugged is the slash you go to.

1146
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1147
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,980
Get your 33% discount, which is a killer discount.

1148
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,620
And then you get access to all of the content at Linux Academy.

1149
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,700
Get your own server as the courseware requires it.

1150
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,580
You choose from seven plus Linux distributions.

1151
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,340
It'll spin up that virtual server.

1152
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,100
It'll give you a public IP address and a DNS name, and you SSH into it to do all of your

1153
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,580
management courseware.

1154
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,820
And then, of course, when you've chosen, like, say you choose a CentOS rig to do your courseware

1155
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,820
on.

1156
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,340
Well, then, since that's your virtual machine, all of the courseware, all of the stuff automatically

1157
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,620
adjusts to match that distribution.

1158
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,180
You've got only a limited amount of time available.

1159
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:39,620
Well, they've got learning plans.

1160
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,340
You go in there and say, with sliders, Monday I have two hours, Tuesday I have one hour,

1161
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,340
Wednesday I have no time.

1162
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,340
I've got them filtered.

1163
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,340
It's crazy.

1164
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,340
I don't have any time Wednesdays.

1165
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,700
Thursdays, well, TechSnap's kind of like going to school, so I'll just do one hour.

1166
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,660
Fridays, I'll put in three hours.

1167
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,060
Then it generates me a learning plan, automatically just fits that schedule for me, keeps me in

1168
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,060
the loop.

1169
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,220
Like, it'll send me a little reminder, like, hey, bro, you've got a quiz coming up tonight.

1170
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,220
Don't forget to study.

1171
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,220
Okay.

1172
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,320
And I'll be like, thanks, Linux Academy.

1173
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
It's great.

1174
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,320
It keeps you right there.

1175
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
You go back in.

1176
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
You see how long the next section's gonna take.

1177
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,100
They download this content and listen to it on the go like a podcast.

1178
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,260
They have live streams where you can ask the educators questions directly.

1179
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,260
They've got a community.

1180
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,420
They'll get you going if you ever have a little bit of a bump.

1181
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,220
It's a really cool system, you guys, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1182
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,340
Why not start with the OpenStack Essentials?

1183
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,460
Really.

1184
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,020
Like OpenStack is such a fundamental technology in the industry, and if you don't know about

1185
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:29,460
it, why not go just take the fundamentals courseware?

1186
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,340
I hear from folks all the time that start with Linux Academy as a total noob on a topic

1187
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,140
and take it all the way and go get certifications.

1188
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:42,140
It's kind of a pretty neat phenomenon, and it's unbelievable.

1189
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,200
There's folks that have gone to Linux Academy here in Washington state, some listeners of

1190
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,500
our shows that have taken Linux Academy courseware and are now working at Amazon.

1191
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,620
Linux Academy has a full set of AWS courseware, too, so you can go in there.

1192
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:58,120
I heard from one of them recently who gave me some info that was really useful that helped

1193
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,500
me correct something I made a mistake on, and he says, yeah, by the way, I got the job

1194
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,500
thanks to my courseware at Linux Academy.

1195
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Nice.

1196
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,500
Isn't that neat?

1197
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
It's really cool to hear that.

1198
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
Yeah, it's really cool.

1199
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Yeah, so go check it out yourself.

1200
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,500
LinuxAcademy.com.

1201
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:14,940
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

1202
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,660
You guys are doing an awesome job.

1203
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,140
They're adding new stuff like crazy, too.

1204
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,980
Holidays didn't slow them down.

1205
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:27,820
Okay, so this article is super, super, super long, and it is full of snow, but it is a

1206
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:34,820
regularly updated article that is trying to be the most comprehensive list of problems

1207
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,100
anywhere on the internet with the Linux desktop.

1208
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,900
Now this person is not a Windows advocate.

1209
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,860
He even says here, this is not a Windows versus Linux comparison.

1210
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:49,220
He says, I want to make this crystal clear, Windows, in some regards, is worse than Linux,

1211
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,320
and it's definitely not ready for the desktop, either.

1212
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:56,580
So it's not, and this guy fixes bugs for the Linux kernel, for many of the desktop environments.

1213
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:58,860
A long time developer.

1214
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:03,900
And he writes in here, in different categories, the problems that are wrong with Linux.

1215
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,180
So I'll just read a couple of them, okay guys?

1216
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:11,740
And this isn't about bashing Linux, but I actually think, if we look at this list, it's

1217
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:16,620
not such a bad idea to itemize the problems we have with Linux, because then we have a

1218
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:22,380
central place to sort of acknowledge these problems and work on them, right?

1219
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,420
And it definitely reads like an article that was written by someone with a clue.

1220
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,740
I disagree with a number of points, and I think there's some cherry picking, but I think

1221
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,180
it's worth looking at.

1222
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:35,500
So he, of course, bashes on NVIDIA Optimus technology and AKI dynamic GPU switching.

1223
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,180
Still not supported on Linux.

1224
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:41,460
Open source driver limitations he bashes on.

1225
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,860
He says, open source NVIDIA drivers not properly and fully support power management features

1226
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,900
and fan speeds.

1227
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,260
Mesa problems, of course.

1228
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,460
You cannot easily mix proprietary drivers and open source drivers.

1229
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,940
So you know, some things in the audio subsystem, he picks on the audio system, no reliable

1230
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:56,940
sound.

1231
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,900
He's referencing a lot of things here.

1232
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,020
He complains like one of ours is too many layers of abstractions lead to situations

1233
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,860
where you just cannot determine why his audio input and output is not working.

1234
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:12,180
So you have also kernel drivers, also libraries into DMX, pulse the audio server to also library,

1235
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,140
then pulse the backend into the application, six layers of audio redirection, and if you're

1236
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:21,180
on KDE, it's seven layers of audio redirection because of phonon.

1237
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,080
No reliable high definition audio support, things like above 96 kilohertz or greater

1238
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,180
than 24 bits, pretty much unusable often on Linux.

1239
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,420
No reliable system wide echo cancellation.

1240
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,760
You might notice that from our mumble room sometimes.

1241
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,320
On Windows and Mac OS, there's a system level echo cancellation that applications can take

1242
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,320
advantage of.

1243
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,580
Lots of slamming on X.

1244
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,620
X is largely outdated, unsuitable, insecure.

1245
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,580
X doesn't automatically switch between desktop resolutions if you have an application that

1246
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,220
goes full screen and running and crashes for some reason.

1247
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,900
X doesn't restore gamma properly if an application changes.

1248
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,820
So if you play a Valve or a Wine game and experience a problem, you know, he's got a

1249
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,660
command here that'll fix that.

1250
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,660
Lots of complaints with X.

1251
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,380
A huge section on X.

1252
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:04,900
High DPI support is pretty much nonexistent at the X level.

1253
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,660
Wayland, he's got complaints about Wayland.

1254
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:11,060
Applications must implement their own window shadowing under Wayland because Wayland decorator

1255
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,940
has no access to application subwindows.

1256
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,900
Applications must implement their own font anti-aliasing, or the GTK or Qt toolkits must,

1257
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,860
and there's no API for setting system wide font rendering.

1258
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,460
He says most sane advanced window systems, windowing systems, have exactly this.

1259
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,800
Windows, Android, Mac OS, you can all set system wide font rendering.

1260
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,680
In Wayland, all clients read all applications are totally independent in this regard.

1261
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,580
Applications read GUI toolkits must also implement their own DPI scaling.

1262
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,660
Again, Wayland doesn't do that.

1263
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:44,500
Wayland, even though there's a, even though it's version is above 1.0, is still largely

1264
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,300
incomplete and not supported by proprietary Nvidia and AMD GPU drivers.

1265
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:53,180
It's got a whole section on font rendering, the Linux kernel driver, problems stemming

1266
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,500
from vast number of different Linux distributions.

1267
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,620
It's a pretty long list of problems.

1268
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:03,180
Well, and he does link, you know, he does provide citation for 99% of the stuff, and

1269
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,900
so I'll give him props for that.

1270
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:10,140
I think my only real gripe with it, because it's really well written, I mean, really,

1271
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,140
I mean, it's very detailed.

1272
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,420
A lot of work went into this.

1273
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,780
Yeah, I mean, he actually cares and honestly knows what he's talking about, but I do feel

1274
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:21,420
like there's someone that might need to just, whatever he's developing or working on, take

1275
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,420
a break, dude.

1276
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,420
Calm down.

1277
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,420
It's not going to bite you.

1278
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,420
It's okay.

1279
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,700
And there's some stuff where it seems a little arbitrary and there's not enough information.

1280
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,260
He says the new init system, system D has been utterly broken by design.

1281
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,140
System D can and does segfault, crash, and freeze.

1282
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,500
In the same world, init system should never crash.

1283
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,300
And he even says in the comments that it's crashed for him.

1284
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:43,540
And then his proof for this is, well, he Google searched system D segfault, and that's his

1285
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,540
proof.

1286
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,460
I've got system D running on nine systems on a pretty heavy production load right now.

1287
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,460
And I've never had it.

1288
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,580
They've never crashed period, let alone system D crash.

1289
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:57,740
I've never had system D crash ever in two and a half years.

1290
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:02,660
And if you look at his regressions link, great writer, I have no problem with who he linked

1291
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:08,100
to specifically, but it doesn't actually prove anything.

1292
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,100
It's just a citation.

1293
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,900
And so it's kind of like, there's a lot of subjective stuff here.

1294
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:16,900
It's like how, at the end of the day, if he's really this upset about it, let's maybe flip

1295
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,340
this upside down and try and find solutions to it.

1296
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:23,740
Okay, there's a lot of layer abstractions, there's a lot of layering stuff in Linux distributions

1297
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,740
in general.

1298
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,500
It's kind of the nature of the beast.

1299
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,860
In 2015, computing holistically blows.

1300
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,460
I don't care what platform you're on, and that's okay.

1301
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,060
We don't have to, you don't have to make it your daily thing.

1302
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,060
So I don't know.

1303
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,060
I agree.

1304
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,700
I look at this list and I think to myself, all right, some of these problems are legitimate

1305
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,700
problems.

1306
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,340
There's a lot of layer abstractions with X and stuff, but they don't really prevent an

1307
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:50,580
average user from using the computer and they don't maybe even notice that if you're really

1308
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,580
an average user.

1309
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:52,580
No one knows.

1310
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,620
If I park this in front of some random guy on the street, they don't care.

1311
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,620
Yeah, DPI scaling, sure.

1312
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,620
Yeah.

1313
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,620
But yeah, sure.

1314
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,620
There's a bunch of stuff like that.

1315
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,940
It just makes it really hard to use a system where if you used a different operating system

1316
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,940
would just work.

1317
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:06,140
And it's really annoying, but at the same time, it's the kind of thing where a developer

1318
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,300
can work around it and just decide they don't care, but it's the type of thing that you

1319
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,500
can't convince your mom to live with it.

1320
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:17,420
Well, and the toolkit does provide, like GTK and Qt can provide some, so if they're just

1321
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,540
using, if it's a GTK app or Qt app, they'll still have the whatever the GTK and Qt systemwide

1322
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:27,180
anti-aliasing setting is, but like over pulse audio, you know what, I'm just, it sucks.

1323
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,180
It's just still not working.

1324
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,580
I mean, like as soon as I try a KD desktop, it's not working.

1325
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,740
If I'm on anything else, it's fine, but it's just, it's too much.

1326
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,820
It's Alex, do you have something, do you have input on the audio frameworks?

1327
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:42,780
Yes, I wanted to mention that the audio situation is very complicated.

1328
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:50,420
I would, what I would like would be a port of the media kit from Haiku.

1329
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:57,000
Media kit seems to be the best competitor to the sound solution on the Mac OS, which

1330
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,620
is by far the best one so far on any computing.

1331
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,620
I'll look into that.

1332
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,620
That's interesting.

1333
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:08,180
Dylan, you had a point on the Wayland and fonts issue.

1334
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:13,780
Yes, actually the windows in their design, it's systemwide and everything, but also it's

1335
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:19,540
worth noticing that whenever you're using anything else that is not the windows forms,

1336
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,120
you also have issues.

1337
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,100
Not to mention that actually it opened up an extremely dangerous vulnerability just because

1338
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,380
they did it in that design or that model.

1339
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:32,380
I remember the font bug, yes, where you could take, you could own a system with a font.

1340
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:39,140
Yes, it's like with a browser at that point because you can send fonts via browser.

1341
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,140
That was a good one.

1342
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:43,940
You know, when I looked at his list here, I thought it was exactly what you said, Matt.

1343
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:49,820
God, in a way, computers suck in 2015, and then I thought to myself, you know, I couldn't

1344
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,820
use anything else.

1345
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,580
I just can't use anything else.

1346
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,580
That's just it.

1347
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,460
Well, like his printer and scanner argument, that made me angry because I will tell you

1348
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,780
any day of the week, you give me a printer and you hook me up on a windows box, I'll

1349
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:03,580
drop the CD in, and then I'll take a trip up to visit Alan, and then I'll come back

1350
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,740
and it'll still be installing the software, okay?

1351
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,740
I'm just saying.

1352
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:11,180
I didn't even read that because I just felt like, and also that's an old argument, well,

1353
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,660
these don't work with a Macintosh, you can't, well then you buy the stuff that works with

1354
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:15,660
what you use.

1355
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,700
That's what, so that argument is crap.

1356
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,740
If you bought a win modem back in the day and then decided to switch over to Linux and

1357
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,340
the win modem didn't work, well, then you bought the wrong device or you shouldn't have

1358
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,940
switched to Linux.

1359
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:28,160
When you buy a printer, you check compatibility.

1360
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,020
That just seems like a given.

1361
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:34,500
Well, specifically when I bought my new printer, I bought one that was networked so that it

1362
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,060
wouldn't matter, I didn't have to plug it into any machine.

1363
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,460
Exactly, because then you don't care.

1364
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,540
It also meant I didn't have to have that machine on when I wanted to print, because I wanted

1365
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,180
to put the printer in my office downstairs and I didn't want to have to leave a computer

1366
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,180
on.

1367
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,180
Yep.

1368
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,260
So, Zero, I was curious about your point regarding the NVIDIA driver.

1369
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,340
So the thing with NVIDIA, it kind of piggybacks along with what you said about printers and

1370
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:58,540
printers, you know, get hardware that works with what you use, a lot of people complain

1371
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:04,500
that NVIDIA doesn't have good support using Linux, and that's mostly, especially Optimus

1372
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:10,180
and things like that, that's because we have proprietary drivers that work well when they

1373
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:19,180
work but can fail often from NVIDIA, who has time and time again shown that they really

1374
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:24,980
don't care about Linux at all, you know, and got the finger from Linus Torvalds over

1375
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,980
that.

1376
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:26,980
That's true.

1377
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,380
And the people who are trying to make these things work in Linux, who are reverse engineering

1378
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:33,540
these things, you know, there aren't very many people like that because the people who

1379
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:38,460
cared about freedom in the first place enough to potentially reverse engineer these things

1380
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,780
just didn't buy NVIDIA in the first place.

1381
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,780
Yeah.

1382
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,660
Wimpy, you have a point regarding printers, I'd like to hear that.

1383
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,740
Yeah, just like any bit of hardware, when you buy a printer these days, you should buy

1384
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:54,700
a printer that supports your operating system, just like Alan said, and when I went shopping

1385
01:01:54,700 --> 01:02:01,340
for a new printer last year, I was able to find one that not only clearly had Linux support

1386
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:07,340
but also supported Android, and that wasn't through the Google Cloud Print API, they actually,

1387
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:13,980
this is a brother printer, and they actually have a printing app in the Google Play Store.

1388
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:20,580
So you can even now, you know, find hardware that's compatible with your mobile devices

1389
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,580
as well.

1390
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,580
Yeah, very good point.

1391
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:27,780
And Urban, I'll let you have the final word, because it's a great point, you can't necessarily

1392
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:33,540
blame Linux if HP doesn't make a driver for a scanner, right?

1393
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:43,060
I think that responsibility for drivers is entirely on the company that makes that hardware,

1394
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,500
and it's not on Linux.

1395
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:51,340
If HP doesn't do the drivers for Linux, screw them, we'll use something else.

1396
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,340
That's right.

1397
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:54,980
I mean, that's why I bought a brother laser printer for the Office, because it just had

1398
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,500
great Linux support.

1399
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,580
What I did is I just went and checked CUPS and saw the driver in CUPS, and I'm like,

1400
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,980
okay, well then I know it'll work on everything that runs CUPS, and I'm good.

1401
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,460
Yeah, that's just it.

1402
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:09,700
At the FreeBSD Foundation, I've been trying to take that argument kind of the other way,

1403
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:13,420
instead of being like, hey, this manufacturer doesn't make drivers for their device, screw

1404
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:17,940
them, it's more like, well, why don't we get together a big group and demonstrate the demand

1405
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,180
to them, and then they'll bother, and we'll give them the resources to help them build

1406
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,180
the driver.

1407
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,180
That's a good idea, too.

1408
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,180
I like that.

1409
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,180
That's excellent.

1410
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:29,500
And that's how we have more 40 gigabit network drivers than other operating systems now, because

1411
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,020
we demonstrated the need.

1412
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:39,340
Well, and shops like Microsoft, they have huge departments dedicated to specific pieces

1413
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,340
of hardware.

1414
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:44,900
So they have, like for the Windows Server development team, on that team, there are

1415
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:49,660
sub-hardware teams that work just with manufacturers on getting drivers into that version of Windows.

1416
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:54,140
So there's a networking card department, a printer department, a storage department,

1417
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,140
and they might even have sub-departments.

1418
01:03:55,140 --> 01:04:00,500
I mean, it's very structured, and all those teams do is work with vendors to get drivers

1419
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,000
written and certified for Windows.

1420
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,180
So the FreeBSD approach makes sense, because that's what the commercial shops have been

1421
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,180
doing for a while.

1422
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,300
So one last thing with this article, too, I want to point out that I wish he would have

1423
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,420
addressed is that when it comes to legacy devices, such as an older printer, an older

1424
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,980
scanner, including Canon products, you will find that Linux is quite supportive, whereas

1425
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:24,380
newer versions of Windows will tell you to go F yourself.

1426
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:25,380
You're on your own.

1427
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:26,720
So, you know, just saying.

1428
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,100
He's got a great bunch of stuff.

1429
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:32,220
And the reason why I like it is it's hard, it's a little aggressive in its language,

1430
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,780
but it's accurate, it's referenced for the most part, some of its conjecture, some of

1431
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:38,140
its personal opinion, but some of its fact, and you can't deny it.

1432
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,540
It's a pretty good citation, too.

1433
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,780
I actually think it's not bad to, some people think I'm being negative.

1434
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:47,100
I don't think it's bad to lose sight of shortcomings so that way we can focus on those and make

1435
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:50,980
them even better, because there's opportunity if Linux shores these things up.

1436
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:53,220
So the only way to do that is if we keep ourselves accountable.

1437
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,220
Absolutely.

1438
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:58,380
Well, and to his credit, when an adjustment is made or he discovers something that actually

1439
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:02,780
counters a previous point, he will cross it out and actually update it.

1440
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,780
So that's cool.

1441
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,780
Yeah, very much.

1442
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,780
All right.

1443
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:10,820
And if you're not thick-skinned and you might be a little hard to read, I don't know, I

1444
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:11,820
just wanted to say.

1445
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,820
Put your big, warm pants on, you'll be all right.

1446
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:13,820
Yeah.

1447
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,820
Pour yourself a cold one.

1448
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,820
Exactly.

1449
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:16,820
Well, go on.

1450
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:17,820
Okay, that's fair enough.

1451
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:18,820
You can read it.

1452
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:21,220
Throw it in your read later queue or something like that.

1453
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:25,820
Oh, by the way, just fun to point out, he does, I just went off the whole list of problems

1454
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:26,820
with Linux.

1455
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,260
It might be fun to mention.

1456
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,060
Here's a few things he thought was wrong with Windows.

1457
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,060
Devastating Windows rot occurs.

1458
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,540
No enforced file system and registry hierarchies.

1459
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:38,380
Svshost.exe, no more needed to be said there.

1460
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,100
Not a true safe mode, it's not legitimately a true safe mode.

1461
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,780
No clean state option.

1462
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:49,860
The user as a system administrator is bogus and most users just totally ignore UAC.

1463
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:53,500
No good packaging mechanism, MSI is a fragile abomination.

1464
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:57,140
No system-wide update mechanism, which includes third-party software.

1465
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,460
Windows is extremely difficult to debug.

1466
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:03,100
Windows boot problems are often fatal and unsolvable unless you reinstall from scratch.

1467
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:07,140
Windows is hardware-dependent, especially when you're running from UEFI.

1468
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:11,420
Windows updates are unreliable and they also waste disk space and there's no way to cleanly

1469
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,420
upgrade your system.

1470
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,820
There will be thousands of leftover files, etc.

1471
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:18,020
So again, he's not saying Windows is great.

1472
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,380
And I would agree with all that list.

1473
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,380
Yeah.

1474
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,380
Yeah.

1475
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,380
He did a pretty good job, I think.

1476
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,380
I mean, considering.

1477
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,380
Yeah.

1478
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,380
Yeah.

1479
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,380
Alan, final thought on the topic?

1480
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:31,300
Oh, I thought I heard Alan, but then I didn't.

1481
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,300
Oh, I guess he left.

1482
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,940
He said something in the mumble room and then he left.

1483
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,940
He dropped his PSD microphone.

1484
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,940
He's like, you know what?

1485
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:36,940
Boom!

1486
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,940
Yeah.

1487
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:42,820
But Alan wanted me to mention before he left that TechSnap, episode 200 of the TechSnap

1488
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:46,060
program is coming up just in a couple of weeks.

1489
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:51,540
And if you've listened to TechSnap and something we've talked about, a story we've covered,

1490
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:55,620
a question we've answered or anything like that has ever helped you at home on your network

1491
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:59,660
or in your office, project, somewhere out there a little TechSnap advice has been helpful

1492
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:00,660
for you.

1493
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:04,180
So just send it into the TechSnap program, go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact,

1494
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,740
choose TechSnap from the dropdown and send in your story.

1495
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,800
We're going to have a special episode 200 where we'll be reading through some of those

1496
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,040
to celebrate.

1497
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:15,060
So it's kind of amazing, 200 episodes in a row too.

1498
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,060
Wow.

1499
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,060
Wow.

1500
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,060
Which is nuts.

1501
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:19,060
All right, guys.

1502
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,060
Well, I just will wrap it up there.

1503
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,980
I want to remind you that I'm looking for your personal runs Linux, either ones you

1504
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,100
find, that's fine too, but I'd really love to see your setups.

1505
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,160
Email them to linuxactionshow at jupitabroadcasting.com and put runs Linux in the subject line.

1506
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,180
And if you need to send in a video, put that up on YouTube.

1507
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,660
If you've got a picture, please put that up on Imgur and link that because I just pull

1508
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,660
down the text.

1509
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,100
I don't pull down attachments.

1510
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,260
And I'd love to feature those in an upcoming Linux action show.

1511
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:46,140
You can also submit ones you find out in the wild to linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1512
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,700
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com is also a great place to make this show and our other shows

1513
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,660
even better and give feedback.

1514
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,540
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com, anything like a story, community engagement, an app pick,

1515
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:01,100
runs Linux, anything like that on the subreddit, it's really welcome.

1516
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:02,340
And it helps make everything better.

It's a lot to do, so join us, won't you?

1521
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:21,620
All right Matt, well coming up on Sunday's Linux action show, we'll have a great show

1522
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:25,180
and I've been following the news already, got a few stories I can't wait to talk about.

1523
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:27,860
So join us on Sunday for that, so I'll see you then Matt.

1524
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:28,860
See you then.

1525
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:29,860
Okay everybody.

1526
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,860
Well guess what?

1527
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:32,540
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1528
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,540
Do join us, won't you?

1529
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:37,100
And don't forget we've also got Android apps so you can watch Jupiter Broadcasting on the

1530
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:41,020
go and jblive.info which is an audio only stream which works great when you're in the

1531
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:44,340
car over 3G or maybe you're at your desk and they don't want you using video.

1532
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,580
It's a great option, jblive.info.

1533
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,580
Okay everybody, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1534
01:08:49,580 --> 01:09:10,860
We'll be right back here next Tuesday.

1535
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:49,300
I don't know if there's been a series of videos.

1536
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,700
We're going to be talking about the Ubuntu Touch Terminal Emulator.

1537
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:53,700
It came out once before but we didn't talk about it on the show.

1538
01:09:53,700 --> 01:10:01,740
And this is the new multiple tab Ubuntu terminal that we might see ship in 1504.

1539
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:06,860
And one of the things I would look at is the animation is pretty smooth, it's pretty slick,

1540
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:08,900
it looks pretty good.

1541
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,980
So watch as now he'll click this and there he zooms out and there's the different tabs.

1542
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:16,020
So instead of tabs along the top you have sort of like a tab overview, sort of almost

1543
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:18,540
like the Firefox tab overview page.

1544
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:22,900
And you can see like the scroll action there looks real smooth, it's nice looking.

1545
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,900
Looks like a nice equal product.

1546
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:29,020
So just to be clear, this is the terminal for the phone that we happen to have made

1547
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:33,740
sure it works on the desktop and tablet, Convergence, which is...

1548
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,220
CONVERGENCE!

1549
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:40,380
But it's not in the phone yet, it's in the store if you've got a phone and you can grab

1550
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,380
the code, it's all open source, it's cool.

1551
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:51,060
It's actually maintained by the same guy who made Cool Retro Terminal.

1552
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:56,300
You know, I just gotta say, it's stuff like this that makes Linux so compelling.

1553
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,300
This is just good!

1554
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:03,120
Yeah, this is fun and I like the...

1555
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:08,140
It's definitely not like desktop optimized, but I like that they didn't make it for the

1556
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,600
desktop necessarily, but yet it's still functional.

1557
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,600
So that's good.

1558
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,460
And I saw it had a Retro Cool Terminal mode too, which is really neat.

1559
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,220
Yeah, the little thing down the bottom, I don't know if you can see this, there's a

1560
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:23,780
little pop-up menu and what we're planning for that is for it to be customizable.

1561
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:30,020
So you can have a pop-up menu for Emacs and a pop-up menu for Vi and it has all your keyboard

1562
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,820
shortcuts pre-filled in and you can define your own.

1563
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,820
Oh, shut your mouth, that's cool!

1564
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:35,820
That's great, guys.

1565
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,700
JSON file or something, that's really quite cool.

1566
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,700
I can't wait for that.

1567
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,060
Did I just hear customizable and Ubuntu in the same sentence?

1568
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:45,060
Oh boy.

1569
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:46,060
Oh snap.

1570
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,060
Sure snappage.

1571
01:11:47,060 --> 01:12:10,140
Get it back in your box.
