1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
See if you can place this.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,300
Can you place that sound?

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,180
That's the fatal error from Windows XP.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,540
Nope, no, it's a sound.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,220
Yeah, the the from from way back when the Ubuntu.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,980
The proper file name is Ubuntu question dog.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,660
It's the info question thing that that played in like Ubuntu

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,460
four to ten all the way to a ten ten, I think.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,400
Yep. All right.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,600
Now, see if you can place what era this Ubuntu

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
startup sound came from.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,200
Oh, man, it feels I know, right?

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,840
It gets me right in the nostalgia.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,080
That was from the very beginning all the way until Unity.

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,780
I miss those sounds now that I hear it.

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,120
Actually, no, they used them in Unity all the way until I think,

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,680
what was it, 1404?

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,760
I think it was 1404 when they stopped doing it.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,160
Good question.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,060
You know, there's still a dead package you can download.

21
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,820
So, yeah, yeah, you can still.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,720
That's how we got it.

23
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,460
Damn it. Now I want that on my computer and maybe your phone.

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,900
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,840
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,240
And my name is Brent. Hello, gentlemen.

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,880
As you know, we'd like to thank a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,620
For Black Friday, a cloud guru has 40 percent off

29
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,460
their personal annual plans. That's right.

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,560
40 percent off.

31
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,160
Go build your cloud skills with hundreds of courses, thousands of labs

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,860
and real sandbox environments.

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,540
Visit a cloud guru dot com and save big for the best cloud learning.

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,340
All right. Well, coming up on the show today,

35
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,040
this episode is really about revisiting old assumptions

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,780
about open source projects and once again, learning the value

37
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,080
of going back to something that you made,

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,580
maybe a decision that it wasn't the best for you or it needed features

39
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,680
or something like that, you know, an assumption you made about a project

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,320
after you spent a little time with it.

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,120
There's one thing I've learned doing this here podcast is

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,700
when you come back after a couple of years or, you know, however,

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,300
however much time has passed.

44
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,960
Sometimes the project's in a totally different state.

45
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,500
And you hear us talk about Plex on the show and especially on Self-Hosted.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,940
But a lot of you have been asking, guys, what are your current thoughts

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,880
on Jellyfin, which is Plex's totally free competitor

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,720
with a few power features up its sleeve that are really nice.

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,320
So has Jellyfin improved over the years?

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,720
Is Jellyfin good enough to replace Plex?

51
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,720
Or should you spring for that Black Friday Plex deal this year?

52
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,260
Well, we've each given it a spin and we're going to report back

53
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,120
with how it went and what kind of hardware we're using Jellyfin on,

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,460
which is pretty new and cool.

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,340
And then we'll round out the show with the emails and the pics and a lot more.

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,600
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,580
to our virtual lug. Hello, Mumble Room.

58
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,680
Hello, Chris.

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,820
Hey, hello and hello to Anthony and Thorbell,

60
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,880
who are from the Jellyfin project and are going to join us

61
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,060
as we're talking about a little bit and share their perspectives

62
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,220
and their insights on it.

63
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,220
Gentlemen, thank you both for taking the time today to make it on a live show.

64
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,260
Glad to have you here.

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,520
Thanks for having us.

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,420
Happy to be here.

67
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,000
All right. Well, let's get into a little community news

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,160
before we dive into the free media server stuff.

69
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,840
And I wanted to start with some of our own news.

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,640
I've been talking recently on the show about having a meetup

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,200
at the Museum of Flight and looking at the price of what it would cost

72
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,740
people to attend and organizing all of that.

73
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,180
I've decided to change things a little bit

74
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,020
because things are tight for me these days.

75
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,220
And I don't know about some of you out there,

76
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,420
especially with the holidays coming up.

77
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,520
I thought, let's do something even more personal and awesome.

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,160
And I know this really only applies to people in the Pacific Northwest area,

79
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,820
although it really would truly be open to anyone who wants to participate.

80
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,600
But we have an opportunity with Brent coming into the studio soon.

81
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,360
Brent's joining me back in the studio because he misses me, I assume.

82
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,040
Oh, yeah. After living with me on the RV, right?

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,440
You just have separation anxiety.

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,640
It's this feeling I just can't get rid of.

85
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,440
I think you're really coming back to visit JOOPS.

86
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,240
It's Levi. Come on. Let's. Yeah.

87
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,080
I suspect you just left a clothesline there and wants to get it back.

88
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,280
Yeah, that does sound like it.

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,680
And probably a mason jar.

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,420
So we thought, well, if Brent's going to be in town

91
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,720
and we're launching our new server soon,

92
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,060
maybe we should have a new server christening party at the studio.

93
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,960
So the meetup will be held at the studio.

94
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,700
It's going to be a grilling thing where you bring your own food, meat or veggies.

95
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,200
And of course, we'll have a few things here.

96
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,040
And I think we'll just make a whole day out of it.

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,640
I have a couple of other special surprises that I will tell you about soon,

98
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,600
but I don't want to reveal everything yet.

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,480
I don't even have dates yet because job one is Brent

100
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
and I are ironing out when he's going to be down here at the studio.

101
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,980
But it'll probably be within the next few weeks.

102
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,320
And then job two is we're going to get a meetup set up

103
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,620
and we'll let you know about it and all that kind of stuff.

104
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,220
And then we've got to try to make sure we have the server ready to go.

105
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,280
So it's ready to go for the new server launch party.

106
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,420
But I think that's going to be a real fun way to celebrate

107
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,460
the launch of a new server is a little meetup here at the studio.

108
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,160
Just, you know, bring your own appetizer or food, whatever you want,

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,340
and or don't bring anything and just hang out for a little bit.

110
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,040
And we'll make a mess out of my house studio, which is already a mess.

111
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,440
But it could make it take a little more.

112
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,000
Also, speaking of get togethers and community news,

113
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,380
I wanted to mention that Ohio Linux Fest 2021 is

114
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,920
back, they're doing the hybrid thing that I think a lot of us speculated.

115
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,020
What are events going to do when they do finally come back into person?

116
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,160
So they're going to have the in-person aspect,

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,220
but they're also going to have the online streaming aspect.

118
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,060
And that's going to be interesting to see how that goes.

119
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,260
Like, will they have hallway cams?

120
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,200
Are they just going to be dead air when there's nothing in the room?

121
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,660
Like, is there going to be pre-room streams?

122
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,940
I have so many questions from a production standpoint,

123
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,200
but at the same time, it's really good to see this.

124
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,540
They're gathering after 25 long months.

125
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,540
The Open Libre Free Conference returns to the Hyatt Regency,

126
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,620
Columbus on Friday, December 3rd and Saturday, December 4th.

127
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,620
They've been going for 19 years.

128
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,620
Man, it's been a long time since I've made it.

129
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,620
You know, it's not easy, but these are the kind of things

130
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,620
we got to figure out as we move forward.

131
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,620
We should pack up Brent's car and I'll drive out there.

132
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,620
I'm in.

133
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,620
You know me, I'm always into a trip. Come on.

134
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,640
Every road trip, we just make the space smaller and smaller and smaller

135
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,140
until finally one of us pops.

136
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
I got a motorcycle.

137
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Oh, God.

138
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Oh, boy.

139
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,140
I don't know about that.

140
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,140
Also, which just happened to kind of work out perfectly

141
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,140
for the timing of this show,

142
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,140
Kodi 19.3 has been released.

143
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Kodi, as you know, is a fantastic open source media player

144
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,160
that kind of goes at the problem a little bit differently than Jellyfin does.

145
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,160
And what has defined the perfect media server, if you will,

146
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
has really changed a lot.

147
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
No kidding.

148
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
This is going to make me feel old,

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
but I was trying to crack this for listeners 13 years ago

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,160
because we've really we've often had a couple of really good choices.

151
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,160
But depending on what you needed to do, you got to you got to pick the right one.

152
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
And that was a big problem 13 years ago.

153
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,160
And so I wanted to play a clip just to just to show you how long

154
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,160
we've been thinking about this and putting some of this into context.

155
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Now, a warning.

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Joe's going to hate this because I recorded this in my living room

157
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,160
back during the Linux action show days.

158
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,160
So it's not like it's super great audio and I kind of sound like a kid,

159
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,160
but I think it really underscores what this media server journey has been like.

160
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,160
So we go back to November 2008.

161
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,160
Everybody today, I want to talk to you about how to build the ultimate home

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
entertainment system using Linux.

163
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I'm not talking about like a mediocre home entertainment system

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,160
with one 30 inch TV that watches standard def resolution stuff.

165
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,160
No, I'm talking ultimate multiple high definition TVs,

166
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,160
multiple high definition sources, over the air HD broadcasts,

167
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Blu-ray movies, upscale DVDs,

168
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,160
and how you can get them throughout your house powered by Linux.

169
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Now, there's a lot of different options.

170
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,160
So I'm only going to touch on a couple today.

171
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,160
One of them is a software project that I've been watching carefully for quite a while.

172
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I've talked about it on the show before, and that's XBMC or Xbox Media Center.

173
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
The history with Xbox Media Center was it was originally developed

174
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,160
for the original Microsoft Xbox, but only for hacked Xboxes.

175
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Now, the lifespan of those original Xboxes is starting to come to an end.

176
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,160
So they've taken the project and they've released it for all the major platforms.

177
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,160
We've got it for Linux, Mac, and for Windows.

178
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,160
It's still in pretty early stages, but it's coming along really good.

179
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Even now, we're starting to see some packages for your favorite distribution,

180
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
but it's still recommended.

181
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
You probably want to build it from source.

182
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
So I'm not going to really touch on today,

183
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,160
but it's definitely something to keep your eye on because it's pretty awesome.

184
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Now, this up here is a myth TV system. It's a myth front end.

185
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll talk about more, I'll go more into details on that later.

186
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,160
And I have both myth on here and Xbox Media Center,

187
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,160
and I'm just kind of using both of them to kind of see which one I like best.

188
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,160
I think probably for movies, it's Xbox Media Center,

189
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,160
but for live TV playback, you really can't beat the myth front end, back end combination.

190
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Fast forward 13 years, and of course, XBMC is still around.

191
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
But now, well, it's known as Kodi.

192
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,160
And as 19.3 shows, it really does so much more these days.

193
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,160
We had a chance to play around with Kodi just last night.

194
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,160
And it has been so long since I loaded it up.

195
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,160
And I really felt out of place.

196
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,160
I used to live in the software.

197
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
And when I used it last night, it felt really different.

198
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
It felt obtuse to me.

199
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,160
It felt like a different visual language on how to navigate an interface.

200
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I could relearn it, and I could learn to love it,

201
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
especially because of the power it provides.

202
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,160
But for me to take advantage of Kodi today,

203
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
I have to load it up with add-ons,

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
and add-ons that essentially use external databases and try to manage external media.

205
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,160
And I'm not really using it for that media player that points at a Samba share

206
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,160
or an NFS mount and scans that directory.

207
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
That was when Kodi was great for me.

208
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,160
All right, hook it up to an external hard drive.

209
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,160
But now, when everything's on a central server in my setup,

210
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,160
and I want to track watch status across multiple machines,

211
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
and I also want to have remote web streaming,

212
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
and I want to have apps on my phone,

213
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Kodi feels like I'm really crowbarring into that situation, and it can be done.

214
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
But my takeaway was from our experience last night,

215
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
I'd be curious to hear what you guys thought.

216
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
It felt like a completely unnecessary step

217
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
when you are using something like Jellyfin or Plex.

218
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,160
It felt like Kodi was just sort of unnecessary now.

219
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Well, yeah, I mean, it's Kodi solving for a particular case, right?

220
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
There were days where when you were watching media,

221
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
you were probably doing it on a main TV in your living room,

222
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,160
and then Kodi was something that enabled you to turn a computer into something

223
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
that would let you play whatever media you had there with you.

224
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
But now we have a lot grander expectations

225
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,160
of these always-present streaming solutions that you can have on your phone,

226
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
that you can have on smart devices of any kind,

227
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,160
that you can get with you on your laptop, over a VPN on the go.

228
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Kodi can be a piece of that,

229
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
but there's also now a lot of other competitors there,

230
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
like Homekiss and Fire TVs.

231
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Brett, you're probably the most regular Kodi user amongst us,

233
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
and I know you even use it,

234
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,160
not necessarily in the context of a television, but just on your laptop.

235
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Yeah, here at home in my cabin, I use my laptop basically as my main TV.

236
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,160
But that's how we sort of got into Kodi last night

237
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
when we were playing around having fun, was I mentioned,

238
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,160
oh, yeah, I use it on the daily to join some Plex servers and watch some stuff.

239
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,160
And then we started playing with Kodi and some of the plugins

240
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
that we'll mention, I think, a little later,

241
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,160
and I realized I don't really use Kodi on the daily.

242
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,160
I use it as a way of launching the Plex add-on.

243
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,160
And, Chris, I had the exact same reaction when we started playing around in Kodi,

244
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,160
was that it felt like sort of the grandfather of the newer technologies

245
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
that we're playing with now.

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,160
So I will say Kodi has just gotten out of the way for me

247
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,160
in the last several years watching Plex this way, which is good.

248
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,160
But the interface isn't something I play with on a daily basis,

249
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
and I'm kind of glad for it.

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Yeah, and I would imagine somebody who's listening to this

251
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,160
who's just been using Kodi for a very long time thinks we're crazy.

252
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Because once you learn what screens actually have what and all of that,

253
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,160
I think it sticks and everything basically follows that convention.

254
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,160
But when you're coming in cold, it was rough.

255
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,160
And I definitely have the takeaway of I would have no problem deploying

256
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Jellyfin or Plex for a family member, but giving them Kodi, I'm not so sure.

257
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,160
But all of that said, so they fixed AirPlay in this recent release.

258
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,160
They've also put a little bit of work in to improve the way

259
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,160
the package metadata displays in different Linux app stores.

260
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,160
They're kind of making it a little more compliant in that regard.

261
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,160
And they've done some work to try to make it easier for Linux users

262
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
to install it in the more recent Kodi Matrix 19.3 release.

263
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes if you want to go check it out

264
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,160
because it's still one of my preferred ways to do decent media playback

265
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,160
that keeps track of what's been watched just by pointing at it

266
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
like a file share on your network.

267
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,160
And that's pretty useful because you don't need any backend server

268
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
or any software.

269
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,160
You can just get like an Android TV box or something or a Linux box

270
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,160
and hook it up to your HDMI and just throw Kodi on there.

271
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,160
It's still just so great for that job.

272
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
linode.com slash unplugged.

273
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,160
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account

274
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,160
and you go there to support the show.

275
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,160
When we went independent just over a year ago,

276
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Linode was the first company to sign on the dotted line to support us.

277
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
It helped that they're Linux geeks and that's why they started Linode.

278
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,160
They saw where virtualization technology was going in the Linux kernel

279
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,160
and they realized that really powerful systems could be used

280
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,160
to host multiple things instead of just like Apache virtual machines

281
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,160
that could actually host entire virtual machines.

282
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
That was 18 years ago.

283
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,160
They got into it because they loved the technology.

284
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,160
That permeates everything they have built over the last 18 years.

285
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,160
And just recently, they've been rolling out upgraded MVME storage,

286
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
which is a total game changer for certain types of workloads.

287
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Now, I don't need it for like a blog site.

288
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
You probably don't.

289
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I don't need it for my Starbound server or my Syncthing server.

290
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,160
But if you have an e-commerce site or if you have something

291
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
that does a lot of database transactions, there can be like big benefits.

292
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I mean, you're just looking at a lot more IOPS per gigabyte

293
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,160
than traditional SSD or I mean, especially spinning rust.

294
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
So if you're a performance hound and you want to try it out

295
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
or if you've got an application that you think the throughput

296
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
that you would get from MVME would improve the application,

297
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,160
it's a great chance to take advantage of Linode's support team.

298
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Their team can help you sort through the possibilities

299
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,160
for accessing the power of MVME and arrive at an optimum storage

300
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
and configuration for your environment.

301
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Linode's 30% to 50% cheaper than the major hypervisors out there

302
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
that want to lock you into their infrastructure.

303
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
And Linode has 11 data centers around the world.

304
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,160
So you're going to find something near you or your customers.

305
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,160
They've really refined this over the last 18 years.

306
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,160
The dashboard is super straightforward.

307
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
Everyone on our team picked it up really quick.

308
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
There was a very short learning curve.

309
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
And then those of us who wanted to take it further

310
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,160
through the extra commands and controls they give you in the dashboard

311
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
or through the API have had those options.

312
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,160
It's really nice that way.

313
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
There's so many great options if you want to build it up yourself

314
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
or deploy with a one-click application

315
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,160
and a lot of configurations depending on what your workload is.

316
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,160
You're going to find the right configuration, the right price,

317
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
and you're going to be blown away by the performance.

318
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,160
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get $100.

319
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
You can really try this for 60 days on a new account.

320
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
And you go there to support the show.

321
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
And now you know your support matters more than ever.

322
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
Linode's been with the show for a long time.

323
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
So let's show them you're still listening.

324
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
Let's show them you're still interested.

325
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,160
And let's show them you still want to learn about new, cool things.

326
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,160
And you want to run Linux up in the cloud the best way possible.

327
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Linode.com slash unplugged.

328
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Well, let's talk about Jellyfin.

329
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,160
The Plex competitor that, yes, is GPL, totally free software.

330
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,160
I've actually been using both Jellyfin and Plex for a while now.

331
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I'll be honest, I mostly use Jellyfin for myself.

332
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,160
But in the past, there's been some limitations around some other folks

333
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,160
that wanted to give access to Jellyfin where Plex was just a better fit.

334
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
I think that might be changing.

335
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
We'll get into that as we go on.

336
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,160
But if you've never tried it, much like Plex, I mean,

337
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,160
you can use it for all kinds of media, movies, TV, books, music.

338
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,160
And yes, even live TV.

339
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,160
It presents a super easy to use web dashboard with multiple user support

340
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,160
and an ecosystem of Jellyfin clients that you can use to play directly

341
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
on whatever device you have,

342
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,160
especially if it supports what is happening on the back end.

343
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,160
And much like Plex, if your client doesn't support direct play,

344
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,160
well, Jellyfin can encode it with the power of FFmpeg.

345
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,160
It really can do pretty much all you want.

346
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,160
I'm curious, though, because I've been kind of stuck in the Jellyfin ecosystem myself.

347
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I have admittedly modest needs.

348
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
I got to know, Chris.

349
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,160
What does someone who's been in the Plex ecosystem think of trying Jellyfin?

350
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Very deep in the Plex ecosystem with that, too.

351
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I'm really all in on Plex.

352
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I've been a Plex subscriber for years because they have a $5 a month Plex pass.

353
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,160
And if you pay for that, it unlocks hardware decoding.

354
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,160
So they lock that up behind a paywall.

355
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,160
You get downloads and you get HDR support and you can set stream bitrate caps.

356
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
All of that, they paywall.

357
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Where MBN Jellyfin gives you all of that for free,

358
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,160
which has always made me kind of check out both MBN Jellyfin.

359
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,160
And I never really clicked for me specifically.

360
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
It always felt like the web interface and the clients were a little rough.

361
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,160
The hardware encoding and decoding on Plex was a little more robust.

362
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,160
And the metadata management was a little sharper.

363
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
It was a little bit better about some things on the Plex side.

364
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
And so I just stuck with it.

365
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,160
But I keep an eye on it because I frequently hear about it from the audience.

366
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
And I noticed, it seemed in my distant perception,

367
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
that Jellyfin was kind of pulling ahead of the pack a little bit.

368
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,160
And Plex has been making changes, understandably.

369
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,160
But they've been making changes to make Plex seem more like a legitimate commercial streaming platform.

370
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
They're trying to pitch themselves as all streaming providers could stream through Plex.

371
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
It could be the one place.

372
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
It's Switzerland of streaming.

373
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
I have zero interest in that.

374
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,160
I understand why they have to go from a business strategy standpoint.

375
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I get why they have to go that direction.

376
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
But I'm all about my local media.

377
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,160
I want to be able to play my media when I'm completely without internet.

378
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Right. It sort of blurs the line between,

379
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,160
is this sort of a self-hosted tool that you're using to access media you already have?

380
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,160
Or is this something more like an online web service?

381
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,160
And Jellyfin is already immediately better at that last part.

382
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,160
None of the account user sign-in stuff goes through a Jellyfin cloud server like it does on Plex.

383
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,160
So you do not need any internet connectivity for Jellyfin to work.

384
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
So that's always put it on my radar.

385
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,160
And then the fact that it's GPL and those kinds of things have always made me want to check back in with it.

386
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
But I was never quite satisfied myself.

387
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I found it mostly lacking in the client side, but pretty good on the server side.

388
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,160
So this time around, we decided to abuse a compute module four and throw it on there.

389
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,160
And just start with a clean slate with Jellyfin.

390
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Point it at, it's either a Samba mount or an NFS mount, I can't remember, but I mounted my big library onto the compute module four.

391
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,160
And then I passed that through to Docker, to the container.

392
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
And I just let Jellyfin go to town.

393
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,160
And so I wanted to hear what you thought, Brent, because once I got it all set up, I gave you guys the links.

394
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I created your accounts and I said, tell me what you think about it.

395
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Co-watch TV shows, hardest unplugged homework ever.

396
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
It really was the hardest research we've ever had to do.

397
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
So how'd your research go, Brent?

398
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Well, I watched till late at night and then I fell asleep.

399
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
And that's basically how it went.

400
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Just kidding.

401
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,160
I had previous to that had zero Jellyfin experience.

402
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
So that's kind of a little bit of context.

403
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,160
And I do not have any experience administering one of these servers.

404
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,160
So I came at it from a purely like consumer end user perspective.

405
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:39,160
And immediately I was a bit wonderfully shocked at how beautiful the Web interface was.

406
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,160
It seemed super intuitive and also just gorgeous.

407
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:51,160
I have to say, whoever worked on that, the designers, they put a lot of love into it and a lot of attention.

408
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,160
And that grabbed me instantly on the more technical side of things.

409
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,160
I think I probably have the worst Internet from anyone who's currently listening to this.

410
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I live sort of tucked away in the Rockies.

411
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:14,160
And Chris, I think that's exactly why you wanted to have me on to try this, just to see how it dealt with some of the buffering that is common with.

412
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
Yeah, you know, it's a common problem, I guess, for me.

413
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:26,160
And I will say I it behaved exactly as expected, which is my Internet is terrible and it had to buffer sometimes.

414
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:33,160
And certain shows were just unusable because of situation on my end.

415
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:40,160
I don't think that's a jellyfin issue more than it is an inconvenience on my side.

416
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,160
But I will say that occasionally the buffering interface just kind of vanished.

417
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,160
I think it was trying to punish me for not being an ideal use case.

418
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,160
And the interface would just go away and I would have nothing to work with.

419
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,160
So that was, I think, a tiny thing, but it still left me with this gorgeous show background to look at.

420
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,160
So I wasn't complaining too, too much.

421
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:11,160
I do want to say that we played with the sync play feature.

422
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
And I want to hear what you guys have to say about that.

423
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,160
On my end, even with my sort of sketchy Internet connection, it seemed really responsive.

424
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
And was that your experience on your end, too?

425
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
I found the sync play to be pretty cool.

426
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,160
So this is a way where you can create a group of users and whoever creates the group is essentially directing what play.

427
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,160
So when I hit play on something, it starts for everyone else in that group.

428
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
And I thought that was a pretty cool feature.

429
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,160
It's something I wish I would have had more when I was flying and staying in hotels.

430
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,160
But I could definitely see down the road doing that with friends and family or you guys like we did last night.

431
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,160
And I wonder, Brent, didn't you try at that time to play with different quality settings?

432
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,160
You could choose different bit rates and that helped, right?

433
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,160
I was easily able to play with bit rates and they're exactly where I wanted to find them, which was nice.

434
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
And that did really help.

435
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:13,160
What I did notice once we got disconnected is that Jellyfin allows you to grab a URL of a particular show or episode and plug that into something like VLC.

436
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
And that's the approach I took, actually.

437
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,160
And it worked flawlessly after we disconnected on our phone call yesterday.

438
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I ended up going that route.

439
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Did you have to manually up the buffer in VLC or did VLC just figure that out for you?

440
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
I didn't have to do a single thing.

441
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
I was thinking I was going to have to do that.

442
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:37,160
And I started poking around looking for it in anticipation of some buffering happening and turned out after five minutes I didn't even need it.

443
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:45,160
So that was curious to me and actually kind of nice, just having sort of an interface I'm used to and not needing to have the Web browser either.

444
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
So that got me kind of excited, too.

445
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Yeah, I do the same thing.

446
00:23:49,160 --> 00:24:00,160
It's just in the hamburger menu when you're viewing a media file in Jellyfin and Jellyfin has support for audiobooks, movies, TV show, live TV.

447
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,160
So say you're in an audiobook or you're in a television episode, you can get that URL.

448
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:11,160
And in the command line, you can just type MPV space and paste the URL and MPV will open up and just start playing it.

449
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:16,160
It's possible to expose that kind of stuff with Plex, but you got to get like browser extensions and stuff.

450
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
They don't really want you to have that kind of stuff in Plex.

451
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,160
You can also download files right from that interface in Jellyfin, which is another route you could go.

452
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
But this way you didn't have to wait for the download.

453
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,160
It's kind of this moment that I wanted to say, think of Jellyfin as it's a back end in a sense.

454
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:41,160
It's a media library and you can use different front end clients, the Web, their Android client or things like MPV to get access to that media.

455
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
And that's something that's really powerful.

456
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
It can also act as a DLNA server.

457
00:24:45,160 --> 00:25:00,160
And then because Jellyfin gives you access to these features for free, it lets you do something that I think I think you do, Wes, which is you kind of create like a temporary disposable Jellyfin server when you're watching something with friends or something.

458
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Yeah, well, that's just it.

459
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
It's like it's so easy to get started in Docker Compose.

460
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,160
It has guest accounts you can set up for just like easy, fast, anonymous access.

461
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:14,160
So if you have some videos that aren't, you know, they're not sensitive, they're maybe they're training videos internally for new employees.

462
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Maybe they're just some some home videos that you want to share with folks.

463
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Jellyfin is just an application you can use to expose that kind of thing.

464
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,160
And it's super flexible because it's not it's not locked down.

465
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
It's not part of a wider service.

466
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,160
And you're not paying for a subscription just for the few months or whatever you're going to use it.

467
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,160
Yeah, right. Like you can just send someone that link to share it.

468
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,160
Or, you know me, I like to mess around with Chromecast.

469
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
That's how I watch a lot of media.

470
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:46,160
And so those URLs, you just pipe them into Chromecast with something like Cat, which is a utility we've mentioned before, a little Python app that you can use to control your Chromecast.

471
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
And that works great.

472
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,160
If you don't want the whole functionality that Jellyfin has to offer, you can just use it as basically a streaming file server.

473
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,160
And to just double on that a little bit.

474
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,160
So that cat app that you're mentioning, it's a command line tool.

475
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:07,160
And you basically cat cast and then you give it the URL that you copy out of the Jellyfin Web UI.

476
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,160
And it will locally stream that to a Chromecast device, right, Wes?

477
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
It doesn't even require going out to the Google services.

478
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,160
So I could still actually use that to Chromecast even when I have no Internet connection.

479
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Well, it just basically tells the Chromecast, hey, go try to pull this this URL.

480
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,160
So the Chromecast does need to go access the Jellyfin application.

481
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Oh, and they have to load that off.

482
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Womp womp.

483
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,160
I'd much rather have it not access the Internet for any of the playback.

484
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Well, you know, you have to do some testing there.

485
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,160
I haven't tested it entirely offline.

486
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
I will try it next time.

487
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,160
I'll try it sometime because I have an outdoor television on JOOPS and that's where I use a Chromecast.

488
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,160
But then when I'm out in the boonies, I can't use it.

489
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
Of course, Starlink is going to change all of that.

490
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,160
But anyways, I was trying to answer two questions with this little test of ours.

491
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,160
Obviously, there was the I guess it's three because it's the meta question of have things improved since I tried it last.

492
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,160
And obviously, spoiler, the answer is yes.

493
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Surprise, surprise.

494
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,160
But I wanted to know, could I switch from Plex where I am very deep into it?

495
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I've got multiple family members that use it.

496
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
It's a big part of our setup.

497
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I have two Plex instances.

498
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,160
I have one at the studio and I have one at the RV.

499
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,160
And I want to know, could somebody that's as deep as I am into Plex switch to Jellyfin?

500
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:23,160
And I also wanted to know, can Jellyfin, the server, run adequately on a Pi 4, specifically the Compute Module 4,

501
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
which is what I have now with a carrier board.

502
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,160
It's inside a dual gigabit Ethernet carrier board for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4.

503
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:33,160
It has four gigs of RAM and a 32 gigabyte eMMC.

504
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,160
So it's not like a screamer of a disk, but it's better than an SD card.

505
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:42,160
It has two NICs and I'm using ETH0 because that's the one that's on the PCI bus.

506
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,160
ETH1 is on the USB bus.

507
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,160
I do a more of a comprehensive review of this device, if you're curious, this little carrier board and the CM4

508
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,160
in the most recent self-hosted that's out right now, self-hosted.show.

509
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,160
But I wanted to know how it was as a Jellyfin server with multiple users and all of that kind of stuff.

510
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Now, this is going to be different if you're out of the big powerful box.

511
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,160
But on the Pi 4, I did notice that the web server process, when three of us are connected simultaneously,

512
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,160
takes about 40 percent of the CPU.

513
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Now, I'm mentioning that because we were specifically doing a watch together thing.

514
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
So we were all doing it through the web interface.

515
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,160
And that 40 percent overhead means you got less room left for transcoding if it needs to happen.

516
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:27,160
And I never actually did get transcoding that's GPU accelerated working.

517
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,160
That I could not seem to get working with my containerized version on OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed.

518
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Yes, that's right.

519
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Admittedly, we tried this in maybe the most difficult way possible for ourselves,

520
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
as is show for standard practice.

521
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,160
First of all, when I first set up the compute module, I actually was attempting to punish the CPU

522
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,160
and generate heat and get that kind of stuff figured out because I was benchmarking it for self-hosted.

523
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,160
And then I realized, holy crap, this Jellyfin is great.

524
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I got to tell the guys about this.

525
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,160
And then we started using it for watching shows.

526
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,160
And I never got the GPU acceleration working.

527
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,160
If you're using a client that does what they call direct play,

528
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,160
so that means that whatever you're watching on has the codecs to decode the video and audio,

529
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,160
then it's really no problem because direct play has very little overhead.

530
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,160
And that worked out just great.

531
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:18,160
But when you're trying to encode or decode anything and it's using the CPU,

532
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,160
well, you know, it's a Raspberry Pi 4.

533
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,160
So the first media scan that also goes out and finds all the chapters, which I freaking love.

534
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I love that it goes out and finds all the chapters and gets thumbnails.

535
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Holy crap, that's awesome.

536
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
But it takes a long time on a big library.

537
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Like in my case, it took nearly four days.

538
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,160
So, you know, that is a little intense.

539
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,160
But once it's done, you can set Jellyfin to save a lot of the metadata to the file system,

540
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
including an NFO file and whatnot.

541
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,160
So it would save time on future scans if you ever had to do that.

542
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,160
But I think with a little more troubleshooting, I could probably get hardware decoding working.

543
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:00,160
But realistically, my use cases are such that everywhere I watch my content from my media server is direct play.

544
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I think Plex gets a little bit higher marks in terms of overall performance on the Raspberry Pi.

545
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,160
But Jellyfin is really it's getting the job done, too.

546
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I should say that's one downside of using the Chromecast.

547
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:16,160
It's often a little less compatible with direct play just because it's picky about formats.

548
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,160
So if you do adopt that path, then, yeah, give it a little juice.

549
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Dan, you've been using Jellyfin on a Raspberry Pi for a little bit, right? An 8 gig model?

550
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
Yeah, I've been using it for a couple of years now.

551
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Oh, OK. And have you gotten, A, GPU acceleration working and, B, how would you characterize the performance?

552
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:39,160
No GPU acceleration. I just encode my stuff in a container that actually works fine on most clients.

553
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Yeah, that is really the way to go. Just if you can.

554
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Yeah, it is. And then the performance is all right if you're just two, maybe three clients connected and it doesn't have to do transcoding.

555
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Yeah, if you can avoid transcoding, you can really run it on some pretty impressive low end hardware.

556
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,160
And the nice thing here is these things are silent.

557
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:05,160
They don't take very much power, so you're not burning 300 watts for something you might watch occasionally.

558
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,160
And I really thought it was adequate.

559
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:13,160
In fact, when you combine it with some of the features that Jellyfin exposes that I don't think Plex has, or at least up to snuff,

560
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,160
I think I could make a pretty compelling argument to switch the family.

561
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,160
Number one, user controls are better. So I set up users for all of us.

562
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,160
I love that there's no cloud connectivity required to authenticate, number one.

563
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,160
But also you can set up PG rating filters or specific tags.

564
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Is that why I didn't see any Rick and Morty on there? You don't think I'm adult enough.

565
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I just don't want to freak you out, man. I don't want to freak you out.

566
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,160
You can also just not show entire libraries, too. That's an option.

567
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,160
Which is kind of maybe a little bit more in line with how we want to do things with my families.

568
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,160
We want to have multiple people using the same server, but we don't need to see each other's libraries.

569
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,160
And the kids don't need to see the parents movies folder library.

570
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
So that could actually work pretty nice.

571
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,160
I think Plex has similar stuff, but the way Jellyfin and the options Jellyfin has, I think are superior.

572
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,160
And while the watch together stuff was a little obtuse to set up,

573
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,160
it took me a little bit to figure out the recycle icon actually meant group icon.

574
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Once you set it up, it works really well.

575
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,160
For Wes and I, and I was on my Starlink connection and Wes was on a com.

576
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Are you on Comcast now, Wes?

577
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
A wave, I think.

578
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Okay. But I'd say it was instantaneous for us.

579
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
You could hear me clicking the mouse and then see the results.

580
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,160
And it just synced right up. And yeah, it really was great.

581
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:29,160
And it was interesting. So it seemed like the signaling layer, if you will, of the sync play,

582
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,160
like communicating when to play or pause was still working with Brent.

583
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,160
It was just that the video side of things wasn't really keeping up on his connection.

584
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,160
But that our part of it kept working.

585
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,160
It wasn't like the whole thing broke down and just was a partial failure,

586
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,160
which I think is kind of impressive considering the stress it was under.

587
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Yeah, I found that impressive.

588
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:51,160
On my end, I could, you know, because we were on a quote unquote phone call

589
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,160
while we were trying to figure all this out and I could hear your clicks

590
00:32:54,160 --> 00:33:00,160
and it would almost instantly appear on my end, which was great.

591
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:07,160
So it kind of distinguished between user interface and just the pure downloading of video,

592
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,160
which I think I really appreciated because I could actually still be a part of, you know,

593
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,160
what was happening and see what you guys were doing

594
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,160
without necessarily having the video be as responsive.

595
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,160
So that was actually really refreshing and I didn't expect that.

596
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,160
You know, something I didn't expect is from the dashboard, you can send messages to the client.

597
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,160
So they just show up as like a little discrete notification on the bottom left.

598
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
But what surprised me, I mean, that was neat.

599
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,160
But what surprised me is that notification messaging feature even works

600
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,160
when you're using the Kodi playback plugin, the add on for Kodi.

601
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:45,160
I will say that is in a past setup, I had my parents house networked with my house over Tink

602
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,160
before, you know, Nebula and Talescale came along.

603
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,160
And then I had Jellyfin set up at home and then they were, they had an Intel NUC system

604
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,160
that was running Kodi and then it was using one of these plugins that there's two options,

605
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,160
one that has a kind of standalone version that goes into a separate interface

606
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,160
to get your Jellyfin library and then another one that basically treats Jellyfin

607
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,160
as the backend library for Kodi and syncs everything down that way.

608
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,160
I had that working and I mean, it mostly just worked.

609
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,160
It felt like a very first class way to use, you know, to experience Jellyfin

610
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,160
with all the playback progress, all that stuff, chapters, it just worked.

611
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Yeah, that does sound nice.

612
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
That would be a good way to use it with Kodi if I was going to do it.

613
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,160
But in my estimation, the modern TV setup is either like a smart TV

614
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
that you're not going to be able to get an app for.

615
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,160
But there are, you know, maybe you could get Kodi for some of them, I don't know.

616
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,160
But you can find the Jellyfin app for like the Rokus out there and for Android TV.

617
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Yeah, I did just get them a Roku for the Jellyfin app, so that's what they're using now.

618
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,160
And how is that? Is that decent?

619
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
Yeah, you know, they're just starting to play with it.

620
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,160
They were playing with a few other apps on there first, but yeah,

621
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,160
I think it's going to be a just fine, very minimal maintenance long term solution.

622
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,160
And at least for now, the one gap in like just watch it through the app

623
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
is with the Apple TV.

624
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,160
And it was earlier this year, I finally decided to pull out my beloved Nvidia Shield

625
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,160
after their most recent update put ginormous banner ads along the top of the UI.

626
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
I just could not.

627
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,160
And I gave it a little bit to see if I get used to it.

628
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,160
But not only did they start advertising stuff that I didn't want to turn my TV on and see,

629
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,160
but it just got worse and worse and worse and ads for stuff I was never going to subscribe to.

630
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,160
And I just decided right then and there I was going to get rid of it.

631
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:43,160
And I, in a fit of rage, picked up a used Apple TV and it's been fantastic.

632
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
I actually think it's a really good little playback box because, you know,

633
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,160
these Apple processors are pretty good.

634
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
But there's no Jellyfin app.

635
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,160
But there is an app called Infuse and the Jellyfin project has even blogged about this.

636
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,160
And it's fantastic.

637
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,160
Infuse is what I've actually switched to to watch Plex.

638
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,160
I've dropped the official Plex app and I've already been using Infuse.

639
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,160
It's like an old school, simple, but powerful media player that can play back Zamba shares,

640
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,160
DLNA shares, Plex, MB, or just local media.

641
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,160
And it can sync your play status with Jellyfin and with MB and with Plex.

642
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,160
It's so awesome.

643
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,160
You're saying it's a modern proprietary Kodi?

644
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Yeah, I guess so.

645
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Yeah, it kind of is.

646
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,160
It really kind of is because it does do a little bit of the library stuff too.

647
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,160
And it supports like every freaking codec out there.

648
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,160
And it does have like a subscription, which I have totally signed up for.

649
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Because with that you get full Google Cast support, full AirPlay support.

650
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,160
You get Dolby TrueHD support, more formats.

651
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,160
And it's a very solid media experience.

652
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Guys, it's like a bulletproof media experience.

653
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,160
When I played that clip from 13 years ago, I was constantly fixing this stuff.

654
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,160
We'd sit down to do like family movie night and I'd always have to fix something first.

655
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,160
And it was embarrassing because you spend all this time and energy and effort

656
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
and you build up this thing that you've just done.

657
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,160
And you sit down and go do the big demonstration and something doesn't work.

658
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,160
When you get an Android TV or an Apple TV and you put Infuse or the Jellyfin app on there

659
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,160
and you connect them up to a Jellyfin server, you get the instant on just works experience.

660
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,160
And then things like the remote play and the web interface and the watch together stuff

661
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
are like bonuses on top of that.

662
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,160
But what you get at its core is a system that tracks what you've watched,

663
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
collects all the metadata, organizes things, puts nice thumbnails up there

664
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,160
and makes it SO and family friendly for everyone to enjoy the things that you've collected.

665
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
And I use this for my audio books.

666
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
I use it for my home movies.

667
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,160
And when we deploy the new server, I'm not deploying Plex anymore.

668
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,160
I'm deploying Jellyfin.

669
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,160
I am so glad that we went back and revisited this project

670
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,160
because I had an assumption that this just wasn't it for me.

671
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
I was too deep into this.

672
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,160
It wasn't sufficient. It wasn't covering all my use case.

673
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,160
And now I feel like it covers more than what Plex even offers me.

674
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
It does it for free. It's GPL software.

675
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
There's no subscription required.

676
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,160
And there's no online component that I have to go through to log in.

677
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,160
It's really for me, it's a big shift.

678
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
So Wes, you've been right all along.

679
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Turns out you were right. It is really great.

680
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
You've been saying it for a while.

681
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
I was a little bit of a client snob.

682
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,160
I would still try to argue that the iOS and Android Plex apps are better.

683
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:51,160
But I think the trend is not going in a good direction for Plex and its apps.

684
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,160
And I think the trend is going in the right direction for Jellyfin.

685
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,160
Yeah, client support is definitely one of the harder aspects of this

686
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,160
because it's just a numbers game to get all good clients in all the places.

687
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
But it does seem to be getting better.

688
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,160
And there are some alternatives out there that help bridge the gap

689
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
for the time being, which is great.

690
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,160
I'm grateful, too, that you can also sort of interrupt.

691
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,160
You can point both Plex and Jellyfin at the same file system

692
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
and expose it both ways.

693
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,160
I'm still doing that.

694
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
So you don't necessarily have to choose.

695
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
And Jellyfin makes it so easy to just layer it on top.

696
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
It's sort of like, well, why not?

697
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
If you've already got some containers running for Plex,

698
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
just pop in a Jellyfin.

699
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
That's true.

700
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,160
And that's kind of what I did, only just on different hardware.

701
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
It wasn't until I started using it more seriously.

702
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I was like, oh, maybe I should have put this on the nice x86 box

703
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
when we started using a lot of the web stuff.

704
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
So if you're going to do a lot of web playback,

705
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
I think you might want GPU accelerated decoding.

706
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,160
But if you're not, if you're going to do a lot of direct playback,

707
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
you really could get away with it on a Raspberry Pi 4.

708
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
That right there, that blows my mind.

709
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,160
We talk a lot about this kind of stuff and these types of applications

710
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
and this kind of load on self-hosted.

711
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
So go check out self-hosted.show.

712
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,160
And for the Plex angle, and also when it comes to hardware recommendations,

713
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,160
if you want to build a media server, our buddy Alex has perfectmediaserver.com

714
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,160
where he's outlined his media server setup.

715
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,160
So go check that out because I think that's a great resource,

716
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,160
even if you were to end up using Jellyfin on top of it or Plex.

717
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
But I think you could get all out there.

718
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
So much good stuff over there. Yeah, really.

719
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
It's true.

720
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,160
He was going to join us today, but I think work, you know, work out in the way.

721
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Well, we have a bit of housekeeping.

722
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,160
Thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

723
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,160
Last week's pre-show, I think, and post-show was really, really educational.

724
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,160
For those of us who want a better understanding of the struggles

725
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
that different open source projects face, the communication challenges,

726
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,160
and it really kind of ended on a good note, wow.

727
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Last week's members feed episode was fantastic.

728
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Worth an entire year of subscription.

729
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
Go check it out on pluggedcore.com.

730
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,160
I think we just do some of our best bits there because the recorder is off

731
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,160
so people feel a little more free to chat.

732
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
So our members get that content, but they're also supporting the show.

733
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,160
You can also get the tighter Joe edited version that has less ads.

734
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,160
So it has a shorter runtime, but also it still has all the production quality

735
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
that the main release version gets.

736
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,160
And I want to plug the Tuxies because the voting is still going for a little bit longer.

737
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Tuxies.party.

738
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Go vote for the best open source projects of the year and a lot more.

739
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,160
Tuxies.party.

740
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,160
We want your feedback, your input, your ideas, your suggestions for segments

741
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,160
or topics, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

742
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,160
Go there to let us know what you're thinking.

743
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
And join our matrix community.

744
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,160
It's growing all the time at linuxunplug.com slash matrix.

745
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
That's where we have all the information.

746
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,160
And speaking of matrix, a big security fix for the Synapse server is out today.

747
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
So if you're listening to this...

748
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
Wait, wait, what?

749
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
We better update.

750
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Yeah, we should maybe do that soon, especially now that we're making this public.

751
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,160
So if you have a public or private Synapse server running matrix,

752
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
go check out the news.

753
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
We'll have a...

754
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Let's put a link in the show notes.

755
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
We'll put a link in the show notes for information and go update

756
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
because that stuff's important.

757
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,160
And then I'd like to invite you to hang out with friends on Sundays.

758
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,160
It's our Luplug every Sunday at noon Pacific.

759
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,160
You can find it at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for your actual time.

760
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,160
And if you don't have Mumble set up yet, linuxunplug.com slash Mumble.

761
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
So go find out how to get that set up.

762
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,160
And then you got a good to go when we have a show on a Tuesday and you're around.

763
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
You could join us or hang out in the Luplug.

764
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,160
And stay tuned because we'll have meetup information very soon

765
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
about the server christening party.

766
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,160
And also I should mention jupytergarage.com.

767
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,160
The rando swag bags are still in stock.

768
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
I scared everyone away when I said there's a few limited orders left

769
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
and so we only got a few orders.

770
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
But we do have about 10 left.

771
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
So if you'd like to get a random swag bag,

772
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,160
and we have one slightly more that also comes with the Jupiter journal,

773
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
which is a notebook with a rocket on top.

774
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,160
I got to make sure you get one of those while you're visiting here.

775
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I'll set one aside for you.

776
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Yeah, please do.

777
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
I mean, what isn't better with a rocket on top? Come on.

778
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Rockets make everything better.

779
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
They do. They do.

780
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Or you can buy just the journal at jupytergarage.com.

781
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
Then you can choose your color.

782
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,160
And then if you really want to treat yourself,

783
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
and these are hard to do right now,

784
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
we have a bearded tux bomber.

785
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,160
You know the bearded tux from Linux action show?

786
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
We put that on a bomber jacket.

787
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,160
And it's just something for the winter.

788
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,160
A nice go into town jacket with a low key design on it.

789
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,160
And I was actually surprised they were actually going to have enough in stock for us to do that.

790
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
But that'll be up there too.

791
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
All of it at jupytergarage.com.

792
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,160
A way to get yourself a little something and support the network.

793
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,160
Get some old swag, stickers, new swag, some bonus road trip swag.

794
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
All of that's in the random swag bag.

795
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
So go get yourself some.

796
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
All right, gentlemen.

797
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
How about we do a little feedback?

798
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Crashmaster writes,

799
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,160
I've been a longtime listener to most of your shows since the beginning.

800
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Love the shows.

801
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,160
I'm a patron donor and a proud owner of a Coder radio robe

802
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,160
that I embarrassed my family with by wearing too long on weekends.

803
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,160
My man.

804
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,160
Properly done.

805
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Excellent.

806
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,160
He continues,

807
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,160
I just heard episode 432 of Linux Unplugged.

808
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,160
This has to be your most unbiased and fair review of an OpenSUSE project ever.

809
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Ouch.

810
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,160
Especially you, Chris.

811
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
You put aside old biases and really gave it a fair shot.

812
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
Thank you for that.

813
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,160
As a longtime OpenSUSE user, myself,

814
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
may I suggest a couple of tools?

815
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:24,160
So he mentions Tumbleweed-CLI and also a tool named TWUPS.

816
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,160
I am guessing that's Tumbleweed-UPS.

817
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
Come on, you're not going to call it TWUPS, Brent?

818
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Yeah, I'd call it TWUPS.

819
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
TWUPS.

820
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
Well, let's just call it TWUPS then.

821
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
Okay.

822
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
So he says both those tools are fantastic tools

823
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,160
that let you easily switch official Tumbleweed images

824
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,160
and view snapshot community reviews.

825
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,160
Harmless to your system, really,

826
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,160
and easy to unwind if you'd rather keep with the standard role.

827
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,160
He says, I like having this for desktop in particular

828
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,160
so I can troubleshoot NVIDIA drivers faster than previously.

829
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,160
This is an area I feel I am probably the most ignorant about

830
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
when it comes to Tumbleweed.

831
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,160
Like I really, I got a sense of this when I went to do an update

832
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,160
on my Compute Module 4, which is running OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed,

833
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,160
which by the way, although the install took forever,

834
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
it was slow as hell.

835
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,160
It just, I installed OpenSUSE Tumbleweed on the Compute Module 4

836
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,160
like it was just a regular old PC.

837
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,160
I booted off of an ISO image on a USB thumbstick

838
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,160
and I installed SUSE to the internal EMC hard drive

839
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,160
on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module like it was a computer.

840
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
It's crazy.

841
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
And it was slow, but man, it's actually been pretty nice.

842
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
And I decided, well, I'll do my first big update

843
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
and there was like 180 packages.

844
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160
Whoa, this thing really is a rolling release.

845
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,160
And I got this strangely worded message that I think has been translated

846
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,160
from German to English that essentially told me

847
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,160
I probably don't want to upgrade using this method.

848
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
I probably want to use a different tool.

849
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
And I went to go look up that tool.

850
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,160
I actually, by the way, sorry, it's another tangent.

851
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:00,160
I remain very impressed with A, the zipper output,

852
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,160
the way it displays package information.

853
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,160
B, the way it displays download information.

854
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,160
And C, the various tools they implement to help you suss out

855
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,160
what you actually mean to be doing and what you shouldn't be doing.

856
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
They have a couple of them.

857
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,160
And that's been really nice as a newbie to come into that.

858
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,160
And one of those little warnings I got is,

859
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,160
hey, man, on a rolling tumbleweed thing here,

860
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,160
you probably want to use this tool for doing your upgrades.

861
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,160
I had no idea, right?

862
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,160
I just thought I could just do standard old upgrades.

863
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,160
That gave me my first insight that there was something more to look into.

864
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,160
And then getting this email, it's obvious that there's a lot deeper

865
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,160
I could go with this image stuff.

866
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,160
And that could actually be pretty cool on our server.

867
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,160
There is another interesting tidbit in this feedback down at the bottom.

868
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,160
They note that the OpenSea subreddit is quite active and strong

869
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:00,160
and that, quote, some of us may post community news notices

870
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,160
of certain public JB polls in there from time to time.

871
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,160
It's a shame if other distros aren't doing the same. Cuff.

872
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,160
Hey, man, don't hate the player, hate the game, right?

873
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
I mean, he's right.

874
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,160
The Fedora folks could be posting that in there, right?

875
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,160
The Ubuntu subreddit could be asking for votes for Ubuntu in the taxis.

876
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Is it fair play? I think it is.

877
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,160
Is it a clean play? I'm not so sure.

878
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,160
Is that a challenge, Chris?

879
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,160
No.

880
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:33,160
I do want to say really quickly about the different update methods in Tumbleweed.

881
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,160
That's actually one of my criticisms.

882
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Even without knowing about some of these that got mentioned just now,

883
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,160
there's like four or five different ways of updating packages,

884
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:49,160
some that install just patches, some that install all of the software.

885
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,160
And I found that kind of confusing.

886
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,160
And we did get some feedback that I didn't mention here that mentioned just that.

887
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,160
Oh, yeah, there's four or five, six different ways of doing it.

888
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,160
So pick your favorite.

889
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,160
But I would say in some ways that just seems really confusing for someone who's new to it.

890
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,160
Was that your experience, guys?

891
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,160
Yeah, I got to be honest.

892
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:12,160
I kind of go into it assuming, though, that if I just sucked it up and used Yast to do the update or whatever,

893
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:18,160
I kind of assume Yast would probably pick the safest, most correctest method.

894
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,160
But even then, there's two different ways of doing it in Yast, which that I came to anyway.

895
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,160
So there's like Yast package update or something.

896
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,160
And then there's the main Yast repository updater.

897
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,160
And those two do different things.

898
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,160
One of them does only patches.

899
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
The other one does everything.

900
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
So I found that tricky.

901
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
You're right.

902
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Now that I think about it, it is kind of confusing.

903
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:46,160
I've been using Zipper on the command line, and I've really only gone through this once so far because I'm still so new into it.

904
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,160
But that was sort of one of the reasons why I thought, you know, I should put this on the Compute Module 4

905
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
because I feel like I still have more to figure out.

906
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,160
And, you know, we're going to put it on our server.

907
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,160
So I really got to actually learn it.

908
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,160
I've got to take this serious.

909
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:05,160
I think part of this, too, is like I try to be honest with myself when I know that I haven't necessarily done things in the proper order

910
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,160
or gone and tried to find docs before just diving in and expecting to know what I'm doing.

911
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,160
And the SUSE ecosystem is just a bit different.

912
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,160
It's a different setup of a system, but in some ways clearly a quite intentional setup.

913
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,160
So I think it's worth us trying to be open to finding what pathways there are even if they don't make sense at first.

914
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
I agree.

915
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,160
I think the first reaction sometimes actually is, well, that doesn't make any sense.

916
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,160
But, you know, after a few seconds of Googling, you kind of get the reasoning.

917
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,160
And a lot of times so far, actually everything so far has made sense once I've done the reading.

918
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
And I don't mind that.

919
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,160
You know, when I'm making a transition like this, I try to be intentional.

920
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,160
I try to take a few seconds to do a little research before I go do the update.

921
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,160
And so when I saw that error, I was like, OK, let's go read about this.

922
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,160
And I went look the whole thing up and skimmed a couple of wikis and then I read a couple of threads.

923
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,160
And then I went and looked at a couple of different docs and came to a conclusion.

924
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,160
And yeah, it took extra time, but that's a one time investment.

925
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,160
And I feel like, OK, I've got that now. I get it.

926
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,160
I kind of try to also take the time to study the output of the tools a little bit more.

927
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,160
So that way I kind of learn what they're saying.

928
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,160
You're reading the output of the tools you use. Wild.

929
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,160
I know. It's a crazy concept, right?

930
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,160
Well, maybe we'll learn enough that we won't have to use the transactional server to be able to survive this experiment.

931
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
That's true. That's true.

932
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,160
Although then again, it seems like immutable file systems are coming for all of us and that's going to solve everything, right?

933
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Yeah, we got another little piece of news here about our coverage on the Steam OS updates with immutable file systems.

934
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:42,160
That teaser we got last week, Nathaniel writes in LUP 4.3.2.

935
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:51,160
You mentioned that Steam OS 3.0 will have an immutable file system with the ability to kind of open an escape hatch by turning on in developer mode.

936
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,160
He continues, Although I think that is a good idea, I think you guys approached it the wrong way in the episode.

937
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,160
You seem to still be thinking about it as a workstation when in reality I think it should be thought of as a game console.

938
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,160
Many game consoles nowadays are not modifiable on the firmware level.

939
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,160
And when you think about it, adding packages on the Steam Deck can be seen as the same type of thing.

940
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,160
It's just like adding modifications to the firmware of a closed console.

941
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:22,160
I think that this is their way of doing exactly that without going to the extremes of these other console manufacturers.

942
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,160
Protecting the user from themselves is a very legitimate goal for these console manufacturers.

943
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,160
And the Steam Deck is no exception.

944
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,160
I'm just glad it's in a way that doesn't infringe on users freedom.

945
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:43,160
He's absolutely right that the appropriate context to actually be discussing the Steam OS release and the Steam Deck is as a console, as an appliance.

946
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:48,160
And of course, a file system like this that's read-only makes a lot more sense in that context.

947
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:58,160
We took about 3 to 10 seconds talking about that and then immediately turned it into how cool will this be when somebody forks us into a desktop project?

948
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,160
How can we abuse this in ways that it's not intentionally being designed for?

949
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,160
That's kind of our way, isn't it?

950
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,160
I mean, you know it's going to happen though.

951
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:14,160
We're all just sitting here waiting for Steam OS 3 to get released so that way we can dig into how it works and then build something really cool out of it.

952
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,160
And I maintain, and I know Valve just doesn't have the engineering resources to do, well, I don't know this.

953
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:27,160
But I suspect Valve would rather dedicate their engineering resources to getting the Deck out the door and getting game compatibility and getting the OS ship shape.

954
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:35,160
But I just, I think it'd be amazing if Valve was able to release Steam OS over the holidays to let Linux geeks really figure out how it ticks.

955
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:42,160
So that way when decks do hit the market in February, you got an army of people out there that know how to support this thing and troubleshoot this thing.

956
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,160
But I know that's just, that's not how it's going to work out.

957
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,160
But when it does land, we're definitely going to take a look at it.

958
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,160
I'm very excited about that.

959
00:52:49,160 --> 00:53:00,160
You know, to defend our perspective slightly more, I think we're actually really excited by what technologies will come out of this as well and will land on desktop and get us even more excited in that space.

960
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,160
So give us a little bit of slack, would you?

961
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:15,160
All right, ladies and gentlemen, every now and then on the Unplugged program, we have an opportunity to present a pick that will forever improve your life.

962
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Episode 433 is one of these opportunities.

963
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,160
You're welcome.

964
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,160
Congratulations.

965
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,160
It's called Junction.

966
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:36,160
It is a simple application that you set as your default browser, and it lets you choose the application to open files and links.

967
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,160
Now, I'm going to let you soak that in for a moment.

968
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,160
You make this your default browser, right?

969
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:53,160
Then when you click a link, this tiny, beautifully designed application comes up with big icons for which browser you'd like to open that link in.

970
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:10,160
And if you live the multi-browser lifestyle like I do, this changes your life in a very positive way because I probably click a link in chat or on, you know, an application and an email, whatever, a thousand times a week, maybe a hundred times a day.

971
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
Who knows?

972
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:22,160
And every time I'm very intentional about what browser I want that link to open up in because I have one signed into some accounts, I have some signed into other accounts, etc.

973
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,160
Additionally, you can have it choose PNG open apps or whatever your different apps you have for like some apps.

974
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,160
Sometimes I want to edit a PNG.

975
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,160
Sometimes I just want to view a PNG.

976
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Junction can be set as the default PNG editor, and then it will show you the compatible apps.

977
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
You pick which one to open that PNG filing.

978
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,160
That's where it changes the game for me.

979
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:49,160
See, at first it kind of just sounded like you were describing a tool that made your nightmarish hellscape of a browser set up more sustainable.

980
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:56,160
But the PNG, I mean, yeah, OK, OK, this is kind of taking this whole system of defaults, adding a whole new layer on top.

981
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,160
Westpain, I'm not done yet.

982
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,160
You can do it for your default email composer.

983
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,160
You can use Junction as the default folder.

984
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,160
Maybe you live the multi-file manager lifestyle.

985
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,160
Junction is going to bring it all together for you.

986
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Additionally, you can do things from the command line.

987
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,160
So you can actually use Junction to open up things, different apps from the command line.

988
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,160
It supports multiple Firefox profiles.

989
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:23,160
This I first discovered an app called Bumper on the Mac like two years ago.

990
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,160
And I always had been lamenting how it was my favorite little app I came across on the Mac.

991
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,160
And I wish we had something like this on Linux.

992
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,160
And it's been around for about six months, I think.

993
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,160
And I discovered it about two weeks ago.

994
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,160
I desperately wanted to tell everyone last week, but we had a theme.

995
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,160
It was command line I love and I was sticking to it.

996
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,160
But now I finally get to tell you and it's also available on Flat Hub.

997
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:50,160
So it's super easy to install, but you don't have to install from Flat Hub.

998
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,160
Again, it's called Junction and you're welcome.

999
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,160
It's really great.

1000
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,160
That's all I have.

1001
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,160
I just really like it.

1002
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,160
I just, you know, when you can make micro little improvements in your workflow that speed up

1003
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,160
what you do every single time you do something and you do that thing frequently, it matters.

1004
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,160
Junction.

1005
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
They should hire me.

1006
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,160
I'll be their spokesperson.

1007
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,160
I'm all about it.

1008
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,160
This is going to be like this.

1009
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Junction.

1010
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,160
When every moment of life matters.

1011
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,160
That'd be my pitch.

1012
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,160
I'll throw the eagle in for free.

1013
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
All right.

1014
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,160
That's going to wrap us up.

1015
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,160
If you do the Twitter thing, follow us on there if you want.

1016
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
I don't know you.

1017
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,160
At linuxunplugged.com.

1018
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,160
I'd like to know you though.

1019
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,160
So if you follow it, maybe I get to know you a little better.

1020
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
You can also follow me.

1021
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,160
I'm at Chris Lass.

1022
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,160
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1023
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,160
Gentlemen, do you want to plug a Twitter or something?

1024
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
I don't know.

1025
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,160
At Wes Payne.

1026
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,160
At Brent Gervais.

1027
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,160
If you can spell it, I'm there.

1028
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,160
We've got links in the show notes.

1029
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
We always do.

1030
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,160
And them show notes for everything we talked about today, they're at linuxunplugged.com

1031
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,160
slash 433, right?

1032
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,160
And this 433, I think so.

1033
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
Man.

1034
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,160
It sure is.

1035
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,160
Remember when we were just doing 400?

1036
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,160
What the hell happened there?

1037
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,160
I don't remember that episode at all.

1038
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,160
Oh, I should mention Wes, you got to go check out Linux Action News this week because there's

1039
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,160
this DNS poisoning attack story going around.

1040
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,160
And Linux, of course, is vulnerable when Mac OS and FreeBSD and Windows are not.

1041
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,160
And it actually originally stems from something that happened in 2008, some research from

1042
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,160
2008.

1043
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160
We thought it was fixed.

1044
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,160
Turns out not fixed.

1045
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,160
And so it's widely deployed.

1046
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,160
We did a whole breakdown, explained everything and how it works in nice, concise terms.

1047
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,160
And this week's episode of Linux Action News to go to linuxactionnews.com and get that

1048
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,160
because that's like all of the stuff you really need to know happening right there.

1049
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,160
And it's nice, presently concise way as we can, because, you know, we know you got limited

1050
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,160
time and there's things that happen you need to know about.

1051
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,160
And then when we want to sit here and hang out and chat with you, that's what this shows

1052
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,160
for.

1053
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,160
That's what this is for.

1054
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,160
And you could do it live with us.

1055
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:02,160
Join us at jblive.tv on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

1056
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,160
Eastern.

1057
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,160
See you next week.

1058
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
Same bat time, same bat station.

1059
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,160
That's right.

1060
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,160
Mumble room's always open.

1061
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
Thank you to our guests from Jellyfin for joining us.

1062
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Thor, Bill dropped off.

1063
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,160
Bill dropped off partway because he had an internet issue.

1064
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,160
But Anthony, thank you for making it.

1065
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,160
And thank you for all of the hard work on Jellyfin.

1066
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
Keep it up.

1067
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,160
And thank you, everyone, for listening.

1068
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,160
Thank you to those that go to linuxunplug.com slash subscribe and get the show every single

1069
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:31,160
week because we love visiting with you and we love hearing from you at linuxunplug.com

1070
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,160
slash contact.

1071
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:38,160
And last but not least, the conversation continues at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

1072
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,160
How many URLs?

1073
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,160
Way too many.

1074
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:58,160
See you right back here next Tuesday.

1075
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:20,160
All right.

1076
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,160
JBtitles.com.

1077
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,160
Oh, yeah.

1078
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,160
Everybody go vote.

1079
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,160
Here we go.

1080
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
Let's go pick something.

1081
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:31,160
By the way, Ben, did I see it go by that you did get GPU acceleration working on your Pi

1082
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,160
4 for Jellyfin?

1083
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,160
Yeah.

1084
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:41,160
So what I did was use the Linux server container and I had one device that I couldn't get mapped,

1085
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:51,160
but with the device tag, I just mounted the entire slash dev directory to it.

1086
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:57,160
And with the open max, the omx in Jellyfin, then I got it all running.

1087
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,160
Oh, huh.

1088
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,160
Yeah.

1089
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,160
Okay.

1090
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:06,320
So it's like the what's in the Linux over IO Docker compose file is pointing at devices

1091
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,080
that are not the same path on the Raspberry Pi 4 compute module, at least.

1092
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,440
But I'd never even thought about just saying screw it.

1093
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,160
Here's all of dev.

1094
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,160
Huh?

1095
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,160
You know what?

1096
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,160
Why not?

1097
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:32,160
What can go wrong?
