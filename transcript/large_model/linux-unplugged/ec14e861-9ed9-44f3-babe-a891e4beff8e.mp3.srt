00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,680
Easy to read, easy to render, easy to print.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,420
Beautiful news in just glorious text.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,840
I'm going to be mad if this is more than 68k to download.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:31,040
Hey friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

8

My name is Chris.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,360
My name is Wes.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,760
Hello, Wes.

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,640
Don't make Wes angry.

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
You wouldn't like it.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
No.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,720
This episode is brought to you by the all-new A Cloud Guru, the leader in learning for the

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi there.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Welcome into the show.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,320
It's $3.99 and I'm having a bit of a mild panic attack because I can't believe I've

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,040
committed to anything for this long.

22
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,480
It's been great though.

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,200
We were just talking on the live stream about some ideas that we have for next week's episode.

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,960
So I want to say right here off the top, if you'd like to help us celebrate 400, please

25
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,200
join us live next week over at jblive.tv at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday next

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
week.

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,760
You can hang out with us to celebrate 400 episodes of this here little podcast.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,960
It's pretty great.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,640
But coming up on $3.99, we have a bit of a problem that has been building for a long

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,260
time in the open source community.

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:39,840
And so we wanted to use our 399th episode to spotlight the challenge of independent

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,800
open source software developers, specifically those who are trying to invest in an application

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,200
for a long period of time, say a decade.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Maybe it's an application that's kind of complicated as well.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,000
It's not a fun thing to talk about.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,520
I think in a sense, it's meant that we haven't brought this up a lot because we don't have

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,820
a real positive spin on this.

38
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:05,040
But I think it's led us to give this issue less attention than it deserves.

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
So coming up on the show today, we're going to talk with the developer behind Lutris,

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,800
which is a phenomenal application for Linux gamers to manage their GOG library, their

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,720
humble library, Steam library, all in one application.

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,120
And of course, locally installed games, classic retro games.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
It's one of the best tools for gamers out there.

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,400
And the developer of it will be joining us to discuss some of those issues a little bit

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,680
in the show.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,040
But we have a lot more than that, too.

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,760
We have a plethora of topics to get into, including some community news, some feedback,

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,300
and of course, analysis provided by our crack team of virtual Lug members.

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,840
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Hello, hello.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Hello, hello.

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
Hello, hello.

53
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Namaskaram.

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,200
Hello, everybody.

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,760
It's good to have you here.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,680
As we gather here, it's been a week since we found out that RMS was back on the board

57
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,320
at the Free Software Foundation.

58
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,920
And a lot of things have been written and said about this.

59
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,920
I haven't seen this wave of both pushback and analysis and clickbait.

60
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,440
I haven't seen this kind of thing in a long time.

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,920
And so I don't think I have a lot more to say today, but I am very happy with our coverage

62
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,920
on Linux Action News episode 182.

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,800
So if you haven't heard that and you want to hear our take and analysis on the situation,

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,360
go check out linuxactionnews.com.

65
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,120
I think at a certain point, what I'm worried about is while there's still relevant discussion

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,580
to be had here, it starts to look like a feeding frenzy.

67
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,200
It becomes more of a gang up than analysis.

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,040
So I want to give a tip of the hat also to the boys over at Late Night Linux, episode

69
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
118.

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,600
I think they did a really good discussion there.

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,460
They handled that really well, I thought.

72
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,060
They voiced both sides of the situation.

73
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,120
They had a good discussion, and I wanted to compliment them.

74
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,560
So go check out Late Night Linux 118 for that as well, if you're looking for a little more

75
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
analysis.

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,480
I think we'll leave it at that, really.

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,560
I don't think I need to say much more.

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm a little disappointed that some in the Linux media just sort of skipped the story

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,440
because it made them uncomfortable.

80
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,980
Yeah, that's the name of this game.

81
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,980
It comes up.

82
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,480
And then you saw others who milked it for like everything they can.

83
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,920
I appreciate it's a hard topic for our community to talk about.

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,720
I don't think there's much more we can add, Wes, than we have now at this point.

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,300
We had our initial, like we just found out about the news last week in this episode.

86
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,480
And then in Linux Action News 182, we had an opportunity to kind of reflect on all of

87
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,120
the open letters that had come out in the news coverage and sort of surmised our analysis

88
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
of the situation.

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
And I'm proud of that work we did there.

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,220
And I think it stands on its own as a piece of our coverage.

91
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,320
Any other thoughts that you have on it?

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
Are you good with that?

93
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
You agree?

94
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Yeah, I agree.

95
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,400
I think we should just move right along because also in episode 182 of Linux Action News,

96
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,800
we had a good chat with Neil McGovern, the executive director of the GNOME Foundation,

97
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,760
discussed the design challenges, GTK4, and of course, all the great technical work being

98
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
done on the shell.

99
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,480
And I think that's what we should probably be more excited about today.

100
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,480
Hear, hear.

101
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Hear, hear.

102
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Yeah.

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
There we go.

104
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
All right.

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Well, then let's talk about something new.

106
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Let's talk about...

107
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Oh, am I going to say this right?

108
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Alamo Linux.

109
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Is that right, Wes?

110
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Alamo Linux.

111
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,040
It's officially stable today.

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,400
They write, we are happy to announce we are releasing the first Alamo Linux OS stable

113
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
version.

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,000
And for those of you who don't remember, this is one of the first announced quote unquote

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,960
replacements for traditional CentOS.

116
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,760
They also announced the formation of a nonprofit that's going to take over responsibility for

117
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,840
managing the Alamo Linux OS project.

118
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,000
Also announced some of the board members that are going to steer that effort.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,720
So it looks like things are starting to really happen over there.

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Yeah.

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
It's what?

122
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,640
About four months since we got the news about the traditional release path for CentOS going

123
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,480
away and then switching to stream.

124
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,720
And now within that time period, we have a one to one binary compatible quote unquote

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
drop in replacement.

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,680
I haven't tested that yet.

127
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,660
And they say with a very long support timeframe.

128
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,540
So if you were wondering how long it would take someone out there to respond to those

129
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,040
changes and actually ship something as a version 1.0, four months.

130
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
There it is.

131
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
Hats off to them.

132
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,720
Yeah, now we just wait and see who uses it and how long it lasts, I guess.

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm not really sure what we qualify as success here, but this is great.

134
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
It's great to see.

135
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
And hopefully there's a lot of happy users out there.

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,640
I think Rocky is getting really close as well.

137
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,440
Rocky Linux is getting Nye, the final release of that one.

138
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,520
And we'll have to cover that.

139
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,760
I mean, at some point, I'd like to take a look at these.

140
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,600
I don't know how you exactly do analysis.

141
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
CentOS shootout.

142
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Yeah.

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,880
Do you have any insight in how we could compare these these various CentOS clones and what

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
what benchmarks even go by there?

145
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm not I'm not really clear on how to do this.

146
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,480
I mean, if they're doing their mission correctly, you won't really be able to tell a difference.

147
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
So right.

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,260
I guess that is the benchmark, isn't it?

149
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,880
Is if it feels like it's its own unique distro, they're doing it wrong.

150
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Exactly.

151
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,280
Because with their stated goal of, you know, bug for bug compatibility, it gets to be even

152
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,160
difficult to add any kind of features or fix any other bugs.

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,340
It's not going to happen in those type of distros.

154
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,100
They're made more for building on top of with some some kind of something equivalent to

155
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,080
like the CentOS SIGs, which will be their own challenge to stand up.

156
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,360
I'm both happy and pleased for them to see this.

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,840
But I wonder if you feel like I do, Carl.

158
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,160
I'm also a little like but we haven't even given stream a shot yet.

159
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,720
I feel kind of like it hasn't gotten a chance to even prove itself.

160
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,360
Well, I'm obviously biased there.

161
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,800
So I don't know how much I can contribute on that.

162
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,120
Other than we're definitely working hard on making stream eight good and stream nine's

163
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
in the works.

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
It's coming out pretty soon.

165
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,840
I don't know that we've actually set a public ish date, but definitely very soon you'll

166
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,460
see stream nine.

167
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,800
And that'll be you know, what's planned to go into rail 9.0.

168
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,560
And I'm hoping that you know, I'm hoping a lot more people give it a shot then because

169
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,560
we'll have a lot more thing much modularity will be a lot more mature.

170
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,200
Some of the other drawbacks we've had with eight are going to be taken care of like we're

171
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,300
trying to make the entire build route available.

172
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,420
There were some devil packages that were missing in stream eight that made a lot of things

173
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,260
like Apple harder to do.

174
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,020
So we're hoping to enable a lot more contributions and a lot more of the ecosystem with nine.

175
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,840
It's the first stream of the new era.

176
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Right.

177
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
This will be the first time where we're actually delivering on the mission stream eight's kind

178
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
of a retrofit like, okay, well, it's going to be upstream.

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,540
It's just still in progress to get upstream.

180
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,980
We're still technically stream eight, we're still rebuilding it.

181
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm still doing a lot of those rebuilds myself.

182
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,480
And they're still happening inside rail internally first.

183
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,560
It's just they're getting delivered to the public as soon as we rebuild them rather than

184
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,320
batching them all up into one big like CentOS 8.4 release.

185
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,320
With stream nine, that's when we're actually going to be moving, finishing that process

186
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,520
and having, I don't want to say finished, there'll still be things that can be improved,

187
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,880
but it'll be a lot closer to the final vision of rail maintainers doing their builds and

188
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,360
stream nine first, and then we compose and deliver those.

189
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,000
We're doing weekly right now delivery of the updates.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
I don't know if we're going to keep that same cadence, but that's probably what people could

191
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
expect initially.

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay.

193
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,400
Neil, I'm curious if you feel like this means that CentOS stream has to compete even more

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,320
aggressively with these other clones out there now.

195
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:28,020
So I think that the CentOS stream effort that's going on now is going to be an interesting

196
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,640
differentiator on itself because when you look at what CentOS stream nine is going to

197
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,800
be, and if you do the right kind of digging and a little bit of the poking, you can kind

198
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,900
of see that we're probably going to start seeing early builds and releases coming out

199
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,600
in about two months.

200
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,800
We'll fact check me in two months time and see if we've got that going.

201
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,280
But I think what you're going to see is that people who are really into the enterprise

202
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:06,920
space who have been kind of frustrated with how difficult it is to leverage RHEL or CentOS

203
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,360
and be able to get things going and get things fixed, we'll find that CentOS stream will

204
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,080
be a way for them to deal with those problems because one of the things that I have been

205
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,360
conveyed as part of some of the work I do professionally that involves Red Hat Enterprise

206
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Linux is I'm being told I should just go push them into CentOS stream and they'll cherry

207
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,920
pick them back if they need to be early, but then they'll be shipped right along with everything

208
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,940
else into the next point release.

209
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,000
So it gives an avenue in which people who are equipped to be able to do stuff to make

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,280
it better for everyone actually have the ability to do it, engaging with Red Hat and engaging

211
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,520
with the community and making a better enterprise Linux.

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
I think that's awesome.

213
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,240
I mean, I've already been doing the same in OpenSUSE Leap for three years now.

214
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,460
And so it's nice to see this on the Red Hat side of things too.

215
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:11,120
It's gotten to the point now where I can actually visualize the flow of it from Fedora onward.

216
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,320
And the fundamental change now is that Stream is going to make RHEL a more openly developed

217
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,900
operating system.

218
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,960
And I think because of the scale of importance that RHEL has in the industry, that is a bigger

219
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,840
win than we can appreciate right now while we are in the midst of the very beginning

220
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,200
of the transition.

221
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,400
But long term, like when we are in episode 500 territory, we'll look back and be grateful,

222
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,680
I think, that RHEL's development is so much more open now.

223
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,520
And people have insights what's actually going to land in RHEL and can plan and develop for

224
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
it.

225
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,120
I think it's going to make a huge difference, but I guess time will tell.

226
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,600
We have a PSA for Ubuntu folks out there.

227
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,360
Ubuntu 21.04 is testing soon, and they'd love to get your help.

228
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,600
Now, they have specific things they're going to focus on.

229
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,680
So I recommend you check the link in the show notes if you'd like to help them out.

230
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,360
But it's coming up pretty soon, April 1st to April 7th.

231
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,160
On April 1st, they'll release Ubuntu 21.04, and they'll halt changes, do some testing,

232
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,520
and then hopefully incorporate what everybody finds during testing week.

233
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,680
They have information and all that good stuff in a post that Popey made on the Ubuntu discourse

234
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
site.

235
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

236
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,680
If you'd like to help them make the next release a little bit better, because this has the

237
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,640
opportunity to kind of be a great desktop environment for folks who are not ready to

238
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,800
take the plunge to 40 and want something really, really solid and just the latest and greatest

239
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,280
of the GNOME 3 series.

240
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
So go check that out.

241
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,320
We'll have a link in the show notes and you can help them.

242
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,920
Go help them, you know, go make it better.

243
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,160
Go make it even better.

244
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,180
And then next up in the show, this is an interesting one.

245
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,520
So I had an opportunity to sit down with some of the folks behind shells.com about a week

246
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,460
ago, just like an off-air conversation that we had, because they are, well, they're introducing

247
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,240
something that seems like a pretty solid idea to me.

248
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,120
Streaming is all the rage these days.

249
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,280
I signed up for a GeForce Now streaming membership and every now and then I stream video games.

250
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,640
And it kind of makes sense that Linux would be in on that game.

251
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,400
So they're new.

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,040
They're just kind of getting rolling.

253
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,760
They're not a sponsor or anything like that.

254
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,700
There's no relationship between them and JB.

255
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,880
But I'm always curious how companies are using Linux.

256
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,680
And then because I used to be an IT guy who built up systems, I always like to know, like

257
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,760
as much as I can about the tech behind the scenes.

258
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
And so the idea behind shells.com, if you haven't heard of it, probably haven't because

259
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,520
it's pretty new, let's just stream a Linux desktop that you have root on via your browser.

260
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,460
And they got lots of different distros, some distros they're working directly with who

261
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,500
will basically answer their calls.

262
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,800
So all of them that will.

263
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,600
There's like, I played, did you get a chance to play with it, Wes?

264
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,440
I played with an Ubuntu box, a Fedora box, messed around with it and thought it was pretty

265
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
neat.

266
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Yeah.

267
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,760
I mean, I didn't play with it a ton, but everything I tried, I was pretty impressed.

268
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,120
Snappy worked right up.

269
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,960
I mean, it felt like a real Linux box.

270
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Yeah.

271
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,560
And it's interesting because they're not like running off of any other cloud infrastructure.

272
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,800
They in the modern day, they're actually, they have their own data center, their own

273
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
servers.

274
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,380
It really seems like they have this infrastructure pretty far along.

275
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,600
And I was curious why.

276
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,160
And I suspect it's because they have ties to the people who found private internet access

277
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,660
and even Mount Gox.

278
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,080
So I chatted with their man behind the scenes who is building all this up on the tech side.

279
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,120
So I'm Zlatan Todorich.

280
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,280
If that name sounds familiar to you, that's because you might recall he was the CTO at

281
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,060
Purism in a past life.

282
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,620
So we started things off by asking why he left Purism and how he ended up at shells.com.

283
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,200
I think our audience might recall your name.

284
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,680
It might sound familiar because it was October 20th, 2019 that Michael Arbrol posted an interview

285
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,220
with you at Ferronix where you expressed some concerns around Purism.

286
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:09,180
So how do we go, just short version, how do we go from leaving Purism to working at shells.com

287
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,880
and building their tech infrastructure?

288
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,440
Well, it was, I guess, more like part of a community.

289
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:23,080
So I left Purism because I disagreed with the direction it chose to go forward.

290
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:32,680
And I ended up in shells because they basically contacted KDE community and people from KDE

291
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,080
contacted me and they needed a systems engineer.

292
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,560
And from there on, I became a systems engineer, project manager, product manager, and probably

293
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,880
some few more titles in there.

294
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
It's startup.

295
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
So everybody is having like five jobs.

296
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,480
Yeah, I know that one.

297
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,000
It just seems super ambitious.

298
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,720
So the elevator pitch for the audience that's listening and feel free to jump in is it's

299
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:08,080
a way to get a full Linux desktop shell in your web browser or on mobile using the app.

300
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,400
And if you're a student or a worker or a developer or creator and you need access to a Linux

301
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,360
desktop and one that will persist as well, so you can disconnect and reconnect and that

302
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,400
environment still exists and you can install software and you get admin access.

303
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,960
That's what shells.com is trying to do.

304
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:31,280
But functionally, that means you're spinning up VMs and creating VMs and allocating IPs

305
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,960
and all kinds of stuff on the back end.

306
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,520
And there's not like a package, as far as I know, that you can just install and we'll

307
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
do that for you.

308
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,840
So no, we basically use open source tech and leverage that.

309
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:52,880
So we use QEMU and we use Pyke protocol to basically show in browsers.

310
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,840
And we have our own things going on in the back end to make all that smooth process.

311
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,800
And as you said, currently, we have a couple of Linux distros, we work with more, we also

312
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,880
plan to offer Windows, Android, and who knows what future brings for us.

313
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,960
It seems like you must have done something to make the Spice experience feel a little

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
quicker.

315
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,760
It feels faster than VNC to me.

316
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Yeah, I mean, Spice has already integrated its own protocols.

317
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,700
And we use the servers, a strong service back, so it's a lot of hardware power behind.

318
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,400
But we also have fast networks.

319
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
And we do require a bit that you have on your side as well, fast networks.

320
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,760
So it does have that huge latency.

321
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,040
And we have our own data centers, and we try to actually move data quite fast.

322
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,520
And we use the Ceph as an object storage behind to make sure everything is kept in place,

323
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,080
it doesn't break every day and loses user data.

324
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,280
Can we talk just for a second before you go too much further, can we talk about the centralized

325
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
storage?

326
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
I'm curious how you've built that here.

327
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,360
So I got a little bit of insight there, sounds like you're using Cephs to manage some of

328
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,360
this.

329
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,960
Can you break some of that down for us?

330
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,440
Well, there's nothing special we use, again, basically what Ceph is, you know, giving us

331
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,560
and we just deploy it on all our servers.

332
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,600
And we make it sure that we have backups.

333
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,360
And you know, Ceph is good for basically keeping data uncorrupted and moving a lot of data

334
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,960
around because again, serving desktop is quite a bit of data that needs to be moved around

335
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,080
and especially the three plan.

336
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,380
How are the data centers connected?

337
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,520
Is it like a VPN over the public internet?

338
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,440
Have you guys wired the data centers directly together because that seems like a ton of

339
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
data to move around?

340
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,680
Yeah, so we wired them and it's our own data centers with our own servers and basically

341
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:00,060
try to have everything in one place and to maintain by ourselves so we don't rent anything

342
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,960
from Amazon or DigitalOcean or what's the usual aspect for that.

343
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,320
We really try to keep everything in-house because again, Shell was founded by founders

344
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,660
of PIA and they really care for the privacy and security.

345
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:22,120
So instead of relying on others, we're actually working hard to have everything in-house and

346
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,480
make it as private and secure as possible.

347
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,000
It sounds like there's been some lessons, perhaps maybe from running PIA that were learned,

348
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
lessons you learned, just going into this, you're kind of building it the way you would

349
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,720
want to build it after building something that's just quick and cheap and then having

350
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
to tear it down and rebuild.

351
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,840
It sounds like you just went right to the rebuild, this is what you'd want to build

352
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
if you could stage.

353
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Yeah.

354
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,840
So we are really trying, we never have a decision to make a decision that's going to be long-term

355
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,680
because we have the resources to pull that out and we are still, of course, learning

356
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,120
along our way but there is no slacking or there's no like a quick road to anything.

357
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,320
We are trying to make a stable product from day one.

358
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,560
So we spend a lot of time during the day, most actual of our time during the day debugging

359
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:19,520
things, making them work together, having the transitions go smooth so users don't see

360
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:26,440
anything happening in their shells, which is a really good achievement because we daily

361
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,240
send things to the production and we try to avoid as much breakage as we can.

362
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
But sometimes we break things but we are quick to fix.

363
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,160
What are we using underneath the user experience?

364
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,560
What Linux distro and kind of technology are you using to push things around?

365
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,260
The kernel that's powering all shells is the Gentoo one.

366
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,520
So it's pretty upstream agnostic.

367
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:57,160
It's very close to upstream and we use the latest one but we actually do offer to distros

368
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,520
and we collaborate with some of them like OpenSUSE and Fedora, they expressed desire

369
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,400
to have their own kernel to actually run the entire experience and we do offer that as

370
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
well.

371
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,880
But again, then in that case the distros themselves didn't provide the kernel, they didn't provide

372
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,920
the bootloader, didn't provide the disk resize tools, obviously, or you have the other way

373
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,840
going with our kernel and we already have automated the disk resize in it.

374
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
It's pretty nice though that the distros are giving you that feedback.

375
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,200
It sounds like you guys have talked to a lot of them and some of them have said it could

376
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
be even better if you tweaked a few things.

377
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,440
So you've got to build a system that can accommodate hosting servers in your data center running

378
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,480
say a Fedora kernel and a Gentoo kernel for a different system.

379
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,960
It sounds like there must be some glue that helps you manage all of this.

380
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:58,000
We have like most of the scripts for the systems, we actually open source them and we invite

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,480
the distros to collaborate on our GitHub repo, basically giving their own scripts how to

382
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
build them.

383
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,840
But yeah, we have a couple of scripts for managing all the data centers, including everything

384
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,940
we have them currently internally.

385
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,240
So they are not currently open source, but we do plan to open source them in the future.

386
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:24,840
It's just that we are working at a high pace and currently we don't have like a super usable

387
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,720
finished product for people to just build a top on it.

388
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,280
But it's going to be there, like we're going to open source more and more things eventually.

389
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,800
I set myself up a couple of, I set up a Fedora workstation shell and I also tried out the

390
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,120
Ubuntu 2004 experience.

391
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
And it's pretty cool.

392
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,040
It seems like it really is becoming the era of streaming desktops and streaming games.

393
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,240
And I wonder since you've been under the hood for a little bit, is there any tweaks?

394
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,120
Like if you could wave a magic wand and all of a sudden have development effort in Linux

395
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,320
directed at something, is there any new code or tweaks that you would wish for to make

396
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,640
this even better for what shells.com is trying to do?

397
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,860
There's like some latency, I guess, like issues that we see from time to time.

398
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:17,040
And we're probably going to try to improve the spice protocol and upstream, those things.

399
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,380
And of course there's the input.

400
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,800
We need to make it sure that once you plug your USB, that it's going to be right inside

401
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
the shells.

402
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,460
And some people expressed, they want to do that and have printing capabilities because

403
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,640
that's like an enterprise solution.

404
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:38,840
So what we need to tweak and work on those, I would say minor, maybe not medium hard things,

405
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,480
but there's nothing too much special now that I would really change about it.

406
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,760
Just refinements and improving things to make it work even better.

407
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,720
Especially with Spice.

408
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:56,120
Spice is going to have some changes, but mostly it's basically default tweaking, the same

409
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,440
with QEMU.

410
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,280
And for example, now we don't have GPUs in our data centers, but we do plan in the future

411
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
to have that.

412
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,760
And that's going to bring us another option, the VirGL option to basically pass through

413
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,680
directly to GPU, which is going to increase the performance a lot.

414
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,160
It can be literally in hundreds and even thousands of times the performance can rise because

415
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,160
most of the desktop nowadays, they have the graphical acceleration, compositing, and same

416
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,520
goes for the browsers.

417
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,780
YouTube needs hardware acceleration to properly push that through.

418
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,640
And so some things are hardware specific and some are software specific that we're going

419
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,520
to tune through the time.

420
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:46,480
But on bright side, Linux institutions work really well through Spice and through QEMU

421
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,220
and the entire work done by community on that side is absolutely stunning and incredible.

422
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,760
And we're just building on top of it.

423
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,440
It's again, the power of the open source is coming to its own height.

424
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,120
lino.com slash unplugged.

425
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,520
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit and support the show.

426
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I just love it.

427
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,760
You know, here we are, an independent podcast, almost a 400 episodes.

428
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,980
And one of the things that makes it possible is the audience trusting that we work with

429
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,440
great sponsors and trying them.

430
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,480
And Linode, it can solve some problems.

431
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,080
If you're prototyping, if you're learning, or if you just want to host something for

432
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,400
yourself or for the public, Linode has different machines at different price points that you're

433
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,720
going to be impressed by.

434
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,780
It's 30 to 50 percent less than AWS or Azure.

435
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,160
And personally, one of the things I love about Linode is they have all the distros.

436
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,360
And the reason why I love that is it's a great opportunity to learn and test or just host

437
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,840
the disk with on the distro that you prefer, I suppose.

438
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,240
I mean, that seems like the obvious one.

439
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,320
I even found a how to online on how to using Linux actually load Windows.

440
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,680
People want Windows on the nodes, too.

441
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,540
I mean, that's because the Linode hardware is really good.

442
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,760
You can go get Windows VPS somewhere, right?

443
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,340
But Linode does more than just the average bear.

444
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:13,080
They have fast disks and network and a great interface and 11 data centers to choose from.

445
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,920
They've really dialed this thing in because they've been around since 2003.

446
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,640
And now they're dedicated to the best virtualized cloud computing.

447
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,400
They're independently owned and founded on a love for Linux and open source technologies.

448
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,760
They support this here show and other others in the Linux media space.

449
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,680
And of course, projects that we love like Kabuntu and events like All Things Open and

450
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Linux Fest Northwest, which gives them a real special place in my heart.

451
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,720
And the fact that they're Linux nerds, well, isn't that just the icing on the cake?

452
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,360
So go support the show and see what I've been talking about.

453
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,840
Try them out, linode.com slash unplugged.

454
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,560
Well Mr. Payne, why don't we talk about something that is a bit aux, you know what I mean?

455
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,520
It's time to broach this subject, I think.

456
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:05,220
I think what gets me about it is it's easy to feel guilty like we're part of the problem.

457
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,720
So what we're going to try to talk about today through the lens of the Lutris project is

458
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,380
an overwhelming problem that seems to be facing independent open source developers who have

459
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,000
to balance life and time and community and bug fixes.

460
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,560
Matthew's dedicated the last 10 years to building Lutris.

461
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,640
He's adjusted his work schedule to go part time so he has time for the project and also

462
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
time for himself.

463
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,680
I mean, also, just trying to take care of yourself is a hard thing to balance.

464
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,000
It's not really even a hobby anymore at that point, I mean, gosh.

465
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Yeah.

466
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,920
And we've talked to developers off air, but not a lot of developers have wanted to say

467
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,880
what he's going to say on air.

468
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,860
We do see this discussion happening a lot.

469
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,520
And I know it's uncomfortable for us end users.

470
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,320
So we just kind of have to listen and maybe we can come up as a community, just maybe

471
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,320
some ideas or solutions to address some of these concerns that he'll raise.

472
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:06,340
It seems like there is some kind of change that is in the winds and our chat with Matthew

473
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,800
gives us insights into some of the longer term challenges specifically around these

474
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,800
complex applications.

475
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,080
Well, Matthew, thank you for joining me on the show today.

476
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,440
You did a blog post on the 20th of March titled Not on the Same Page, and it's sort of a

477
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,720
reflection of your 15 year journey in Linux.

478
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,040
You are the founder of Lutris, which is one of my absolute favorite desktop Linux apps.

479
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,680
Do you have a elevator pitch to the audience who might not be familiar with who or what

480
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Lutris is?

481
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,920
Well, I call it a video game preservation platform now.

482
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:47,480
I used to call it an open platform for Linux and recently I've decided to change the main

483
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,120
focus of the project and to make it clear that it's a project that is here to preserve

484
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,280
video games, to make them run locally on your machine.

485
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,640
So the goal is really to make run any type of video games, regardless of their platform.

486
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,500
It can be old consoles, old computers, or like really modern games as well.

487
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,580
And one place to just manage all of that and try to make it as approachable as possible,

488
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,660
which is obvious why I love the project.

489
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,160
You must have known trying to build something like this, especially targeting the Linux

490
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,360
desktop before you even started, was going to be an uphill battle.

491
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:31,560
I knew that in some ways because the way I wanted to approach Lutris was not the traditional

492
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,400
way of running things, but also I had some ideas.

493
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:44,080
I wanted to gather some, let's say some development team or just a team to work with, and I thought

494
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,880
that I would start an open source project and some people would jump into the project

495
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,680
and I was just getting started at the time and wasn't actually the best programmer or

496
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
anything.

497
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,120
You thought if you built it though, they would come?

498
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Yeah.

499
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Yeah.

500
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,080
I thought that, yeah, I just have to start something and someone will say, oh, this looks

501
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,080
great.

502
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
So I'll come and help you.

503
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Well, the users arrived.

504
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Yeah.

505
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,680
The users, yes, but not really, and also some people who helped with the code really, I

506
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:16,120
don't want to say I haven't had any contributors because that wouldn't be true, but some team

507
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,520
members do work on the project who would be on the same page, like I said.

508
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,600
But as the project goes on, it sounds like the disconnect that you felt between what

509
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,440
you have in mind, what the goals are for the project and what Linux users are asking for,

510
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,160
and it sounds like a core tenet of Linux users is this desire to tweak their system and make

511
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,020
it their own, customize it the way they like it.

512
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,120
That's something the community, I think you say, and I agree with, takes pride in doing,

513
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:50,080
but that is ultimately kind of creating an always moving target for you, I would imagine.

514
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,560
That's something that's on top of the open source aspect of the project.

515
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,400
That's just working on Linux and that would also happen if the program was proprietary

516
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
like Steam.

517
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:06,200
Steam faces the same issues like when they want to run games on Linux, they have to work

518
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,800
on this platform, which is so broad and what you can do with it that you have to target

519
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,280
something to ship on and that thing is moving all the time, like you said.

520
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,040
You could describe it as a volatile environment to develop for.

521
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,080
You write on here, if your goal is to have a system that is about choice, then you've

522
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,880
made the choice to not give me or other developers a stable foundation to build upon.

523
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,920
I might not 100% agree with that, but I have absolutely heard that sentiment 100 times

524
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,160
over from other developers I've talked to.

525
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,640
Yeah, I don't want to say that Linux is not stable because I have software that is closed

526
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,880
source and that will run on Linux pretty easily.

527
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,320
Compatibility is good if you are doing the right thing.

528
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,540
If you're choosing the right libraries and you're compiling just rights, then your program

529
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:02,700
might keep working in the long run and Lutris interacts a lot with a lot of the other components

530
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,700
of the system.

531
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:09,880
A video game is just its own program, just shows up a 3D window and it's done, but Lutris

532
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,920
is all interacting with all these other components on the system, so it has to play friendly.

533
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:24,360
It has to have a good idea on what's going on, and that's not always easy to achieve

534
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,600
to have this situation or you have control of what you're running.

535
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,040
It's not like you're trying to support some open source command line application inside

536
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Lutris.

537
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,520
You're trying to support a complex game that's using God knows what 3D and audio libraries

538
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,080
from God knows when.

539
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,680
Actually, the development I'm doing right now in Lutris is to support command line applications,

540
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,680
but yes.

541
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Oh, really?

542
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
That's hilarious.

543
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Well, good for you.

544
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,400
That might be nice for a while.

545
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,040
It's also in order to build a feature that will be used for Steam and everything, so

546
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:04,440
it's not only for command line, but it's a starting point for some other things.

547
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:12,120
It has to be in this ecosystem that works great locally on my setup, and then someone

548
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,120
tries it and they have those weirdest issues.

549
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,800
If I knew how to produce issues, usually they don't take long to solve.

550
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,640
What weird thing did they do that I would have to replicate to reproduce the problem?

551
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,360
What it sounds like you're describing is why containers have become so popular in the server

552
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,360
space, because it sort of smooths this problem out.

553
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,540
There are some efforts regarding containers, including one that I've made that's using

554
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
the Docker.

555
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:43,160
I've made it so it would run all low-key games like Soldier of Fortune or SimCity, but the

556
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,640
problem is that it doesn't play nice with what's installed locally, like the graphics

557
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,620
drivers or the sound card or all those things.

558
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,880
There's something I have an idea for that.

559
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,480
I'm not sure it's technically feasible, because it's really just an idea at this point.

560
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,040
It's like on paper, it's like no code, no prototype, nothing, but something that would

561
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,080
more or less do what Wine is doing, but for Linux, and that would say, okay, you want

562
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,640
to run this game, but you run this game in this section of this window, because this

563
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,760
is also to address some of the problems with Wayland rights, because Wayland gets rid of

564
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,760
all the screen coordinates.

565
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,680
So you run a game and the game doesn't know where to put itself.

566
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,960
And same with sound cards.

567
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,640
Sometimes you have a sound coming out of a TV and you would like it from your headphones

568
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:44,240
and it gets mixed up and everything, and you have games with also a game with false audio.

569
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,240
It gets messy.

570
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,280
So if you had some way of sending the game where you want it to, and that can be a portion

571
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,680
of the screen, that could be a full screen, that could be two screens, like a big window

572
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,580
that spans two screens, or three, I don't know, any number of screens.

573
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:07,840
If you give the game only the sound card you want to use, or if you want to give it only

574
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,640
the joysticks you want it to use, then that would solve a lot of problems.

575
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,280
And that's something I would like to give it a go.

576
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,680
That's not something I can do technically, because I'm not good enough.

577
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,920
It's a fantastic idea.

578
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,780
And it kind of is, kind of going back to a point you were making earlier, is it kind

579
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,000
of comes down to developer resources.

580
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,680
The theme we see here is that Lutris has gotten really popular.

581
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,060
It's like, it is, I think, a critical part of a Linux gamers set of tools.

582
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,440
And it has a very loyal user base, but it hasn't really scaled up development wise.

583
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,320
And in part, that means that you are inundated with tons of issues, you and many other developers.

584
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,240
I wonder if this isn't a tooling problem, Matthew, because I talked to other developers

585
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:57,560
who have just turned off notifications of new issues and requests, because they just

586
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,480
simply don't have the email bandwidth to manage it.

587
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,320
And they're just going to be working on what they have time to work on anyways.

588
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,600
And it kind of makes the whole bug submission process moot.

589
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,040
And it leaves end users expecting that something's going to get fixed.

590
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,660
And it creates this weird tension between developer and user.

591
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,840
And I'm curious if you have thoughts on how we could fix this problem.

592
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,720
Because from your blog, I grok that this is an issue for you, and everybody else I talked

593
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,920
to in this space.

594
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Is it a tooling problem?

595
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,720
Is it a people problem?

596
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,920
It's a problem with expectations, I think.

597
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,160
This is very common.

598
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,920
It's not only with issues.

599
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,840
Issues is something that's raised quite a lot.

600
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,880
But also, pull requests is also very time consuming.

601
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,840
And it can be worse in some ways than issues.

602
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,440
Because issues, I mean, you just respond and you get on with it.

603
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,240
And if you don't have the time to work on it, then, I mean, that's too bad, but you

604
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
can go on.

605
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,320
With pull requests, I mean, either it's something you're not you don't want.

606
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,300
And then you have to say, well, no, that's not something we want for the project.

607
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,840
Or something you want, but it's not it doesn't fit well.

608
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,280
Or it doesn't fit the code standards or all the stuff that's around the project.

609
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Or it uses some code variation that will break the project on various platforms.

610
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Right.

611
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
So you can't just go with it.

612
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,840
And if you were going to import it, it would take hours of refactoring.

613
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Yeah.

614
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,960
And I was doing that at some point earlier, like a few years ago, where I would just welcome

615
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,040
everything and say, yeah, you helped the project.

616
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
That's great.

617
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
And it would just hit merge.

618
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,340
And then weeks would pass.

619
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,960
And sometimes a bug would sneak in and would not see it.

620
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,160
And then I would ship the program with some broken stuff because I didn't test the PR

621
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,200
enough or didn't review it enough.

622
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,240
And some PR contains some really broken stuff.

623
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,560
And that has happened a few times.

624
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
And it happens enough that you have to always be vigilant for it.

625
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,400
I talked to a developer last week who said, even though he has an open source project,

626
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,840
he just sort of has an unofficial policy that he's not going to accept any future merge

627
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
requests.

628
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,880
And then if he likes it, he'll rewrite it himself and do it that way.

629
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,880
Yeah.

630
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,360
I've done that a lot.

631
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,140
Either just saying, no, I don't want this proof request, but then writing my own version

632
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,760
of it or merging it and then rewriting on top of it.

633
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Yeah.

634
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,400
That's something that's frequent.

635
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:33,200
And I think that's mostly because this doesn't happen like in companies, like when you work

636
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,920
in a company or a project, this doesn't happen.

637
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,220
This is an open source problem.

638
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,880
And I think in a way, GitHub and its UI have kind of encouraged this issue.

639
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
They've made it worse.

640
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Yeah.

641
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,760
But this is open source, but also open source on a one-man team project because you have

642
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,600
like Mozilla, you have like big projects that have like a real team on it.

643
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Staff.

644
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Yeah.

645
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
And you don't have those problems.

646
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,680
You have like a real workflow that you would see in an enterprise.

647
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,440
And because everyone is on the same team, they share the same coding standards.

648
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,160
They have like the same goals and key results that they have to hit.

649
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Yeah.

650
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:16,080
And this is something, so I went back and ran into some of the things that were in the

651
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:24,880
cathedral and the bazaar and some of its rebuttal, mostly not the article itself of the cat B,

652
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,880
but more of the articles that followed it.

653
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Interesting.

654
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
Good idea.

655
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:38,520
One of them is in the Wikipedia page for cat B. And it was written more than 20 years ago.

656
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:44,200
It was written in 1999, just after cat B was released.

657
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,880
And it raises a lot of important issues that are really valid today.

658
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,640
And about this like tribalism or cult of personality and all this stuff, and also not having the

659
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:03,120
bandwidth to work on issues and the fact that open source can slow down a developer instead

660
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,680
of speed up and all those things.

661
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,680
And I was like, oh wow, this is really old, but also really accurate in how things work

662
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,280
even today.

663
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:20,880
And yeah, I shouldn't have, I had some expectations that open source would bring some help into

664
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,520
the development and help me really speed up the development, but it's really clear now

665
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,720
that you work on something on your own, like it's kind of closed source, but it doesn't

666
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
have to be.

667
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,420
At some point, it's just like it exists just on your computer because you're the only one

668
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,280
who's aware of it.

669
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,320
If you release something and you make it open, then that's not going to speed up anything.

670
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,000
That's just going to make it visible to people.

671
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So people will be able to-

672
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yeah.

673
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
It speeds up adoption, essentially.

674
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,800
It gets it included in distribution repositories.

675
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Yeah.

676
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,220
And if it's good and if it's stable enough to be used, then adoption will grow.

677
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,780
But it doesn't necessarily guarantee a development team will form or that the tooling around

678
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,440
the support process will be comprehensive.

679
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,120
It's like a land of promise, but then you get there and it turns out there's a lot of

680
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,400
negatives and positives.

681
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,920
And I'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.

682
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,320
It doesn't put you in a place where you can build and design great things.

683
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,320
So you can support your software, you can debug it.

684
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:28,800
And it's true because I've found that it was the case that it's good to have this open

685
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:35,280
source environment when I'm in QA stage, when I've done a bunch of work and I say, okay,

686
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,640
I've done this, please test it.

687
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,920
And sometimes there's not even enough testing because I release those betas or release candidates

688
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,440
and I say, okay, test it.

689
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,540
And there is some testing, there are a lot of bug reports and it goes well and it's fast

690
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:59,320
and there's a lot of feedback and that's also citizen open source work really great.

691
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:05,160
And then we have this situation where we are now where we're just after release and I want

692
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,480
to have a lot of new stuff that's either rewriting some previous code or just brand new code

693
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,760
that's never been done before that creates value added for the project.

694
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Right.

695
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,240
The kind of features you get excited to work on.

696
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,040
Yeah, the fun stuff.

697
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,160
This is fun stuff.

698
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,360
This is stuff that will bring value to the program that doesn't exist yet.

699
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:34,280
This is stuff that has been promised on Patreon or to donors.

700
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,040
All those new features, that's where it blocks, that's where I want to get the project working

701
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:47,080
and then it's no because of those PRs and people also come and complain about the state

702
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,800
of the current projects and say, oh, this doesn't work right, the UI doesn't work right.

703
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,340
And they say, yeah, okay, but this is not really finished, I've shipped what I could

704
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,340
do with it.

705
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,400
It's in a working form while you focus on other features.

706
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,540
And I want to change it, I don't want to keep it that way, but also I don't want to bring

707
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:13,680
back the old stuff, I don't want to regress.

708
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,200
I want to keep moving forward, but some people, they just say, oh, this is bad, I just want

709
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,200
the old stuff.

710
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,480
I just want the old stuff back and say, no, this is not great, but I want to make it better

711
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,720
and not move backwards.

712
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,740
Yeah, I can totally understand that, especially when you've been working on something for

713
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,780
so long.

714
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,960
It's got to be a huge driver to want to build these new things.

715
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,080
Is the unspoken thing here is simply revenue?

716
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,760
If this was a $50 piece of software that somebody had to buy from you before they downloaded

717
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,520
it, you could just hire developers.

718
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:53,040
Yeah, certainly, I'm not under the same impression because, so what I see is that 10 years ago

719
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,160
when the Lutris project started, there was a big push from mostly from Ubuntu, from Canon

720
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,600
Recall to create those developers.

721
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,440
And this effort is just not here today.

722
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,560
And this is something that's been noted by other developers.

723
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:18,680
I've heard this from other developers, that there was a huge group efforts and everybody

724
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:25,080
was developing software, even people that never called themselves software developers.

725
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,160
They would just fire up some code editor, write some Python and GTK.

726
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,240
And everyone was doing Python and GTK.

727
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,000
And there was this quickly framework that would let you create those apps really fast.

728
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,320
And now I think there's not this group efforts going on.

729
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,000
And there's this sort of confusion of what should we do?

730
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,880
What should I code in?

731
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
Should it be in Electron?

732
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,400
Should I code in Rust?

733
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,880
Should I code in Python?

734
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,200
I don't know Python developers who work in GTK anymore.

735
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,960
I know one developer of Lollipop.

736
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
I don't know him personally.

737
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,520
I know his code.

738
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,720
I know other small projects.

739
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:16,200
There's a GOG tool that's written with Python and GTK.

740
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,880
If I wanted to hire someone, I don't know who I would hire at this point.

741
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,480
The finishery aspect is not the problem because I've made the decision to just work part-time

742
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,800
because I wanted to keep Lutris going.

743
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,720
So I have a contracted job that is only 20 hours because I want to keep...

744
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,320
I mean, it's not just for Lutris.

745
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:49,420
It's also for having some more time for myself, but also mostly to be able to work on Lutris.

746
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:55,920
So that is myself putting some resources into the projects.

747
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:04,440
But I've noticed that even having all this time devoted to the project doesn't necessarily

748
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,880
help when all I see around it is no one being...

749
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,120
Like I said, I was working on this monitoring stuff for command line applications.

750
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,840
There's no one who is aware of this.

751
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,760
Yes, there's an issue on GitHub.

752
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,200
There's a few comments that have been...

753
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:33,040
And if I wanted to work on this with someone, I wouldn't know who to reach out to.

754
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,100
I wonder if it isn't the point you make in your blog.

755
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,640
We don't have a common goal.

756
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:43,120
In a silly way, hating Windows and hating Microsoft and how everybody had been burned

757
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,420
by Windows, it was a unifying mission.

758
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,140
We all wanted to beat Windows, and then Microsoft went and rolled over on its own.

759
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,960
And I think in a way, with Microsoft not really being the big bad guy anymore, we've sort

760
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,520
of lost a bit of unity.

761
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,440
And we've sort of lost a common goal.

762
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,440
Yeah, sure.

763
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,600
I mean, that's something I feel, but also I don't feel that being against Microsoft

764
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,600
brought anything of value.

765
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:18,400
I mean, it brought people to lecture, but I don't think it brought technical expertise,

766
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,480
and I don't think it brought code, like actual code.

767
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,920
So that was something to rally, to group together, but that's...

768
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,760
It wasn't necessarily a healthy thing.

769
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,900
Yeah, it wasn't healthy.

770
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,960
There's echoes and ramifications and ripples from it that I think are not positive today.

771
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
I agree.

772
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,960
And I was fully participant in it back in the day.

773
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,880
I completely acknowledge that.

774
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,440
Oh, I mean, I was participant in the anti-Microsoft stuff before I was using Amiga.

775
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
Yeah.

776
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,800
I mean, I didn't have a computer, and I was already on anti-Microsoft.

777
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,440
So what do you think this leaves you as a longtime Linux user?

778
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,920
Do you think it's kind of a new, I don't want to call it a maturing of how you are going

779
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,000
to interact with Linux in the community, but a shift kind of like from lessons learned,

780
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,520
is it kind of a, have you come to a new realization or a new normal, as it were?

781
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,520
Yeah, totally.

782
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:19,800
Not only because of that aspect, but also because of some more positive aspects.

783
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,940
The more positive aspect being that I have this Linux console that can play pretty much

784
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,900
any game I want.

785
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:35,560
So from some point of view, the project is pretty much done because I have this machine,

786
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,960
and I don't have a game that I cannot play.

787
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
That's great.

788
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,920
So from that, yeah, and that's something I want to say, okay, this is, from now on, this

789
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,560
is the reality of Linux.

790
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,600
This is that I have this machine that can play pretty much any game I want, regardless

791
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,440
of its age, regardless of its platform.

792
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,400
So I want to build based on that, and that's going to be the reality.

793
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,540
And sure, there will be some feedback from people who send them some bug reports and

794
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,640
they want to bring some features.

795
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:16,520
But from now on, I built the software based on that console that can run those games.

796
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:21,680
And that's something that I have in my living room that I can work on that is rooted in

797
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,680
physical work.

798
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,440
So I don't have to ask questions.

799
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:27,240
I can just make progress on that.

800
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,080
It's going to be more of an intentional development style.

801
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,740
There's also another positive thing about Lutris is that it's also now everywhere.

802
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,120
It's in Ubuntu, it's in Debian.

803
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,680
So I don't want to ship something that's broken, and I want to have a lot more testing

804
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,680
going on.

805
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:48,400
And I hope that your new focus ends up making you more pleased with the process, enjoy the

806
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,560
process a bit more, and means that we get years more of Lutris.

807
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:57,400
Yeah, the goal is to be enjoying more of the development process.

808
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,560
I care about the project a lot.

809
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:07,600
I would rather change some of the aspects of the open sourcedness of the projects rather

810
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,320
than just walk away from the projects.

811
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,760
It's almost worth listening to that again, if you care about this issue, because what

812
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,880
he touches on, you can kind of extract what the bigger picture issues are.

813
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,440
Because what I heard in there is that he feels like he's been left behind by the GTK and

814
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,480
Python stack, and he's not really sure where to go next.

815
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,240
He hasn't really had a lot of development support.

816
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,160
The users definitely showed up, but he hasn't really had people show up helping him.

817
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,480
And I mean, he has had support, but not like core development features, you know, the big

818
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,480
stuff.

819
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,480
And I think there's also a disconnect right now because he wants to work on finishing

820
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,840
core features, and users are submitting requests that are more like quality of life requests,

821
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,680
not necessarily core feature fixes.

822
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,360
And I think he's kind of getting a bit demotivated by it all.

823
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,360
No, you're right.

824
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:59,520
And this is something that started as a solo project, a hobby project, maybe, and has really

825
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,520
grown.

826
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,600
And in open source, it can be hard, especially, I think, you know, once you're packaged in

827
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:11,440
distributions, you're widely known, there are a lot of expectations, spoken and unspoken.

828
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,040
It's also really hard to find good development support.

829
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,160
I mean, this is true even in like, you know, private corporate development.

830
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,280
But when it's a baby, when it's your project, you can't just turn control over to anyone.

831
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,280
Delegating is hard, finding good help is hard.

832
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,320
And then if you don't totally trust them to, you know, make a fully formed PR that just

833
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,800
needs a little light review, some checking, then you're going to either have to do a whole

834
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,180
bunch of handholding and help, which can be good and can be one way to eventually get

835
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,740
more help on the project.

836
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:42,020
But that's a huge investment, or, you know, as Matthew mentioned, the other option is

837
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,080
just sort of taking that idea and just doing it yourself.

838
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,840
But that doesn't scale.

839
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,840
And this is something he mentioned that I never thought of, because of course, I'm not

840
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,440
a developer, but it's not easy to figure out who's the designer to go to to develop GTK

841
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,920
applications and have them design a beautiful GTK app, or who do I go to that has this Python

842
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,920
expertise?

843
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,360
Like, we don't have a way to really sort that out.

844
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,840
The downside of the flexibility, right, I mean, I think it favors folks with strong

845
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,720
opinions and who do just want to make their own project, and I'm going to make it work

846
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,780
my way.

847
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,760
But if you don't have those strong opinions, or you want to try to find some help, it's

848
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,500
not clear where are those communities?

849
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Where are other people doing?

850
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,880
If everyone assembles it their own way on the development stack, well, they might not

851
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,520
be ready to just jump in and use your version of that.

852
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,400
Yeah, that is an interesting challenge as well.

853
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,400
So yeah, you're right.

854
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,100
That's also in there is sometimes you get a patch that comes along, but it just is written

855
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,640
in a way that just not really fit with the rest of the projects code base.

856
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,920
And so that's particularly tricky.

857
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,560
And then, of course, in there, you can hear that he's had struggle with motivation as

858
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,560
well.

859
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,680
And our podcast, I know you had some thoughts on staying motivated when you're getting that

860
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,820
kind of skewed feedback from users who want things and not the users that are just sitting

861
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,520
back there loving the software using it every day.

862
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,520
Yeah, I mean, I encountered this even in my day job sometimes with developing complex

863
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,600
and sophisticated products, but then you only hear about what's wrong with it.

864
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,080
You don't hear a lot of praise from it.

865
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,320
And I think an open source that happens all too much, whether it's creating software like

866
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:13,000
looters or even content creators like some of us, sometimes you just hear about wrongs

867
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
and not so much how to help people.

868
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,760
And I know that can be a big problem when keeping motivated.

869
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,760
Yeah, really.

870
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:22,840
You know, because like I told him, you know, it's packaged with the distros.

871
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,120
So it's not like I downloaded from the website, I installed from the repo, and I've just used

872
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,040
it for like eight years.

873
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,880
And I've never sent him a note saying thank you.

874
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,600
That's why I actually wanted to reach out to him recently.

875
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
And then he made a blog post.

876
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,840
I was like, dude, we got to talk.

877
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,320
And I just I really connected with that struggle of this passion project.

878
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,900
It's a different transition for everybody.

879
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:47,360
And if he could get out of the trenches and build a community of support around him that

880
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,640
could deal with some of that lower hanging fruit, that would definitely be beneficial.

881
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,120
But I think part of the problem is just he doesn't have the tactical time to accomplish

882
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,120
that.

883
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,440
And Neil, I know you've experienced this.

884
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,800
You might have some suggestions.

885
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Yeah.

886
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,320
So it's been something that I've had the experience for years.

887
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:09,000
Like I don't actually write as much code as I used to five or six years ago.

888
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,440
I actually spent a lot more time doing coordination and community building and all that kind of

889
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,160
stuff because it's actually harder than writing a line of code.

890
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,680
It's so much harder.

891
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,960
And I still do technical work.

892
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,960
You know that, Chris.

893
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,920
I've, you know, the Butterfest things and stuff in Fedora with Plasma and Wayland and

894
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:29,920
Pipewire and all that stuff.

895
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,920
Yeah.

896
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,920
I'm still doing that stuff.

897
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,760
But I spend a lot of my time doing that because if you don't have someone actually doing that

898
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,820
work specifically, you burn out.

899
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,640
And so, you know, my suggestion on that front, at least, is instead of looking for another

900
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,900
developer, look for someone that is geared towards, you know, doing the community building

901
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,640
because you can't do both.

902
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,080
It's just you'll burn yourself out doing it.

903
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,160
I think he's starting to feel that in the first place.

904
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,520
And another bit that, you know, he was talking about feeling abandoned by the PyGTK mess

905
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,260
is the nicest way to put it.

906
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:11,680
I've seen a lot of projects move from GTK to Qt mostly because of this.

907
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:19,720
And the other added advantage of using Qt is that the other market that is that a lot

908
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:25,600
of Linux software tends to be more successful on is Mac OS and Qt works a lot better there

909
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,840
than GTK.

910
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:33,840
And if that's something that eventually somebody wants to do like Lutris on Mac OS, I don't

911
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,120
see any reason anyone would, that's a thing.

912
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:45,620
But I think PyQt, which is officially supported by the Qt project and is maintained as part

913
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:51,460
of it is pretty much the go to for a lot of the Pythonistas doing graphical applications

914
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:54,480
these days is fairly straightforward to use.

915
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,760
And with things like QML, it's super easy to do the styling and stuff like that.

916
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:03,920
That's probably like if you want to take a hard look at about like switching ecosystems

917
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,840
while remaining Python, that's probably the best choice to go.

918
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:13,040
Otherwise, I mean, another option is, and this is me like doing a little plug for myself

919
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,240
here, a project that I work on called the monotools project.

920
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,520
We use a library called libui from the SUSE folks.

921
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,860
That's the UI toolkit library that powers the yast installer.

922
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:32,960
We have Python bindings for it and it works fairly well.

923
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,320
And that library toolkit gives you both Qt5 and GTK3 UIs basically for free by using the

924
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:43,080
abstract interface provided by libui.

925
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:48,240
I think the next thing that Lutris as a project needs to consider is not hiring a developer,

926
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,440
but hiring a community manager type.

927
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,900
A community manager is a really good point and it could be somebody who could help kind

928
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:01,880
of bubble the people that could help the most to the top to Matthew.

929
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:05,880
It's a good idea because I think a support community beyond just a community of users

930
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,440
who need, right, but a community of contributors.

931
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,660
Well, I think you know, Chris, right, it can be hard to balance time involved directly

932
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,600
in the community and then time doing the work, whether that's creating a show or actually

933
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:21,400
heads down in the trenches trying to add a complicated technical new feature.

934
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,560
There's just no doubt about it.

935
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,880
I sit now as as kind of, you know, reward, I guess maybe in a way for having been around

936
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,200
for so long.

937
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,840
We have a lot of really good people in our community that can help help organize it as

938
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,960
well, including a lot of people who are here in our virtual log right now.

939
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,840
And it means that I get to be more of a participant and and that's really great.

940
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,220
But that's that's like, you know, that's what you to get to that point.

941
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,040
You've got to build something for a really long time.

942
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,040
But he does have a very beloved application.

943
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,760
So I think he's got everything that would take to build a good community around him.

944
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,000
And you know, he and I talked a little bit off air afterwards, and he felt like there's

945
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,120
probably some sort of shift, something is going to happen.

946
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,780
You know, we talked a little bit about what elementary OS is doing.

947
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,160
And he thinks that's an intriguing idea, just that just having kind of some established

948
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,880
design languages, and he wouldn't necessarily have to use Vala either, you know, but just

949
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,360
kind of following their GTK design language and stuff is is an idea just in its sense,

950
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,620
just because he likes that kind of structure.

951
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:28,520
I mentioned it in the in the chat, but he authored this blog post, where he goes into

952
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
a lot more detail.

953
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,400
And so if you are curious, we'll have a link in the notes.

954
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,240
If you want to check that out, go go give that a read and it gets that's probably any

955
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,660
real bit more in the moment of passion.

956
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,120
You know, by the time he and I got on got on the horn, I think he had some time to reflect

957
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
on a little bit.

958
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,600
But that that blog post, I think was written kind of at the heat of the moment.

959
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:52,320
So that'll be at linuxonplug.com slash 399.

960
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,440
Just a couple of last minute housekeeping items, because we're getting long, it's a

961
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,440
big show.

962
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,560
399 is a lot.

963
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,560
But there was a pretty cool up lug this Sunday.

964
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,800
So I wanted to give mini mech a chance to give us an update on how things went at the

965
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,800
log log.

966
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Thank you, Chris.

967
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,800
So we had a good meeting.

968
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,500
I think there were about 20 listeners to the talk.

969
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,320
So the topic was very specific.

970
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,840
I mean, creating and managing data streams is not an everyday task for a normal Linux

971
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
user.

972
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,160
But we had some well informed people in the room.

973
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,660
And also for the first time, we had some audio and video recording.

974
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:35,480
So we recorded our mumble room and Bennett shared his screen via OBS Ninja and also recorded

975
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,640
his screen at the same time.

976
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,880
So I think it was a pretty good success.

977
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,380
But we have Bennett here in the room.

978
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,560
So Bennett, what do you think?

979
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,960
Hey, many Mac, I do have to say love blog was a huge success.

980
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,800
I was blown away with the turnout.

981
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,000
And I met some really interesting engineers.

982
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,560
As many Mac mentioned, we recorded the log log.

983
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:01,080
So in case you missed, you missed the log log and want to watch the recording, you can

984
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,040
watch the edited down condensed version.

985
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,320
So you can catch a log log in a third of the time.

986
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,440
How about that?

987
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,440
That's great, guys.

988
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:17,200
Man, you know, as we're getting close to 400, I look oh, I bet you know what, for the 400

989
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,680
time capsule, I'm going to put down how the log logs doing that's going to be number six

990
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,280
in the time capsule.

991
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:29,200
So I just say it's so cool to see that's a that's a self self started organic component

992
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,300
to this show's community.

993
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,180
And I think it's so great.

994
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:36,160
So if you want to participate in the log log, it's every Sunday, noon Pacific in our mumble

995
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,720
room right there in the lobby.

996
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:42,120
And we have information about our mumble room on the website at Linux unplugged.com.

997
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,680
You can probably find that I would imagine.

998
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,620
And then also, while we're in the housekeeping, just one more reminder next week is 400.

999
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,580
We will be live and would love to have you join us.

1000
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,040
If you haven't had an opportunity to join us in a while, it'd be a great chance to come

1001
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,080
by and say hi and celebrate 400 episodes of your unplugged program.

1002
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,420
Then we have 401 pre recorded.

1003
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,600
So we will not be live on April 13.

1004
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,360
So 401 is going to be a pre record, but then we'll be back to our regular bat time.

1005
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,740
So come hang out with us next week for 400.

1006
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:14,880
And then I give you permission to take the week off on 401 you just listen to it on your

1007
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,880
own time.

1008
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,720
I'm gonna let you do that just this once though.

1009
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,280
So I don't want to see you doing that too much, but it's a special occasion.

1010
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,240
And that's really all we have in the housekeeping.

1011
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,960
Thank you to our members who support the show help us stay independent.

1012
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,260
And that means a lot to us.

1013
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,760
And especially as we get to I'm just feeling really I don't know I'm feeling really something

1014
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,080
now that we're getting close to 400 I'm really grateful for those members unplugged core.com.

1015
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,080
Thank you very much.

1016
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,420
We got a couple of perks for you.

1017
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,700
You get a limited ad version of the show as one feed option same full production all the

1018
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,260
Joe Levin just few less ads.

1019
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:55,640
And then there is feed to which is the full live stream right as we get going I hit the

1020
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,960
record button.

1021
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,400
Our mumble room is our virtual leg.

1022
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,520
You know, imagine being at a log as people trickle in through the door and you're say

1023
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,080
oh, you know, it's been a week since you say oh, hi, how's it going?

1024
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,820
That's that's a little bit of what we do in there.

1025
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:10,760
We talk about a few topics and kind of just warm up and then we usually have to wind down

1026
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,760
and that's all in there as well.

1027
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,160
It's like a full additional show that gets packed into that second feed plus extra mistakes.

1028
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,220
No kidding.

1029
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,400
No kidding.

1030
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:26,100
And if you like to know how we messed up, that's that's how you're going to that's good.

1031
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,100
Maybe we should.

1032
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,100
What are we doing?

1033
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,100
Wes?

1034
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,100
Why are we doing that?

1035
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:34,200
It can't be good for our reputations too late we've committed.

1036
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,120
Yeah, I know some people like the full thing.

1037
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:41,360
So thank you everybody who supports the show over at unplugged core.com.

1038
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:45,180
Just a couple of feedback items before we get out of here.

1039
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:50,720
Number one was just an excuse to mention a great tool that we haven't talked about for

1040
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:51,720
a little bit.

1041
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,160
Jack writes in he says, Hey, guys, I'm not aware if you've seen this before.

1042
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:59,260
I think I found a great tool for system administration and for local management or even remote server

1043
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,260
management.

1044
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:01,260
It's called SSH.

1045
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,260
No, I'm kidding.

1046
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,920
It's called cockpit.

1047
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,500
And it's of course in arch, but it's also in fedora and a lot of other distributions

1048
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,500
as well.

1049
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:12,100
And once you install it, you'll find it at localhost on port 9090.

1050
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,640
You can manage VMs, updates network and a bunch of other stuff.

1051
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,640
Hope you enjoy it.

1052
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,960
And thanks for the show, Jack.

1053
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,120
Well, Jack, we love cockpit here at the show.

1054
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:24,560
We've talked about it a few times, but Wes and I were thinking it'd been a little bit.

1055
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:28,160
Did you recently just install to is a just totally unrelated to this email?

1056
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,160
Yeah.

1057
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,320
Webman updates to J-Bot over the weekend, updates now, basic maintenance.

1058
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,480
Let's call it that life support, restoration, hospice care.

1059
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,480
Yeah, yeah.

1060
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:43,000
I was moving it to a fedora 33 box and you know, there was cockpit for me already.

1061
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,400
I was like, Oh, yeah, I've kind of forgotten about cockpit, but it sure is handy to have

1062
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,240
because it's come a long way and it really is quite full featured and handy.

1063
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,240
Yeah, it is.

1064
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:00,920
And it makes, I mean, no disrespect to the Webman team, but it makes Webman just like

1065
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,720
look like a real tool of the past.

1066
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,800
And cockpit has much better security history and story, much more modern.

1067
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,800
I think that's it.

1068
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,600
I kind of forget that like GUI server management can be a thing on Linux because I mean, I'm

1069
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,840
just used to using the command line anyway, and that's kind of my preference or at least

1070
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,840
default.

1071
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,580
But you're right, cockpit like kind of resets that it.

1072
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:19,580
It's good.

1073
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:23,880
Also, a lot of times people will write in and say, how come you don't talk about XYZ

1074
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,760
Web GUI to manage containers on the show?

1075
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:29,840
And a lot of times my response back is, oh, because cockpit does it.

1076
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,840
Cockpit does it well.

1077
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,240
Five wrote in, you want to take his email?

1078
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,960
Five wrote in with a interesting little tip he developed with more people becoming eligible

1079
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:38,960
for the COVID-19 vaccine.

1080
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,960
One of the most difficult things now is getting an appointment.

1081
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:48,720
I resorted to writing a simple Python script to output availability using the vaccine spotter.org

1082
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,720
API.

1083
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,320
The script is noisy, but attempts to output only new availability.

1084
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,920
I also wrote a matrix shell command to send me various notifications.

1085
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:04,000
I've used this script and cron to notify me when new appointments open up.

1086
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,440
Just thought I'd share with the Linux Unplugged and Jupyter broadcasting community since I

1087
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,560
think everyone in it rocks.

1088
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:11,760
And boy, you are right about that one, Five.

1089
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,760
And thanks.

1090
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,760
This looks pretty handy.

1091
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,560
It can be pretty tricky to find those appointments.

1092
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,040
And this is exactly the sort of open source sharing and just like you've learned some

1093
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,200
fun tools on the Linux command line, and now you can make them useful for problems in your

1094
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,280
own real life.

1095
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,760
What a great example of learning to build something by having a problem to solve.

1096
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,800
And this was a clever one.

1097
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,800
I like this.

1098
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:35,420
And it got me thinking, if you have little small projects like this, they don't have

1099
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,960
to be significant, although those are cool, too.

1100
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,960
Let me know.

1101
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,600
But let more importantly, let the Koda radio show know, because I'd love to maybe talk

1102
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,120
about them from time to time in our feedback.

1103
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:50,280
Just like Five just did, you can go to koder.show slash contact for those and little code projects

1104
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,940
you built to solve problems like this that maybe others might be interested in, but nobody

1105
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,400
knows about it.

1106
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,840
I'd love to share what our community is building the Koda radio program would be such a perfect

1107
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,840
outlet for that.

1108
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,880
So koder.show slash contact for that stuff.

1109
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:03,880
Koder code swap.

1110
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,340
Yeah, actually check out the Koda radio coming out later this week because Wes joined to

1111
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,680
give Mike a hard time.

1112
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,680
So I really enjoyed that episode.

1113
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,880
Hey, that wasn't my intention, but that is what happened.

1114
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,400
Anyways, this here show, if you want to find anything that we talked about today, links

1115
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,320
for all of that stuff, of course, all at linuxunplugged.com slash 399.

1116
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,720
If you do that Twitter thing, that Twitter thing, you can follow the podcast at Linux

1117
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:30,720
Unplugged.

1118
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,880
I'm over there at Chris LAS at Wes Payne over there.

1119
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,880
That's right.

1120
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,880
You on Twitter, Wes?

1121
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,880
I sure am.

1122
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:37,880
I don't see you tweet much.

1123
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,880
You're not a big tweeter.

1124
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,080
I should probably tweet more.

1125
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,640
Or maybe I shouldn't tweet at all.

1126
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,200
I just don't know anymore.

1127
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,120
You tweet when you need to, right?

1128
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,040
I mean, you're not spamming people.

1129
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,680
You're not spamming people.

1130
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,680
That's right.

1131
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,800
Low volume, just some weird, interesting things from time to time.

1132
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,040
Yeah, and you know, same on the Grams.

1133
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,120
He's got some, you know, he's got some local pics that are pretty good.

1134
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,200
So go check that out.

1135
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,880
But the whole network also has Twitter, you know, it's a thing.

1136
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,880
So what can I say?

1137
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,880
The network's there at Jupiter signal.

1138
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,720
But really, you know what's great?

1139
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
Websites.

1140
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,720
Websites are good.

1141
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,720
They're really close.

1142
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,720
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1143
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,720
So go over there.

1144
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,960
Yeah, just good, clean, pure HTML for you.

1145
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
Well, yeah.

1146
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,040
I mean, I don't know about pure, but definitely HTML.

1147
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,600
Don't look too close.

1148
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,160
And be sure you check out Linux Action News every Monday morning.

1149
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,840
Wes and I break down everything that matters in the world of Linux.

1150
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,080
So join us.

1151
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,580
We'll be back for episode 400 next Tuesday.

1152
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:36,160
That's at 12pm Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

1153
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,880
And we'd love to have you join us to celebrate 400 ridiculous episodes of the show I launched

1154
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,440
to read emails.

1155
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,640
Yep.

1156
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,280
And now look at us go.

1157
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,800
But I'm looking forward to it.

1158
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,960
Wes and I have been doing something special for the last few weeks in preparation.

1159
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,280
And we will unveil it in episode 400.

1160
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:58,820
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1161
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:23,240
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday.

1162
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:44,640
All right, let's name it JBtitles.com.

1163
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,480
Let's go pick our title.

1164
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,600
Mumble Room, you were great today, everybody.

1165
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Thank you very much.

1166
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,600
Lots of great discussion.

1167
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,200
I really enjoyed that.

1168
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:56,160
Really great that you contacted the developer for Lutris, actually, and you got to talk

1169
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,160
with him.

1170
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1171
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:02,680
And I wasn't sure if at the time it would work out, but it totally did.

1172
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,000
And that was pretty cool.

1173
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,160
It was nice.

1174
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,880
And I think he's found a new comfortable place with it.

1175
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,460
I think the project's safe.

1176
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:15,640
But I think it's good to touch in with those issues because we don't want to talk about

1177
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,080
it all the time on the show because it's kind of a bummer that a lot of things aren't great

1178
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,800
for people who are putting software out there for free, surprise, surprise.

1179
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,280
And we don't want to talk about it, but it's the reality.

1180
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,840
And I get the sense that most people in the community are down for a solution that's equitable

1181
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,840
for everybody.

1182
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,360
And we just haven't really stumbled on the right one.

1183
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,760
And when we get there, I think it's going to be great for developers.

1184
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,000
We're just not there right now.

1185
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,040
And in the meantime, it makes me even more grateful for everyone out there who's sticking

1186
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,240
it out, even if they're never going to make a dime, they're somehow finding that balance

1187
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:50,240
and they keep going.

1188
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,160
And it just makes me just incredibly grateful for them.

1189
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,280
I mean, it really makes the Linux desktop, the open source world and landscape.

1190
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:59,040
I mean, it makes it what it is, right?

1191
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:22,640
And it makes the arse-kicking that we're given to the commercial desktops even more impressive.
