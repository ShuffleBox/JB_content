1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
My son is currently going back and forth between believing in Santa Claus versus not like he has a pretty good theory his theory

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,040
It's pretty solid. He thinks that Santa Claus is real. It's just that Santa Claus is Amazon

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,740
So if you ask him Dylan, who is Santa Claus Amazon?

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,600
I know and he recognizes the Amazon wrapping paper and that's usually what dads know all the presents from dad come in

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,720
Yeah, when he's a father Amazon will have reindeer shaped drone, right? Yeah

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,880
They will

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,480
with custom 3d printed boxes and

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,920
Man, Amazon needs 3d printed boxes. That would be great

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
If the reindeer drones don't happen, I'm protesting. Yeah, that's that'll be a missed opportunity

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,040
Wimpy you should market that patent that and then sell it

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,960
Faisal yeah, I just sell for you for a good deal like $500,000 or something like that. I

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,720
Just want my unlimited credits on my fire TV. That is that is brilliant

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,000
That is that is eating up my spare change. Did I did I tell you I can't did I said?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,660
I might have mentioned it on there that I cancelled my Nexus player order

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,180
And I don't blame you. I'm gonna get a fire. I read the reviews on the Nexus player and it just sounds

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,940
It sounds like a total miss. I think on

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,840
Okay. Yeah, I thought I remembered saying something. Yeah, so now the fire TV is really terrific and some advice

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,320
You gave me a couple of a few weeks back now

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,020
I was asking about controllers for Steam on Linux and you recommended the wired Xbox 360 controller

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,700
Compatible with the fire TV you can plug the USB in of it. You just plug it in you just plug the

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,660
Xbox 360 360 USB controller in and all the buttons are mapped

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:54,940
It works exactly like the official Amazon controller, but it's half the price and it's stonking good

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,340
So I'm using that on the fire TV for gaming that is winning

24
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:58,820
Yeah

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,740
Arbilis is right like you have the Google TV now the Nexus Q and the Nexus player and all of these three products have been

26
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,460
In my opinion, I'm sure people like the Google TV is used by people still in it and loved but in my opinion

27
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,620
it fails on a couple of critical points that would really bug me and you know

28
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,820
The number one thing that jumped out me in especially a couple of the reviews

29
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,300
Complained about the same type of lagging us in the same kinds of areas and it's exactly the kind of stuff that drives me

30
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,820
crazy

31
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:31,060
I'm the guy that will yeah, you know back before the set-top boxes like the Roku could could handle decent performance

32
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,340
I was the guy that would just build an XBMC machine

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,780
But in because I needed a PC powerful enough to just not have a laggy system

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,600
Because who wants to sit down with the TV and like then wait for their computer

35
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,420
Yeah, quite. Well, the the fire TV is really really slick. It's very responsive

36
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,380
In all respects. I mean it does some really neat things as well

37
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,180
So the first thing is when it arrives it's pre-configured with your account credentials. That's nice

38
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,780
So like a nice touch that yeah nice touch. Yeah

39
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,500
But it's a bit like oh, I didn't expect that but then when you start watching TV episodes and things like that

40
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,300
It will pre download the next in the series. It stores them. It stores them. Yeah

41
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,660
Yeah, so when you then say I want to watch the next episode of Battlestar Galacta

42
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:25,260
It's just instant because it's already there and it means that you know, the fast-forward and rewind stuff is really responsive

43
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,520
I like that kind of hybrid streaming download approach

44
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,100
So I assume you could probably stream immediately right you could go in there and if you had not ever watched say like I don't

45
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,980
Know 24 and you went to go watch season 1 episode 1 and 24 it would play immediately, right?

46
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,380
But then you would just start down. Yeah, that is so but but it will pull it down faster than you're watching it

47
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,740
So eventually you're you're playing it off the local device rather than off the stream

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,460
And then it will be grabbing the next one if it thinks that this is something that you're you know into and watching

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,300
That I got it I got that's it, you know

50
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,900
I'm what I'm doing is I got a couple of TVs that I like a lot

51
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,140
I don't I feel like a TV buying a TV is like a huge decision too, which is a little silly

52
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,620
But I have a couple of TVs that I like a lot that I have bookmarked to see if they go on Black Friday sale

53
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,620
And if they do I'm gonna get an Amazon fire TV with it

54
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
Yeah, I'm really impressed

55
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:25,660
We've ditched the Roku in the front room now and I'm now looking at the fire TV stick to replace the other Roku in the bedroom

56
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,780
Did you guys see they announced their tier pricing for bit torrent sink?

57
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,780
No, yeah. Yeah, it's a thing. They're doing a tiered pricing thing. Let me go look it up real quick. I think I saw us. What what?

58
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,780
I'll stop using bit torrent sink and start and use sink thing because that's

59
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,780
That's horrible. I'm looking it up now. Maybe it was a prank before I

60
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
They're still gonna release like a

61
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,780
Solid free version everything that you have now you're gonna get to keep you won't lose anything

62
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,780
All right, so that was the thing I saw that wasn't me just being crazy

63
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,780
What the hell?

64
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,780
Are you guys seeing this?

65
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,780
Yeah, what do you think of this? What do you think about this sucks?

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,780
At the moment, I've got probably 200 gigabytes. Well, I think I think yeah, I published all the unfiltered supporters

67
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,780
Files and every single episode is usually one to two gigabytes minimum

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,780
And you know, there's a lot of episodes and then yeah, I know it really so that shit, isn't it?

69
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:30,780
Okay, so I'm gonna have to bite the bullet on the sink thing and get over the rather clunky trust relationship model

70
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,780
I promise

71
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,780
That pulse that pulse model doesn't work for me. I can't add each listener individual

72
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,780
No, no, it doesn't work for you and then it's a pain in the what sits for me because I've got

73
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Bit sync on all of the laptops and desktops and the NAS and a couple of servers out, you know providers

74
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,780
So I've probably got at least a dozen to 14 things and just that is going to be a mess because that's a 28-way

75
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,780
Key exchange which is doesn't scale really does it?

76
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,780
Way to add add keys from like the command line because in theory what you could do is

77
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,780
When someone subscribes to like the unfiltered stuff you could send them an email it like it could and that could be automated

78
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,780
They could add their key and then you could have just a back end that automatically adds it to

79
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,780
The sink thing. So yeah, so okay. So sink is gonna be

80
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Pro is gonna be forty nine dollar. I'm sorry forty dollars a year

81
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,780
Gives you unlimited files

82
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,780
Yeah, she's boy. This is rough, right?

83
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,780
Some people call it bait and swing folders as well though. This is rubbish. Oh

84
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,780
I've got because in lieu of in lieu of selective sync. I've got lots of sync folders, right?

85
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,780
That's how you thought my torrent sink. Yeah. Yeah

86
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,780
It isn't

87
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,780
Looking more like 96 euros a year from from what I'm looking at here

88
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,780
Isn't isn't bit torrent sink

89
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,780
distributed

90
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Well, it's decentralized. It's the the way the files are shared is decentralized

91
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:12,780
It's basically it's basically they're they're nobbling their software to get money out of us

92
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
Well, this is this is why they're never open sourced

93
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,780
It isn't that technically be illegal because you think other people's resources to get money. No, I mean this is not

94
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:25,780
You launch a beta it's free during the beta and then when you are done with the beta you charge

95
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,780
I mean, that's not too uncommon

96
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,780
Chris what if you use an old version for

97
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,780
for our filter on content? Yeah, I suppose you could stick but the thing is is if the clients update

98
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,780
I've noticed on bit torrent sink that can be an issue if the server falls too far behind some of the clients

99
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,780
At least it happened to me once

100
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,780
It became a problem and I and some people couldn't get files anymore

101
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:54,780
So another one looking good now, maybe yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, another one to look a C file if you've not used that

102
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,780
Sparkle share. Yeah, and of course if you want to pay a spider oak

103
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:11,780
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's really packing it in for the holidays. My name is Chris

104
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,780
And my name is Matt. Hey there Matt

105
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,780
So rumor has it you were just chowing down on a little bacon before we got started today

106
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,780
I was I was

107
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,780
You know, I got up here about 15 till logged in about 10 till and I'm like cramming bacon down my face

108
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,780
But the cool through it you were still doing your thing. So I was like, oh cool. I got time to eat

109
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,780
I had some meatballs while you're having your bacon. It's like it's Sunday. It's like we're our Sunday routine on Tuesday

110
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:36,780
Oh, so I have a I have a lot to cover today. I'm really excited about today's show

111
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,780
So we are following up with Charlie from Sunday's Linux action show and he's brought some of the students and they're all huddled around a laptop

112
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,780
Right now and we're gonna talk to them about their experiences with Linux really looking forward to that

113
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,780
We've got some great emails to read this week

114
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,780
There's some thought-provoking questions and potentially some big changes coming to the Jupiter broadcasting website and

115
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,780
No towards the end of the show. I'm gonna play a preview clip of

116
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,780
Interview that will be playing on Sunday's Linux action show with Mark Shuttleworth and the topic is Jermaine

117
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,780
To this show. It's something we've been talking about a lot lately the tone of dialogue in the open source community around all the recent

118
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,780
Systemd debates and Debbie and all that kind of stuff. I wanted to ask Mark Shuttleworth what he thought about it and

119
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,780
Got his a brief summary of his thoughts

120
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,780
We go into greater detail in the Sunday interview

121
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,780
We're gonna play a clip of that because it felt like it fit pretty well

122
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,780
With the topic that we have been recently discussing here on the show

123
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,780
So that'll be towards the end of the show a lot of the stuff that we've been talking about

124
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,780
With the topic that we have been recently discussing here on the show. So that'll be towards the end of the show a lot to do today

125
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,780
So Matt, you know what we got to do. You guys start with that email got to start with that

126
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,780
He's good. So Jesse writes in and he has a question for our guest today

127
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,780
so I will start with our first email that pertains to Charlie and

128
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:57,780
Charlie I I'll read this to you and then I'll give you a chance to respond and it goes a little something like this

129
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,780
Jesse says hello there Chris Madden obviously now Charlie I saw your latest episode of the Linux action show episode

130
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
340 with Charlie raising your rising your

131
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:13,780
And I was just wondering how would you introduce Linux and open source to a school district that still uses Windows XP and power PC

132
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Versions of OS 10 and they can't really afford new hardware or software

133
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,780
Due to politicians stealing money from the state budget

134
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,780
Thanks for your hard time and all your hard work and any ideas

135
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,780
So Charlie if somebody's in a really budget restricted environment, maybe they couldn't buy laptops for students

136
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
And can't really afford to buy new hardware

137
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,780
Is there somewhere where you would give them advice to start on rolling out Linux and open source in a district?

138
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Oh, sorry Charlie I had you turned down go ahead Charlie. Oh, yeah, no problem. Thanks again for having us on the show today

139
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,780
This is just so much fun. Yeah, you know, that's that that's tough, you know being in a school, you know

140
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:52,780
You've worked in a school. We've we've you know both been there when you know budgets and resources are restricted

141
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
What I could offer up is

142
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,780
Probably just starting small

143
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:04,780
Right in the past, you know really are some of our first implementations on the desktop or with Zubuntu

144
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Just simply because the interface was lightweight and we could take advantage of lower-end hardware

145
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,780
But also I think you know more germane to this is a discussion of just starting, you know in a very small fashion

146
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,780
You know when we've we've scaled up to thousands of machines in the desktop, but if we didn't start there

147
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,780
We built on very small successes, you know in many cases we installed

148
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,780
You know some flavor of Linux on just a few machines, you know

149
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,780
Maybe just a teacher's set in a classroom or perhaps even just a single lab

150
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,780
Very good. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense

151
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,780
It requires patience, but you start small and you build up after successes

152
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,780
You get some successes under your belt prove that it's worth everybody's time prove

153
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,780
It's worth whatever little budget is available and then build on top of that. That's great advice

154
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
Yeah, absolutely

155
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,780
And it helps also just you know to bring teachers on board and and staff and and of course students too

156
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,780
You know, we often forget that we want to get students excited about technology

157
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,780
And I think that's an important part of the equation as well. Yeah, great point

158
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,780
All right. So there you go. Jesse. There's some great starting points from Charlie and I wish you the best of luck sir

159
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,780
And you know when I tried to get Linux deployed in my work environment

160
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,780
It was fundamentally critical to have these mini successes. It started small and then I built on top of that

161
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,780
And it doesn't have to be a school district. It can be any kind of environment like that

162
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,780
So Bugsbane the third writes in and maybe this is one we can open up to the whole mumble room

163
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,780
He says I've been using Linux for over a decade and I love it

164
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,780
While I can't write a line of code to save my life over the years

165
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,780
I've gotten very used to setting up networks compiling code triaging bugs, etc

166
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,780
I have no formal qualifications, but I've learned a lot

167
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,780
Now I'd like to use all of that training to get a job, but I have no idea where to start

168
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,780
Entry job levels entry jobs seem to be overqualified

169
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,780
We have requirements where you've been a network administrator for many years or you're a developer

170
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,780
And currently not having a job

171
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,780
I don't have a lot of money to spend on getting certifications or training to become a coder

172
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,780
So where would you or anyone in the audience recommend someone start?

173
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,780
And so the question is if you have a good sense of Linux

174
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Maybe you've been using it for a while, but you don't have anything on that resume

175
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,780
How could you get in and get started?

176
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:21,780
And I have I'll start with my idea and then anybody that wants to jump in please do so

177
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,780
I would if you're all if you're all if you are unemployed

178
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,780
Consider the fact that you might have something in excess that a lot of people don't have

179
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,780
And it's not necessarily money. It's time

180
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:38,780
And you might consider starting at the ground floor somewhere and just on a volunteer basis to see if they need help

181
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,780
And then perhaps make yourself invaluable and they might consider hiring you

182
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
That would be one way I know that's easier said than done

183
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Matt, what do you think?

184
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,780
What about like just trying to get your foot in the door and maybe trying to get somebody's attention?

185
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,780
Is it got to be like, do you need to know somebody?

186
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,780
Is that is he screwed if he doesn't know somebody?

187
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,780
No, you hit the nail on the head with volunteering

188
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
Both pretty much everything I've ever done in my life

189
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,780
I started at some capacity of working for free

190
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,780
And I think that volunteering for a worthwhile organization makes a lot of sense

191
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Because not only do you have something very strong to put on your resume later

192
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,780
But you also showed that you weren't watching Oprah all day on television

193
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
You're actually doing something productive, right?

194
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
Getting work experience

195
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Exactly. It's truly it

196
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,780
I mean, that's you know, I've been self-employed for years

197
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,780
And so for me, it's like I can't fathom not having you know

198
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,780
If I'm not in the middle of a project, I'll go make one

199
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
And I think the same thing applies here

200
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,780
If you could find a need, go fill it, figure it out

201
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,780
You know, just get out there and try stuff

202
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
I love it. That's great advice

203
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Anybody in the mumbler want to jump in with anything before we move on?

204
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
I think that's probably good stuff right there

205
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,780
But if anybody else has any pointers of something that got them a gig

206
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,780
We'd love to hear it

207
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,780
I'd just like to echo Chris that absolutely volunteering is the way to go

208
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,780
You know, open source by its very nature is participatory

209
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,780
And really the best way to demonstrate your skills is to get out and volunteer

210
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,780
Be active in projects and programs and demonstrate what you got

211
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
Nailed it. All right

212
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:07,780
I'd also say that there's sometimes where I've talked to people who said that they didn't have enough experience

213
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,780
Because the job listings required something so absurd that it's not even possible

214
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:21,780
But a lot of the times these employers are looking for people who are willing to try anyway

215
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
Yeah, I've heard that before too

216
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,780
Yeah, so they'll set up an experience

217
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,780
It's like you have to have three years of experience for this

218
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
And two years experience for this

219
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
But they don't actually want that

220
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,780
They're kind of like

221
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,780
Sometimes they'll have it where it's kind of a deterrent for someone who's not motivated enough to try

222
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,780
They don't want them working for them anyway

223
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,780
So if you don't have the experience but you go there and say

224
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
And you can prove that you can do it anyway

225
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
They'll hire you

226
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,780
That's a great point

227
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,780
From their perspective they're like we're either going to get somebody who's really determined

228
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,780
And willing to go the extra mile for us

229
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,780
Or B, we'll get really lucky and get somebody who's super qualified

230
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
And we won't have to pay them very much

231
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
And on top of that

232
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,780
Once you're in the negotiations for the job

233
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,780
If they're going to give it to you and you didn't meet all the qualifications

234
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
They can be like well

235
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,780
You know we were looking for somebody who had 15 years as a DBA

236
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
And 25 years as a VB programmer

237
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,780
So we're going to go ahead and cut off about 10K from what we listed in the job application

238
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
But you got the job, congratulations

239
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
You know that's another reason they do it

240
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,780
They make up these impossible qualifications

241
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,780
And when you don't meet them they can kind of reduce their commitment

242
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,780
We want you to have like 10 years of VB experience

243
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,780
And also speak Chinese

244
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,780
Yeah, yeah

245
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
Have you been working with

246
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,780
We need somebody who's been working with Linux for 35 years

247
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
Can you do that for us?

248
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,780
Yeah, no I can't

249
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,780
Lies

250
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Yes, lies exactly

251
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,780
Alright I'll tell you about something that's not a lie

252
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,780
That's saving a little bit of money from Ting

253
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,780
That's my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider

254
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,780
And that's our first sponsor this week

255
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Go to linux.ting.com

256
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,780
Linux

257
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,780
Yeah you get to put Linux in there

258
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
Linux.ting.com

259
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,780
Head over there

260
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,780
Check out the Ting website

261
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,780
By going to that URL

262
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
You automatically are going to save 25 bucks

263
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
If you pull the trigger and get a Ting device

264
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,780
Or if you got a compatible Ting device

265
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,780
You're going to save 25

266
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,780
Or you're going to get 25 dollars in Ting credit

267
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Which could be like almost 2 months of service

268
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,780
It's kind of crazy

269
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,780
So why Ting?

270
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,780
Right

271
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Why Switch?

272
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
Why go through the hassle of moving over?

273
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Well first of all they make that switch pretty painless

274
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,780
They've got an early termination relief program

275
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,780
So if you're in a contract now

276
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,780
They'll pay up to 75 dollars per line and you have to get cancelled

277
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
If you're not in a contract

278
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,780
Well then this is a better time than ever to move over

279
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,780
Because you only pay for what you use

280
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,780
It's just your minutes, your messages and your megabytes

281
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
That's all you pay

282
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,780
You just take that

283
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Add it up

284
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,780
That's it

285
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,780
It's 6 dollars for the lines

286
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,780
You can have as many lines as you want

287
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
It's a flat 6 dollars

288
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,780
You can turn them on and off when you need them

289
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,780
And then you just pay for your usage

290
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,780
It doesn't matter if it's a data device or a smart phone

291
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
No contracts

292
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
No early termination fee

293
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,780
An incredible, incredible dashboard

294
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,780
And no whole customer service when you call them at 1855-TING-FTW

295
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,780
A real person answers the phone

296
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,780
Just got a call between 8am and 8pm on business hours

297
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,780
They're not animals

298
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,780
But go to linux.ting.com and try out that savings calculator right there on the screen

299
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
You click that

300
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
Go in there

301
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
Put in your current usage information

302
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
Like for example

303
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
Let's just

304
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,780
I don't even remember what I used to use anymore

305
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
But let's just say I use

306
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,780
Yeah right

307
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,780
Let's say I use 300 minutes

308
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
I'm not a big talker

309
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,780
And 200 text messages

310
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
Well

311
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,780
I mean maybe

312
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,780
I really would probably use Hangouts to be honest with you

313
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,780
So I don't know

314
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,780
But let's say it's 200 messages right

315
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,780
And the megabytes

316
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,780
Let's say it's about

317
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,780
Let's say this month I think I'm probably about 3 gigabytes

318
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
And before taxes

319
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
That would be normally what?

320
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
150 dollars for that cell phone bill?

321
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
Oh not 450

322
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
150 dollars

323
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,780
Now you go into the Ting savings calculator

324
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,780
If you've got multiple lines

325
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,780
You put that in there

326
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,780
You put your actual usage in there

327
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,780
And you can calculate the savings

328
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780
And see how much you would save

329
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,780
They can do some data scraping as well

330
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,780
But just at that

331
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
Which is a fairly moderate plan

332
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,780
You probably are using more than that

333
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,780
A lot of you

334
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,780
You'd save 2,000 dollars

335
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
And if you're using less

336
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
You'd save even more

337
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
That's what's so great about the Ting model

338
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,780
It's so sweet

339
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
Go over there right now

340
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
Linux.ting.com

341
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
Check them out

342
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
See why Ting is mobile

343
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,780
That makes sense

344
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,780
And when you're playing around with that savings calculator

345
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,780
Don't be surprised if it brings a tear to your eye

346
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,780
When you see that money

347
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,780
You're like gosh

348
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
That's a laptop I could buy every couple of years

349
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
And also I think this is pretty cool

350
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,780
They've been spotlighting different Ting customers on the Ting blog

351
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,780
And they've got an adorable new baby

352
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,780
Oh look at that girl with those pretty blue eyes

353
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,780
Let's go over to the Ting blog

354
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
And check out the Ting customers

355
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
Their app pics

356
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Information about Ting

357
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,780
Their blog post about their consumer reports rating

358
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,780
That was excellent

359
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
They've got all the kinds of good info

360
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,780
Gives you some behind the scenes information about Ting

361
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,780
It kind of gives you a better idea of where your money is going

362
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,780
And I think that's all pretty important to a lot of us

363
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,780

00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,780

You own that phone

368
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,780
Like your computer

369
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,780
You know

370
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
I know

371
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
It's crazy

372
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,780
And it's not actually

373
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,780
You know what's funny

374
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Is people outside the US

375
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,780
Like some of our listeners

376
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
Live in areas where the cell phone system

377
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
Makes a lot more sense

378
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,780
And they hear this stuff

379
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,780
And they're like wait a minute

380
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
You guys pay subsidies

381
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,780
You realize you pay more in the long run

382
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,780
You realize they're scamming you

383
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
And I don't know if you heard

384
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,780
But Verizon just like extended the early termination fee

385
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,780
Even further out now

386
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,780
And with a higher rate

387
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,780
Like they just keep getting worse

388
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,780
They're not getting any better

389
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
Linux.ting.com

390
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
Go make a difference for yourself

391
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
And go vote with your wallet

Linux.ting.com

393
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,780
And a big thank you to Ting

394
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
For sponsoring

395
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
Linux Unplugged

396
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,780
Okay

397
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,780
Just a couple more emails to get to

398
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
This is

399
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,780
You know when we started the Linux Unplugged show

400
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,780
The initial concept for Linux Unplugged

401
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Was actually going to be

402
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,780
Just 100% emails

403
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
I remember that

404
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,780
You remember that

405
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,780
Yeah right

406
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Like I was like Matt

407
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
We get too many emails

408
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
We should have a show

409
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,780
Where we just read emails

410
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,780
So that's why we do emails

411
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
At the beginning of the show

412
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,780
Because that's the heritage

413
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,780
Of Linux Unplugged

414
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
It's like okay

415
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,780
This is bad

416
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,780
These emails are just sitting in the inbox

417
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,780
And now we still have the same problem

418
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,780
But we at least get to some of them

419
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
So that's good

420
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Alright

421
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Mandaray writes in

422
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,780
With yet another System D survey

423
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,780
This is up to you

424
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Dear audience

425
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,780
But he wanted to let us know

426
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,780
That he's created another System D survey

427
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Unlike the one we ran previously

428
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
This one aims to figure out

429
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
What groups of users

430
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,780
Are in favor of System D

431
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,780
And which are against it

432
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,780
And who is a vocal

433
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,780
And who is

434
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,780
You know

435
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,780
All the kind of nuances around that

436
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,780
He says hopefully

437
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,780
He wants to find more discussion around it

438
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
He's already compiled

439
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,780
Some of the interesting information

440
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,780
Not only about System D

441
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,780
But other topics too

442
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
Which might be worth discussing

443
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,780
In future episodes

444
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,780
However

445
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Because he's kind of running this on his own

446
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,780
We haven't talked about it anywhere

447
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,780
He's only gotten about

448
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
240 participants so far

449
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,780
So I have a link in the show notes

450
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,780
If you'd like to take yet another

451
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,780
System D survey

452
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,780
That also asks some other questions

453
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,780
And you never know

454
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,780
We might get some good weekly

455
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,780
Conversation out of it

456
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
For a little bit

457
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,780
So thanks to Mandaray

458
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
For writing that

459
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,780
It's a Google form

460
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
You know these Google forms

461
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Are actually really handy

462
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
If you haven't checked them out

463
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Because they output all of the results

464
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
I mean you know me

465
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
I'm not like Mr. Google over here

466
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,780
But they output all of the results

467
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,780
Right into a spreadsheet

468
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,780
And that's just undeniably handy

469
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
In fact we have one

470
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
That I'm going to talk about

471
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,780
At the end of the show

472
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,780
For us

473
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,780
So I'll have a link to his survey

474
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
In the show notes

475
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,780
If you guys want to try it

476
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Cool

477
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,780
Yeah

478
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
And maybe we can dig

479
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,780
Through the results later

480
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
Alright

481
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
Here's the big one

482
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,780
That I've been waiting to get to

483
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
I know Rotten Corpse

484
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,780
Is going to have some stuff

485
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,780
To talk about that

486
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,780
So I'll give him a chance

487
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,780
To jump in first

488
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
Once I read this one

489
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,780
So on Coda Radio yesterday

490
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
I mentioned that

491
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
I have

492
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
I have a dream Matt

493
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,780
I have a dream

494
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
You have a dream

495
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,780
Of going into the Jupiter Broadcasting

496
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,780
WordPress directory

497
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,780
Typing rm-rf star

498
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
And hitting enter

499
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
I want

500
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,780
I'm done with WordPress

501
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,780
It's great

502
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,780
It's super sweet

503
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,780
If you run a blog

504
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Anything like that

505
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
Great open source project

506
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,780
I don't want to use WordPress anymore

507
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,780
I don't need a CMS

508
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,780
I don't want a CMS

509
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,780
All I want to do

510
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Is put an HTML5 video

511
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
Up on a webpage

512
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,780
With some download links

513
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
And some text that tells you

514
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
What that video is about

515
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,780
That's all I want Matt

516
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,780
I want to take a flat markdown file

517
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,780
I want to drop in a directory

518
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,780
And I want that to publish

519
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
Up on the web

520
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,780
I don't want a database

521
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
I don't want nothing dynamic

522
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,780
None of it

523
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
Reach it

524
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Static HTML

525
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Simple easy

526
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,780
Boom shakalaka

527
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,780
I hear you

528
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
So on Coda Radio 129

529
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,780
I went on

530
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,780
About my fantasy

531
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,780
Of replacing WordPress

532
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,780
With something more

533
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,780
Quote unquote

534
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,780
Sane as

535
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,780
It was written here

536
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,780
Up in this

537
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,780
Subreddit post

538
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,780
So here's the

539
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
There's a bunch of great suggestions

540
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,780
In this post

541
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
Of what Jupiter Broadcasting

542
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,780
Could do

543
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,780
To move away from WordPress

544
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
Let me tell you

545
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
What I'm thinking about here

546
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Because I'd love to get the audience

547
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,780
I'm sure there's some people out

548
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,780
That have done this kind of thing

549
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
I really want something

550
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
Very simple

551
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,780
That would allow us to import

552
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,780
Somehow

553
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,780
I don't know how we would do it

554
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,780
All of the back catalog

555
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,780
Of the existing post

556
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
So we could go

557
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,780
Pull in

558
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,780
All of the previous shows

559
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Not mess with all the time stamps

560
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Keep all the tags

561
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,780
Something that could extract it

562
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,780
From the MySQL WordPress database

563
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,780
And put it into this new system

564
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
So that's one thing

565
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,780
I want to get done

566
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,780
I'm thinking like

567
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,780
After the holidays

568
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,780
So not like right now

569
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,780
Probably after New Years

570
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,780
And put this all

571
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Put this

572
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,780
I'm trying to put something together

573
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,780
And I'm looking for people's

574
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,780
Suggestions right now

575
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,780
On how we could pull off

576
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
What we could use

577
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
And any tools that might be useful

578
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,780
In a transition like this

579
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,780
It's really early day stuff

580
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,780
Just starting to think about it

581
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,780
But Rotten Corps

582
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,780
You were looking at PicoCMS

583
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,780
I know

584
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,780
I think Alan is using PicoCMS

585
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,780
To run the bsdnow.tv site

586
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,780
And he says

587
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,780
It essentially does

588
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Kind of what I was talking about

589
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,780
They run the whole site

590
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,780
Off of markdown files

591
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,780
And some CSS tweaks, right?

592
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Yeah

593
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,780
It's not just

594
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
It's not limited to just markdown

595
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,780
But it does

596
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,780
It does have a lot of

597
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,780
Focus on markdown

598
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,780
So what do you think?

599
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Am I crazy?

600
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
No, actually for JB

601
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
It makes a lot of sense

602
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Because the biggest bottleneck

603
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,780
For a CMS

604
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,780
Is the constant checking

605
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,780
The database for the content

606
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
And if it's just

607
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,780
For the episodes

608
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
You don't need to go back

609
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,780
And change the show notes

610
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,780
Because once the show's out

611
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,780
The show's out

612
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
So a static file

613
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
Would make perfect sense

614
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,780
For JB

615
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,780
And the entire structure

616
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Would make sense to each other

617
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Pico looks really good

618
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,780
I'm also looking at Pelican

619
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,780
But so far

620
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Pico is kind of like

621
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
The front runner

622
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,780
But there are many other options

623
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,780
That I'm looking at

624
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,780
A few suggestions people gave

625
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Were actually

626
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,780
Have been discontinued

627
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,780
Oh, really?

628
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
So there's

629
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
About half of the ones

630
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,780
That were suggested

631
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,780
Were not viable

632
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,780
But Pico does look like

633
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
A good option

634
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
Now, MB

635
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
You've done some migrations

636
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
I noticed you mentioned

637
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
mate-desktop.org

638
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,780
And ubuntu-mate.org

639
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,780
You mentioned those as reference

640
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
Have you migrated those

641
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Specific sites from WordPress

642
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,780
Or what's that been like for you?

643
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,780
So, yeah

644
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,780
So I migrated my own site

645
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,780
From WordPress

646
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780
To Nicola

647
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,780
Which is a static site generator

648
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,780
A couple of years ago

649
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,780
And Nicola has a

650
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,780
WordPress migration tool

651
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,780
So you can migrate

652
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
All your pages and blog posts

653
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,780
And it also has

654
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,780
Well, no

655
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,780
You don't need to use Nicola

656
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,780
For this

657
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,780
Within WordPress

658
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
You can export

659
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
All your comments

660
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
As XML

661
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,780
And then you can load

662
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,780
Those into Disqus

663
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,780
And then you can link

664
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,780
Your static site

665
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Generated with Nicola

666
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,780
To the Disqus account

667
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,780
Where your comments

668
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Have been imported

669
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,780
And retain all of your

670
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Comment history as well

671
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,780
So I migrated my own site

672
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
To Nicola

673
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Because I wanted

674
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,780
A static site generator

675
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,780
I wanted a really easy way

676
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
To deploy the website

677
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
And I spend a lot of time

678
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,780
In the shell

679
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,780
And I just wanted

680
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,780
To be able to open up

681
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
My text editor

682
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Bashing some words

683
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,780
And publish

684
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
And everything for my site

685
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,780
Is done in Markdown

686
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,780
So if you look at

687
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
The Ubuntu Mate website

688
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
That is all Markdown

689
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,780
That's rendered into HTML

690
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
By Nicola

691
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
And you just manage

692
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
A theme

693
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
That is then applied

694
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
To the Markdown

695
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,780
So I found Nicola

696
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
To be really great

697
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
And I actually use

698
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
BitSync as my

699
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Deployment mechanism

700
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,780
So my sites are in BitSync

701
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,780
And you edit the Markdown

702
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
And then I touch a file

703
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,780
In there to say publish

704
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,780
And a cron job on the server

705
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Looks for the published file

706
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,780
Runs the Nicola

707
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
Static site generation

708
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
And then R syncs

709
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,780
The generated site

710
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,780
To the web group

711
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,780
I was thinking of maybe

712
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
I mean BitTorrent sync

713
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,780
Is pretty sweet too

714
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,780
I was thinking of like

715
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
A GitHub

716
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
Like a git deployment

717
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
Like check in, check out

718
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
Push kind of thing

719
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
Yeah, I know

720
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
I've used things like that

721
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
Too complicated?

722
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
It's a bit of a

723
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,780
Well, for my own sites

724
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
It is, although as it happens

725
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
The mate-desktop.org

726
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,780
Website is powered by Nicola

727
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,780
And that's in git hub

728
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,780
And periodically the server

729
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Checks out the git hub

730
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
And rebuilds the site

731
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,780
And deploys it

732
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
So that's familiar for

733
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
For the developers

734
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Who know the git workflow

735
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
For my own stuff

736
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,780
It's currently in BitSync

737
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
But I'm going to put

738
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
The Mate desktop

739
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,780
The Ubuntu Mate site

740
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Into either Git or Bazaar

741
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
So that I can get some

742
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,780
Translators involved

743
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,780
Because Nicola has also got

744
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,780
Multilingual facilities as well

745
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,780
So you can do translations

746
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,780
I like the WordPress

747
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,780
Conversion built in

748
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,780
Yeah, go ahead

749
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,780
What I would recommend is

750
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,780
Setting up a Gitolite server

751
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,780
On your DigitalOcean droplet

752
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
And this is what I do in fact

753
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
And you push a change

754
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,780
And you can have Gitolite

755
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,780
Call a hook

756
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
And that hook could be

757
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,780
To rebuild the static site

758
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
Okay, oh this is exciting

759
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,780
Okay, so how do you handle

760
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,780
Like changes to like

761
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
So if you

762
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,780
How do you like for example

763
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,780
In Jupyter Broadcasting

764
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
Let's say we had a thumbnail

765
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,780
And we want to change

766
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Thumbnail on one of the

767
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,780
On one of the stills

768
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,780
How do you regenerate

769
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,780
Like a front page

770
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
What generates that

771
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Is the Nicola software

772
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,780
Taking care of that

773
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,780
What's doing that part

774
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,780
Yeah, yeah

775
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,780
So the way Nicola works

776
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
Is it knows the hashes

777
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,780
Of all of the source files

778
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,780
And it knows the hashes

779
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
Of all of the configuration

780
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
And the files that get generated

781
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,780
So if for example

782
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,780
You change an asset

783
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,780
Every page where that asset

784
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,780
Is used will automatically

785
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,780
Be generated

786
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
So when I did that deployment

787
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,780
Of Ubuntu Marte

788
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
A couple of weeks ago

789
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,780
The release part was running

790
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,780
Nicola

791
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,780
And it's two commands

792
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,780
Nicola build

793
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,780
Which builds all of the pages

794
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,780
And pulls in all of the assets

795
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,780
And then Nicola deploy

796
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
Which is then

797
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
Calls a script of your own

798
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,780
To actually push it somewhere

799
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
And what I've done is

800
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
I've added a couple of

801
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
Extra deployment pieces

802
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,780
Which are scripts

803
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,780
That automatically

804
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
Sim link the ISO images

805
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
And stuff like that

806
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
And does it handle things

807
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
Like responsive design

808
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,780
And stuff like that

809
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
Or is that a little tricky

810
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,780
It does

811
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,780
Yeah, go and open

812
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,780
Ubuntu Marte.org on your phone

813
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
And have a look

814
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
It's automatic

815
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
Yeah, it actually works

816
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,780
On the browser too, yeah

817
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
So the way that that's handled

818
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,780
Is I've cheated

819
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,780
And Nicola supports

820
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,780
Bootstrap

821
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
One of the themes

822
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
So I just went to Boot Swatch

823
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
Found a theme that was

824
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
Broadly what I wanted

825
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
And then just tweaked it

826
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,780
And then I got all the benefits

827
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Of Bootstrap and Boot Swatch

828
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
I didn't have to do much work

829
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
That's pretty great

830
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,780
That's a lot of great

831
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,780
It sounds a lot

832
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
Up our alley

833
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,780
And does it do

834
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
I'm sure

835
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
Sorry

836
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
Does it do any feed generation

837
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
Or anything like that

838
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
For RSS feeds

839
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
Yeah, it generates

840
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
RSS feeds

841
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
And it can do

842
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
Podcast stuff

843
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
And a whole bunch

844
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
Of other things

845
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
And it's not limited

846
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
To Markdown either

847
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
So it also supports

848
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,780
Restructured text

849
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
And BB code

850
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,780
And just about every kind

851
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
Of text render

852
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
You can imagine

853
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Really?

854
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,780
Yeah, all of those

855
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,780
And so on the

856
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,780
Marte Desktop.org website

857
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,780
The front page

858
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
Is actually

859
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Restructured text

860
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,780
Because I needed

861
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Some of the facilities

862
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Of restructured text

863
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,780
But all of the other pages

864
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,780
Are Markdown

865
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,780
That's cool

866
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,780
So this is sounding

867
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,780
Pretty doable

868
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
I wonder

869
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,780
But I'm sure

870
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,780
What Nicola does

871
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,780
Is not that different

872
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
From what a lot

873
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
Of the other static site

874
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
Generators do

875
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
But what you get

876
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
Of course

877
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,780
Is you get some real

878
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Security benefits

879
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,780
Because you're not running

880
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,780
An interpreted language

881
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,780
On your web server

882
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,780
So you can't be exploited

883
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,780
And the other thing

884
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,780
You can do

885
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,780
Is then trivially

886
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
Hook it up

887
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,780
To your CDN

888
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,780
To cache

889
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
All of the assets

890
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
Like your CSS

891
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,780
And your JavaScript

892
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,780
Exactly

893
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,780
So I then integrate

894
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,780
My sites

895
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,780
With Cloudflare

896
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,780
And that absorbs

897
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
Gobs of bandwidth

898
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,780
That I don't have

899
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
To serve out

900
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
Through my own servers

901
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
That is excellent

902
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
And my

903
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
Really ultimate

904
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
Envision

905
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
I don't know

906
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
When this would ever be done

907
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,780
But the file

908
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
Comes out of

909
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
The editing software

910
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
Whatever it is

911
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
At this point in time

912
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
And it's then

913
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,780
Ran through

914
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,780
We currently have

915
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,780
A pretty nice

916
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,780
Bash script

917
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:15,780
That Rekai's put together

918
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:16,780
To handle all

919
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,780
Of our encoding

920
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,780
And metadata tagging

921
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
And the different versions

922
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,780
Of all the different files

923
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,780
And the, you know

924
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
It spits them all out

925
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
It would be amazing

926
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
Then to have something

927
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
Like that

928
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,780
That would

929
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Then take a

930
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
Markdown file, right?

931
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,780
And put it somewhere

932
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
Where it could get

933
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,780
Absorbed onto the website

934
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,780
And upload these files

935
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
To the CDN

936
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,780
Really have it be

937
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
The point where

938
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
You export out

939
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
Of the editing application

940
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,780
You run the bash script

941
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
And from that point

942
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Everything is kind of

943
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
On autopilot

944
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
And it just reduces

945
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
Human error

946
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
It makes it faster

947
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
And the end goal

948
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,780
Would really be

949
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,780
To give us

950
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
More time

951
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
And more resources

952
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
Available to do other things

953
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
So that way we don't have

954
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
To sit there and babysit

955
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,780
The computer

956
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
As it goes through

957
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,780
These tasks

958
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,780
And sit there and upload

959
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,780
It to the FTP

960
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
We don't need to do that

961
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
It could all be automated

962
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
But the key part

963
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
I really want to do

964
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Is I want to make sure

965
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
The whole web

966
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,780
Posting process

967
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,780
Could be automated as well

968
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,780
And that

969
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
You know

970
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,780
It doesn't have to go

971
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
And it gets published

972
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,780
On its own

973
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
After that

974
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
So we'll see

975
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
Yeah so

976
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,780
So if you've already

977
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,780
Got an investment

978
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,780
In some scripts

979
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
That do some of those

980
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,780
Deployment activities

981
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,780
You can continue

982
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
To leverage those

983
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
And just integrate

984
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Those as the deployment

985
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,780
Commands within

986
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,780
Nicola

987
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
So in the configuration

988
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,780
File it can run

989
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,780
Any number of commands

990
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
As part of the deployment

991
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
And I've got

992
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Half a dozen shell scripts

993
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
That get executed

994
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,780
In my deployment

995
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
And I've got

996
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Half a dozen shell scripts

997
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
That get executed

998
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
In my deployment

999
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
One to deposit

1000
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
The files

1001
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
In the right place

1002
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
And then a few other

1003
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
Bits and pieces

1004
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
To link up ISO links

1005
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
And torrents

1006
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
And stuff like that

1007
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
So not dissimilar

1008
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
From what you would

1009
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Want to do

1010
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
With media

1011
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
And it can be automated

1012
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,780
Because cron

1013
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,780
Is your friend

1014
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,780
Yeah

1015
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,780
Wow

1016
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,780
I just

1017
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,780
Touch a file

1018
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
And how long

1019
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
Have you had so far

1020
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
How long have you

1021
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,780
Been using it

1022
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,780
In production

1023
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
On my own

1024
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
Personal site

1025
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,780
For two years

1026
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,780
Okay wow

1027
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,780
On the mart

1028
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,780
A desktop website

1029
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,780
For about a year

1030
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,780
And obviously

1031
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,780
I've been to Marte

1032
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,780
Just about five months

1033
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
So what do you think

1034
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,780
Rodden

1035
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,780
I think that there's

1036
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
A now potential battle

1037
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,780
Between Nicola and Pico

1038
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,780
Good alright

1039
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,780
There you go

1040
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,780
And if

1041
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Out there in the audience

1042
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,780
If anybody has some suggestions

1043
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
There's already a thread

1044
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,780
Going in the subreddit

1045
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,780
You can toss in

1046
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,780
Or you can leave a comment

1047
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,780
In the feedback thread

1048
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
For this episode

1049
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
It's not that we're

1050
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,780
Going to do right away

1051
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,780
But it's definitely something

1052
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,780
I want to start thinking

1053
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,780
About now

1054
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
So when we do it

1055
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,780
We do it right

1056
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,780
Oh totally

1057
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
Well I actually

1058
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,780
Threw something to you

1059
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,780
In the Skype message in there

1060
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,780
So I think it's called Jekyll

1061
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
It's something I've looked at

1062
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,780
In the past

1063
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,780
It's very similar to what

1064
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
You guys were talking about earlier

1065
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
RSS imports the whole package

1066
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
Yep yep that's another one

1067
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
I've heard of too

1068
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
Yeah Jekyll's looking good

1069
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Yeah there's

1070
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
And Ghost is another one

1071
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
I've seen a lot of

1072
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
Common mentions

1073
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,780
Yeah so some

1074
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
Some really interesting

1075
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
Way more options out there

1076
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,780
Than I thought

1077
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,780
When I came up with this

1078
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,780
Apparently

1079
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
I'm nowhere near

1080
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,780
The first person

1081
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,780
To ever think of this idea

1082
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,780
Not surprising

1083
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,780
Not surprising at all

1084
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,780
And you know

1085
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
I think a big part of that

1086
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,780
Is that's why I think

1087
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
I'm going to mention

1088
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Our next sponsor

1089
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,780
Over digitalocean.com

1090
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,780
I could easily see us

1091
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,780
Using a droplet to manage

1092
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
The deployment

1093
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,780
Or take care of

1094
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
Some testing

1095
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,780
In fact there's so many

1096
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
Amazing things you could use

1097
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,780
Digitalocean for

1098
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,780
Because you get

1099
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,780
Great performance

1100
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Great price

1101
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,780
And unlimited access

1102
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,780
To the machine

1103
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,780
Check it out

1104
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
Digitalocean is a simple

1105
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
Cloud hosting provider

1106
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
Dedicated to offering

1107
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,780
The most intuitive

1108
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
And easy way for you

1109
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
To spin up your own

1110
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Cloud server

1111
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
You get root access

1112
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,780
To that bad mamma jamma

1113
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
HTML5 console access

1114
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,780
I know you like that

1115
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,780
But you get a

1116
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
30 second

1117
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,780
Benchmark

1118
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
And it's only 35 seconds

1119
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,780
I mean seriously

1120
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:38,780
Like our audience

1121
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
It's ridiculous

1122
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,780
I mean now if you can

1123
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
If you can get it below 40

1124
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
You really

1125
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
The benchmark is

1126
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
35 seconds

1127
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
That's when you should

1128
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
Be tweeting at Chris

1129
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
If you get it under

1130
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,780
35 seconds now

1131
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,780
And for $5 a month

1132
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,780
You're going to get

1133
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,780
512 megabytes of RAM

1134
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
A 20 gigabyte SSD

1135
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,780
One CPU

1136
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
And a terabyte of

1137
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,780
Blazing fast transfer

1138
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,780
This connected to

1139
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
Data centers

1140
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
All over the world

1141
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,780
In New York

1142
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
San Francisco

1143
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
Singapore

1144
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
It's got to be

1145
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
The best looking

1146
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Data centers

1147
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,780
I've ever seen

1148
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
And I know that seems

1149
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,780
Like a weird thing

1150
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
To comment on

1151
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
But guys

1152
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
I've been in

1153
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
A lot of data centers

1154
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
And they never look as good

1155
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
It's just

1156
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
Oh man

1157
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
I feel like

1158
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
I want to go back

1159
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
And just appreciate

1160
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
A well designed

1161
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Data center

1162
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Because now that

1163
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,780
It's no longer my problem

1164
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,780
Oh it's just

1165
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,780
It's gorgeous

1166
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,780
But it's

1167
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,780
It's that interface

1168
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,780
That really stands out

1169
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
I mean it's not just

1170
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Their data centers

1171
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
That look great

1172
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,780
It's their interface

1173
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
They can replicate

1174
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,780
The functionality

1175
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,780
With their straightforward

1176
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,780
API

1177
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,780
You can write some scripts

1178
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
Snap it into your

1179
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,780
Puppet management infrastructure

1180
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,780
Use one of the

1181
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,780
Many applications

1182
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
Built by the community

1183
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
They've got all of it

1184
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
That control panel rocks

1185
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,780
And the community support

1186
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
Around it rocks

1187
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
DNS management

1188
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
One click deployment

1189
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
Of GitLab

1190
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
You know like

1191
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,780
For example

1192
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
If we were going to

1193
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
Actually start

1194
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,780
When we released an episode

1195
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,780
Deploying that

1196
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
To the website

1197
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Via Git

1198
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,780
You

1199
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
You absolutely bet

1200
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,780
It would be on a

1201
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
Self hosted instance

1202
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
Up on Digital Ocean

1203
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,780
No question about it

1204
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
Not only does that dashboard

1205
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
Make Git up and going

1206
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
Super fast and straightforward

1207
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Doesn't make

1208
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
Give me any pause

1209
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
So I just get right in

1210
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Friction free

1211
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
But it also means that

1212
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
I'm going to have a

1213
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Blazing fast machine

1214
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,780
Because Digital Ocean

1215
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,780
Has SSDs throughout

1216
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
They've got great bandwidth

1217
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780
Incredible SSD speeds

1218
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
It really makes a difference

1219
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,780
And it's

1220
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
It's just all those little things

1221
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
At every single level

1222
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
That make them

1223
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
So incredible

1224
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
But I also know that

1225
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
If I ever get stuck

1226
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
Digital Ocean has

1227
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
The best tutorials

1228
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
On the web

1229
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
And they're getting

1230
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,780
Even better

1231
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,780
Because Digital Ocean

1232
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,780
Is willing to pay

1233
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,780
For them

1234
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,780
Because they understand

1235
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
The importance of them

1236
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,780
In fact

1237
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,780
If you write a tutorial

1238
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
For Digital Ocean

1239
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
You could get paid

1240
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
Up to $200

1241
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
And they have an editor

1242
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
That works with you too

1243
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
So it's not like

1244
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,780
It's all on you

1245
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
And they've had

1246
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,780
Such success there

1247
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
They've opened up

1248
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
An editing position

1249
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
So here's what

1250
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,780
I want you to do

1251
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
I want you to try out

1252
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,780
Digital Ocean

1253
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,780
You can try it for

1254
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,780
Two months

1255
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
For free

1256
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
To see what I've

1257
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,780
Been talking about

1258
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Use our promo code

1259
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,780
For November

1260
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
Okay?

1261
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
You get a $10 credit

1262
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
You apply that to your account

1263
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,780
In fact, I need to go in there

1264
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
And do that right now

1265
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,780
This is another thing

1266
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
I like a lot about it

1267
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
Is that you pre-fund the account

1268
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
And they just send you

1269
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
A message

1270
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,780
Hey

1271
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
You need to add more funds

1272
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,780
This is how I have it set up

1273
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
I'm sure you could probably

1274
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
Have it set up multiple ways

1275
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
So I go in there right now

1276
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
If I was trying out

1277
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Digital Ocean

1278
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
I put the promo code in

1279
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
Unplug November

1280
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,780
And I get a $10 credit

1281
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
I think I might go do that

1282
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
I could be trying it out

1283
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,780
Right now

1284
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Try it out

1285
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
Go over there

1286
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,780
Get a $5 rig

1287
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
See what you can do

1288
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
Because if you need to upgrade

1289
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,780
To a beefier box

1290
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,780
The pricing tier

1291
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Is crazy straight forward

1292
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,780
You just go look at the

1293
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,780
Pricing plans

1294
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,780
Okay, that's easy

1295
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,780
That's another $5

1296
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
That makes sense

1297
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,780
Right?

1298
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
And you could even do

1299
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,780
Hourly pricing

1300
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,780
So if you just need to

1301
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
Scale up for a little while

1302
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
And add some additional capacity

1303
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,780
Or you're doing some testing

1304
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,780
For a day

1305
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,780
Or it's a launch day

1306
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Or maybe you're going to do

1307
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,780
A gaming server

1308
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,780
For a few hours

1309
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
Hourly pricing

1310
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
Right?

1311
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,780
Because you've got

1312
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
These snapshots

1313
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,780
You can just spin it up

1314
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
When you need it

1315
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,780
For a little while

1316
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,780
And then shut it down

1317
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
For you

1318
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
To DigitalOcean

1319
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,780
For sponsoring

1320
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
The Linux unplugged program

1321
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,780
DigitalOcean.com

1322
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
Unplugged November

1323
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
When you check out

1324
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,780
I always have like

1325
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Whenever now we're talking

1326
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
About big projects

1327
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Somebody's like

1328
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Oh, I know what we're going to do

1329
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,780
We're going to spin it up

1330
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
On a DigitalOcean droplet

1331
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,780
Is this an excuse

1332
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
To have a droplet?

1333
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
That's like me now

1334
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
It's like I'm ridiculous

1335
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Totally

1336
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,780
Okay, so I'm pretty excited

1337
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
So we've been talking with Charlie

1338
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,780
And Charlie's there

1339
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,780
I'm assuming

1340
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
I'm picturing it right now

1341
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
It's a classroom

1342
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Probably a whiteboard

1343
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,780
And there's like one laptop

1344
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
In the middle

1345
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,780
And like all of these kids

1346
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
And students

1347
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
And teachers

1348
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,780
And I don't know

1349
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
Who else?

1350
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
Maybe Superman

1351
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,780
I don't know

1352
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
Are all sitting around

1353
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
This laptop to talk to us

1354
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
So I thought

1355
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
Charlie told us something

1356
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
That really struck me

1357
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
Like wow

1358
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
This blows my mind

1359
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,780
As a previous school

1360
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
District employee

1361
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,780
Some of the students

1362
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,780
I'm not sure how many

1363
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
Maybe it's all

1364
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,780
Have root access

1365
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
To their boxes

1366
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
And some of the students

1367
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
Are involved in the help desk

1368
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,780
And troubleshooting

1369
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
Like they get tickets

1370
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
They go in there

1371
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
And close tickets

1372
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
And so Charlie

1373
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,780
You could be my eyes

1374
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
And ears

1375
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,780
And hands for me

1376
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
And pick maybe

1377
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,780
A help desk representative

1378
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
I'd love to ask somebody

1379
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,780
I'll start

1380
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,780
Here's the question

1381
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
And then Charlie

1382
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
I'll let you pick the person

1383
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,780
What is a typical

1384
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,780
Help desk call

1385
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,780
For a student IT person?

1386
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
What kind of troubleshooting

1387
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
Do they have to do?

1388
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Sure

1389
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
That's a great question

1390
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
And I'm looking at

1391
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
Four gentlemen

1392
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
That are with me here

1393
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
And I'm going to let

1394
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
One of our

1395
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
Students answer

1396
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
That question for you

1397
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Great

1398
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,780
I'm curious

1399
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,780
Hello

1400
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,780
My name is Taylor

1401
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
Hey Taylor

1402
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,780
Hey Taylor

1403
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,780
How's it going?

1404
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,780
So what kind of questions

1405
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
Are you wondering?

1406
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,780
Well give me like

1407
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
A common problem

1408
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
You run into

1409
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,780
Just usually general things

1410
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,780
Like why isn't this page loading

1411
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
And stuff like that

1412
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,780
Because I mean

1413
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
They're not going to go

1414
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
Too above and beyond

1415
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,780
The normal student population

1416
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,780
You know what I mean?

1417
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Yeah

1418
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Well I wonder

1419
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
Do you ever get people

1420
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
To throw their hands up

1421
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
And say I don't know

1422
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
How this Linux stuff works

1423
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
What's going on here

1424
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
This is Linux

1425
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,780
And I don't get it?

1426
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,780
Actually when we first distributed them

1427
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,780
We ran them all through tutorials

1428
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,780
When the new freshmen come in

1429
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,780
We run them through tutorials

1430
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,780
When a new student enrolls

1431
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,780
Same deal going on

1432
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
And they're welcome to stop by

1433
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
With any questions

1434
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
Or leave a ticket

1435
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,780
If they can't get down here

1436
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,780
That's great

1437
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,780
And do you run Linux

1438
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,780
At home now too

1439
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,780
Or are you running

1440
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,780
Something else at home?

1441
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,780
I used to have my one computer

1442
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
Triple booted

1443
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,780
But yeah

1444
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,780
I got a new drive

1445
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
And it's just running

1446
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:31,780
Mac OS X E70 right now

1447
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
I caught you

1448
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
I caught you

1449
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
It's okay

1450
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
We still love you Taylor

1451
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Oh no

1452
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,780
We won't hold it against you

1453
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
It's okay

1454
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,780
So Taylor

1455
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
When you go out there

1456
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Do you have like

1457
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
Do you get assigned a ticket

1458
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,780
And this is Taylor's ticket

1459
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,780
And you have to resolve it

1460
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,780
And is that tied

1461
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,780
In any kind of curriculum?

1462
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Well it's tied into the course

1463
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,780
It's an honors weighted course

1464
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,780
And the whole ticket system deal

1465
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,780
Is basically everybody

1466
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
That has admin privileges

1467
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
To view the tickets

1468
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
That are open

1469
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
They can assign it to themselves

1470
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,780
Or transfer it to somebody else

1471
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,780
And you just basically answer

1472
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
If you assign it to yourself

1473
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,780
Or you transfer it to somebody else

1474
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,780
If you can't necessarily

1475
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
Figure it out on your own

1476
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
Okay that sounds pretty reasonable

1477
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,780
Sounds like a pretty good system

1478
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Is there ever a time

1479
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
Where you're troubleshooting

1480
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,780
Some of this stuff

1481
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,780
And this is Taylor

1482
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
Or anybody that wants to answer this

1483
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
Is there ever a time

1484
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
When you're troubleshooting

1485
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
This kind of stuff

1486
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
And you think gosh

1487
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,780
If it wasn't Linux

1488
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,780
This would be a lot easier

1489
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,780
Or do you find it sometimes

1490
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Is easier to do some troubleshooting

1491
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Because it is Linux

1492
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,780
Both are things that do come up

1493
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,780
With the wall that you hit

1494
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
When you're trying to find

1495
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,780
Something that would be

1496
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,780
Maybe easier

1497
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,780
There's always alternatives

1498
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,780
Stuff like that

1499
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Play on Linux to run

1500
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,780
Windows applications

1501
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,780
If we need to

1502
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,780
Stuff like that

1503
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,780
That's pretty cool

1504
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,780
So you're getting into

1505
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
Some of the wine stuff too

1506
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
And how has that worked for you?

1507
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,780
The students seem to be

1508
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Pretty pleased with it

1509
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,780
And it basically gets us around

1510
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,780
Obstacles that

1511
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,780
They want to use a certain program

1512
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,780
And it's only supported

1513
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,780
On Windows and Mac

1514
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,780
They download the Windows version

1515
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,780
And then they just open it up in there

1516
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,780
And it does the rest for them

1517
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,780
Yeah, that is kind of a nice thing

1518
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,780
And I wonder if

1519
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,780
And anybody's free to answer this too

1520
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,780
How do you guys manage user logins?

1521
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,780
Because one of the nice things

1522
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,780
About a Windows mobile lab

1523
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,780
Or a Windows lab of computers

1524
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,780
On the desk

1525
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
Or whatever it might be

1526
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
Is it's Windows

1527
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
But you can tie it into a domain

1528
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,780
And it's easy to have one account

1529
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,780
Across all the computers

1530
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,780
And so is there a standard student login?

1531
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Or how are you managing

1532
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,780
All of those user accounts

1533
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,780
On all of these laptops?

1534
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,780
Yeah, actually I'm going to turn that over

1535
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,780
To one of my staff

1536
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,780
To jump in for a moment

1537
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,780
I'll let him introduce himself

1538
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
And take that question

1539
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,780
My name is Chad

1540
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,780
Hey Chad

1541
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,780
So on the actual laptops themselves

1542
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,780
Well as part of the rollout

1543
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,780
Every student kind of just

1544
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:09,780
Resets the local password

1545
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
On the user

1546
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
And then we actually

1547
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,780
Don't even know what they are

1548
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
And then as far as like

1549
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Any services that we provide

1550
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,780
As a district

1551
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,780
We actually have

1552
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,780
Active directory accounts for people

1553
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,780
So we do centrally manage those

1554
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,780
But that doesn't give them access

1555
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
To the laptop

1556
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
It's a separate username and password

1557
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,780
Sure, that makes sense

1558
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,780
And I suppose as long as

1559
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
You have root access

1560
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,780
You could always get in there

1561
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,780
And flip their password

1562
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,780
To something you need

1563
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,780
If you need to log in as them

1564
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,780
Have you ever walked up to a laptop

1565
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,780
And been shocked or surprised

1566
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
By something installed

1567
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
That maybe came from a repo

1568
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
That you didn't expect

1569
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:41,780
Like they didn't have to go out

1570
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,780
And find it on the web

1571
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
They just

1572
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,780
Somebody came down

1573
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,780
They knew Linux

1574
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,780
And they installed stuff

1575
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,780
Or is this

1576
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Is this so different

1577
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,780
Than what people are used to

1578
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,780
That that almost never happens

1579
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,780
I'm looking to the student team

1580
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,780
To answer that

1581
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,780
So I think you get two different

1582
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Two different answers

1583
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
From the staff and the students

1584
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
So Taylor

1585
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,780
Do you want to take that

1586
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Or Nick or somebody

1587
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
Okay Taylor

1588
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
Taylor is going to jump in

1589
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,780
So were you ever surprised

1590
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,780
By anything you saw installed

1591
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,780
Well just aesthetic wise

1592
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,780
I've seen some freaky wallpapers

1593
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,780
For one

1594
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,780
Yeah

1595
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,780
And I've seen one or two students

1596
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,780
That like

1597
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,780
Have actually tried to

1598
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,780
Like reinstall Ubuntu

1599
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,780
Or actually try and install

1600
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,780
Windows itself

1601
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,780
And they just completely

1602
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,780
Messed up everything

1603
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Because of it

1604
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,780
Yeah that doesn't surprise me

1605
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,780
You know I could see them

1606
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
Like well I'll take this home

1607
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,780
And I'll put Windows on

1608
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
So I can play my games

1609
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,780
Or something like that

1610
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,780
And then they mess it all up

1611
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,780
Yeah okay that makes sense

1612
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,780
Okay

1613
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,780
I know you

1614
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,780
I should

1615
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,780
Chris I should add

1616
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,780
Just really quickly again

1617
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,780
We absolutely encourage

1618
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,780
Our students to explore

1619
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,780
And tinker with the machines

1620
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,780
There is an acceptable

1621
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Use policy

1622
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,780
There is a mobile policy

1623
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,780
That our students do sign

1624
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,780
The one thing that we ask

1625
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,780
Them not to do

1626
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,780
Is to reformat

1627
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,780
And reimage the machine

1628
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,780
That's one of the boundaries

1629
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,780
That we put up

1630
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
And there's various reasons

1631
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,780
For that

1632
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,780
You know we have software

1633
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,780
That's installed

1634
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,780
And there are some

1635
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:06,780
Unique mechanisms

1636
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,780
Here at the high school

1637
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:08,780
There's other unique items

1638
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,780
That are specific

1639
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,780
To the high school

1640
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,780
That we need to

1641
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
Make sure are maintained

1642
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,780
On the boxes

1643
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,780
So we do put

1644
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,780
That barrier up

1645
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,780
And that's really more

1646
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,780
Of a functional barrier

1647
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:18,780
Because we do have

1648
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,780
Certain expectations

1649
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,780
Of what's on

1650
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,780
The machine itself

1651
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:22,780
You know also our

1652
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,780
Filtering software

1653
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,780
For example

1654
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,780
You know in a perfect world

1655
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:26,780
We would remove

1656
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:27,780
Those restrictions

1657
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,780
But there's still the

1658
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,780
You know the quote unquote

1659
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,780
Business of education

1660
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,780
That we have to get done

1661
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
Inside the school

1662
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:33,780
Sure that makes sense

1663
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:34,780
That's available

1664
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,780
For learning

1665
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,780
I'm curious

1666
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,780
I'm picturing

1667
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:38,780
My environment

1668
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Right I'm picturing

1669
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,780
A setup like this

1670
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,780
Who drives forward

1671
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,780
It's who comes

1672
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,780
Who pulls everybody together

1673
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,780
And says alright

1674
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,780
It's been a few years

1675
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,780
We deployed

1676
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,780
Zubuntu

1677
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,780
Or whatever

1678
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,780
12.04

1679
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,780
14.04

1680
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,780
Whatever it is

1681
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:54,780
Who's the person

1682
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,780
That now leads

1683
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:56,780
The initiative to say

1684
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,780
We've got to update

1685
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,780
The Linux deployment tool kit

1686
00:45:58,780 --> 00:45:59,780
And we've got to get

1687
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,780
The next version

1688
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,780
Of all of the applications

1689
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,780
And the next version

1690
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,780
Of the operating system

1691
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,780
On all of these laptops

1692
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,780
Who has that initiative

1693
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,780
Is that something

1694
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,780
That's driven from IT

1695
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,780
Is that something that comes

1696
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,780
From the student body

1697
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:11,780
That says look

1698
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,780
We need these things

1699
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,780
How does that work

1700
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:14,780
In this setup

1701
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,780
Yeah in our case

1702
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,780
That's driven by IT

1703
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,780
You know we look at

1704
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,780
We'd like to stay on

1705
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,780
Long term support releases

1706
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,780
You know I mentioned

1707
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,780
In the past

1708
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,780
We actually started

1709
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,780
The elementary level

1710
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,780
With Zubuntu

1711
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,780
On 12.04

1712
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,780
Our current implementation

1713
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,780
Here at the high school

1714
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,780
Is pretty close to stock

1715
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,780
Ubuntu 14.04

1716
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,780
Long term support

1717
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,780
We actually do use Unity

1718
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
But yeah at some point

1719
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,780
We'll look at that

1720
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:39,780
You know my team

1721
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,780
And I will sit down

1722
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:41,780
And decide well

1723
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,780
It's time to you know

1724
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,780
To rev and move up

1725
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:44,780
To the latest long term

1726
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,780
Support release

1727
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,780
We're pretty happy

1728
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,780
With 14.04 right now

1729
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,780
We're not seeing

1730
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,780
Any roadblocks

1731
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,780
But you know likely

1732
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,780
When the next long term

1733
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,780
Support comes out

1734
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:53,780
We'll look at that again

1735
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,780
And build a fresh image

1736
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,780
Now of course

1737
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,780
In the intermediate time

1738
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,780
As there's applications

1739
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,780
That we need

1740
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,780
We'll rev those

1741
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,780
As need be

1742
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,780
We pulled back

1743
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,780
All of the one to one

1744
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,780
Machines this past summer

1745
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,780
And re-imaged them

1746
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,780
Up to 14.04

1747
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
Long term support

1748
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
But again it's really

1749
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,780
Driven by you know

1750
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,780
The OS reps

1751
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,780
You mentioned

1752
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,780
You're running Unity

1753
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,780
What's the reaction

1754
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,780
Been to Unity

1755
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,780
From this

1756
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,780
From the student body

1757
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,780
I think I'm going to

1758
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:17,780
Let the students

1759
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Answer that

1760
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,780
We have two

1761
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Just to give you a sense

1762
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,780
Of who's with us today

1763
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,780
We have two of our current

1764
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:24,780
Help desk students

1765
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,780
Two current students

1766
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,780
Here at Penn Manor

1767
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,780
And I also have

1768
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,780
Three of our Vanguard

1769
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,780
Help desk students

1770
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:31,780
These are three individuals

1771
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,780
That have

1772
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,780
That actually just

1773
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,780
Graduated last year

1774
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,780
So they're here as well

1775
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,780
But I think for the reaction

1776
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,780
To the Unity interface

1777
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,780
Nick would you like

1778
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:39,780
To take that

1779
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,780
Sure

1780
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,780
You want to jump in

1781
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,780
And take

1782
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,780
Hi I'm Nick

1783
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,780
And a lot of the students

1784
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,780
Here actually kind of

1785
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
Do like the laptops

1786
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,780
But some are complaining

1787
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,780
Because they are

1788
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,780
So used to Windows

1789
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,780
Or Mac

1790
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,780
And they can't play

1791
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,780
Their games on here

1792
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:53,780
So they keep coming down

1793
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,780
But it's something that

1794
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,780
We can actually

1795
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,780
Really do without

1796
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,780
Installing a GUI

1797
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,780
Or a different sub

1798
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,780
That they can use

1799
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,780
But overall

1800
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,780
A lot of students

1801
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,780
Do like them

1802
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,780
Because it gives them

1803
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,780
The opportunity to

1804
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,780
Bring the laptop home

1805
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,780
Work on stuff for school

1806
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,780
And then bring it back

1807
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,780
Without having to be back

1808
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,780
A couple of days or weeks

1809
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,780
That makes a lot of sense

1810
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,780
So Charlie I know you have

1811
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,780
Sounds like you have

1812
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,780
A good range of experience

1813
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,780
There

1814
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,780
Here's my question

1815
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,780
You know

1816
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,780
Here you are

1817
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,780
A very large

1818
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,780
What I find fascinating

1819
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,780
About this is

1820
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,780
It's a very large

1821
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,780
Concentrated Linux deployment

1822
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,780
Of similar hardware

1823
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:24,780
With a specific

1824
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,780
Use case in mind

1825
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:26,780
And I'm curious

1826
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,780
And maybe people might

1827
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,780
Ask what is Linux lacking

1828
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,780
That would make

1829
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,780
Your job easier

1830
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,780
What have you gone

1831
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,780
Oh man

1832
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:33,780
If we just had this

1833
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,780
Or if we could just do this

1834
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,780
XYZ would be easier

1835
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,780
Or we could get this

1836
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,780
Better accomplished

1837
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,780
What's been lacking

1838
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,780
For this initiative

1839
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,780
That you've maybe

1840
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,780
Worked around

1841
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,780
It's not insolvable

1842
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,780
But it's maybe

1843
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,780
Not the best case

1844
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,780
Yeah I think

1845
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,780
Four of us kind of

1846
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,780
Jumped up and thought

1847
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,780
The same thing together

1848
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,780
I'm going to introduce you

1849
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,780
To another member

1850
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,780
Of my staff

1851
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,780
Take it away Alex

1852
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,780
Hi my name is Alex

1853
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,780
I will say

1854
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,780
Two things that

1855
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,780
Could be improved

1856
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,780
From the feedback

1857
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,780
From the students

1858
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,780
First is that

1859
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,780
Since the students

1860
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,780
Get to take

1861
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,780
The computers home

1862
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:03,780
They already have

1863
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,780
Equipment at home

1864
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,780
Printers especially

1865
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,780
Different network setups

1866
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,780
And it's the lack of

1867
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,780
Drivers for many

1868
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,780
Devices they run at home

1869
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,780
Sometimes they have to

1870
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,780
Come to us

1871
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,780
And help them

1872
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,780
To install the drivers

1873
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,780
That they can

1874
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,780
Do themselves

1875
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,780
The second one

1876
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,780
Is there's a lack

1877
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:26,780
Of polish on the GUI

1878
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,780
For most of the programs

1879
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,780
And that from students

1880
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,780
That are used to

1881
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,780
Carrying their

1882
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,780
Android phones

1883
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,780
Or iPhones

1884
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,780
The interface

1885
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:37,780
Sells a lot

1886
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,780
That's a really good point

1887
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,780
Yeah they see it

1888
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,780
As a polish thing

1889
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:49,780
That's a good point

1890
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,780
And the drivers

1891
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,780
I could see

1892
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,780
Being an issue

1893
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,780
Actually if you don't mind

1894
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,780
Chris

1895
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:55,780
If you don't mind

1896
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,780
I was looking at

1897
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,780
Some of the other students

1898
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,780
Again current

1899
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
And past students

1900
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,780
Does anybody else

1901
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,780
Want to add to that

1902
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,780
What are their

1903
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,780
Impediments of

1904
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,780
People are shaking their heads

1905
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,780
Any other ideas

1906
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:07,780
The fact that we can't

1907
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,780
Actually print from these

1908
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:09,780
Because we can't

1909
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,780
Drive our support

1910
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,780
For printing

1911
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,780
Yeah that's another

1912
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,780
Road block

1913
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,780
That we bump into

1914
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,780
Although that's not terrible

1915
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,780
I mean it's gotten better

1916
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,780
Over the years I think

1917
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,780
But it's still problematic

1918
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,780
I think you know

1919
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,780
To add to that

1920
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,780
You know we hear a lot

1921
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,780
From students and parents

1922
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,780
You know that

1923
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,780
That just are very unfamiliar

1924
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,780
With Linux

1925
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,780
And they run into

1926
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,780
Road blocks

1927
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,780
When they're trying to

1928
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:29,780
Install their home printers

1929
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,780
And other devices

1930
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,780
So that's pretty common

1931
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:32,780
And have you

1932
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,780
Guys experimented all

1933
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,780
With something like

1934
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,780
Google Cloud Print

1935
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,780
Or something like that

1936
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,780
That sort of normalizes

1937
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,780
The print driver

1938
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,780
Where print rendering

1939
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,780
Is done on a separate box

1940
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,780
Because I mean that's

1941
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
A lot of times

1942
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
How network printing works

1943
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
But Google Cloud Print

1944
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,780
I know you're not big

1945
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,780
On a lot of the Google services

1946
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,780
But Google Cloud Print

1947
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,780
Might resolve the issue

1948
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,780
For home users

1949
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,780
Yeah we haven't really

1950
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,780
Explored that

1951
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,780
But it's not out of the question

1952
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,780
I mean it always could be

1953
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,780
Something we look at

1954
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,780
Down the road

1955
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,780
My team is all kind of

1956
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,780
Collectively nodding heads

1957
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,780
Up and down

1958
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,780
Yeah

1959
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,780
I wonder

1960
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,780
Have you seen

1961
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,780
Or heard of students

1962
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:03,780
Maybe not a lot

1963
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,780
But have you heard

1964
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,780
Of some students

1965
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,780
That were sort of encouraged

1966
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,780
Maybe motivated

1967
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,780
To use Linux

1968
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,780
On their home computer

1969
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:10,780
Yeah actually Nick

1970
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,780
Go ahead

1971
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,780
Jump in

1972
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,780
Last year actually

1973
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,780
When I decided to

1974
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,780
Join this

1975
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,780
My Windows 7 laptop

1976
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,780
Was being corrupted

1977
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,780
And it wasn't working

1978
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,780
So I decided to actually

1979
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,780
Install Linux on here

1980
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,780
And actually worked out

1981
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,780
For the better

1982
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:23,780
I kind of actually prefer

1983
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,780
That over Windows 7

1984
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,780
Right now

1985
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,780
Because it seems to be

1986
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,780
Very unstable

1987
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,780
That's awesome

1988
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
Windows 7 was unstable

1989
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,780
Yeah

1990
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,780
Right yeah

1991
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,780
Yeah

1992
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,780
Well that's

1993
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,780
That's great

1994
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,780
And so

1995
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,780
I want to

1996
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:37,780
We're going to

1997
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,780
We're going to keep

1998
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,780
Pulling ahead here

1999
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,780
On some of

2000
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,780
The rest of the show

2001
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,780
But you guys

2002
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,780
Feel free to jump in

2003
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,780
On any insights you have

2004
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:45,780
On any of the

2005
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:46,780
Rest of the topics

2006
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,780
For today

2007
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,780
I guess

2008
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,780
My final question is

2009
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,780
What's next

2010
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,780
Charlie you mentioned

2011
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
Getting down the rest

2012
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,780
Of the school district

2013
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:54,780
What kind of initiatives

2014
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,780
Are next for this

2015
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,780
Kind of huge project

2016
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,780
Yeah I think in our

2017
00:51:58,780 --> 00:51:59,780
In our immediate future

2018
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,780
We're having discussions

2019
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,780
About expanding our

2020
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,780
One to one program

2021
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
To the middle levels

2022
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,780
Currently

2023
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,780
The only students

2024
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:06,780
That are carrying laptops

2025
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,780
As part of the one to one

2026
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,780
Are in high school

2027
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,780
That's grades 9 through 12

2028
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,780
So we're beginning

2029
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:11,780
These planning stages

2030
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,780
For rolling that out

2031
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,780
To grades 7 and 8

2032
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:14,780
For next year

2033
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,780
You know I think

2034
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,780
You know beyond that

2035
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,780
You know I'm beginning

2036
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,780
To think longer range

2037
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,780
You know what does this

2038
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,780
Look like for an elementary

2039
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,780
Implementation

2040
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,780
You know but that's

2041
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,780
Just the operational

2042
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,780
Side of the house

2043
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,780
I think that you know

2044
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,780
Ideally

2045
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,780
What I look forward to

2046
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,780
Is just watching

2047
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,780
Our teachers and our students

2048
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,780
And the interesting

2049
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,780
Creative uses

2050
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,780
That they have

2051
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,780
For the laptops

2052
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,780
I mean the whole reason

2053
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,780
Is because

2054
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,780
It's a learning initiative

2055
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,780
You know again

2056
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,780
We talk a lot about it

2057
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,780
From the technical perspective

2058
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,780
And it's very interesting

2059
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,780
And you know

2060
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,780
And exciting

2061
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:43,780
But at the same time

2062
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,780
I think the learning

2063
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:45,780
Opportunities for our kids

2064
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,780
I mean that's really

2065
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:47,780
What gets me excited

2066
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,780
And I just can't wait

2067
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,780
To see what neat things

2068
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,780
Our students begin producing

2069
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:51,780
And finding and discovering

2070
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,780
You know everything

2071
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:53,780
From coding

2072
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,780
To painting and drawing

2073
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,780
Applications

2074
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,780
To what they do

2075
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,780
With the 3D programs

2076
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,780
You know I'm just

2077
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,780
Really looking forward

2078
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,780
To what our kids do

2079
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,780
And what they can produce

2080
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,780
And build

2081
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,780
And you know projects

2082
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,780
Yeah absolutely

2083
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,780
And I think it's

2084
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,780
There's also maybe

2085
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,780
Some long term advantages

2086
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,780
On being on

2087
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,780
The Linux ecosystem

2088
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:10,780
Being on

2089
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,780
Getting familiar

2090
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,780
With these interfaces

2091
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,780
These program names

2092
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,780
How they work

2093
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,780
It seems like

2094
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,780
We are rapidly approaching

2095
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:17,780
A time where

2096
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,780
The Raspberry Pi

2097
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,780
And devices like it

2098
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,780
Could become

2099
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,780
Consumerized, productized

2100
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,780
And be very accessible

2101
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:26,780
To low cost deployments

2102
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:27,780
Like a school deployment

2103
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,780
And the best part about that

2104
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,780
In the case of the Raspberry Pi

2105
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,780
Is it's fundamentally

2106
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,780
Different hardware

2107
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,780
Than your desktop PC

2108
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,780
But you can still run

2109
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,780
The same Unity desktop

2110
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,780
The same you know

2111
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,780
Firefox applications

2112
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,780
And LibreOffice

2113
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,780
And all of this stuff

2114
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,780
And the school

2115
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,780
Would in theory

2116
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:42,780
When these devices

2117
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:43,780
Are powerful enough

2118
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:44,780
If they're not already

2119
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,780
Would be able to jump in

2120
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,780
And start deploying those

2121
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:47,780
And the cost savings

2122
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:48,780
Like it just seems like

2123
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,780
It will continue

2124
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,780
To pay off over time

2125
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,780
But I guess here's

2126
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,780
My really last question

2127
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,780
For you Charlie is

2128
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,780
You know down the road

2129
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,780
You win the lottery

2130
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,780
Or a lot of folks

2131
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:57,780
On the IT staff

2132
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,780
Win the lottery

2133
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,780
Change over happens

2134
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,780
Maybe 5, 10 years

2135
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,780
Does this initiative

2136
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,780
Continue on on its own

2137
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,780
Does it have enough momentum

2138
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,780
Or if the stars

2139
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:05,780
That are pushing it

2140
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,780
Sort of fade

2141
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,780
Will the initiative

2142
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,780
Begin to fade

2143
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,780
And that dominant

2144
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,780
Narrative from the parents

2145
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,780
And perhaps new faculty members

2146
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,780
Who come in from

2147
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Other school districts

2148
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,780
Come and say

2149
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,780
Well this isn't Windows

2150
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,780
Where is Office

2151
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,780
Windows 10 just came out

2152
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,780
It's amazing

2153
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,780
You know these kinds of

2154
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,780
These kinds of

2155
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,780
Will always be

2156
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,780
Outside external pressures

2157
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,780
That are always constantly

2158
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,780
When new eyes come in

2159
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,780
Reassessing your project

2160
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,780
Reassessing what you're

2161
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,780
Doing here

2162
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,780
Constantly questioning it

2163
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,780
And I wonder

2164
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,780
Is this something

2165
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,780
That can hold up

2166
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:32,780
To scrutiny long term

2167
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,780
Say if some of the

2168
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,780
Key drivers behind it

2169
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,780
Were to go away

2170
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:36,780
Yeah I think

2171
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,780
I think it can

2172
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,780
And I think a large reason

2173
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,780
Or really to that point

2174
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,780
We've been building

2175
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,780
To this point

2176
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:43,780
This isn't just something

2177
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,780
That we woke up one day

2178
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,780
And we decided

2179
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,780
Hey we're going to roll out

2180
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,780
Not only A a one to one

2181
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,780
But also B we're going to

2182
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,780
Do it on Linux

2183
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,780
You know we've been

2184
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:51,780
Building on experiences

2185
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,780
And successes

2186
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,780
For well over a decade

2187
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,780
You know we started

2188
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:56,780
Again with

2189
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,780
With a huge deployment

2190
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,780
Of well actually

2191
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,780
Started small

2192
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,780
But built up a huge

2193
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,780
You know a huge infrastructure

2194
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,780
Based around open source

2195
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,780
And Linux

2196
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,780
And demonstrated that

2197
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,780
It's not only the cost savings

2198
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,780
But it can work

2199
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,780
And that open source

2200
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:09,780
Works well

2201
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,780
In an enterprise environment

2202
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,780
In schools

2203
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,780
So I think that you know

2204
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,780
Culturally it's

2205
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,780
It's really been

2206
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,780
Threaded into our DNA

2207
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,780
And into our philosophy

2208
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,780
Here at Penn Manor

2209
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,780
At this school

2210
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
And I really don't see that

2211
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,780
Unraveling any time soon

2212
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,780
Because we've demonstrated

2213
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,780
That it's a fantastic

2214
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,780
Learning model

2215
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,780
Model for education

2216
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,780
And one that saves

2217
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,780
A truckload of money

2218
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,780
You know now

2219
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,780
Who knows down the future

2220
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,780
I mean we would be remiss

2221
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,780
If we were not constantly

2222
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,780
Re-evaluating technology

2223
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,780
Both open source

2224
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,780
And proprietary

2225
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,780
My team and I

2226
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,780
Have a fundamental belief

2227
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,780
And we

2228
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,780
Our fundamental philosophy

2229
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,780
Is obviously you know

2230
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,780
Turn toward open source

2231
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,780
But we continue to evaluate

2232
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,780
And see if there are

2233
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,780
Better solutions

2234
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,780
And at this point

2235
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,780
I don't see anything

2236
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,780
In the near to long term

2237
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,780
Future that is better

2238
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,780
Than a full open source

2239
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,780
Implementation for us

2240
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,780
From an operational

2241
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:55,780
And more importantly

2242
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:56,780
An educational perspective

2243
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,780
Right that makes

2244
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,780
No sense

2245
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,780
I mean it

2246
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,780
Fundamentally at the end

2247
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,780
Of the day

2248
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,780
Is the best tool

2249
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,780
For the job

2250
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:04,780
It's not just one thing

2251
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,780
There's a lot of

2252
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:06,780
Aspects to it

2253
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,780
Well that's

2254
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,780
That's great to hear

2255
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,780
And Charlie I've heard

2256
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,780
From you know

2257
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
A lot of people think

2258
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:12,780
This is a great initiative

2259
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:13,780
So major compliments

2260
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,780
To the whole team over there

2261
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,780
All the students

2262
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,780
And everybody

2263
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:18,780
It's really awesome

2264
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,780
And it's I don't know

2265
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,780
To be honest

2266
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,780
It's sort of

2267
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,780
It's brought back

2268
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,780
My optimism about it

2269
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,780
Because it's something

2270
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780
I'd seen fade away

2271
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
So it's really good

2272
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,780
It's people motivated

2273
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:28,780
To get into technology

2274
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,780
So everyone over there

2275
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,780
Please continue to huddle

2276
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,780
Around the laptop

2277
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,780
And join us for the remainder

2278
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,780
Of the show

2279
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,780
And feel free to jump in

2280
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,780
Just flag us

2281
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,780
If you want to say something

2282
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:38,780
Because I'd love to hear

2283
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,780
Your insights on any

2284
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,780
Of this stuff

2285
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,780
So if somebody has something

2286
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:42,780
They want to contribute

2287
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,780
Just raise your hand

2288
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,780
And I'll have Charlie ping me

2289
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,780
So before we get into

2290
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,780
Our next topic

2291
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,780
Which is I'm really

2292
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,780
I think I'm really happy

2293
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:52,780
With the way our chat

2294
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,780
With Mark Shalloworth turned out

2295
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,780
I recorded it yesterday

2296
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,780
On Monday at 10 a.m.

2297
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:57,780
I did it off air

2298
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,780
Because I wanted to ask him

2299
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,780
A few things that I wanted him

2300
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,780
To feel comfortable

2301
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:01,780
Not having a live audience

2302
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,780
Answering them

2303
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,780
Because I wanted to go

2304
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:04,780
A little bit deeper

2305
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,780
Than the typical

2306
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,780
Mark Shalloworth interview goes

2307
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,780
And I called him out

2308
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,780
On a couple of things

2309
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,780
That I think are misconceptions

2310
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,780
And he did a really good job

2311
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,780
Of addressing them

2312
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,780
So I really encourage you

2313
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,780
To tune into Sundays

2314
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,780
The upcoming Linux action show

2315
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,780
Because we covered some ground

2316
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:19,780
That I think a lot of interviews

2317
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,780
Have danced around

2318
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:21,780
But nobody's asked Mark

2319
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,780
Some of the direct questions

2320
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,780
The preview I'm going to play

2321
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,780
In today's show

2322
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:26,780
Is Mark's thoughts

2323
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,780
In light of

2324
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,780
The Debian community upsets

2325
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,780
So this is very pertinent

2326
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,780
To the discussions

2327
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,780
We've had on this show

2328
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,780
And I think it actually

2329
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,780
Would be pertinent

2330
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,780
For some of the students

2331
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,780
That are listening right now

2332
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,780
On how conflict resolution

2333
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,780
Has to kind of work

2334
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,780
In the open source community

2335
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,780
Before we get to that, though

2336
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,780
I want to thank our next sponsor

2337
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,780
And that's Linux Academy

2338
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,780
This is a great opportunity

2339
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,780
For you to go

2340
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,780
Bring your skill level up

2341
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,780
A little bit

2342
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:50,780
And have something

2343
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,780
On that resume

2344
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,780
You know, we had an email earlier

2345
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,780
Asking about something

2346
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,780
That Jesse, I believe it was

2347
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,780
That wanted to go out

2348
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,780
And try to get something

2349
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,780
On the resume

2350
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,780
Try to put something

2351
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,780
On the books to show

2352
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,780
That he's been expanding

2353
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:02,780
His skill set

2354
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,780
And that the unemployment time

2355
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,780
Has been well spent

2356
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,780
Well, Linux Academy

2357
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,780

2358
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,780

And it's done by people

2386
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,780
Who truly know

2387
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,780
The subject matter

2388
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:37,780
They're not generalists

2389
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,780
They're experts

2390
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,780
They're expert trainers

2391
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,780
They're programmers

2392
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,780
It's really

2393
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,780

00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,780
The market's been waiting for

2395
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,780
And I think that's why

2396
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,780
They're seeing so much success

2397
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,780

To get started

2401

You have

2402
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,780
A lot of free guides

2403
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,780
You can read them offline

2404
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,780
A lot of the stuff

You can listen in the car

2408
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,780
And continue to learn

2409
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:58,780
You know, after you're done

2410
00:58:58,780 --> 00:58:59,780
With your JV content, of course

2411
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,780
And labs come

2412
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,780
With their own servers

2413
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:02,780
Just that alone

2414
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:03,780
Is amazing

2415
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:04,780
You get to a point

2416
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,780
In the courseware

2417
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:06,780
Where you need to

2418
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,780
Actually implement something

2419
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,780
They spin up a VM

2420
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,780
For you

2421
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,780
Give you a public IP address

2422
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,780
Give you logins

2423
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:12,780
You can assign roles

2424
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,780
You can work in teams

2425
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,780
It's so cool

2426
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,780
And they do it automatically

2427
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:16,780
From any seven

2428
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,780
Of the

2429
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,780
Or more now

2430
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,780
Of the Linux distributions

2431
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,780
And when you choose

2432
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,780
Those Linux distributions

2433
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,780
All of the courseware

2434
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,780
Automatically adjusts

2435
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,780
To match that distro

2436
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,780
So if you're moving

2437
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,780
Between distros

2438
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,780
Or curious how

2439
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,780
The other side lives

2440
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:29,780
It's a great way

2441
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:30,780
To do this

2442
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:31,780
They have some great

2443
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:32,780
OpenStack courses

2444
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:33,780
They have great

2445
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,780
Puppet courses

2446
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:35,780
All of it

2447
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,780
Just go over there

2448
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,780
And learn a little something

2449
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,780
I hear from folks

2450
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,780
All the time

2451
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,780
They've gone over there

2452
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,780
And said, jeez

2453
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,780
I had no idea

2454
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,780
How much content was available

2455
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,780
I've heard you mention

2456
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,780
Some of them

2457
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,780
But I had no idea

2458
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:47,780
The sheer amount

2459
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,780
You could spend years

2460
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,780
On the internet

2461
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:50,780
And I need to enter

2462
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,780
In my gnome password

Of their courseware

2469
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,780
The reason I mentioned Puppet

2470
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,780
Is because they just

2471
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,780
Refreshed the Puppet stuff

2472
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:01,780
And I think if you've got

2473
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:02,780
More than a couple of servers

2474
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,780
Now

2475
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,780
Or more than a couple of VPSs

2476
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
This might be something

2477
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,780
That's worth looking into

2478
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:07,780
Maybe you want to

2479
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,780
Dip your toe into

2480
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,780
Android development

2481
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:10,780
Or OpenStack

2482
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,780
Maybe you're one of those

2483
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:12,780
Quote, unquote, DevOps

2484
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,780
People all of a sudden

2485
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,780
Did you just find yourself out

2486
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,780
Did you just find out

2487
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,780
Your DevOps

2488
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,780
Because I think people

2489
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,780
Will learn

2490
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:19,780
Oh wait, this is kind of

2491
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,780
A DevOps position

2492
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,780
Maybe there's more

2493
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,780
I need to learn

2494
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,780
Go over there right now

2495
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,780
Try it out

2496
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,780
And they also have

2497
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:26,780
Scenario-based training

2498
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:27,780
So that way you'll actually

2499
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:28,780
Implement everything from

2500
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:29,780
Setting up the web server

2501
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,780
Configuring the security

2502
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,780
Getting the CDN caching

2503
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,780
Deploying to the website

2504
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:33,780
All of it

2505
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,780
It's scenario-based training

2506
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:35,780
So when you walk away

2507
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,780
From the course

2508
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,780
You've already done the work

2509
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,780
It's not

2510
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:41,780
When you go to do it

2511
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,780
In a live production environment

2512
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,780
It won't be the first time

2513
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,780
You've ever done it

2514
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:45,780
That kind of confidence

2515
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,780
Is invaluable

2516
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,780
They've got in-depth resources

2517
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,780
Over at Linux Academy

2518
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,780
They've got live Q&A streams

2519
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:51,780
They've got a community

2520
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:52,780
That can help you get going

2521
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,780
If you stall out a little bit

2522
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,780
If you've got to move into AWS

2523
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,780
Go take some of their courses first

2524
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,780
If you're managing a PHP server

2525
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,780
Go take some of their courses

2526
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:03,780
The list goes, Git

2527
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,780
If you've heard us talk about Git

2528
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:06,780
And you have no idea

2529
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:07,780
What it is or how it works

2530
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,780
Or you kind of have a rough idea

2531
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,780
But you've never actually used it

2532
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:10,780
In a practical use case

2533
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:11,780
They've got a course on it

2534
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,780
You want to start doing

2535
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,780
Your backups with rsync

2536
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,780
They've got a course on it

2537
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

2538
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

2539
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,780
Go check them out

2540
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,780
I'm telling you

2541
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,780
Game changer

2542
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:24,780
It's a game changer

2543
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,780
Because it's the difference

2544
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,780
Between when you hear

2545
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,780
Your general technologist

2546
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,780
Talk about open source and Linux

2547
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:32,780
And they just butcher it

2548
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:33,780
And when you hear

2549
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,780
Linux users talk about Linux stuff

2550
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,780
It's that kind of difference

2551
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:37,780
Because it's by the people

2552
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:38,780
That know the material

2553
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,780
Through and through

2554
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

2555
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:43,780
Go check it

2556
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,780
It's just

2557
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,780
You know what I've noticed?

2558
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,780
All three of the sponsors

2559
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,780
In this show

2560
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,780
Have the best dashboards

2561
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,780
In the industry

2562
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,780
When you log into Linux Academy

2563
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,780
All of the courseware is broken out

2564
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,780
How long it's going to take

2565
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:56,780
And don't even get me started

2566
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,780
On their learning plans

2567
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,780
Because the learning plans

2568
01:01:58,780 --> 01:01:59,780
You just tell them

2569
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,780
Hey, I've got this much time this week

2570
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,780
And it automatically generates

2571
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,780
Custom courseware

2572
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,780
For that availability

2573
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,780
How slick is that?

2574
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,780
It's the best of breed of technology

2575
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,780
With the best kind of backing

2576
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

2577
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,780
Go become part of that vibrant community

2578
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:17,780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

2579
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,780
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

2580
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,780
For sponsoring the unplugged program

2581
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,780
Love it so hard

2582
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:24,780
All right

2583
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,780
Before we jump in

2584
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,780
If anybody has anything

2585
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,780
They want to mention

2586
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,780
Feel free

2587
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:29,780
Otherwise I'm going to play

2588
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:30,780
A little bit of the

2589
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:31,780
Mark Shelworth interview

2590
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:32,780
We're doing a little bit

2591
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:33,780
Of a tight show today

2592
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,780
Because after the show

2593
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:35,780
If you're listening live

2594
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,780
Stick around

2595
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:37,780
We're going to go through

2596
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,780
And try to find out

2597
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,780
The best moments

2598
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,780
For 2014

2599
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:41,780
My hope is

2600
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:42,780
If we get that done

2601
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:43,780
And I think we can

2602
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,780
We've got a good showing today

2603
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,780
And I'll also

2604
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:46,780
Put the link in the show notes

2605
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:47,780
So if you're listening

2606
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,780
Afterwards on the download

2607
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,780
But there's a moment

2608
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:50,780
You think might be good

2609
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:51,780
For the best of

2610
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,780
I will have a link

2611
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,780
To the form in the show notes

2612
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,780
It just has a few questions

2613
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,780
You can fill them out

2614
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:56,780
And I would really

2615
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:57,780
Appreciate the help

2616
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,780
You don't actually

2617
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,780
Have to be here live

2618
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,780
I feel like it's more productive

2619
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,780
If we're all here live

2620
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,780
Collaborating at the same time

2621
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,780
We'll get a good chunk

2622
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,780
Of it done

2623
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:05,780
But I have the sense

2624
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,780
That we should give

2625
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,780
The download audience

2626
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:08,780
A chance to chime in as well

2627
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,780
To the show notes

2628
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:10,780
If there was a best moment

2629
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:11,780
In Jupiter Broadcasting's

2630
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,780
2014 run

2631
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:13,780
Help us fill that out

2632
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,780
My goal is

2633
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:15,780
If we get it all pulled off

2634
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:16,780
We get all the moments noted

2635
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,780
Which is the hardest part

2636
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:18,780
Of a best of

2637
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:19,780
Best ofs you'd think

2638
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:20,780
Are less work

2639
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,780
Because you don't have to

2640
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,780
Show up and do a show

2641
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,780
But it is way more work

2642
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,780
Than doing an actual show

2643
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,780
Going through

2644
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:26,780
Especially when you have

2645
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:27,780
As big of a back catalog

2646
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,780
As we do

2647
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,780
So it's a lot of help

2648
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:30,780
If you have a moment

2649
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,780
In your recent memory

2650
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,780
And you want to go

2651
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,780
Let us know about it

2652
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,780
I'll have a link

2653
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,780
In the show notes

2654
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,780
I'd really appreciate it

2655
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,780
But we're going to do it

2656
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,780
And all right

2657
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,780
So let me shift gears

2658
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:40,780
Let me shift over

2659
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,780
To the Mark Shuttleworth interview

2660
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,780
I was talking to Mark

2661
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,780
About a lot of things

2662
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,780
And I wanted to get his take

2663
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,780
On essentially if the tone

2664
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:50,780
Of conversation

2665
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,780
Has been getting

2666
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:52,780
More and more hostile

2667
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:53,780
And why is that?

2668
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:54,780
Why is the tone

2669
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,780
As bad as it is?

2670
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,780
And what can we do?

2671
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:57,780
These are a couple of questions

2672
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:58,780
That I started to ask Mark

2673
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,780
And he jumped in with

2674
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,780
I thought some pretty good

2675
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,780
Commentary on the topic

2676
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,780
So here's just a couple

2677
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,780
Of minute pull out

2678
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:05,780
From the whole interview

2679
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,780
Which we'll have

2680
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,780
In Sunday's

2681
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,780
Linux action show

2682
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,780
Just tell people

2683
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,780
To stop

2684
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,780
And ask them

2685
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:12,780
Why they're involved

2686
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,780
And what they're involved in

2687
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:14,780
Right?

2688
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:15,780
If you're just here

2689
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,780
To be a talking head

2690
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:17,780
Then

2691
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,780
And you're just going to

2692
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:21,780
Bring opinions

2693
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,780
To the table

2694
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,780
Then you need to

2695
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,780
Back off

2696
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,780
Because we're trying

2697
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,780
To get stuff done here

2698
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:27,780
Do you think it's the result

2699
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,780
Of the size of the communities

2700
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,780
Now that there's

2701
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:30,780
Now there's just

2702
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:31,780
So many people involved

2703
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,780
That there's just not as many

2704
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,780
People actually producing code?

2705
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:34,780
Well, no

2706
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,780
I think it's

2707
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:36,780
I think it's more

2708
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,780
Got to do with the fact

2709
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:38,780
That it's so easy

2710
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,780
To contribute an opinion

2711
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:40,780
Because of

2712
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,780
Because of the evolution

2713
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,780
Of sort of

2714
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,780
The social thing

2715
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:44,780
Right, right

2716
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,780
So it used to be

2717
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:46,780
That if you wanted

2718
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:47,780
To have an opinion

2719
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:48,780
On how Debian did something

2720
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,780
You needed to show up

2721
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,780
You needed to become

2722
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,780
A Debian developer

2723
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,780
You needed to go through

2724
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:53,780
A process that essentially

2725
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,780
Gave you a sophisticated understanding

2726
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,780
Of how all the parts

2727
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:57,780
Fit together

2728
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,780
And who's contributing what

2729
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,780
And who's responsible for what

2730
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,780
And get a sense

2731
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:01,780
Of the culture

2732
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:02,780
Because now you can just

2733
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:03,780
You can just throw comments

2734
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,780
At LWN

2735
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,780
On Slashdot

2736
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:06,780
Or somewhere else

2737
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:07,780
Right

2738
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:08,780
So I think that's

2739
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:09,780
The real issue

2740
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:10,780
And it's the same thing

2741
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:11,780
With Gamergate

2742
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,780
Right

2743
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:13,780
It's this

2744
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:14,780
It's that

2745
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,780
In a sense

2746
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,780
It's so cheap

2747
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,780
Just to throw another opinion

2748
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:18,780
On the fire

2749
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,780
And in some ways

2750
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:20,780
It's rewarding

2751
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:21,780
To put out an opinion

2752
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,780
That's somehow polarized

2753
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:23,780
And so as a result

2754
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,780
We get a lot of

2755
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:25,780
Polarizing opinions

2756
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,780
It's not

2757
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,780
Not surprising

2758
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:28,780
Right

2759
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:29,780
But I do think

2760
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,780
We have to

2761
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:31,780
We have to be willing

2762
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,780
To defend our communities

2763
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:33,780
For it

2764
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:34,780
And continue to invest

2765
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,780
In building a clear

2766
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:36,780
Constructive conversation

2767
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:37,780
For people

2768
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,780
Who want to

2769
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:39,780
Get stuff done

2770
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,780
And that's why

2771
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,780
We

2772
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:42,780
I think

2773
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:43,780
Continue to

2774
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,780
To just

2775
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:45,780
You know

2776
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:46,780
Steamroller forward

2777
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,780
Not just with Unity

2778
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:48,780
And Ubuntu

2779
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,780
But actually across

2780
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,780
Huge tracts

2781
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:51,780
Of

2782
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,780
Free software

2783
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:53,780
Right

2784
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:54,780
Because people feel

2785
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,780
They can come there

2786
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,780
Be part of that conversation

2787
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,780
And get stuff done

2788
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:58,780
Yeah

2789
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,780
We have an incredible

2790
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:00,780
Community council

2791
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:01,780
That are very thoughtful

2792
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,780
And supportive

2793
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,780
And also

2794
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,780
You know

2795
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:05,780
We

2796
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:06,780
We don't fool ourselves

2797
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:07,780
That you can have a technical

2798
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:08,780
Meritocratic decision

2799
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:09,780
By 500 people

2800
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:10,780
Right

2801
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:11,780
You take a decision

2802
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:12,780
As to the three people

2803
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,780
Who need to make a decision

2804
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:14,780
And then

2805
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:15,780
Yeah

2806
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:16,780
They get on

2807
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:17,780
And do it

2808
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:18,780
Right

2809
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,780
Right

2810
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:20,780
So what do you think guys?

2811
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,780
I'll start

2812
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:22,780
Let's start at the bottom there

2813
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,780
Wimpy

2814
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,780
Is it just

2815
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,780
Is it that comments

2816
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:26,780
Are cheap

2817
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:27,780
And that anybody

2818
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:28,780
Can have an opinion

2819
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,780
And that's what's moved

2820
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,780
The tone forward

2821
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,780
Or is it

2822
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,780
The beliefs

2823
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,780
Of how technology

2824
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,780
Should be implemented

2825
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,780
And it's really coming down

2826
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,780
To more of a

2827
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:37,780
Philosophical difference?

2828
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:38,780
What

2829
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:39,780
What do you

2830
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,780
What's your sense of it

2831
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,780
Wimpy?

2832
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,780
I think that it's

2833
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:43,780
The first thing

2834
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:44,780
I think that it is

2835
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,780
Far too easy

2836
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:46,780
For people

2837
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:47,780
To contribute

2838
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:48,780
Comments

2839
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:49,780
To a wide

2840
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:50,780
Audience

2841
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:51,780
That don't

2842
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:52,780
Necessarily

2843
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,780
Understand all

2844
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:54,780
Of the technical merits

2845
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,780
Of the discussion

2846
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,780
And repeat

2847
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,780
Sound bites

2848
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,780
And clips

2849
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,780
That they've picked up

2850
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,780
From

2851
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,780
Other places

2852
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:02,780
Elsewhere

2853
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:03,780
It's

2854
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,780
It's

2855
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:05,780
So it's sort of like

2856
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:06,780
Opinions

2857
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:07,780
Are

2858
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,780
Sort of like

2859
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,780
A dime a dozen

2860
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:10,780
Everybody's got one

2861
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,780
I want to ask

2862
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,780
But sometimes

2863
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,780
Sometimes not their own

2864
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:14,780
They're

2865
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,780
They're repackaging

2866
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,780
Other people's opinions

2867
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,780
Not necessarily

2868
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:18,780
Technically accurate

2869
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,780
Opinions

2870
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,780
And passing them off

2871
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:21,780
As their own

2872
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,780
Boy

2873
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,780
You see that in political debates

2874
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,780
All the time

2875
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,780
Right?

2876
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,780
Yeah

2877
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,780
And you've

2878
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,780
And you've identified

2879
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:29,780
A few

2880
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,780
Problems with the quality

2881
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,780
Of this

2882
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:32,780
Of you know

2883
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:33,780
Pinging backwards and forwards

2884
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:34,780
And citing each other

2885
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,780
Over

2886
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,780
System D

2887
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,780
Rotten Corpse

2888
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,780
Do you have the sense though

2889
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,780
That

2890
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,780
Some of it is also

2891
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,780
That maybe there's

2892
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:42,780
Less technically savvy people

2893
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:43,780
Involved now

2894
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,780
And they're not understanding

2895
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,780
The nuances

2896
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,780
Of the discussion?

2897
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,780
Well that

2898
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,780
That goes with the

2899
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,780
Repackaging as well

2900
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:50,780
But the problem is that

2901
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:51,780
The

2902
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,780
The people who

2903
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:53,780
Are

2904
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:54,780
Providing those

2905
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,780
Repackaging

2906
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,780
Opinions

2907
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,780
They don't know

2908
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,780
As well

2909
01:07:58,780 --> 01:07:59,780
So there's a lot of people

2910
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,780
Who are talking about

2911
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,780
They don't understand

2912
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,780
The

2913
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,780
The topic

2914
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:04,780
The technical part of the topic

2915
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,780
But then they're acting like

2916
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:06,780
They do

2917
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:07,780
And then spreading more

2918
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:08,780
Misinformation that is

2919
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,780
Then spread again

2920
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:10,780
And it just

2921
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:11,780
You know

2922
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,780
It just

2923
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:13,780
Rolls

2924
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,780
Keeps rolling on

2925
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:15,780
Becomes bigger and bigger

2926
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,780
Web wizard

2927
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:17,780
Break it down for me

2928
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:18,780
You say

2929
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:19,780
You would argue

2930
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:20,780
One is because of the other

2931
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:21,780
What do you mean?

2932
01:08:21,780 --> 01:08:22,780
So basically

2933
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:23,780
When you go in

2934
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:24,780
You look at this

2935
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,780
And you say

2936
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:26,780
Look at these

2937
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:27,780
These opinions

2938
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:28,780
Are that way

2939
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,780
And then there's these arguments

2940
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:30,780
And then we have to argue it out

2941
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:31,780
Between

2942
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:32,780
You know

2943
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:33,780
500 people

2944
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:34,780
3 people

2945
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:35,780
Whatever

2946
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:36,780
It's

2947
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:37,780
It comes down to

2948
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,780
Well

2949
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:39,780
I'm arguing this

2950
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:40,780
Because of this reason

2951
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:41,780
And

2952
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:42,780
I know my reason is right

2953
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:43,780
There's nothing that makes it wrong

2954
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:44,780
So therefore

2955
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:45,780
You must be wrong

2956
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:46,780
And the other person

2957
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:47,780
Has nothing wrong

2958
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,780
With their argument either

2959
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:49,780
But they're thinking

2960
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:50,780
The exact same thing

2961
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,780
There's nothing wrong

2962
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:52,780
With my argument

2963
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:53,780
You must be wrong

2964
01:08:53,780 --> 01:08:54,780
And this is

2965
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:55,780
And then you go

2966
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:56,780
And you have each other

2967
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,780
And you're both insistent

2968
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,780
That the other is wrong

2969
01:08:58,780 --> 01:08:59,780
Because there's nothing wrong

2970
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:00,780
With my argument

2971
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:01,780
Urban

2972
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,780
Do you feel like

2973
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,780
People have to pass a test

2974
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,780
Before they can give

2975
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,780
Their opinions online

2976
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,780
On technical issues?

2977
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:07,780
Like a technical

2978
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:08,780
Qualifications test?

2979
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:09,780
No

2980
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,780
I'm not that far

2981
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,780
But I think that

2982
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,780
People should give

2983
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:13,780
And need to give

2984
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,780
Their opinions

2985
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:15,780
But only if they know

2986
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,780
What they're talking about

2987
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:17,780
If they don't have

2988
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:18,780
A technical background

2989
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:19,780
To

2990
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:20,780
To say about

2991
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:21,780
Any systems

2992
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:22,780
They should

2993
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:23,780
Shut up

2994
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:24,780
About system D

2995
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:25,780
I think everybody

2996
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,780
Thinks they know

2997
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,780
What they're talking about

2998
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:28,780
Right?

2999
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,780
That's part of the problem

3000
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,780
Because everybody thinks

3001
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,780
They've got it figured out

3002
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,780
All right, Lionhead

3003
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,780
I want to ask you a question

3004
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,780
You and I

3005
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,780
We sit here almost

3006
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,780
Every morning

3007
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,780
On Tech Talk today

3008
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:39,780
And we talk about

3009
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,780
Technology news

3010
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:41,780
We are one of these

3011
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:42,780
Commentators that

3012
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:43,780
Mark is talking about

3013
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,780
Are we, Lionhead

3014
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,780
You and I

3015
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:46,780
Part of the problem?

3016
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:47,780
No

3017
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,780
I don't really think so

3018
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:49,780
Because

3019
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:50,780
At least for myself

3020
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:51,780
I know my limitations

3021
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:52,780
And I try to

3022
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,780
Angle my point of view

3023
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:58,780
From what I actually do know

3024
01:09:58,780 --> 01:09:59,780
And if I don't know something

3025
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:00,780
I completely acknowledge that

3026
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,780
Yeah, so

3027
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,780
There is that kind of

3028
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:03,780
View as well

3029
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:04,780
Know your own limits

3030
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:05,780
Kind of thing

3031
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:06,780
Before you jump in

3032
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:07,780
Yeah

3033
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,780
That's a good point

3034
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,780
You know

3035
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:10,780
And something else

3036
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:11,780
Mark says in the interview

3037
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,780
Is that

3038
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:13,780
Part of it is

3039
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,780
Human psychology

3040
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,780
It can be kind of satisfying

3041
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:16,780
To go online

3042
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:17,780
And drop a big wisdom bomb

3043
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:18,780
When everybody knows

3044
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:19,780
What they're talking about

3045
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,780
Right?

3046
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,780
Yeah

3047
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:22,780
Yeah

3048
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,780
And drop a big wisdom bomb

3049
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:24,780
When everybody

3050
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:25,780
Be like

3051
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,780
Boom, here's my point

3052
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:27,780
Look at me

3053
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:28,780
I thought of this

3054
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:29,780
You know

3055
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:30,780
And it's sort of a

3056
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,780
Satisfying kind of feeling

3057
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:32,780
A sensation for some people

3058
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,780
And so it's a little

3059
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,780
Human nature to do it too

3060
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:35,780
To jump in on something

3061
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:36,780
We all care about

3062
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:37,780
And also

3063
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:38,780
The thing about the

3064
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:39,780
The three people

3065
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:40,780
Versus 500 people

3066
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:41,780
Is not the argument

3067
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:42,780
Of opinion versus opinion

3068
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:43,780
It's more of the argument

3069
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,780
That three people

3070
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:45,780
Having a discussion

3071
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:46,780
Is a lot easier to compromise

3072
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:47,780
Than 500 people

3073
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:48,780
You know

3074
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,780
Let's ask Charlie a question

3075
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,780
I'm always extremely curious

3076
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,780
How much of all

3077
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:53,780
Of the inner turmoil

3078
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,780
And drama

3079
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:55,780
Inside these open source

3080
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,780
Projects

3081
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:57,780
Actually leaks out

3082
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:58,780
Into real world

3083
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,780
So Charlie

3084
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:00,780
When you're talking about

3085
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:01,780
Linux and open source

3086
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:02,780
And people developing software

3087
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:03,780
All over the world

3088
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:04,780
Do you also say

3089
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:05,780
And by the way

3090
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,780
They fight a lot

3091
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:07,780
Is there a disclaimer?

3092
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,780
Do you say

3093
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:09,780
Sometimes it's treacherous?

3094
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,780
What's that look like?

3095
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:11,780
How do you prepare people

3096
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:12,780
That might be looking

3097
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,780
Into the open source world

3098
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,780
For the first time?

3099
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,780
Or does it

3100
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,780
Not even come up?

3101
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:17,780
Well I think

3102
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,780
I think it's a huge concern

3103
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:19,780
Actually

3104
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,780
I think part of my role

3105
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:21,780
As an IT leader

3106
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,780
For the district

3107
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,780
For our organization

3108
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,780
Is to

3109
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,780
Well first off

3110
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:26,780
I keep up with this

3111
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:27,780
As much as I can

3112
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:28,780
Again I'm not a developer

3113
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,780
So some of the finer points

3114
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:30,780
You know escape me

3115
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,780
But

3116
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,780
I think what's key

3117
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:33,780
Is that from my

3118
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,780
Perspective

3119
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,780
I need to

3120
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:36,780
Have at least

3121
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:37,780
A finger in the pulse

3122
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:38,780
So I can get a sense

3123
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:39,780
As to whether or not

3124
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:40,780
Projects are going to

3125
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,780
Live or die

3126
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:42,780
Sure

3127
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,780
You know for us again

3128
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,780
Everything that we do

3129
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:45,780
I think about

3130
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:46,780
From the enterprise

3131
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:47,780
Perspective

3132
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:48,780
You know so not just

3133
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:49,780
The immediate

3134
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:50,780
People that support this

3135
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,780
You know over

3136
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,780
Three five

3137
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:53,780
Maybe even ten years

3138
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:54,780
So you know I think

3139
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,780
That the infighting

3140
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,780
On a lot of projects

3141
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:57,780
It does certainly

3142
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,780
Concern me because

3143
01:11:58,780 --> 01:11:59,780
You know again

3144
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:00,780
I've seen many

3145
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,780
You know many projects

3146
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:03,780
That you know were

3147
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:04,780
Potentially killed

3148
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:05,780
Or strangled by

3149
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,780
You know a community

3150
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:07,780
That just sometimes

3151
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,780
Can't get their act together

3152
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,780
Now I don't

3153
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:11,780
That's not an indictment

3154
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,780
You know I think that's also

3155
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,780
A tremendous strength

3156
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:15,780
Of open source

3157
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,780
And developing software

3158
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:17,780
In the open

3159
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:18,780
You know so again

3160
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,780
From my perspective

3161
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:20,780
It's a big concern

3162
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,780
I think what it doesn't do

3163
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,780
Is it doesn't necessarily

3164
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,780
Help you know schools

3165
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,780
That you know by nature

3166
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,780
Are not technical

3167
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:28,780
You know they're looking

3168
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:29,780
For fast easy simple

3169
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:30,780
Fantastic educational solutions

3170
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,780
So the minutia

3171
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,780
Of technical arguments

3172
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:34,780
You know it doesn't

3173
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:37,780
Really help the conversation

3174
01:12:37,780 --> 01:12:38,780
So I don't know if that's

3175
01:12:38,780 --> 01:12:39,780
What you're looking for

3176
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,780
In terms of that question

3177
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:41,780
But that's my perspective on it

3178
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:42,780
I didn't even think about it

3179
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:43,780
In the fact of

3180
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:44,780
If I'm looking for

3181
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:45,780
An enterprise and I'm looking

3182
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,780
To get something that

3183
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,780
You know multi-year

3184
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,780
Sustainability out of

3185
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,780
Of course

3186
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,780
Of course the drama

3187
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,780
Of a community

3188
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:54,780
Would be a concern

3189
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,780
And it almost becomes

3190
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:56,780
The responsibility of the person

3191
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,780
That's trying to implement

3192
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,780
That technology

3193
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,780
At least have a bit

3194
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,780
Of an understanding

3195
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:01,780
Of how volatile the project is

3196
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,780
Because in open source

3197
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:03,780
You know it's not the mighty dollar

3198
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,780
That drives that project

3199
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:05,780
It's the passion

3200
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:06,780
Of the contributors

3201
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,780
In a lot of cases

3202
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,780
In a lot of cases

3203
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,780
So that makes so much sense

3204
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,780
That that would be

3205
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:11,780
That if you're sitting back

3206
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:12,780
And watching a project

3207
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,780
Right now

3208
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,780
And you see a project

3209
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:15,780
That's just falling apart

3210
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:16,780
You're not going to want

3211
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:17,780
To bet the farm

3212
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:18,780
On that for five years

3213
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:19,780
You're going to try to find

3214
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,780
Maybe something else

3215
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:21,780
That's maybe a little stable

3216
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:22,780
Maybe a little

3217
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:23,780
A little more tame

3218
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,780
Well ironically

3219
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:25,780
You would have thought

3220
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,780
That would be Debian

3221
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,780
You know

3222
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,780
You would have thought

3223
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,780
That was Debian to a T

3224
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,780
But watching them fall apart

3225
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:31,780
It even happens there too

3226
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:32,780
I mean not fall apart

3227
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,780
That's kind of

3228
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,780
Putting it over the top

3229
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:35,780
But obviously

3230
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:36,780
They've been having issues

3231
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:37,780
And that's critical too

3232
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:38,780
Because education

3233
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:39,780
Again I'm speaking specifically

3234
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,780
From education

3235
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:41,780
But you know

3236
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:42,780
Educational leaders

3237
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:43,780
I mean they

3238
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:44,780
They have limited dollars

3239
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,780
To begin with

3240
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:46,780
And it doesn't

3241
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:47,780
You know

3242
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,780
By the same token

3243
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:49,780
But you know

3244
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:50,780
With when you're betting

3245
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,780
On open source projects

3246
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,780
In general

3247
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:53,780
It's not as if

3248
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,780
You know

3249
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:55,780
We can just turn

3250
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:56,780
To another vendor

3251
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:57,780
And say hey

3252
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:58,780
Help support this

3253
01:13:58,780 --> 01:13:59,780
You know

3254
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,780
We are

3255
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,780
One of the downsides

3256
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,780
Of our current position

3257
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:03,780
Is that

3258
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,780
You know

3259
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:05,780
I can't just

3260
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
Easily go out

3261
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:07,780
And get support

3262
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:08,780
For the projects

3263
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:09,780
And programs

3264
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:10,780
That we have in place here

3265
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:11,780
Now I'm incredibly fortunate

3266
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,780
To have a phenomenal team

3267
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,780
Of technologists

3268
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,780
You know

3269
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,780
Because they're just

3270
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,780
Great technologists

3271
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,780
But you know

3272
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,780
If I didn't have

3273
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:19,780
That internal support

3274
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:20,780
I would be at the mercy

3275
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:21,780
Of vendors

3276
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:22,780
And again

3277
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,780
That's an incredibly precarious

3278
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:24,780
And dangerous position

3279
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:25,780
For a school district

3280
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:26,780
Or any organization

3281
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:27,780
That can't turn to

3282
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:28,780
You know

3283
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,780
Somebody or something

3284
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,780
For support

3285
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:31,780
Absolutely

3286
01:14:31,780 --> 01:14:32,780
Rotten Corps

3287
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,780
You have a question

3288
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,780
For Charlie

3289
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,780
Go ahead

3290
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:36,780
Yeah I was wondering

3291
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,780
Do you find it more

3292
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,780
There's

3293
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:39,780
Based on when you

3294
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:40,780
Started doing this

3295
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,780
Do you

3296
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,780
Is it more recently

3297
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:43,780
Have you noticed

3298
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:44,780
A difference

3299
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:45,780
In Debian

3300
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:46,780
Or anything

3301
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:47,780
In particular

3302
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:48,780
Linux community

3303
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:49,780
Based on before

3304
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:50,780
Because at

3305
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,780
At one point

3306
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,780
Like Debian has not changed

3307
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:53,780
How they do anything

3308
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,780
They caught

3309
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:55,780
There's a lot of people

3310
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:56,780
Leaving and coming and going

3311
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:57,780
And there's hundreds of people

3312
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:58,780
Working on Debian

3313
01:14:58,780 --> 01:14:59,780
And people leave

3314
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,780
Because of different

3315
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,780
You know

3316
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:02,780
Opinions

3317
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:03,780
But now that they can

3318
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:04,780
Make it public

3319
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,780
And that media people

3320
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,780
Pick it up

3321
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:07,780
Do you think that has

3322
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,780
Any effector

3323
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,780
For the

3324
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:10,780
The perception

3325
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,780
That people have

3326
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:12,780
For this

3327
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,780
Yeah

3328
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,780
Yeah

3329
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,780
Just kind of

3330
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,780
Thinking out loud

3331
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,780
Yeah and I guess

3332
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,780
It

3333
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,780
You know it's tough

3334
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,780
And I'm not as

3335
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:21,780
You know

3336
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:22,780
Up to speed

3337
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:23,780
On those specific

3338
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,780
Arguments and discussions

3339
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:26,780
You know I think

3340
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:27,780
I guess the key is

3341
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,780
You know just

3342
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:29,780
The tone of these

3343
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:30,780
Again these tend to be

3344
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:31,780
Incredibly technical

3345
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,780
You know

3346
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:34,780
Sometimes vanity

3347
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,780
Discussions

3348
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,780
Very much

3349
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:37,780
And you know

3350
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:38,780
I just

3351
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:39,780
It doesn't help

3352
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:40,780
You know it just doesn't

3353
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:41,780
It just doesn't help

3354
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:42,780
You know the

3355
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:43,780
The tech industry itself

3356
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:44,780
Finds itself fighting

3357
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,780
All the time

3358
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:46,780
Over

3359
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,780
You know Apple

3360
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:48,780
Versus Microsoft

3361
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,780
You know iOS

3362
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:50,780
Versus Android

3363
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:51,780
You know I think

3364
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,780
What we do in

3365
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:53,780
Our industry

3366
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:54,780
Again just

3367
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:55,780
In fighting

3368
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,780
Doesn't add to

3369
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:57,780
It just doesn't add

3370
01:15:57,780 --> 01:15:58,780
To you know

3371
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,780
To anything

3372
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:00,780
For technical leaders

3373
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:01,780
So again without

3374
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:02,780
Knowing all of the

3375
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:03,780
You know all the details

3376
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:04,780
The arguments

3377
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,780
Yeah I just

3378
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:06,780
I just think it

3379
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,780
Makes it more difficult

3380
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,780
You know I think we should

3381
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:09,780
All be focused on

3382
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:10,780
Working together

3383
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,780
In these programs

3384
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:12,780
And trying to minimize

3385
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,780
You know the

3386
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:14,780
The strife

3387
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:15,780
Yeah preach it

3388
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,780
Alright Charlie can

3389
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:17,780
Will you do me a favor

3390
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:18,780
Give it

3391
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,780
Give everybody down

3392
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,780
I'll give you a countdown

3393
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:21,780
And when I get to one

3394
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:22,780
Hold down the

3395
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:23,780
Push to talk

3396
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:24,780
And have everybody in the room

3397
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,780
Say

3398
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:26,780
Linux unplugged alright

3399
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:27,780
In three

3400
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:28,780
Two

3401
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:29,780
One

3402
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,780
Linux unplugged

3403
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:31,780
We gotta try that again

3404
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,780
Come on whole group

3405
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:33,780
Three

3406
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:34,780
Two

3407
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:35,780
We totally have to try that again

3408
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,780
He's gonna give us a countdown

3409
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:37,780
To screaming

3410
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:38,780
Linux unplugged

3411
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,780
Yeah we wanna get

3412
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:40,780
The whole room in there

3413
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,780
The whole room

3414
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:42,780
Let's see if we can just

3415
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:43,780
Break the whole thing in

3416
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:44,780
Three

3417
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:45,780
Two

3418
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:46,780
One

3419
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:47,780
Linux unplugged

3420
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,780
That's pretty good

3421
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:49,780
Alright thanks guys

3422
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:50,780
Alright well

3423
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,780
We'll wrap it up right there

3424
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:52,780
I think

3425
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:53,780
We gotta get out of here

3426
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:54,780
Cause we got some

3427
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:55,780
Thanksgiving shenanigans

3428
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:56,780
Here in the U.S.

3429
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,780
To prepare for

3430
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,780
Matt we're gonna have

3431
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,780
A great show on Sunday

3432
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:00,780
We got not only

3433
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,780
The Shuttleworth interview

3434
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:02,780
We got all our other

3435
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:03,780
Regular stuff

3436
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:04,780
Are you ready

3437
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:05,780
I'm so ready

3438
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,780
Yes

3439
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:07,780
Alright you bring it

3440
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:08,780
I'll make sure that

3441
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:09,780
I know

3442
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:10,780
I know

3443
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,780
Don't worry Matt

3444
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:12,780
I'll get bacon

3445
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:13,780
I can handle that

3446
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:14,780
Alright so those of you

Alright everybody

3466
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,780
Thanks so much

3467
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,780
For tuning this week's episode

3468
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:36,780
Of Linux Unplugged

3469
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,780
See you right back here

3470
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,780
See you

3471
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:39,780
Bye

3472
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:20,380
Well that was fun, thanks everybody.

3473
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:24,780
It was a little tricky making one laptop work for everybody in the room but I think it turned

3474
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,900
out okay and we had a good discussion.

3475
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,380
So that was nice.

3476
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:33,060
So we're gonna sort of shut down here and switch over to our best of thing but let's

3477
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:35,660
go over to the JB Titles real quick and pick ourselves a title before we do that.

3478
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:39,220
We got some business to take care of before we run and I don't know man, I didn't see

3479
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:42,860
a lot of title suggestions.

3480
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,460
Repackage your opinion, that's pretty good.

3481
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:47,460
I kind of like that.

3482
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:48,940
Cool kids use Linux.

3483
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:55,280
JBTitles.com, JBTitles.com, er buddy boat.

3484
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,580
Know your technical limits.

3485
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,580
That's pretty good.

3486
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,700
Yeah, know your limits is good.

3487
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,660
Unplugged education, I like that.

3488
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,660
That's good too.

3489
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,100
Unplugged, I'm gonna give that a boat right now.

3490
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,100
Good one Keller.

3491
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,900
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

3492
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,900
What's that?

3493
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:10,900
Unplugged education?

3494
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:11,900
Unplugging education.

3495
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,900
Oh, I suppose, yeah.

3496
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,580
Yeah, like get rid of that thing.

3497
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,420
Get it out of here.

3498
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:21,100
Yeah, maybe we could just get, maybe we could just loan Charlie out to different school

3499
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,100
districts.

3500
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,100
That'd be cool, right?

3501
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,100
Yeah.

3502
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,900
That was neat they were able to join us during the school day over there.

3503
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:26,900
That was awesome.

3504
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,860
It's got to be getting close to the end of the day for them, right?

3505
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:30,860
I would think so.

3506
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:32,500
East Coast, they're 511 over there.

3507
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,500
Yeah, oh boy.

3508
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,780
Well, a big thank you to them for joining us.

3509
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:35,780
That was really cool.

3510
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,780
Yeah.

3511
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:41,220
All right, JBtelus.com, we'll go pick a title and then get, did you guys hear about this

3512
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:42,220
Sony hack?

3513
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,220
Matt, have you heard about this?

3514
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,220
Yes.

3515
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,220
Where they replaced, it's Sony Pictures.

3516
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:50,220
I guess it's the movie arm, but like this has got to be a Windows vulnerability they're

3517
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:56,300
taking advantage of here because it's full screen images and holding data for ransom,

3518
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,100
taking over Twitter accounts, replacing Google Play apps.

3519
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,900
This is a massive breach and it's of course the week we take TechSnap up.

3520
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,100
Oh man.

3521
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:11,460
Well in hindsight though, it'll allow more things to develop over time and you can come

3522
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,460
back to it.

3523
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,460
We do like them deets.

3524
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,460
That's a good point.

3525
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,460
Yeah.

3526
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,700
All right, JBtitles.com, unplugged education.

3527
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,460
I do like it, but I could see the negative connotation.

3528
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,740
Repackage your opinions would be good too though.

3529
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,740
Linux powered schools.

3530
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:27,340
Cool kids use Linux.

3531
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,660
School of Linux, cool kids use Linux again.

3532
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,860
Open source education.

3533
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,860
Linux in schools is cool.

3534
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:37,420
Boy, I would have loved to have been a student back when that was going on.

3535
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:41,140
That would have been so neat.

3536
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,540
All right, last chance and then we're going to run.

3537
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,260
Last chance and unplugged education is racking up the top, but there's still a chance.

3538
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,260
Everybody go over there and boat.

3539
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,260
Repackage your education.

3540
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,260
Boat.

3541
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,260
Nice.

3542
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,260
Nice.

3543
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,260
Nice.

3544
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,260
Oh, yes.

3545
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:55,260
Boat, boat, boat.

3546
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:00,260
I think he's done, the school sounds really interesting.

3547
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:01,260
Yeah.

3548
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,260
I agree.

3549
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,340
I wish my school did that.

3550
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,340
No kidding.

3551
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:07,340
Yeah.

3552
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:08,340
Yeah, I mean the best you're going to get-

3553
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,380
I'm still in school, so I have a chance to change it.

3554
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:16,340
The best you're usually going to get in school is freaking Chromebooks.

3555
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:17,340
Yeah.

3556
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:24,260
I would have loved to have anything remotely relevant to computer class.

3557
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:25,260
Yeah.

3558
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:31,220
I don't think it really counts to your entire, your entire school.

3559
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,740
Your entire hour of the class is Mavis Beacon.

3560
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,740
Or Organ Trail.

3561
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,060
Or Organ Trail on an old Mac.

3562
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,740
Now, don't doubt Organ Trail.

3563
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:40,060
That's how I learned about dysentery.

3564
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,060
Come on now.

3565
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,060
Exactly.

3566
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:47,380
I learned how to do punch cards in computer science at school.

3567
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:48,380
Oh, wait.

3568
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,380
Boom.

3569
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,380
Static.

3570
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:51,380
Static.

3571
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:55,380
Well, now, that's been a really useful skill set that you've been able to bring forward.

3572
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:56,460
Yeah.

3573
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,780
Even when I was taught it, it was about 20 years out of date, I think.

3574
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:00,780
Oh, wow.

3575
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,780
Did you have hanging chads?

3576
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:03,780
Yeah.

3577
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:08,780
Did you ever, like, drop all your punch cards and get them all mixed up?

3578
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:09,780
Oh, God.

3579
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:10,780
Yeah.

3580
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:11,780
Yeah.

3581
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:12,780
Done that.

3582
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:13,780
Yeah.

3583
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:19,260
And also, we had the paper tape as well, which, frankly, it's only practical application is

3584
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:21,060
removing fingerprints.

3585
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,060
Wow.

3586
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:28,940
I was going to say, the last person that I heard that actually used to tape drive to

3587
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:33,860
go and take it, well, sorry, a regular paper tape with punch holes in it was my teacher,

3588
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:35,420
and she's nearly 16 now.

3589
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,420
Yeah.

3590
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,420
Yeah.

3591
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,980
It's an older generation thing for sure.

3592
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:39,980
Yeah.

3593
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:40,980
I'm not that old.

3594
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:45,380
Like I say, it was well out of date when I was at school, but this was the quality of

3595
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,500
computer education.

3596
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,700
I want to find one just to experiment with it.

3597
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,700
Yeah.

3598
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,700
It'll be kind of fun.

3599
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,740
My father-in-law has still got one from the mainframe systems he used to operate at Heinz,

3600
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:01,660
so yeah, maybe I'll dig that out at Christmas and take some photos.

3601
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:04,380
Well, schools have got slightly better.

3602
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:08,380
Their only perception of Linux in books at the moment is Ubuntu.

3603
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,380
Yeah.

3604
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:17,540
That's a de facto screenshot for every single one I've seen.

3605
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:20,580
I wonder if, yeah, I mean, hmm.

3606
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:22,580
Redhead desktop's pretty popular too.

3607
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,580
Okay.

3608
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:27,420
I can see Ubuntu, and especially with the Edubuntu spin and Zubuntu, being pretty useful

3609
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,420
for schools.

3610
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,420
Yeah.

3611
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:30,420
And Ubuntu Monte.

3612
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,420
Yeah.

3613
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,420
Oh yeah.

3614
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,420
Yeah.

3615
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:34,420
Yeah.

3616
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:35,420
Oh yeah.

3617
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,420
In fact, Wimpy, we were going to-

3618
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,420
Nice plug.

3619
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,420
Yeah.

3620
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,420
There was a...

3621
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,420
You were telling me about a pretty big deployment of...

3622
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,420
In fact, that was something I was going to ask Charlie if they've played with Linux terminal

3623
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:42,420
services at all.

3624
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:43,420
Yes.

3625
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,420
When I was.

3626
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,420
That's what I used.

3627
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,420
Yeah.

3628
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:52,860
There's a few in the embryonic stages at the moment, and I can't really say too much about

3629
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:56,980
it at the moment because it might happen and it might not, and if it looks like it's definitely

3630
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:01,100
going to happen, I shall be sure to fill you in on the details.

3631
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,140
But here's a little teaser.

3632
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:06,700
The Ex2Go Gathering was sponsored by IBM.

3633
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,700
Hmm.

3634
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,700
Really?

3635
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,700
IBM?

3636
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:17,820
And they like those PowerPC things, and they contracted Canonical to port Ubuntu to PowerPC

3637
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,820
recently.

3638
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:19,820
Oh, wow.

3639
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:20,900
Oh, I didn't realize that.

3640
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:26,780
You know, that would have been a good answer for the emailer who was saying, how do I repurpose

3641
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:53,500
these old XP and PowerPC Macs as maybe Linux terminal services?
