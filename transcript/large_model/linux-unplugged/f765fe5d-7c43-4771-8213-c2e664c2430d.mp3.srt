1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
In the meantime, I should probably get my computer here started up.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's see, let's start up my... There we go.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yep.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,800
It's just the most reliable choice for the live stream.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,560
No, Chris. No, just no.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,520
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
My name is Chris.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,520
My name is Wes.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,040
Hello, Wes.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,400
This episode is brought to you by the all new A Cloud Guru.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,360
You know, they are the leader in cloud Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds of

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,800
courses and thousands of hands on labs.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,240
So go get certified, get hired and get learning at a cloud guru.com.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,320
Well, coming up on this episode, we're going to make good on a promise to you.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,140
Tim Kenam, the Mars helicopter operations lead at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory joins

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,520
us again on the show.

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,480
He's been living on Mars time and they have had successful flights.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,400
They have, well, they have made history, but not everything went perfect.

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,720
So he's going to join us today and he's going to get really technical about what broke,

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,840
how they fixed it and some of the awesome like action movie kind of workarounds they

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
had to do to get that thing flying again.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,680
And then after that, we're going to come clean about a service.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,720
It's time to retire here on the show.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,260
When we launched here on the podcast and towards the end of this episode, find out which project

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,820
of ours is just not really worked out the way we thought it would.

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,200
So we're going to have an exit interview and we'll find out what didn't work.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,480
But before all of that, before we get into any of that, we got to bring in our virtual

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Linux users group.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,400
So time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
Hello, hello.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Hello.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Hello.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Hello.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Hello.

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,500
Thank you for making it.

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,320
This is going to be our last live stream for the next few weeks just because we're traveling.

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,880
There will still be shows in the feeds.

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,580
We'll have more details about that in a little bit, but I'm really glad you guys could make

39
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,640
it because I'm going to miss you guys.

40
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,460
This is something we do every single Tuesday.

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,840
So then to not do it for a few weeks is just going to feel really weird.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,520
So each one of you has a special place in my heart.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,340
And if you'd like to join our show live, we do it typically on Tuesdays.

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,340
So this is your heads up.

45
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,640
Maybe like in a few weeks, like say, oh, I don't know, June 8th, come on back here and

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,420
hang out with us at jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

47
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,720
We have all of the information at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
Really there's no excuse anymore, right?

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Because you've got these upcoming weeks to get your audio set up, tuned, tweaked, maybe

50
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,720
practice with the lup lug, and then you'll be ready to join the live stream when we're

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
back.

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,800
And let's be honest, Wes, put in your PTO request so that way you can come hang out,

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,200
you know, or slide the lunch hour.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,960
Good idea.

55
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,880
I also want to let everybody know that our friends at a cloud guru have a Linux system

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,400
maintenance course.

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,680
This is a course that's designed to give you the knowledge and utilities needed to just

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,840
maintain a Linux box.

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,160
So you get started with getting programs installed and set up, but then they have sections that

60
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,600
cover backups and which directories you should consider when you're backing up the utilities

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,440
to create backups, how you can use physical medias if that's your jam.

62
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,120
And then it kind of ends with automating some of the communication and also how you can

63
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,980
communicate with other users on your Linux box.

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,840
It's a standalone Linux system maintenance course, but I also wanted to mention it because

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,680
it's part of the path towards the LPIC 2.0.1 exam.

66
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,760
So if you are getting your cert on, or you just want to maintain a box, we'll have a

67
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,480
link to this in the show notes because it is kind of a long URL, but we'll have that

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,640
in the notes and you can go check out their Linux system maintenance course, which probably

69
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,800
everybody could benefit from because a lot of the stuff I've self taught so you can go

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,520
check that out.

71
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,860
So let's not delay, actually, I think, you know, this is usually the time in the show

72
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,760
where we would do news.

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,180
But realistically, what is bigger than making history with Linux on Mars?

74
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,580
So we were really thrilled that Tim could come back and join us.

75
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,400
As I mentioned, he is the Mars helicopter operations lead at NASA's JPL.

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,600
And he was on the show in early March, right, Wes?

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,140
Yeah, early March in LUP 396.

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,520
But a lot has happened since then.

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,240
I mean, we were kind of looking forward to heard about the successful landing, but there

80
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,520
hadn't yet been any flights.

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
Yep.

82
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,000
He joined us earlier.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,520
And we started by talking about getting off of Mars time, which he had just been living

84
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
on.

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
Tim, welcome back to the show.

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
It's great to have you.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,760
It's been amazing to watch five successful flights on the surface of Mars.

88
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,960
Yeah, it's been extremely exciting.

89
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,280
It's performed beautifully, even beyond our expectations in many ways.

90
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,120
So I think, right, you were on Mars time for a bit and now that's wrapped up.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,220
How was that?

92
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
It's very different.

93
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,100
I mean, it's very stressful on your schedule because you're walking close to an hour every

94
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,140
day right through the night.

95
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,880
And it actually happened at the most stressful time when we were trying to debug the hardware

96
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,000
issue that we found on the surface of Mars.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,180
So I was actually hopping between Mars time and Earth time because I was in the lab debugging

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,480
the issue that we saw.

99
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,600
And then we would hop on, if you will, metaphorically hop onto the helicopter in the middle of the

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,900
night and try some experiments to see if the fix we were trying worked.

101
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,480
So it was a very stressful time and a very, but at the same time we came through it and

102
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,500
we were able to fly.

103
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,840
So that was very cool.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,720
Hopefully you're catching up on sleep now.

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Yes, for sure.

106
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,960
That issue that you ran into, that was what delayed the first flight, right?

107
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,800
Can you give us some details on what happened?

108
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Yeah, absolutely.

109
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,160
I don't know if you're familiar with what the concept of a hardware watchdog is, but

110
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:46,160
it's a hardware function, if you will, that monitors a CPU or a processor and the software

111
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
running on it.

112
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
It's a form of a dead man switch.

113
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,080
Remember those movies where the bad guy would hold the switch in his hand and if he got

114
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,420
shot by the police, it would open up and he would blow up, right?

115
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,720
So watchdog timers are a form of a dead man switch that's used very commonly in embedded

116
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,940
software to make sure that the processor is behaving.

117
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:10,720
So if you're in a safety critical function or very timing critical function and for some

118
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,160
reason the software or the processor goes off in the weeds, a watchdog will stop that

119
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,040
processor from doing something bad or reset it.

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,120
And the helicopter hardware has a watchdog timer and the way the watchdog would work

121
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,340
is once the software is booted up, it gives it one second to boot up.

122
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,240
This is on the flight controller, which is the microcontroller, not the main Linux processor

123
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
that we've spent a lot of time talking about, but the microcontroller.

124
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,400
Some of those hardened ingredients you mentioned.

125
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Right.

126
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,280
And so it gives it about a second to boot up and then it looks for essentially a special

127
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,240
code that we send it, we send the hardware.

128
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,960
There's two codes we have to send alternating, you can call it A and B where in computer

129
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,740
ease, the B is the one's compliment of A. So that makes it so the software has to do

130
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,020
something deliberate.

131
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,400
It flips all the bits of the A pattern to do the B pattern and then flips all the bits

132
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,920
of the B pattern to go back to the A pattern.

133
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,200
And so the design with the hardware was that the software has to send these alternating

134
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,160
A and B patterns every cycle on that microcontroller, which is two milliseconds.

135
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,700
That's the duration of the cycle, very short cycle.

136
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:27,700
So at the end of that one second window, the FPGA, that's a field programmable gate array.

137
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,960
It's a form of programmable hardware that's very popular amongst embedded designers.

138
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,680
If you have like hardware, which is all the individual components on a board, but then

139
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,040
you have these field programmable gate arrays, which allows a hardware designer to design

140
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,840
in specific functions into the hardware.

141
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,280
And as long as that hardware is still on the ground, you can plug in a cable and update

142
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,040
the hardware design without having to fabricate new chips or anything like that.

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,800
So it's very popular among hardware designers.

144
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,640
And so the software boots up and starts sending the A, then the B, then the A, then the B.

145
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,480
So depending on how long it takes for the software to boot up at the end of that one

146
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,480
second window, that hardware would see either the A pattern or the B pattern.

147
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Does that make sense?

148
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Yep.

149
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm following you.

150
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:22,800
And according to the design, the hardware was supposed to accept either A or B. And

151
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,920
we found out once we got on Mars that the hardware actually required that you send A

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
first.

153
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Oh, wow.

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,800
And over time, as the hardware has settled in, if you will, and each hardware has its

155
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:43,320
own clock that can run slightly slower or slightly faster, that's what clocks the processor.

156
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:51,040
And over time, the boot time of that microcontroller drifted such that on Earth, for the most part,

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,600
all through our testing, it just happened to send the A pattern.

158
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,440
But then when we get to Mars, go figure, it decides that it's going to boot up either

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,000
slightly slower or slightly faster.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,160
And the first pattern that the hardware saw was the B pattern.

161
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,080
This is probably not the kind of incident you expected.

162
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,560
I would imagine you thought some sort of physical damage might happen or something might get

163
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
jarred loose.

164
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,400
I bet you weren't expecting something like this.

165
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
So how did you even start the research process on that?

166
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,560
It totally came out of the blue.

167
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,140
It's very interesting, but this is not atypical for a project that you sweat and you stress

168
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,960
and you lose sleep over things that you think are going to be a big deal.

169
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,040
And they don't end up being a big deal, but something comes completely out of the blue

170
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,720
and smacks you in the side of the head.

171
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,120
And this is really what happened.

172
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,220
And we basically just opened up the FPGA code itself.

173
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,200
They have simulations they can run on the FPGA hardware, and they're able to reproduce

174
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,640
the case where the software boots up slightly faster or slightly slower and sends the B

175
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,400
code to the hardware instead of the A.

176
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Wow.

177
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,880
Good thing that simulator is accurate.

178
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Yeah.

179
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,460
It's a nanosecond accurate simulator.

180
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,960
So we were burning the midnight oil.

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,640
We were up many, many days, 15 hours a day just trying to dig through and find out what

182
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
happened.

183
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,080
And once we had nailed it, even though it's on Mars, there's always a maxim that once

184
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,840
you can reproduce it and nail it, you have a pretty darn good chance of fixing it.

185
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,380
It's the ones that are really hard are the intermittent ones that happen once in a while.

186
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,880
So it's hard to reproduce.

187
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,880
But after about a day of just intense study and simulation, the hardware designers and

188
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,900
I were actually able to figure out what was going on.

189
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,240
Then we had to come up with a solution.

190
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,640
We actually found, if you will, a hardware hack to get around it.

191
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,820
There's really two solutions.

192
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,120
One would be use the existing software and find some way to get it to fix itself, if

193
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,280
you will.

194
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,340
Or the second alternative is a software update, where we change the software so that it in

195
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,860
essence sends both the A and the B pattern every cycle instead of every other cycle.

196
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,480
And so the hardware sees the A pattern first and then the B pattern, and then it's happy.

197
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,180
So there was a relatively easy software fix.

198
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,360
You say relatively easy in the code change there, but I don't know the prospect of updating

199
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,960
remotely that seems a little dicey, right?

200
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Yes.

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,260
So getting it to Mars is the challenge.

202
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,560
And we did it.

203
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,100
I mean, we did the software change.

204
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,000
So we were trying to develop these two paths in parallel.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
So you can probably understand why this was a very stressful time because at the same

206
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,360
time I was debugging the issue in the hardware with the hardware team.

207
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,000
I was also making a software update and testing it on the rover that we have in what they

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,880
call the Mars Yard at JPL, which is a replica of the rover on Mars, because there's a whole

209
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,160
set of procedures we had to develop in the space of 24 to 48 hours, all these procedures

210
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,160
for updating the software on the helicopter and test them.

211
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,360
And so I was doing all that in parallel.

212
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,000
My wife was getting very nervous because I was so stressed about it.

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,160
I wasn't eating that much.

214
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,560
And because there's all these eyes on it at all levels up to NASA wanting to know how

215
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
we were going to fix this.

216
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,440
And so it was definitely one of those Apollo 13 moments.

217
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,160
And so we got the software tested.

218
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,040
It's actually the software update is sitting on the rover if we decide to use it.

219
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,220
But we actually found a fairly clever workaround on the vehicle itself that did not require

220
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,660
the software update.

221
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,560
So that's got to be the safer route then.

222
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Yes.

223
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,520
And it actually shortened the time because we had this very limited window.

224
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,660
We could do this experiment on Mars and time was ticking.

225
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,200
And based on my own estimates, based on all the times it would take to transfer the software

226
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,080
to the helicopter and then retest it, we would probably lose at least a week.

227
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,000
What is it using to communicate back to the rover, the helicopter?

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,760
Is it a Wi-Fi network?

229
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Is it something else?

230
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,960
Well, you're going to laugh at this.

231
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
It's a Zigbee radio.

232
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
No way.

233
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
No kidding.

234
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,260
Yeah, it's the same radio people use in their IoT devices in their home.

235
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,200
And we have one on the helicopter and then the helicopter has an instrument payload on

236
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,760
the rover called the base station.

237
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,560
So they both have these radios and they talk to each other.

238
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,440
That's how we communicate back and forth.

239
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Wow.

240
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,480
But what we figured out was on the helicopter, I mentioned a software update.

241
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,920
We had built in from the beginning the ability to update the software on this microcontroller.

242
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,320
We actually did it many times when we were testing because we do some testing.

243
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,760
We'd say, oops, we need to correct that issue in the code or try this different approach.

244
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,440
And so we would update that microcontroller.

245
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,100
So one thing you don't want to have happen is as you're updating, right, you're writing

246
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,360
to the flash on the microcontroller, which takes a certain amount of time.

247
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,680
You don't want the hardware saying, hey, you forgot to stroke my watchdog, so I'm going

248
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
to shut you down.

249
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
Right.

250
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,680
That would be bad.

251
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,160
Please leave your Mars helicopter plugged in while your system is updating.

252
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,440
Exactly.

253
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,880
And so we had a special, we call it the patch mode in the FPGA where when you put it in

254
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,500
this patch mode, it would disable this watchdog check for as long as you're in that mode.

255
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,960
And then when you would exit that mode after you were done patching, the hardware would

256
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,680
look again for those watchdog transactions that I mentioned, the A and the B.

257
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,880
So we found out in our lab at JPL that the timing is, there's all kinds of charts and

258
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,280
things that would probably be boring you, but we actually did a whole bunch of analysis

259
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:34,440
and we found out the timing was just right, that if you exited this patch mode, it would

260
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,520
actually make it so that that A transaction will line up about 85% of the time and it

261
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
would work.

262
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,200
We're like, wow, how do you like that?

263
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Right.

264
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,100
And so in essence, we have these software back doors because that's what software people

265
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,820
like to do.

266
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,880
And we have these commands that are already on the helicopter that allow us to poke into

267
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,240
the hardware directly and change that mode to be in this patch mode, and then we can

268
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,360
exit it.

269
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,340
So normally when we're doing patching on the software, it's a much higher level function.

270
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,240
You send a command that says, I want to write this file to the flash on the microcontroller

271
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,940
and the software executes at a high level to do that.

272
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,800
And obviously we didn't want to update the software.

273
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,560
We just wanted to put it into this mode temporarily and pull it back out.

274
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Does that make sense?

275
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,320
Just to adjust the timing to kind of get these cycles between the two systems more in sync.

276
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,760
Yeah, to kind of force it to go in and out of this mode.

277
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,360
And as we found out in the lab that when it exited this mode, serendipitously 85% of the

278
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,080
time, it would be happy with that AB pattern.

279
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
That's excellent.

280
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Very clever.

281
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,760
So every sequence that we run, every command set that we run now during a flight, it has

282
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,280
those transactions in there to basically hotwire this hardware mode to force it in and out

283
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,880
so that we can fly.

284
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,600
And we did have one flight, we had flight four that canceled because we just caught

285
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
the timing wrong.

286
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,320
I was going to ask you about that.

287
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
I was wondering.

288
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Okay.

289
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
Yeah.

290
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
The fourth flight on April 29th, right?

291
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Yes, that's right.

292
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,200
So that's a case when the timing was just off slightly and when we exited that mode,

293
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
it didn't work.

294
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,360
And so the sequence failed out safely and we just ran it the next day and it worked.

295
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Wow.

296
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,080
I love hearing clever solutions like that that avoid the greater risk of remotely flashing

297
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
the copter.

298
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,320
There are a bunch of Star Wars nerds on the project.

299
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,820
And if you look on Twitter, on the JPL Twitter feed, on May the 4th, we had the helicopter

300
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,160
send out a May the 4th be with you message back to Earth.

301
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,920
So that was kind of fun.

302
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,800
But we have sort of a running funny meme for that workaround that we found to get the helicopter

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
to fly.

304
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,760
And that is the scene when Han Solo is trying to get away in the Millennium Falcon and he

305
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,920
walks in and the Millennium Falcon won't start.

306
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,120
So he turned around and he smacks the panel and everything lights up and he can go.

307
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,400
That's kind of what we're doing on the helicopter every flight.

308
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,960
Hey, if that's what it takes, it's still making history.

309
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,480
So what then has worked better than expected?

310
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,100
Like what were you maybe very concerned about that turned out to be a non-issue or something

311
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,080
you didn't consider that's just gone fantastic?

312
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,800
Well, we were really sweating the energy story because the helicopter is small relative to

313
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,360
the size of something like the Rover.

314
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,040
So it's difficult to model the energy, meaning how much energy the solar panel will absorb

315
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,720
and fill the batteries, how much heat leakage there is out of the helicopter and how much

316
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,680
it will expend overnight keeping the helicopter warm because we have to keep the batteries

317
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,800
warm overnight or else they can go into a deep freeze and then the helicopter is done.

318
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,960
And so we were really, we were spending a lot of time trying to figure out what this

319
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,120
model would tell us.

320
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:48,020
And the model was pretty pessimistic and it said, you're kind of borderline on energy.

321
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,280
And so we were coming up with all these contingencies about, well, how can we do it at a different

322
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
time of day?

323
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,780
Maybe we can only do one flight because that will exhaust the battery and it won't keep

324
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,400
us awake at night.

325
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,600
And as it turned out, we dropped on the surface and then the next day when we talked to it,

326
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,720
the batteries were bouncing off 95%.

327
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
Wow.

328
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,240
We were like, this is fantastic.

329
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,480
And basically, you know, the battery health has been great.

330
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
There's been even some days when we wake it up at noon and it's sitting right at a hundred

331
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
percent.

332
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,120
It's fully charged by noon.

333
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,640
And what that really allowed us to do was to extend the maximum time that we could fly.

334
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,560
We had been advertising, and you may remember this from the first time I spoke to you that

335
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:40,160
we had been advertising that we could fly up to 90 seconds because past that, we didn't

336
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,920
know if we would have enough energy left after we landed to keep the helicopter warm through

337
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
the night.

338
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,800
When we had so much energy, we basically took the limit up to two minutes of flying.

339
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,800
And that's what allowed us to do this flight number four, where we went 130 meters to the

340
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,280
south and then back.

341
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,520
That's essentially two and a half football fields in one single flight.

342
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,140
And that was a pretty epic trip.

343
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,880
And all kinds of great things came out of that trip.

344
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,740
We were able to scout the landing location for flight number five, which is where we

345
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:17,180
are right now, and get some really, really good imaging on the way of the surface.

346
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,940
We actually used our black and white camera and took on the order of 60 pictures as we

347
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,560
were flying towards scouting, you know, scouting towards the landing location.

348
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,280
And we got a whole ton of pictures right as we approached the landing site.

349
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,800
And we were able to take a bunch of color pictures.

350
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,040
And when we went back to the north again and landed, we still had really good energy.

351
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,920
We were sitting at, I want to say around 60 to 70 percent.

352
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,120
Amazing.

353
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,800
That's got to be beyond your expectations.

354
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,060
Yeah, we were just elated at that because it opens up so many possibilities.

355
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,660
And it seems like we're just energy rich, which that we just didn't expect.

356
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,360
So what about the Linux systems?

357
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,240
You know, last time we kind of talked about the journey it took to get Linux involved

358
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,200
at JPL and onto this copter, and we were talking before about some of the, you know, the hardware

359
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,000
and low level software details, but how, you know, you're talking about the images.

360
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,080
How has the Linux stack actually done?

361
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,480
Well, the processor and Linux have done very well.

362
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,720
We tripped over one thing that's it's kind of funny, you know, in a way, we have a command

363
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,800
on the helicopter that if we want to list all the files in a particular directory, it

364
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,800
takes each file in the directory, and it gives us the size and the name, but then it also

365
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,680
computes what's called a checksum.

366
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,400
And basically it's sort of like MD5, if you're familiar with that utility on Linux, it gives

367
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,800
you a code that says, you know, this is what the, this is a check of the, of the actual

368
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
binary itself.

369
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:50,240
And we found out that on some of the larger files, it would take sufficiently long to

370
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,640
compute that checksum that on one, actually two different days on Mars, we actually tripped

371
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,200
the, remember I talked to you about the watchdog on that microcontroller, well, there's actually

372
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,600
another one that's watching the Linux processor, the Qualcomm ARM processor that has a 30 or

373
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,040
a three second expiration.

374
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:16,300
And apparently the time it took to read those files and compute that checksum was just,

375
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:21,040
it locked up the Linux kernel just long enough that it tripped that watchdog.

376
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,380
And we ended up getting the processor reset.

377
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,200
And so that was one of those moments where we're looking at the data on the ground and

378
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,520
we're, we see about 50 files into the listing and all of a sudden the helicopter goes off

379
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,520
the air and we're like, that's not good.

380
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,960
But you know, the way we designed it, we always set the alarm clocks for the next day before

381
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,120
we do anything else.

382
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,760
And so the helicopter just came back the next day, just fine.

383
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,040
But there was about a 24 hour period there where we were like, yeah, we know that's the

384
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,000
design, but it also just kind of vanished and we hope it comes back.

385
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,280
That's a long time to wait for the next log time.

386
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,940
Even though you know, that's how it's built.

387
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
That's gotta be weird.

388
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Yes.

389
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,200
And I was kind of joking with one of my coworkers, one of the other engineers on the project.

390
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,360
And I said, that would be a little embarrassing if the helicopter went down in history as

391
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,160
being killed by LS, you know what I mean?

392
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:19,000
I hope this is sort of a success story for future experiments that might use Linux.

393
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But that wouldn't have been, if that was the case.

394
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah.

395
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,360
And it was, it's not Linux's fault per se, it's just doing what it likes to do, which

396
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,520
is, you know, when it does file accesses, it's not a real time operating system.

397
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,280
So it says, okay, you want me to go walk through this huge file, I'm just going to grab the

398
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
kernel for that time.

399
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Yeah.

400
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,560
And the watchdog did its job.

401
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Yeah, exactly.

402
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,040
It was one of those things you discover.

403
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:46,720
I remember there was a very senior manager, JPL, who's been doing projects for years and

404
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,540
years and years.

405
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,760
And coming into these projects, I always assumed there was this ironclad requirement that you

406
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,160
exactly know every single thing that a spacecraft is going to do once it gets where you want

407
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,440
it to go.

408
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,600
And he said very plainly in a meeting, he says, well, you know, when you get to a location,

409
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,680
you start to discover the personality of a particular spacecraft.

410
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,200
You can't test every single scenario on Earth the way you would encounter it because you're

411
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,080
not on Mars, or you're not at Saturn, or you're not orbiting Jupiter or something like that.

412
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,920
You really start to discover over the time what the personality of a particular spacecraft

413
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,760
is and the things you have to avoid, the things that you thought were going to go wrong and

414
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
didn't.

415
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,800
And then, like I said, the things you didn't even have any idea would go wrong, but did.

416
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,320
And so really, we've been learning the personality of the helicopter as it's been sitting there

417
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,780
on the surface of Mars.

418
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,880
And we just learned don't use that command because as I said, it's not the fault of Linux.

419
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,480
It's just a feature, if you will, that on a normal desktop would not be a big deal.

420
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,040
But we have this watchdog watching over us.

421
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,640
So ironically, what we ended up doing was we do have yet another backdoor on the software

422
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,600
that allows us to execute a command on the shell as if you were sitting there at the

423
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,480
Linux prompt and typing something.

424
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,260
So you can run pretty much anything on the helicopter you want.

425
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,040
And what it does is it takes the standard output of that command and puts it into a

426
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,040
log file that then you can transfer back to Earth and see what actually happened.

427
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:22,720
So what we did is after we tripped over that particular behavior, we actually switched

428
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,480
to doing LS, actually running LS.

429
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,800
One shell command slowly at a time.

430
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,600
Yeah, we just we found out that because LS was running and we put it on a different core

431
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,800
on the processor, right, we directed it to a different core.

432
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,000
We can do that with this command.

433
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,920
We can say run on the third core as opposed to the first core and we can direct it.

434
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,760
We basically since then have been doing LS on those directories and then running the

435
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,760
MD5 command on those same directories to use the sizes of the files that were generated

436
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,920
during the flight to estimate data volume that the rover has to downlink to Earth and

437
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,360
how long it will take because it takes a certain amount of time to transfer from the helicopter

438
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,180
back to the rover and so on and so forth.

439
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,520
So we needed those sizes.

440
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,840
So we basically just switched to using LS.

441
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,420
Core utils to the rescue.

442
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm kind of taken aback by the fact that you are actively essentially using the shell on

443
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,840
this copter on the planet of Mars from Earth.

444
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
That's just incredible to me.

445
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,680
Yeah, and it gets even better in that we do spend a lot of time with the helicopter up

446
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,560
transferring these large logs and images from the helicopter back to the base station that

447
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,320
I've mentioned on the rover over the radio and then subsequently transferring those files

448
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,980
from the base station of the helicopter.

449
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,800
And because those files are large, it takes a significant amount of time to transfer those

450
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,000
on each hop from the helicopter to the base station, the base station to the rover.

451
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,900
It consumes significant amount of time.

452
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,240
And so once we started using the shell command, we just said to ourselves, why don't we just

453
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,680
try compressing these files and see what happens?

454
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,600
And we did some experiments here on Earth and the good old fashioned bzip2 utility,

455
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,240
you may be familiar with it on Linux.

456
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,600
We basically do bzip-k because we don't want to delete the original files.

457
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,200
And we take all these log files and we compress them into bzip files and then we transfer

458
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:24,560
those and that actually shaved probably 30 to 45 minutes off of each hop from the helicopter

459
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,120
to the base station and the base station to the rover.

460
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,540
It significantly cut back our transfer time just because we just compressed them by running

461
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,680
this utility on the command line on the helicopter.

462
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,440
And how are they transferring between copter to rover and up?

463
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Is it is it some proprietary sync solution?

464
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Is it SCP?

465
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,520
I mean, what is going on there?

466
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,480
It's an old fashioned serial UART.

467
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,680
I don't know if you're familiar with that.

468
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,940
Remember the serial ports from the 90s and the 80s?

469
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,280
They essentially have one of those on steroids.

470
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,100
You know that the signaling is very robust so that you don't get noise in the rover that

471
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,680
can interfere.

472
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,300
But it's relatively slow by modern standards.

473
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,400
It's a hundred and fifteen kbaud connection between the base station and the rover.

474
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,040
For those of you played around with modems in the past, right?

475
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,040
You remember how you have these standard speeds of serial ports based on the 8080 PC back

476
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,360
in what, 1982?

477
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,260
They just kept them kept these standard speeds for 40 years.

478
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,380
So they set up these connections between the rover and the base station.

479
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,620
And so we initiate a transfer across that serial line, that UART line from the base

480
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,720
station to the rover.

481
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,920
And so the rover then takes that data and stores it in the form of its own internal

482
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,920
files.

483
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,680
And then whenever the next pass, the spacecraft pass, when the spacecraft goes overhead, they

484
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,300
relay those files up to the spacecraft and back to Earth.

485
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,940
So when we're actually looking at our data, we're seeing a bunch of these binary files

486
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,160
on storage on the ground, and we just run our tools to decode them back into the data

487
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,560
that we got from the helicopter.

488
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Wow, that is really impressive.

489
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,520
What's next for our little helicopter here?

490
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,120
And what's next for you?

491
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,360
I mean, you're off Mars time now, right?

492
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,880
Yeah, although Mars time is sort of aligned with Earth time because it circles around.

493
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,880
But after a certain point, the rover projects, they realize that the human cost of just always

494
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,280
going to Mars time, it just wrecks people's schedules and they get more and more tired

495
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,480
and more and more prone to make mistakes.

496
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,760
Somebody think of the humans.

497
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
Right.

498
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,560
So what they do is for the first part of the project, this is very common for Mars projects.

499
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,280
Everybody's on Mars time because they want to make sure the vehicle is working and stable

500
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,920
and doing what it's supposed to be doing.

501
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,880
And then they go to these kind of a modified schedule where when Mars time is in the middle

502
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,560
of the night Earth time, when humans don't want to be up and doing things, they'll take

503
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,440
one day on Earth and they'll schedule two Mars days, they'll do two things at once,

504
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,500
and then they can process it during the day when humans are awake.

505
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,200
So the shift kind of slides from early in the morning Earth time to later in the afternoon

506
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,680
and into the evening Earth time.

507
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,320
So it's still sliding, but it slides during the Earth day.

508
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,080
It doesn't go through the night anymore.

509
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,840
It's a little nicer on your schedule.

510
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Yes.

511
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,680
So they're able to juggle and not be as hard on engineers doing it.

512
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,760
But because Mars is cycling, every three weeks or so, it's working its way through a normal

513
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,480
Earth day and you can get, if you will, results the same day that you do an activity.

514
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,600
So Mars is kind of in that mode right now where it's about three or four hours behind

515
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,380
us, if you will.

516
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,520
And so we're able to get the data and look at it on a more normal human scale.

517
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:49,280
But we did finish our 30 Sol experiment and we met all of our requirements.

518
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:54,500
Our original promise was we would do these three canonical flights and we pretty much

519
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,240
nailed them.

520
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
They were great.

521
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,520
And we always said that flight four and five would be more adventuresome flights based

522
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,280
on what we discovered in the first three and we did exactly that.

523
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,360
So we're able to check the box and say, yeah, we did it and we did it in spades.

524
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,000
And we met our criteria and we got all the data that we want from those flights for future

525
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,800
projects to use to design their own particular missions.

526
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,760
And really validate that this is a worthwhile investment.

527
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Yeah.

528
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,080
So we switched modes, if you will.

529
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,040
The first 30 Sols were, it's a technology demo.

530
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,200
We're just trying to see if we can fly on Mars.

531
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,640
It's really what we're trying to show.

532
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,800
Was this even possible?

533
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,080
Yeah, exactly.

534
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Nobody knew if we could do it.

535
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,360
I mean, that's the bottom line.

536
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
A lot of people were skeptical.

537
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,800
Yeah, well, it's very nice that you had a chamber, you know, but you had a cable.

538
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,520
You don't know what it's going to do when it gets there and so on and so forth.

539
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,060
And we, it just nailed it.

540
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,800
Our chief pilot was looking at plots of altitude and position and rates and all that.

541
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,600
And he says, if I had looked at this six months ago, I would have said it was from our simulation,

542
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
not from Mars.

543
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
It was so close.

544
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,840
We were just shaking our heads.

545
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,840
It's another one of those things that we thought might bite us, but never did.

546
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,640
We were worried about wind tossing us around.

547
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,840
We were worried about, you know, the performance of the flight system not being what we expected,

548
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,960
but it was just dead on.

549
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,120
And we also got these pretty glorious color pictures as we were loft, you know, we were

550
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,360
up at five meters.

551
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,120
That has to feel like real tangible, you know, something you could take away from all of

552
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,220
this work is that that copter is up there forever now, but you have these pictures.

553
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,240
That's real tangible proof that you were successful in this.

554
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Yeah.

555
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,560
And the pictures came out really great.

556
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,120
And if you, if you go to the JPL website for the Mars helicopter, there's all these great

557
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,360
color pictures that we took and you can even see in one of them, this very cool.

558
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,200
You can see in one of them, cause it's sort of fish either you can see the edges curve

559
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,120
and we actually caught perseverance in one of our pictures.

560
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,760
It was off in the distance watching us with its camera and you could just see it at the

561
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
corner.

562
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,000
So there's actually this really cool picture where we're looking South when we're on that

563
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,200
flight three, when we're flying to the North and we're taking pictures sort of as we're

564
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,300
flying backwards and you can see in one shot, you can see the Rover off to the left.

565
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,880
You can see the helicopter landing spot in the middle.

566
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,280
And then to the right, you can actually see the place where the Rover landed.

567
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,760
It still has the blast marks from the rockets as they were landing.

568
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,880
You can look in the picture and you can see this scoured, these two scoured circles where

569
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,840
the rocket blasts scoured all the surface clean, just as the Rover was landing.

570
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,380
You get this great picture of everything all at once.

571
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,900
And so I'd encourage everybody to go look at that one picture.

572
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,000
If you look around, you can see it.

573
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,640
But that really proved that we can actually fly and it works.

574
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,920
And the Rover project saw these colour pictures and they were just like, wow, these are really

575
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,320
good pictures.

576
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,080
And so they said, you know, since the helicopter is doing so well, we're going to actually

577
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,560
propose this extended mission, if you will.

578
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,000
And it's really an operations experiment.

579
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,880
You can use that term where we're switching from just seeing if we can fly and surviving

580
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,180
to, well, let's try to fly around and act as a scout.

581
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:18,400
So we'll fly longer distances, we'll fly over more challenging terrain, we'll take pictures

582
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,160
and we'll bring them back down to Earth and we'll say, you know, how could a potential

583
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,760
Rover mission or other mission use these pictures?

584
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,060
And the Rover team doesn't need us as a scout.

585
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
They never did.

586
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:33,880
But they're still going to opportunistically look at these pictures and see, hey, maybe

587
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
there's something over there.

588
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Interesting.

589
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
Yeah, it's valuable data for them.

590
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Yeah.

591
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,320
So the idea is that we're going to start looking at, we haven't fully planned all the flights

592
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,440
yet, but we're going to start looking at these more distant features and locations to fly

593
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,440
over there and get some good shots with the colour camera and, you know, bring them back

594
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,760
and see how well they can be used by people to figure out, hey, there's a cool feature

595
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
there.

596
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,480
But we aren't going at the same cadence we did because during April, they dubbed the

597
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,900
month of ingenuity where we pretty much were the whole show.

598
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,440
The Rover was prioritized to work with us to get flights every few days to get the data

599
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,140
between that.

600
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:18,400
And they're actually moving on to their own mission, which is to start to explore that

601
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,680
southern area.

602
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,880
It actually helped because originally their plan was to do a sprint away from the landing

603
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:28,160
zone to get to what they call the Delta, which is where all these interesting geological

604
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,680
features are.

605
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,500
But they've decided in the meantime that they want to poke around to the south of where

606
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,320
they landed and look at some interesting stuff they've discovered down there up close.

607
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,000
So they, since they were loitering, if you will, down in that southern area for a while,

608
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
they said, well, why don't, you know, we're not going to drive away from the helicopter

609
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
for a while.

610
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,540
So why don't you guys do this operational experiment?

611
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,760
You won't fly as often.

612
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,360
We're flying probably once every two to three weeks instead of every four or five days,

613
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,680
it'll be more intermittent and they're deprioritizing our data.

614
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,700
Like for instance, for flight five, we're just starting to get the data down from the

615
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,080
vehicle because they're prioritizing their own science instruments, which we're totally

616
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,320
fine with that.

617
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,600
This whole thing is a bonus for us.

618
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,160
We're living within the new paradigm, which is let us do our own thing.

619
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,840
Maybe not as often while you're doing your thing on the rover side and see what we can

620
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
get out of it.

621
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,360
So we're going to probably be flying every, as I said, every few weeks and seeing how

622
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,960
well it works potentially through the summer.

623
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,920
Usually you pick up and move to essentially where the rover is going to be going to.

624
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Cause you would, I would imagine you have to stay within communications range.

625
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,080
Yes, we will stay relatively within communication range.

626
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,800
We found out that the, that's the other thing that we were worried about was we didn't know

627
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,760
what the radio performance would be.

628
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,360
We were worried that obstructions would get in the way that we'd have what they call a

629
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:58,200
multi-path where the radio waves bounce off things and cause interference with itself.

630
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,600
And what we found is the radio is performing beautifully.

631
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,580
It's almost amazing.

632
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,600
We actually keep a counter on the helicopter of how many packets were dropped.

633
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,560
So the helicopter attempts to send a radio packet to the base station and it's, if for

634
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,320
some reason it doesn't work, it tries again, it tries up to three times.

635
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,740
And during, I think it was flight five, we received our first single counter that said

636
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,720
that we had dropped a single packet.

637
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,920
So it's kind of mind boggling that over the entire project up to flight five, we didn't

638
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,800
drop a single radio packet.

639
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,040
Doing better than my wifi at home.

640
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,040
That's the truth.

641
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,520
It's kind of ironic that there was a couple of times when the internet connection failed

642
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,120
at home and I was, we were doing operations, talking to the helicopter on Mars through

643
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,840
my iPhone hotspot and the radio on Mars is working great, but not evidently my internet

644
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
connection.

645
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
Oh wow.

646
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
Infrastructure is hard.

647
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:00,640
Yeah, that is just, it's such an incredible story and it feels like it's a technology

648
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,640
success.

649
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,400
It's a human success and it's just been also a historic event to witness and I just, I

650
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,920
have so much gratitude and just want to say so much congratulations to you and the team.

651
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,120
Just remarkable what's happened here and I really appreciate you running down just some

652
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
of that with us.

653
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,640
I feel like I could talk about this with you for the entire day, but I know at some point

654
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,800
we have to bring it to an end, so Tim, thank you for joining us and updating us on that

655
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,200
little Linux Copter.

656
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,960
You're quite welcome and it's been great talking with you guys.

657
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,860
It's always good to talk to people who are space geeks like ourselves because we really

658
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,440
are space geeks living the space geek dream, right?

659
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,200
If you think about it, flying a helicopter on Mars, how many people will get to do that?

660
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,800
And so having me as a kid from a small town, being able to do something like this, it's

661
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,080
still hard to process sometimes that we're going to go down in history with people like

662
00:37:52,080 --> 00:38:00,000
the Pathfinder, the Voyagers, all these different amazing historical spacecraft and projects

663
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,440
and we get to take our place in that group that it's not a pride thing for me.

664
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,080
It's just a sense of amazement that I get to do something like this.

665
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,800
Linode.com slash unplugged.

666
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,320
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on a new account and of course you support

667
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
the show.

668
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,400
$100 in credit, well that lets you see why Linode is our hosting provider for everything

669
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
we've built in the last couple of years.

670
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,680
Linode's infrastructure is solid, it's flexible and you can focus on your project, not your

671
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
infrastructure.

672
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,000
You get 11 data centers to choose from around the world and every service level, every Linode,

673
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,600
every data center is just backed by the best customer support in the business and man,

674
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,960
when that matters, it really makes all of the difference.

675
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,080
And at every step of the way since 2003, Linode has asked themselves how they can use Linux

676
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,640
to accomplish their next task.

677
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,640
I know how that feels.

678
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,420
They have built on Linux in brilliant ways and they've contributed back to the Linux

679
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,000
community in a lot of brilliant ways too.

680
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,840
I love that their dedication to the platform is baked into their product and that's long

681
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,020
time Linuxers, that's a term.

682
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,080
You can really see it.

683
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,540
That's special when you're using a product and you can kind of notice that the company

684
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,640
behind it truly loves Linux.

685
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,520
I love picking up on those things and a few months ago, just as an example of how sometimes

686
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,520
I'll randomly use Linode for my own personal stuff, I wanted a cloud-based component to

687
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,500
my SyncThing setup because I like to sync between the studio and I like to sync to the

688
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:40,960
lady juke's RV and one sync server to another sync server, it works but it's kind of slow.

689
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,500
I want like more transfer so you can tweak SyncThing and you can really open up the flood

690
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,080
gates if you bring in another sync node.

691
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
So that's what I did.

692
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,640
That's what I used a $5 Linode for and now I kind of use it to do a couple other things

693
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,520
like jump posts and stuff but you know SyncThing, it's great.

694
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,840
It's a great open source project and it just transparently is moving my data at the file

695
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,840
system layer.

696
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,840
I don't even notice it.

697
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,360
It feels like I have a network wide file system and Linode is so fast and so reliable that

698
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,840
I move a ridiculously impressive amount of data that I'm kind of embarrassed to say and

699
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,120
they do it just with no fuss.

700
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,360
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged.

701
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,720
Get that $100 in credit for yourself.

702
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Go see what it can do.

703
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,540
Go try this stuff out.

704
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,780
Go build something and you know maybe learn something.

705
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,280
There's a lot of ways to host but there's no company like Linode.

706
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:37,640
Go see why we choose Linode every single time at linode.com slash unplugged.

707
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,540
You know Wes we have a few things to get to this week because we're going to be traveling

708
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,080
over the next couple of weeks and off the air so we have some details we should probably

709
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
cover.

710
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,880
You know we still need to find the keys to these chains.

711
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,080
I don't know if we're going to be able to leave the studio.

712
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,880
Yeah you know these podcast locks they're pretty tough.

713
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,240
So for the next two weeks we won't be live.

714
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,760
We do have some great content lined up and then we'll be back in studio all chained up

715
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,640
on June 8th.

716
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,280
In the feeds next week our AMA episode comes out and it was a lot of fun to record.

717
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,240
We did it with the LUP plug this last weekend and I think you're really going to enjoy it.

718
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,720
I was surprised at how great it turns out and you still have a chance to get your questions

719
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,760
in go to asklup.com or use the standard contact form at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

720
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,480
The LUP plug will continue on while we are traveling though every Sunday noon Pacific.

721
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,820
That's in our mumble room.

722
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,960
We have mumble information on our website and we have our calendar to get the live time

723
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,880
or the plug time at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

724
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,760
Oh I should have mentioned this earlier.

725
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,000
I made a thing.

726
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,240
I made a thing and I want to share it with you guys.

727
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,440
I made like a five dollar Linux can fly sticker to celebrate this incredible milestone that

728
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,720
Linux is flying on the surface of Mars.

729
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,120
The first rotocopter flight on another planet was made possible by Linux and free software.

730
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:05,520
And look at how cute this is bold brave on the surface of Mars.

731
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,600
I made this myself Wes.

732
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
What do you think?

733
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Are you impressed?

734
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:15,440
It is it's the rotocopter on a stylized version of Mars in a cut sticker.

735
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,300
So it's what do you call that kind of it's like a die cut sticker.

736
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,560
So it's got into the wings of the rotocopter or the blades.

737
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,520
It actually extends a little bit out so it's not a perfect circle and it really gives it

738
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,720
a really nice 3D depth effect.

739
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
Yep.

740
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
That's just five bucks.

741
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,400
So JB makes like probably a dollar eighty.

742
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,060
But if you're a member if you're a core contributor you can use the same promo code I gave you

743
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,720
a couple of weeks ago and it will take 15 percent off even this.

744
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,040
And it's at Jupiter Garage dot com and you can grab the Linux flies on Mars sticker that

745
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
I made myself.

746
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,240
I'm very proud of it.

747
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,280
And I totally ordered a couple myself because I want them around the studio.

748
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,160
This is every time I look at the sticker I'm going to think Linux and free software flew

749
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,480
on the fricken surface of Mars.

750
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
It's pretty awesome.

751
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,440
So I wanted I wanted I wanted a way to celebrate it and I thought why not make it available

752
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,800
for everybody at Jupiter Garage dot com.

753
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,320
So go check that out.

754
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,580
And I won't be mentioning it again because we're traveling and the shows are already

755
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:15,700
recorded so you just got to remember yourself I suppose.

756
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,880
And last but not least I'll mention the telegram will still be popping in there from time to

757
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,320
time even when the shows are pre-recorded and they're not live will still pop in there

758
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,720
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

759
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,760
OK so it's time for an exit interview with PeerTube.

760
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,240
It has been great.

761
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,280
We are so excited about the future of this project but we have some problems.

762
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,480
And so we have decided to make the tough choice about decommissioning the Jupiter broadcasting

763
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:53,080
PeerTube instance that we set up in episode 388 of the show so a little while ago.

764
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,800
Not something we do often or necessarily take lightly.

765
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,960
No no we generally don't.

766
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,000
We generally just keep it running and support it.

767
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,320
You know we we also want to this is really about refining the scope of software and services

768
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,160
that we maintain and not overdoing it and keeping what limited time we have invested

769
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,600
in the right areas.

770
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,000
And part of me just wanted to keep this going and just kind of experiment with it.

771
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,660
But I've been getting feedback about it and there's kind of this public perception that

772
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,920
if it's if it's online it should be a little bit more than it is.

773
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,200
So I have put up a longer explanation of our decision at Jupiter.Tube if you'd like to read

774
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,280
about this put just really kind of short though I think PeerTube is and should be the future

775
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,400
of decentralized video on the web.

776
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,040
There are other platforms out there right now but PeerTube is a pure peer to peer play

777
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,120
with no silly cryptocurrency that's going to be a problem for them down the road.

778
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,800
It's just a YouTube in a box that you can install yourself.

779
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,960
And I think it is good to go today for open source projects like like a distribution or

780
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,640
a community event that maybe wants to do a little live streaming and then make their

781
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,560
talks available online.

782
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,600
I think personally PeerTube is there and so this is not taking away from any of that.

783
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,120
It is an incredible piece of software and they only recently rolled out live stream

784
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,280
support and we were both very impressed with what they've done there.

785
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Oh yeah.

786
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,600
There are still some issues for our use case but just to add that at all in a in a project

787
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,920
like that including I mean initially web torrent support and then now they've got a new peer

788
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,440
to peer HLS based system that's fancy and they've got some really clever tricks with

789
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,400
FFmpeg in the back end which you know we love.

790
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,680
They do have some great great out of the box features that just make getting set up really

791
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,680
simple if you just want to pull in a few videos like an import feature from Twitch or really

792
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,020
anything that YouTube DL supports which is crazy fancy.

793
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:57,400
Really it comes down to when you're using it at scale on an ongoing basis for like you

794
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:02,860
know four or five shows plus two or three or four live streams and a team of more than

795
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,080
a handful of people and you start adding all these things together and it's kind of unclear

796
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,200
how you scale multiple shows across multiple channels.

797
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,160
Do you set up an account for every single show and like a network account for live streams

798
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,440
and then personal accounts for each staff member who's going to be on there and interacting

799
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,400
with the comments and interacting with their shows.

800
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,640
It just becomes an incredible amount to manage but it also becomes kind of cumbersome to

801
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,120
automate because there's like all of these little we have to go create this account do

802
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:35,840
this instead of just like an API that we can use to to just upload video productions as

803
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,440
our automation system completes them.

804
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,920
The live stream support is really solid but it's still a little tricky to use especially

805
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,720
if you want to have your live stream auto publish after you're done if for any reason

806
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,440
during a live stream if you drop PeerTube will not allow you to reconnect to that stream

807
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,680
and for some intermediate services like Restreamio when that kind of lockout happens they just

808
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,040
mark the entire RTMP feed as always bad you have to go delete the integration and reset

809
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,860
it up which is disastrous during a live stream.

810
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,940
And then really and this was what I was worried about when we started there's no great way

811
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:19,360
to mass import right so they have great ways to import maybe a YouTube playlist or you

812
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:25,720
just want to pop in a link or something easy but if you have a whole SFTP server full of

813
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,560
backlog and catalog it just doesn't even support that what we will what we would love to be

814
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,760
able to do is like some kind of directory import we could we could we could point it

815
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,120
at a at an FTP or SFTP URL or whatever it was maybe a text file in there that has some

816
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,360
of the metadata like name and description and then have it import 400 videos so that

817
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,160
way we could do a mass migration but they don't have anything like that there's no RSS

818
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,720
feed import either which would be really nice so that while the video import options are

819
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:00,600
good today they're just not as expanded as we need and so since it doesn't address all

820
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:06,320
of these use cases and we've also seen kind of a fade in adoption as people have kind

821
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:12,400
of went back to YouTube and Twitch we're gonna just take this moment to hit pause on it we're

822
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,240
gonna take it private we're gonna continue to have it installed and upgrade it and test

823
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,280
it privately and then when we think it's gotten to a point where we can support it fully and

824
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:30,340
and like go all in like just really go all in where we we publish every single show we

825
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:34,800
have channels that you can subscribe to if you just want this one show all of its tied

826
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,920
into our automation system we figured out the storage issue because storage does become

827
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,480
a problem even in our light testing we've already eaten up 30 gigs and we've only been

828
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:49,840
publishing two shows so you know all those little things have to be worked out and then

829
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,840
we're gonna make it public again and and try to go all in on it because I really do like

830
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,920
it I think it is very good software I think it's one of the more exciting free software

831
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,900
projects out there right now so it does hurt to not be able to just totally embrace it

832
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:08,940
right now but I have to be realistic about what our what our abilities are as a small

833
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:15,080
team and so what I've done is I've put together a page that goes into some more detail specifically

834
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,840
I talk about how I think they can maybe defeat the network effect that YouTube has and I

835
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,320
tried to link to the previous coverage of that I could find which looks like four previous

836
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,620
shows and I gave timecode links to those segments if you'd like to hear our past kind of discovery

837
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:34,280
of PeerTube to implementation of PeerTube and now to this phase for now and that'll all

838
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:38,240
be up at Jupiter dot tube I think we just found ourselves in a sort of awkward spot

839
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,240
of you not not being all in finding some rough edges that we weren't really prepared to necessarily

840
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,440
deal with or wait for the project to get to in time and we we liked it so much that yeah

841
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,280
if we're gonna use it we want to do it right we want to go all in we want to be able to

842
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,600
have it as a as a firm foundation for the future of Jupiter broadcasting which would

843
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,060
be really nice I mean it would be really nice to know like here's a spot we can put stuff

844
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,840
it doesn't matter if YouTube's gonna choose to demonetize it or censor it or take it down

845
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:07,280
for some other dumb reason we've got our own accessible catalog in a way that's a lot more

846
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,800
useful than some of the back you know the archive systems we have now but to do that's

847
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,440
gonna take a lot of work right it's gonna take investment and I think we have to evaluate

848
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,780
you know when the right time is to expend that energy but I am looking forward to continue

849
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,400
to play with it and already since we started using it they've updated and made a lot of

850
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:31,880
nice improvements and I'm sure that's going to continue mail route dotnet slash Linux

853
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,640
out a service that is going to make email a lot better for you for 24 years mail route

854
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,000
is focused on its core competence providing cutting-edge email security that's mail route

855
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,560
dotnet slash Linux we're using mail route for the new Jupiter colony mail server and

856
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:59,720
mail route can protect your mail server with a suite of services designed to remove spam

857
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,760
viruses and my favorite aspect prevent downtime and I know that sometimes it can be tricky

858
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,960
with your ISP perhaps they're blocking certain ports or trying to play tricky with your email

859
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,160
or maybe for some reason your server ended up on a blacklist and so it's not getting

860
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,720
email anymore it's just gone into the black hole yeah I hate that and I've had to help

861
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,760
clients fight that problem too I've deployed mail route for my clients in the past and

862
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,760
now I'm using mail route today and I want you to try it out at mail route dotnet slash

863
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,240
Linux it solves that downtime problem if you need maintenance or maybe you just have an

864
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,160
outage they will queue email up for you and then when your email server comes back online

865
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,680
they forward it right on they were the first to build an email filtering service back in

866
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:49,000
1997 and that's what they've been doing since they provide one-click migrations for both

867
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,480
office 365 and Google G suite and they have very simple onboarding realistically for any

868
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,240
mail server it's just you change a couple domain records you add a couple of settings

869
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,600
in the mail route service then you're good to go and you're getting real-time logs you're

870
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:08,160
getting they're filtering and you also get critical compliance for federal government

871
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,600
contractors and others that have to meet CMMC compliance so go check that out as well because

872
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,040
that can be a huge plus your account also includes controls to stop spam and phishing

873
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:23,320
attempts and viruses and get a whole heads up on all of that when you need it mail route

874
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,000
is there for you and they'll make email better so try out mail route today and get 10% off

877
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:47,640
mail route mail route dot net slash Linux we have a really great pick for those that

878
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:52,560
want super high quality music but want to host it themselves and are looking for something

879
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,720
to take them music off their server and get it on their desktop or maybe their mobile

880
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,920
client we have got a couple of great picks and this wasn't even inspired by the fact

881
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,280
that another music service announced their quote-unquote lossless audio streaming which

882
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,080
is all fine and good but I got I got a library full of flags with yeah exactly they might

883
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,360
have some things that that online service doesn't have for sure but how are you easily

884
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,960
gonna get access to them because not everything's happy with a flag file so there's a couple

885
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,800
of pretty well-known home media hosting software packages we talk about them pretty frequently

886
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:33,040
on this show and on self-hosted thing top of list is plex and jellyfin so let's start

887
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:39,440
with plex here this is how I'm solving this problem today and it's called plex amp plex

888
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,720
amp is a mobile app for iOS and Android and they have a Linux desktop app image which

889
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,760
I think is just like an electron app but it's kind of great that you can get it on your

890
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,880
Linux desktop and it is a dedicated app just for streaming music from plex it doesn't see

891
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,160
the other aspects of your plex library it looks like somebody created a dedicated music

892
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,960
app that just happens to use plex and it's beautiful it's it's clean and it's really

893
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,960
solid has a lot of nice features and I can even use it to play audio books off of my

894
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,860
plex server so that's plex amp and you can get it for mobile devices or over on app image

895
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:20,800
hub they have an app image of plex amp as well that's really nice and it does look beautiful

896
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:26,840
now for us jellyfin folk there's fin amp which looks relatively new and it's a little harder

897
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:33,320
to find it does support Android and iOS but it's not on the play store or the app store

898
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:39,480
you can find it in fdroid or build it yourself for iOS sounds like those things are coming

899
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,040
down the road I like that you got to work for it a little bit although I think we should

900
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,960
just make a sub pick right here fdroid we've mentioned it a dozen times on the show but

901
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,280
it's it's so important that on Android a alternative app store remain viable and I feel like just

902
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,880
as a vote for alternative app stores we should all have fdroid installed on our Android devices

903
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,420
and then you do get some great apps like fin amp f-i-n-a-m-p so you do have to have the

904
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,560
media server component for both of these running on your server this is kind of assuming you've

905
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,080
already done that but if you have this kind of just plugs right in and if you haven't

906
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,760
you really should because it's great to have your media automatically organized and available

907
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,960
and all kinds of devices and streamable to friends and family it just feels super cool

908
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:29,420
and it can often be the gateway drug into even more self-hosting so go check out the

909
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:37,400
links we have in the show notes at linuxonplug.com slash 406 for that also a shout out to one

910
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,600
password who has formally announced one password for Linux their password manager and it has

911
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,420
some cool details and they wrote up a blog post that goes into some of it and it is filled

912
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:57,440
with all the buzzwords you could hope for yes including our favorite rust you don't

913
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:05,520
say you'd almost think we plan it that way well maybe that's why we're talking about

914
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,780
it no no what's really nice here is to see them excited about Linux and actually they

915
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:16,840
took the opportunity of developing Linux support to build the new cross-platform foundation

916
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,560
for the rest of their apps I don't think they've actually updated them yet but sounds like

917
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:27,400
that's the plan yeah the front end is like a mix of web technologies TypeScript and react

918
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,840
is in there and including web assembly yeah yeah and then they as they put it west they

919
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,060
bundle it all together using electron that allows them to integrate deeply with the operating

920
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:43,120
system but before you go electron it's kind of rad because it's that acts as a front end

921
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:49,240
client to this like 99% rust back end they diagram the whole thing in this welcome Linux

922
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,720
to the one password family blog post where they even share pictures of the team with

923
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:59,440
their Ubuntu boxes like building the prototype apps and demoing it to each other it's all

924
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,720
kinds of adorable and while I'm very happy these days with Bitwarden I have fond memories

925
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:11,440
of one password but more importantly one password is more and more widely used in the enterprise

926
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,960
so this now means that an enterprise provided solution I've had an employer in the past

927
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,080
who just gave everyone a one password account as part of their security practices and now

928
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,380
that means Linux users can participate in that yeah you're no longer stuck to the web

929
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:29,800
client and I just thought it was cool to see them sort of knowingly talk about a lot of

930
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,060
the features out of the box like all the integrations with things like GNOME and KDE and the system

931
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:38,500
tray and clipboards and key rings and wallets now a lot of that stuff is made possible with

932
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,280
with electron but you can tell that they know that there are boxes here that they should

933
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:47,120
check off and that's impressive to me like this is not a lazy Linux port they've put

934
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:52,440
in a lot of time here yeah they really have very nice to see it thank you to our core

935

946
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,280
single week like a champ that's right like a news ninja he just sort of swings into the

947
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:57,520
studio on a Sunday lands in his chair and starts breaking it down you know it's kind

948

weeks you know I can't travel back in time and get him to change it what do you expect

951
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,060
that guy's probably I mean I hate to say it but he's probably not alive I know you were

952
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:22,040
thinking it I was thinking it too so what do you want me to do I can't do anything about
