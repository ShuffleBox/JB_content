00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
So Wes, what do you think of this concept of Linux speedruns? Oh, I'm hooked. I love it

00:04.400 --> 00:09.240
I mean, I don't know if I'm up for it without reading some manuals first, but I like the idea

00:09.240 --> 00:13.500
It wasn't it wasn't our idea. It was a post over at Rachel by the bay calm

00:13.500 --> 00:17.480
She's blogged quite a few times and this one caught our attention because well, honestly

00:17.480 --> 00:19.740
It's kind of a neat just idea on the surface

00:19.740 --> 00:24.680
you start with a minimal system and then get yourself to the point where you can do something meaningful like I

00:24.680 --> 00:30.580
Don't know download a picture from reddit or get in the IRC chat room like no nano no VI

00:31.040 --> 00:32.040
Maybe you get cat

00:32.040 --> 00:37.240
Okay, but you know certainly nothing like net cat or FTP or Ruby or Python or any of it?

00:37.280 --> 00:44.160
Can you build yourself up from a bare bones Linux? Yeah, you could do that or another speedrun example could be like go through a testing

00:44.320 --> 00:45.840
spree and

00:45.840 --> 00:50.080
Test the latest Ubuntu release or test the latest fedora and see how fast you can spin them up

00:50.080 --> 00:54.320
But go through a sequence of things and if you discover a bug report it and time yourself

00:54.320 --> 00:57.900
I wouldn't mind doing some arch install speedruns. I think we have West

01:09.160 --> 01:11.280
Hello friends and welcome to episode

01:12.200 --> 01:18.260
349 of your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there, Wes. Hello looking great today

01:18.260 --> 01:24.000
I'm sorry about the plexiglass between us social distancing you understand. Yeah, that's alright. I've got this nice suit on them

01:24.000 --> 01:27.320
It's comfortable. Yeah, I'm actually impressed. It hasn't affected your audio quality

01:27.640 --> 01:31.200
It's a special fabric. The mask is a little distracting West we have

01:31.720 --> 01:37.440
One of these episodes that it felt really appropriate. We're gonna do something. You should never do today

01:38.040 --> 01:43.360
Don't do what Wes and Chris are going to do. We're gonna build a server like you should not this is not a how-to episode

01:44.040 --> 01:49.800
We're going to expose a server to the public internet open up a telnet port and have you pound on it to prove the scalability

01:49.800 --> 01:55.840
Of a piece of hardware that we're going to be abusing in this demonstration. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun

01:55.840 --> 01:57.840
but we have of course our

01:57.960 --> 02:04.740
Steak and potatoes as well like community news and our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hello. Hello

02:09.120 --> 02:15.320
Happy happy Linux Tuesday. Happy Linux Tuesday everybody. Nice to see you back in there poppy

02:15.320 --> 02:17.160
Hello Brent has been a little bit for you, too

02:17.160 --> 02:23.640
And we have a great lineup there is 31 of our virtual lug in there right now. Wow, it's pretty great

02:23.640 --> 02:28.720
We love you all. Yeah, it's really nice to see you there. We had we had a really fun pre-show over at JB live TV

02:28.720 --> 02:34.600
We do the show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, but you can get that converted at Jupiter broadcasting comm

02:35.560 --> 02:40.200
Calendar, so let's start out with a little community news before we get into abusing hardware around here

02:40.240 --> 02:44.880
there's a couple of stories that caught our attention and so this wasn't was

02:44.880 --> 02:48.320
a partially inspired by our weekend activities

02:48.320 --> 02:53.680
It's a little steam update. It's been a while since we've had one of these it has it has in part

02:53.680 --> 02:59.840
It's both news and our weekend. It looks like really nice improvements for the 80 AMD

03:00.400 --> 03:06.080
Easy for me to say radion graphic driver in version 5.8 of your Linux kernel will be landing

03:06.080 --> 03:11.240
That'll be a good one lots of nice fixes in there and then also Nvidia just pushed out a new update

03:11.240 --> 03:18.640
That helps improve some recent game releases run on proton, which I thought was just noteworthy because

03:19.560 --> 03:24.640
Nvidia is specifically updating their driver to support proton now. Yeah, right

03:24.640 --> 03:27.240
I think a lot of this is for doom eternal and wow

03:27.240 --> 03:33.640
I mean something there's users complaining and Nvidia is actually being receptive. I guess I mean, this is like what is it?

03:33.640 --> 03:38.720
This is how it works on Windows. This is weird. This isn't this is just awkward. I think first class

03:38.720 --> 03:44.440
Yeah, so that's in the Nvidia version four dot four zero dot eight two stable long-lived

03:44.960 --> 03:49.320
Quote-unquote Linux driver a Michael Arbel over at for Onyx has some really good coverage

03:49.640 --> 03:54.720
But I think I just want to take a moment and check in with you guys because I know myself Wes and cheese have all

03:54.720 --> 03:56.720
Been playing some proton games recently

03:57.600 --> 03:59.600
before we get to that

03:59.880 --> 04:06.140
Popey mentioned some really interesting data on a buntu podcast just some numbers that he noticed when they covered it on a recent episode

04:06.140 --> 04:12.300
About the difference in graphics card usage. So yeah, I was reading the article and digging into the

04:12.940 --> 04:16.700
Usual Steam survey and it struck me just how many

04:17.740 --> 04:22.660
Machines in the Steam survey run Nvidia GPUs and I know it's anecdotally

04:22.660 --> 04:28.300
We talk about how popular Nvidia is but I hear a lot in the community people saying I am D is trouncing

04:28.740 --> 04:33.020
Nvidia and AMD is way more popular and they got much higher sales figures, but then when you look at the stats

04:33.020 --> 04:39.700
It's nothing like it. There's way more like multiple more Nvidia cards than there are

04:41.780 --> 04:43.240
AMD cards and in fact

04:43.240 --> 04:50.260
There are more people with integrated Intel cards than there are AMD cards according to the steam stats if I'm reading them correctly

04:50.500 --> 04:57.460
That's how I've read them too. I just assume it's people that are super casual gaming playing card games and simple games and hey

04:57.460 --> 05:01.060
I'll raise my hand. I'm one of them. There's not many the Intel graphics will do for me

05:01.060 --> 05:07.460
But there are some that's really interesting and I guess it's the video cards you have right sort of the reign of the default there

05:07.460 --> 05:12.380
It just struck me that I would have expected there to be some parity there

05:12.380 --> 05:18.460
I would have expected Nvidia and AMD to go toe-to-toe and have a similar spread of GPUs

05:19.100 --> 05:25.300
Across the board from super high-end ones that you know, the real gamers have down to the low-end entry-level ones

05:25.300 --> 05:31.900
But it really wasn't like that. It's just Nvidia from top to bottom and then a couple of AMD and a few Intel cards in there

05:31.900 --> 05:37.180
It's really fast. It's worth a look. You really really should go and dig into those theme stats. Sometimes they're quite fascinating

05:37.620 --> 05:40.860
What would your bet be for a year down the road?

05:41.460 --> 05:43.340
Much the same. I

05:43.340 --> 05:48.880
Don't see that everyone's gonna suddenly throw away like however many I can't remember the numbers

05:48.880 --> 05:51.860
But it was something like of the top 40 cards in the list

05:51.860 --> 05:54.860
60% or so were Nvidia

05:54.860 --> 06:00.980
I can't see that many people throwing away their Nvidia cards and replacing them with with AMD overnight

06:00.980 --> 06:03.500
I just can't see it. It'll be a long transition

06:03.500 --> 06:06.220
If so, it's more like a next build do you think about it?

06:06.220 --> 06:09.460
And if AMD is still really kicking butt then then that's probably the route you go

06:09.500 --> 06:14.660
Well, you can also pick up a 2080 right now. I think for right around five six hundred dollars

06:14.660 --> 06:20.140
So, you know that was a fourteen hundred dollar card six eight months ago. Yeah, yikes

06:20.140 --> 06:24.460
I'll take one if you're buying cheese. Yeah cheese if you want to yeah God dang

06:24.460 --> 06:31.060
That is I I would need to see hard data that proves that you have any real advantage with those cards under Linux

06:31.060 --> 06:36.220
I will I will couch that same perhaps maybe under Windows in certain circumstances for sure

06:36.220 --> 06:40.860
But I'm just not really sure if Linux games are fully taking advantage of it

06:40.860 --> 06:43.780
I'd love to see the data that says they are if you're gonna invest

06:44.700 --> 06:46.540
$600

06:46.540 --> 06:52.020
Just you could buy a whole computer for that and play on the graphics that it comes with and maybe not notice a huge difference

06:52.020 --> 06:55.620
I know that's old man Chris speaking, but but that frame rate Chris the frame rate

06:55.660 --> 07:01.740
So I've been playing over the weekend Batman Arkham City on proton and it's pretty good

07:01.740 --> 07:06.940
It's I I really actually don't have any complaints even on the e GPU. It's worked pretty well

07:06.940 --> 07:11.820
I've only played for about two hours. So I don't have a ton of experience. So perhaps it gets I don't know

07:11.820 --> 07:15.840
Maybe it doesn't work. Well, but this one's rated as gold on proton DB

07:15.840 --> 07:17.840
So I think that's to take it works pretty good

07:18.420 --> 07:19.740
Some people have had some crashes

07:19.740 --> 07:27.140
I have not but I love love love the amount of games that are available now via proton and when I spent a

07:27.420 --> 07:29.760
month on the Mac about a month ago now

07:29.760 --> 07:37.460
I was shocked that the Mac has such a crappy game selection, which I believe there's actually more steam users using the Mac

07:37.660 --> 07:39.660
But there's when you consider proton

07:39.660 --> 07:47.820
Way more games available for Linux and then when you add the fact that you can get a much wider range of gaming hardware

07:49.220 --> 07:52.100
Yeah, you're not just stuck on whatever man yeah, yeah

07:52.100 --> 07:57.820
It's way better on the Linux platform despite what the numbers may what a weird switch of scenario. It really is

07:57.820 --> 08:03.620
It's it's I mean fantastic. Yeah, totally. So what have you been playing? I'm playing risk of rain, too

08:03.620 --> 08:08.460
Well, I started off playing some tabletop simulator, which I'm pleased to note does have a native Linux built

08:08.460 --> 08:12.100
Which worked beautifully. I hadn't had steam installed for a while

08:12.100 --> 08:15.320
I like gaming but I'm very much a casual gamer when I have time, you know

08:15.520 --> 08:17.580
And as many folks are doing these days

08:17.580 --> 08:23.780
I was having a virtual video hangout with some folks and they were all gonna start playing I'd never played risk of rain 2 before

08:23.780 --> 08:28.940
It's a third-person shooter roguelike a lot of fun lots of fun enemies to shoot and kill super fun

08:28.940 --> 08:35.180
Yeah, and I was like, okay. Well, it's been a while since I tried proton. It's has platinum support over on proton TV

08:35.180 --> 08:38.860
Let's give it a go. Yeah, when you said you tried it and I looked it up on proton DB

08:38.860 --> 08:41.020
I said, oh so you must have had no problem playing this

08:41.200 --> 08:47.180
So this is where me being a little bit of a newbie to proton. Maybe wasn't the best. I had just reinstalled steam

08:47.180 --> 08:49.320
I'd you know installed everything I needed to go along with it

08:49.320 --> 08:53.680
I tried a couple other proton games and that worked this one the launcher would load up

08:53.920 --> 08:59.320
We'll scroll bar going, you know loading the game and then nothing just it even even sometimes it would say it was running

08:59.320 --> 09:01.480
But nothing showing up on my screen

09:01.480 --> 09:06.940
So I had to go dig in and try to enable logging and still nothing and eventually I found some post somewhere that

09:07.120 --> 09:12.400
Reminded me I didn't I didn't have the Mesa Vulcan drivers. Oh, yeah, so one little package and then it was perfect

09:12.400 --> 09:18.040
yeah, and some distributions make that a little more discoverable than others and there's other ways of

09:18.680 --> 09:22.360
Installing it that sometimes pull in some of those dependencies, right?

09:22.360 --> 09:25.720
Yeah, in this case, I was just installing steam right out of it. But so once that got

09:26.480 --> 09:30.400
No complaints at all and it even ran on this ThinkPad right here with integrated graphics

09:30.400 --> 09:35.040
I mean I did turn the settings down a little bit, but that was fine worked on the Intel chip, huh?

09:35.040 --> 09:37.440
that's right, so you're one of those numbers there and

09:38.720 --> 09:41.920
Like me your experience was probably like you would have no idea. This is a

09:42.960 --> 09:48.920
Not at all didn't have to mess around with wine or bottles or any of that nonsense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

09:48.920 --> 09:53.840
I know I love it so much. So what about you cheesy? What are you been playing? Is it on proton? Yeah, it's on proton

09:53.840 --> 09:55.840
It's platinum level. It's raft

09:55.840 --> 10:01.600
Essentially you float around on a raft try not to get eaten by a shark and you can play with I think up to four

10:01.600 --> 10:02.960
people no

10:02.960 --> 10:04.760
This sounds great

10:04.760 --> 10:06.320
It's a super fun game

10:06.320 --> 10:10.920
you build out your raft and you kind of float to these different islands and then eventually you can unlock a

10:11.720 --> 10:19.680
Radio that'll allow you to get beacons so you can direct toward different islands and you essentially just pick up ocean trash the entire game

10:19.680 --> 10:22.640
And build your raft with it. It's a really fun game

10:22.640 --> 10:29.840
works right out of the box. I haven't had any issues any crashes or anything like that running on top of a rx-580 and

10:30.320 --> 10:34.960
It's it's it's a super fun game. I played on with you know for hours on end with it and

10:35.760 --> 10:40.480
Never had any issues. You know what I'm thinking is we need to do a game sesh between you me and Dylan and

10:41.760 --> 10:46.400
You know get a little raft going this sounds like something he'd love game on. That was his birthday today

10:46.400 --> 10:51.880
His birthday today happy birthday Dylan Dylan turns 11 years old Wow

10:51.880 --> 10:54.960
which the thing that really blows my mind about that is

10:56.160 --> 11:00.960
It was right around when he was born that I was like, I'm going serious with with the whole podcasting thing

11:01.040 --> 11:04.160
So it's been 11 years since it's been my full-time job

11:05.000 --> 11:10.180
11 years full-time podcasting. Can you believe that that doesn't seem and in his world is totally normal, right?

11:10.180 --> 11:14.040
He's grown up with that like oh, yeah, my pops just a full-time podcaster. Yeah, he's got it

11:14.040 --> 11:19.640
Yeah, he's got this building we go to this his studio for podcasting. It's really it's really kind of it's kind of remarkable and

11:20.320 --> 11:25.760
He and I have been loving loving playing games via Steam on his laptop and I have it on my laptop and it's just been

11:25.760 --> 11:28.360
Awesome. So I'm really pleased with the state of proton

11:28.360 --> 11:31.460
I know there was some issues around like a development capacity for it

11:31.460 --> 11:33.460
But so far it really seems to be kicking ass and now

11:34.080 --> 11:39.760
Both AMD and Nvidia are spending resources on development time to make games work

11:39.760 --> 11:45.900
It's it's not perfect. It's not native games. It's not the ideal scenario

11:46.440 --> 11:51.640
But you'd be surprised how often weird abstraction layers like this exist in the gaming industry

11:51.640 --> 11:54.760
I mean, it's one it's just it's just very technically clever

11:54.760 --> 11:56.680
I'm very impressed with the work and two

11:56.680 --> 11:59.520
I mean it might be a good long-term play in the sense of alright

11:59.520 --> 12:03.500
Well, once you start seeing how many folks on Linux are willing to play these games once they work

12:03.720 --> 12:08.860
That's some good data for perhaps more native games down the line. So some really good game suggestions, too

12:08.860 --> 12:13.000
I really have been enjoying Batman Arkham City. It's it's a little bit on rails

12:13.000 --> 12:18.520
But at the same time you can fly around Arkham City and it gives you the instructions

12:18.520 --> 12:22.280
You need to feel like you're playing the game like a competent person when you're not necessarily

12:22.280 --> 12:25.220
So I like it if you're not of a serious as a gamer

12:25.720 --> 12:33.040
Risk of rain 2 was Wes's that looks like a lot of frickin fun and then raft which I'm installing after the show cheese

12:33.040 --> 12:39.400
There will have links to their proton pages and stuff in the show notes at Linux unplug calm slash

12:40.240 --> 12:45.600
349 if you've got any great picks yourself. Why not? Give us an email when it's unplug calm slash contact now

12:45.600 --> 12:52.440
There's some news that just broke that poppy brought to our attention before we hit record that Wes and I are still chewing on and it's

12:52.680 --> 12:58.680
Github's huge announcement that it is now free for teams Nat Friedman writes on the github blog

12:58.680 --> 13:01.680
We're happy to announce we're making private repositories

13:01.680 --> 13:03.840
with unlimited collaborators

13:04.680 --> 13:11.280
Available to all github accounts all of the core of github features are now free for everyone to use

13:11.560 --> 13:14.720
This means teams can now manage their work together in one place

13:15.240 --> 13:20.560
CICD project management code review packages all that and actually a whole lot more

13:21.200 --> 13:25.880
We want everyone to be able to ship great software on the platform developers love

13:26.000 --> 13:31.440
So this also very practically means I'm no longer paying a subscription for private repositories

13:31.440 --> 13:33.280
Yeah, you got a free plan now, but yo

13:33.280 --> 13:38.400
But you spotted a comment that Nat Friedman made about this on hacker news, which I think adds some context to this

13:38.400 --> 13:39.880
Yeah, he wrote

13:39.880 --> 13:42.960
We've wanted to make this change for the last 18 months

13:43.000 --> 13:50.440
But needed and this parts key needed our enterprise business to be big enough to enable the free use of github

13:50.680 --> 13:56.720
By the rest of the world in general. We think that every developer on earth should be able to use github for their work

13:56.720 --> 14:01.360
So it's great to remove that as a barrier. Is it a strategic move computer kid?

14:01.800 --> 14:05.600
That would make sense since they are very competitive

14:06.520 --> 14:13.800
Since Microsoft bought github get lab has been kind of gaining more users since a lot of people aren't trusting

14:14.400 --> 14:18.320
Microsoft and moving over to get lab. So it would make sense that they're trying to

14:19.160 --> 14:21.360
Get another one up

14:21.360 --> 14:27.840
It seems like a competitive move against get lab and just at the end of last month get lab moved a bunch of stuff

14:27.840 --> 14:32.200
You know that had previously been in there their private version over to the the free version

14:32.440 --> 14:38.280
There's also some good comparisons in that same hacker news thread around what things you might you know the difference between what what's free and get

14:38.280 --> 14:39.360
Lab what's free and github?

14:39.360 --> 14:43.680
So there's still some reasons you might choose one over the other and I'll also note there's been some

14:43.880 --> 14:46.800
Some nuances here as there always are sure it's cheaper now

14:46.800 --> 14:52.400
but for instance used to get if you had this this old pro plan you got a certain number of action minutes for the

14:52.400 --> 14:57.440
New github actions and on the free one while you get less and it turns out to get back to that same amount

14:57.440 --> 15:01.560
You probably have to pay two times the price. So great news in general

15:02.120 --> 15:04.600
Go check it out for whatever your particular needs are

15:04.600 --> 15:08.740
I think bitmux you make a good point that it's in Microsoft's interest for a lot of their other

15:08.880 --> 15:13.780
Ancillary service to get as many people using github as possible. Yeah, I was just thinking about it

15:13.780 --> 15:20.200
It's like well, we host code and we solve problems and we sell software and it's like I have a problem

15:20.200 --> 15:24.240
I think I'd like to see if there's a solution for it. Oh, I'll check my own product

15:24.680 --> 15:29.880
Good github. I'll look to see if somebody solved this problem for me and they're they're already been doing that for years and years

15:30.240 --> 15:36.160
But now they own the platform and so if they can bring the entirety of the world's development brainpower

15:36.720 --> 15:39.600
Under their under their roof. They'll take that. Thank you very much

15:39.600 --> 15:45.720
You could also say that this is a win for the open source community to some regard too because I mean this now allows

15:45.860 --> 15:51.080
teams and you know to possibly develop applications together where they might not have

15:51.480 --> 15:56.540
Been able to do that otherwise or just couldn't afford the four bucks the nine bucks a month to do so. So I

15:57.120 --> 15:58.260
mean

15:58.260 --> 16:02.700
I see it as kind of a positive move, but I can also see the Microsoft aspect as well

16:02.700 --> 16:06.520
And I've been following the whole github and gitlab thing for a while now

16:06.520 --> 16:10.660
So I don't think that that debates ever gonna go away personally, right?

16:10.660 --> 16:16.900
I mean, there's always the issue of it's easier now to use a proprietary platform and that is good and maybe a little bit bad

16:16.900 --> 16:20.020
too, yeah, but it does ultimately mean there's gonna be

16:20.660 --> 16:24.700
Probably more software developed and published online. That's more accessible to more

16:25.840 --> 16:30.180
So that's good. Seems like totally kind of a net win because it makes

16:30.180 --> 16:37.060
Get lab more competitive. It makes github more competitive. It's kind of a win-win and I also know

16:37.060 --> 16:40.060
You know some of the folks over it get lab jumped in the comments, too

16:40.060 --> 16:43.460
Of course, and it does seem like it's a friendly rival. You know, they're not out to get each other

16:43.460 --> 16:47.800
No one's slashing throats here. It's they're both making great products. There's use cases for everything and

16:48.380 --> 16:51.500
Thankfully, it's all powered by git. It's true. All right

16:51.500 --> 16:57.520
Well, let's look a little head because just around the corner is the release of a buntu

16:57.520 --> 17:01.000
20 Oh for we're cooking up a review right now

17:01.520 --> 17:03.520
weeks in the making

17:03.560 --> 17:08.880
Going deep on this one. The current target release date is April 23rd

17:09.600 --> 17:16.720
2020 so it's coming up just next week. So your Linux unplugged program will likely have its review next week for you right on the nose

17:17.400 --> 17:22.320
It's gonna feature Linux 5.4. And why your card is essentially

17:22.320 --> 17:27.680
Pre plumbed at least the holes are dug right West you actually got it going on 24 pretty easily

17:27.680 --> 17:30.240
Yeah, I mean the modules already ready for you

17:30.240 --> 17:33.880
So just you know mod for a wire garden away you go and then the you know

17:33.880 --> 17:40.360
The tools the wire guard tools package is just an apt install away. Yes, that's nice. It's right there in the repo also

17:40.880 --> 17:47.160
The snapshot system that's built into the ZFS file system that happens like every time you install a package

17:47.160 --> 17:55.220
things like that has seen a nice couple of tweaks including one that makes it much much much quicker to

17:55.280 --> 17:58.040
Go through the list of possible snapshots in grub

17:58.040 --> 18:02.640
and the way this works is you have just an entry in grub you select that and

18:03.080 --> 18:07.400
That will have all of the previous snapshots which you can boot from and we're talking a pretty dramatic

18:08.660 --> 18:10.560
like a hundred

18:10.560 --> 18:14.840
Seconds sometimes for something to load so well over a minute. What's wrong with my computer?

18:14.840 --> 18:17.600
Why won't it boom and now it's near instantaneous?

18:18.080 --> 18:23.560
Which is pretty great and I got some hands-on experience with that which I'll try to include in my review next week

18:23.560 --> 18:26.560
So it's coming pretty close Wes. I know I mean, you know still

18:27.000 --> 18:33.760
Experimental and ext4 is of course the default file system still but from when this option first appeared

18:34.200 --> 18:40.180
I'm really impressed and it's it really I think points the way to the glorious snapshot future that we might all have

18:40.180 --> 18:45.640
And probably I believe the testing week just wrapped up. That seems like it was pretty well attended pretty well utilized

18:45.660 --> 18:52.220
That was great. It was a community organized test week. We you know, we always have these test weeks, but we don't often have

18:53.100 --> 18:58.460
as much visibility and as many people participating and use of Phillips who's

18:58.900 --> 19:02.900
active in the ability community decided to take the bull by the horns and

19:03.660 --> 19:07.700
Did a whole lot of promotion invited a whole load of people from all the different ability flavors

19:07.700 --> 19:12.140
So the XFC flavors of one two and come on two and so on get them all on board

19:12.140 --> 19:15.900
so they all promoted it individually as a central effort and

19:16.420 --> 19:20.500
loads of people joined in and started testing this thing and we got a whole bunch of

19:20.700 --> 19:24.500
bugs reported as a result because you know who knew software has bugs and

19:25.460 --> 19:31.860
Put more work on the desktop team before the release a week before the release whoopsie, but yeah, it's really good

19:31.860 --> 19:37.340
It's really really good. It's a model that others could follow. I I love there was community started too. That's really great

19:37.340 --> 19:41.540
That's super cool. So we'll give you our take on that next week now

19:42.140 --> 19:43.900
before we get to

19:43.900 --> 19:50.140
Exposing our telnet server to the internet and releasing the hounds onto it

19:50.140 --> 19:53.320
We do have just a little bit of housekeeping

19:56.020 --> 19:58.820
So I start with some unfortunate news

19:59.660 --> 20:02.780
This week you may have heard that we have ended the production

20:03.460 --> 20:05.460
immediately of Linux action news

20:05.460 --> 20:07.460
choose Linux and

20:07.460 --> 20:09.380
user air which

20:09.380 --> 20:13.580
Really stings because I was a personal favorite podcast of mine. It just hurts. I loved user air

20:14.140 --> 20:16.140
but after a

20:16.260 --> 20:21.060
lengthy internal investigation a cloud guru management who owns

20:21.660 --> 20:24.900
The podcast Jupiter broadcasting who we are all employed by

20:26.140 --> 20:28.580
Determined that they had no choice but to terminate

20:28.580 --> 20:36.500
Joe Resington's contract with a cloud guru, which means he'll no longer be on any Jupiter broadcasting podcasts or

20:37.180 --> 20:39.180
employed by a cloud guru effective

20:39.860 --> 20:44.300
Immediately, so the ramifications of that are obviously pretty dramatic

20:44.940 --> 20:51.980
Not only do we have to immediately cease production on some shows which I've worked on and essentially for 14 years like Linux action news

20:52.300 --> 20:53.940
but it also

20:53.940 --> 20:55.940
Does have an impact on this show?

20:55.940 --> 20:59.980
Joe joined us. I think in the spring of 2018

21:00.720 --> 21:04.160
Took our audio from amateur to pro, you know

21:04.160 --> 21:08.240
It's when we went from a mixed to stereo track where everybody was talking over each other

21:08.240 --> 21:14.480
No edits right to multi-track polished sinking it up. You can tell I mean if you go back and listen to the archive

21:14.480 --> 21:16.480
You can tell immediately

21:16.920 --> 21:21.260
It's just I couldn't get it across the line on my own and I mean it wasn't just that I mean

21:21.260 --> 21:24.840
You know all the care he had for the audio the mastering the mixing that the sound

21:24.840 --> 21:29.920
But also the behind-the-scenes the production work the critiques of things we did wrong input on topics

21:29.920 --> 21:35.280
Mm-hmm. Yeah, so his mark will always be on the show and on that on that ring of shows that he had there

21:35.960 --> 21:41.680
But moving forward drew will be editing and I can genuinely say he's a fantastic editor

21:41.680 --> 21:45.440
it may sound slightly different, but I think it'll still sound great knowing drew it will and

21:46.600 --> 21:49.800
He if you've heard him on choose Linux, you've heard him on this show

21:50.240 --> 21:54.180
He's another one of these exceptional assets to our team much like Joe was

21:54.180 --> 21:55.460
and

21:55.460 --> 22:01.460
Drew will be taking over the editing of the show and I I have confidence in his ability completely

22:01.460 --> 22:06.620
but I just personally want to thank Joe for his time one of the things that he did that was special for the show is

22:07.300 --> 22:10.740
He worked and an unrealistic schedule that

22:11.220 --> 22:15.060
Meant that he was up until 4 or 5 a.m. To work on the show

22:15.060 --> 22:18.740
So that way we could get it out Tuesday night or Wednesday morning for people's commute

22:18.740 --> 22:24.660
You can't just ask someone to shift their timezone eight hours. Yeah, and he did it so that way the audience got the show as fast

22:24.660 --> 22:27.140
as possible in the best quality as possible and

22:27.860 --> 22:32.600
I think that's been something that we're gonna try to continue to do. You know, it's of course within

22:33.740 --> 22:38.540
Expectations of the team's capability now, but one one advantage that drew has is he's not in London

22:38.540 --> 22:40.700
He is he is actually here in the States. So

22:41.300 --> 22:46.100
That will help time zone wise but Joe made a statement on late night Linux

22:46.100 --> 22:49.140
Which I recommend you go check out at late night Linux

22:49.180 --> 22:54.860
Go go subscribe in your favorite podcast catcher because it's a great show anyways, but he covers it right there

22:54.860 --> 22:56.860
He says all that really needs to be said in

22:57.340 --> 23:02.820
That episode so go check that out for his statement. I mean, I think there's not much more that can be said to it

23:02.820 --> 23:04.900
Right. That is just what it is

23:04.900 --> 23:10.500
And I will be putting my focus from what I did some of the time I spent on Linux action news

23:11.100 --> 23:12.660
into the show

23:12.660 --> 23:17.060
One other adjustment that is happening is we are reducing the cadence of Linux headlines

23:17.580 --> 23:21.540
from every weekday to Monday Wednesday Friday and

23:21.940 --> 23:27.700
Some of the news that would have gone into LAN will go into headlines. So we'll just sort of divvy up some of that work and

23:28.620 --> 23:30.620
That is the state of things for now

23:30.740 --> 23:36.940
The plan is to keep trying to invest as much as we can in fact make Linux unplugged bigger and better than ever and that's our

23:36.940 --> 23:38.940
focus now going forward and

23:38.940 --> 23:45.460
I hope you will keep subscribed Linux unplugged comm slash subscribe and join us for the next series of episodes like

23:45.860 --> 23:50.260
You know as a team, we're just really trying to kind of put it all together still. It's still new for us, too. Mm-hmm

23:50.900 --> 23:55.580
I was not involved in the decision process. So I found out after it was official and

23:56.740 --> 24:02.700
Just kind of dealing with it as as we can and that's true for all of us. Yeah, so we're sorry

24:02.700 --> 24:05.420
It was you know, it's it's quick. Sometimes things go that way

24:05.420 --> 24:08.980
It's not how we would have planned it, but that's the world we live in. Yeah, that's that

24:08.980 --> 24:09.260
You know

24:09.260 --> 24:13.900
We are our intention is always and always will be to try to give you as much notice before we wrap up a show

24:14.220 --> 24:19.700
But one of the things I've learned about the media business is sometimes that it just does not work that way despite your best

24:19.820 --> 24:26.580
Intentions and I felt that way super strongly since the finale of Star Trek Voyager. Yes, right

24:26.820 --> 24:32.340
That was that is that is when I learned an important lesson that you need to brace yourself for the end of something you've been

24:32.340 --> 24:37.700
listening to or watching every week and from that moment, which is what 2001?

24:37.700 --> 24:41.620
I don't know from that moment forward. It has been a core belief of mine

24:41.620 --> 24:46.980
So we always will strive to give you as much heads up as possible. Sometimes it is outside our control though a

24:47.740 --> 24:49.740
little bit of good news though

24:50.220 --> 24:55.920
Our good friend Heather from side bite has rejoined us for a very special extra the resilience of the Voyagers

24:56.060 --> 25:01.300
These things were built to last the Voyager probes 42 years in county

25:01.300 --> 25:08.580
They probably won't be lasting much longer. In fact, we're about to enter a very crucial period where we will be dismantling some of these

25:09.200 --> 25:12.740
Infrastructures that are on the planets. Yeah, the big old radio telescopes

25:12.740 --> 25:14.740
so we will not be able to communicate and

25:14.900 --> 25:19.860
It's all detailed in the resilience of the Voyagers about how they were built about some of the special things about them

25:19.860 --> 25:25.020
I tell you what with everything going on right now. There was something about that episode. I found super inspirational

25:25.020 --> 25:28.580
So that's at extras dot show slash 70 right on the nose

25:28.580 --> 25:35.900
So great to talk to Heather again, too. She's the best so you gotta give that a go give that a go and then I want

25:35.900 --> 25:41.000
I want to also give a plug for something that's pretty neat that's developing in the community right now

25:41.220 --> 25:48.280
It's the luck plug our virtual lug is also assembling an extra day in the week on Sunday

25:48.820 --> 25:54.300
Sunday at noon Pacific that's when we would normally do the show our regular live time, but on Sunday

25:54.300 --> 26:00.900
This Sunday myself and cheese are gonna try to make in attendance. I think I'll be talking a little bit more about the hardware device

26:00.900 --> 26:03.740
We're using today. That's gonna be something I'd like to talk about

26:03.740 --> 26:06.940
I guess they did it last Sunday and they were saying it went for hours

26:06.940 --> 26:11.420
You know people come and go as they can so it's a virtual lug on the weekend

26:11.420 --> 26:17.660
If you can't make it on a Tuesday, the virtual lug is assembling on the mumble spot. You same spot same bat time

26:17.660 --> 26:22.220
It's just different bat day. And if you google search Jupiter colony mumble

26:22.220 --> 26:26.060
you'll get all of the information on how to connect just get mumble installed from your repo and

26:26.700 --> 26:29.300
Except the fact that the certificate has expired apparently

26:29.300 --> 26:31.900
I love that. We have another great reason to get the mumble set up

26:31.900 --> 26:35.860
You know like join the lug hang out and then you'll be ready to go for today

26:35.860 --> 26:40.540
I mean, I'm gonna be doing it maybe with like a sparkly beverage with my feet up at the RV

26:40.540 --> 26:44.620
I think that's how I'm gonna do it. It's gonna be like totally chillax. Well, and I love that

26:44.620 --> 26:50.140
This is spawned out of the community. So the community thought hey, let's get together and just have a have a lug

26:50.140 --> 26:56.020
And I think this will be a great opportunity for everybody to learn a few little things and from the the sounds of it

26:56.020 --> 27:01.740
There's no itinerary. It's just free-flowing. So everybody will get a chance to chime in. Sounds like a fun time

27:01.740 --> 27:05.500
It's just nice to chat with other people that know what you're talking about when you're talking about Linux stuff

27:05.500 --> 27:10.540
That's just that's just a great rewarding conversation. It'll be in the lobby of our mumble server

27:10.540 --> 27:16.860
So again, just google search Jupiter colony mumble or join the geek shed IRC IRC geek shed net

27:16.860 --> 27:21.340
There is now a hashtag lup lug geek shed channel

27:21.340 --> 27:25.580
That'll be going all the time. So IRC geek shed net hashtag

27:25.580 --> 27:30.620
lup lug and people in there probably help you get connected to the mumble room if you have any problems

27:31.100 --> 27:37.980
How great is that? Fantastic and it's just a quick mention for our telegram group at Jupiter broadcasting comm telegram

27:38.300 --> 27:43.260
That is the persistent universe of this podcast. That is where the conversation continues

27:43.260 --> 27:48.780
Even when the podcast is not being produced or released as well as conversations around the network

27:49.100 --> 27:51.100
Jupiter broadcasting comm telegram

27:53.500 --> 27:57.100
The persistent universe, you know, it's like an MMO but only chatting

27:57.820 --> 28:02.860
Something like that. So we're gonna do something that you really should never do. We are going to build

28:03.660 --> 28:05.660
what we think is

28:05.980 --> 28:07.420
near

28:07.420 --> 28:15.020
Ideal pine 64 rock pro 64 server grade setup. And I think this could be a candidate for

28:15.580 --> 28:21.180
Just about anyone's home server anyone who needs to maybe run some plaques some network monitoring

28:21.180 --> 28:26.780
Maybe a little authentication some name resolution some ad blocking. Maybe you want a self-hosted wiki

28:26.940 --> 28:33.980
Maybe a little home assistant all of these things on one device that takes 12 volts of power

28:33.980 --> 28:38.300
I mean, we know you've been a little bit obsessed with these, you know, I mean computer boards with arm

28:38.300 --> 28:44.540
You've got raspberry pies, I think basically everywhere in your I do and I was I really like the raspberry pie because it feels

28:44.540 --> 28:49.660
Like a platform that is well supported with a community around it, right tons of guides tons of images

28:49.660 --> 28:55.660
I think and you guys correct me if i'm wrong, but I think the second to that now has become the pine 64 boards

28:56.060 --> 28:58.380
You know, i'm happy to see that you're kind of

28:58.380 --> 29:04.300
Now falling into this addiction for single board computers. I've been dealing with this for quite some time now

29:04.300 --> 29:08.940
My shelf is full of these boards. But man, the rock pro board is one of the best boards out there right now

29:09.500 --> 29:14.860
A great great little machine. I'll tell you what put me over the top on it is it has a pci express slot

29:15.260 --> 29:19.420
So let that sink in for a second express by far man pci 4x

29:20.220 --> 29:21.260
and

29:21.260 --> 29:25.100
That meant that you could put a gigabit nick in there

29:25.100 --> 29:30.700
You could put a sata expansion card in there or you could do like we did again

29:30.780 --> 29:35.340
Not recommending you do this, but you could do like we did and you could get an mvm

29:36.380 --> 29:37.340
e

29:37.340 --> 29:41.180
pci adapter that will take an mvme drive and

29:42.220 --> 29:44.220
Click it right into that pci slot

29:44.780 --> 29:46.780
And then you're doing

29:46.780 --> 29:51.660
Like real data transfer speeds, right? I mean so this has been sitting around on the shelf for a little while

29:51.660 --> 29:56.220
We hadn't had a chance to really check it out yet. And so of course when we first booted it up on the sd card

29:56.860 --> 29:58.060
well

29:58.060 --> 30:00.620
It was slow. I mean it felt almost

30:01.260 --> 30:05.820
Somewhat perceptibly faster than the raspberry pi, but that's a hard thing to quantify at the command line

30:06.540 --> 30:09.740
It didn't really seem significantly better

30:10.140 --> 30:15.740
And then you combine that with the network effect and community effect or the raspberry pi and you start to think well, maybe a right

30:15.740 --> 30:19.020
I mean, you know, you have to find different images. There's like a you know, that's a little bit of a

30:19.020 --> 30:21.660
Process and they're you know custom builds from members in the community

30:22.140 --> 30:27.020
And on top of all of that, how do you tell performance when everything's waiting on the desk? So the rock pro

30:27.580 --> 30:31.100
64 is special in a couple of ways. It has

30:31.800 --> 30:37.920
ddr4 ram lpd ddr4 ram so it's faster ram than what's on the raspberry pi. It has gigabit ethernet

30:38.220 --> 30:40.220
It has an emmc module slot

30:41.100 --> 30:45.020
It has a full-size 4k support hdmi video out

30:45.020 --> 30:48.540
It has usb 3 it has usb 2

30:49.340 --> 30:51.100
and it has

30:51.100 --> 30:54.380
the 40 gpi opens you'd expect as well as

30:54.940 --> 30:59.900
That pci slot we mentioned and a real-time clock. Okay, that's actually also worth mentioning isn't it?

30:59.900 --> 31:01.900
Because the pi doesn't have that does it right?

31:01.980 --> 31:05.500
So that's also uh, kind of great and kind of nice and cheesy

31:05.580 --> 31:08.620
You have been sort of trying to get me to try it out for a while

31:09.340 --> 31:12.300
And I think the part that where you're trying to get me to try it out for a while

31:12.300 --> 31:17.900
And I think the part that where you convinced me was when you showed me like some of the nas boxes people are building with

31:17.900 --> 31:22.780
This thing pine themselves actually sell a nas case that you can buy but

31:23.340 --> 31:27.520
There are all there are tons of 3d printed cases out there for the pine 64

31:28.460 --> 31:32.540
And I think really what it comes down to is adding that pcie lane breaking that out

31:33.100 --> 31:36.700
Really kind of expands what you can do with this board and you know

31:36.700 --> 31:40.780
Just like you said this would be the perfect board even if you just slapped a couple of sata drives in

31:40.780 --> 31:45.100
The nas case I think will support uh, two three point fives or two two point fives

31:45.500 --> 31:47.900
perfect for your little home file storage or

31:48.460 --> 31:52.380
Home assistant or any any sort of you know, shinobi or anything like that

31:52.380 --> 31:57.980
This would be the perfect box for that. This probably would be a lot better box for my for my shinobi setup at the rv

31:58.540 --> 31:59.980
So let's get into the setup here

31:59.980 --> 32:04.460
I want to give you a price range and I I want to challenge you that if you're setting up a home server

32:04.460 --> 32:06.620
That is based on an x86 box right now

32:06.620 --> 32:12.540
And you don't have more than 12 people living in your home. You need to really seriously consider what i'm talking about

32:12.540 --> 32:18.140
But don't do what I do, but you should think about it. So the rock pro 64 4 gigabyte

32:18.780 --> 32:22.620
System is 80. I'm rounding up here in all these numbers. I'm rounding up

32:23.420 --> 32:29.820
A power adapter which it will not come with will cost you 12. You need 12 volt 5 amp power adapter non-switching

32:30.380 --> 32:32.380
I bought a 250 gigabyte

32:32.380 --> 32:38.780
I bought a 250 gigabyte mvme western digital blue drive standby on why I went blue

32:39.960 --> 32:41.340
$55

32:41.340 --> 32:43.500
And then the mvme pci adapter

32:44.600 --> 32:45.820
$11

32:45.820 --> 32:52.700
So my total rounding up for all of this for a system that I think would compete with a nuke for most home server uses

32:54.120 --> 32:58.940
150 us greenbacks 150 total all in for a system

32:59.980 --> 33:01.480
that is

33:01.480 --> 33:08.060
remarkably performant and the other nice thing about the rock pro 64 4 gigabyte board is it is designated by pine 64

33:08.700 --> 33:13.420
As a long-term support board, so they're committing to supplying it for five years

33:13.660 --> 33:19.500
So that's until 2023 at least which is maybe one of those factors that helps build the community of people using it

33:19.820 --> 33:27.100
When you add in this 11 dollar pcie adapter and then you just snap in the blue and I went with I went with the one

33:27.100 --> 33:30.380
I'll have linked in the show notes because it supports the western digital blue drives

33:30.380 --> 33:34.900
And I think possibly according to their wiki the pine 64

33:35.300 --> 33:39.300
Pci mvme adapter does not support western digital blue

33:39.300 --> 33:42.460
The reason I opted to go for blue is they have a good life cycle

33:42.460 --> 33:49.580
But also you're not gonna get the full beans with this disc on the pine 64

33:49.700 --> 33:54.580
The reality is the PCI bus is limited to such that you're gonna get good performance

33:54.580 --> 34:02.020
But you're not gonna get high-end MV me performance. So here's the numbers you're gonna see it essentially works out

34:02.020 --> 34:05.780
What did we decide? What do we figure out was a 30 30 times speed difference about?

34:05.780 --> 34:06.020
Yeah

34:06.020 --> 34:10.820
when we switched from an SD card to this MV me drive that

34:11.180 --> 34:15.620
Took an $11 adapter and then a $55 West digital blue off Amazon

34:16.020 --> 34:19.440
We went from a 22 megabyte a second transfer rate

34:20.060 --> 34:22.060
to around

34:22.060 --> 34:26.900
110 615 megabytes a second on average and it peaks above that and

34:27.620 --> 34:33.820
When you open up the disk, I owe like that all of a sudden you truly appreciate

34:34.140 --> 34:42.140
What the rock pro 64s CPU is actually capable of it is truly IO bound by that SD card or eMMC

34:42.140 --> 34:47.420
I would assume and you just open up the floodgates. It's remarkable what you can achieve

34:48.060 --> 34:51.660
And so we thought we'd have a little bit of fun with it here on the podcast, right?

34:51.660 --> 34:53.660
I mean you said you wanted us to use it as a server

34:53.820 --> 34:59.500
So we thought why not set something up on telnet that we could give out to folks that they could they could connect to

34:59.580 --> 35:05.820
So are you ready for me to give out the URL? Yeah. All right, so I would encourage you if you're listening live right now

35:06.700 --> 35:14.740
Let's see how many connections this pine 64 rock pro 64 running off an MV me can take what we have here in

35:15.100 --> 35:16.940
a container

35:16.940 --> 35:22.580
Because what else would it be is I believe it's the Star Wars new hope in ASCII

35:22.580 --> 35:26.340
That's right the famous one, you know, you can see we've got a self-hosted version

35:26.340 --> 35:32.440
So, let's see how many ASCII streams of Star Wars the new hope we can get going right now chat room

35:33.100 --> 35:38.220
Telnet to telnet Linux unplugged calm everyone telnet

35:38.860 --> 35:41.940
Linux unplugged calm launch it up right now

35:41.940 --> 35:48.780
Additionally for yeah, people are joining are they all right, I'm gonna open up two over here. Oh, yeah. Okay. I got mine going, too

35:49.220 --> 35:52.220
Now if we can't bring this thing to its knees

35:52.980 --> 35:55.820
We have prepared a punishment script

35:55.820 --> 36:04.140
Oh God that will spawn hundreds of telnet sessions and start this thing now in our original tests off air

36:04.500 --> 36:09.980
We were only able to test against the SD card, which was intrinsically bound by disk.io

36:09.980 --> 36:12.380
I mean every time you'd launch a new client you'd be like, all right

36:12.380 --> 36:15.860
Well, I'll wait for it to read the text off the disk. All right, give it a go

36:15.860 --> 36:21.580
I am currently getting the Star Wars scroll right now same. Yeah, I got to say no

36:21.580 --> 36:24.700
We've got I mean looks like like 20 plus already. All right, and

36:25.660 --> 36:28.100
Let's how's it doing in that? Let's bring up the net data. Wes

36:28.620 --> 36:31.980
Let's bring up the net data. So Wes and I are both monitoring on net data right now

36:32.540 --> 36:38.620
Now you got to imagine this thing is rendering this ASCII out and then spitting it out over telnet to how many over 20 plus

36:38.620 --> 36:45.420
Sessions, right? It's not it's gotta be 30 now. It's not a super complicated task, but it's a significant task and right now

36:46.100 --> 36:48.100
it's sitting at a

36:48.300 --> 36:53.740
Range of 8 to 14 percent CPU usage Wow, and every time it's doing this

36:53.740 --> 36:55.940
It's spinning up a whole bunch of Python in the back end

36:56.700 --> 37:03.180
Reading these files. It's it's actually a kind of an IO heavy workload surprisingly on the back end

37:03.580 --> 37:07.320
But we're not even we're not even really cracking 14 percent 11

37:07.320 --> 37:09.320
11 percent CPU usage right now

37:10.320 --> 37:17.480
22 percent RAM usage a consistent near 3 megabits of telnet data is coming out of this thing right now

37:18.640 --> 37:21.380
Pure text pure 3 megabits of text

37:22.480 --> 37:29.160
Do you want to launch the punishing scripts? Oh, oh do I let's do it now this script will launch

37:29.840 --> 37:35.180
hundreds of telnet sessions at the pine 64 rock pro 64

37:35.180 --> 37:38.500
We just peaked up to 24 percent there for a second

37:38.620 --> 37:44.060
I'm curious. Do you have a rough guess on how many connections we have there because we just hit 30 percent there for a second

37:44.060 --> 37:46.060
Yeah, looks like well, let's let's pop over here

37:46.740 --> 37:50.780
I mean, it's it's gotta be 40 50 my movies still streaming. Yeah, man

37:50.780 --> 37:55.380
Hey, what do you expect that we get thrown out of there? So the telnet session is closing or what?

37:55.380 --> 37:57.380
I don't know if it's gonna freeze up or

37:58.180 --> 38:02.500
If our internet connection goes first, I'm curious to see which one it is

38:02.500 --> 38:08.220
We're up to 32.2 percent 32.6 percent. Actually, it's climbing pretty pretty fast

38:08.380 --> 38:12.140
We're now at 33 percent RAM usage seems a little slower

38:13.020 --> 38:18.460
35 we almost just cracked 40 percent load 200 additional telnet clients

38:21.260 --> 38:24.060
Just hit 44 percent. Oh, yeah, okay

38:24.660 --> 38:30.780
So now we have like like what nearly 300 telnet sessions coming off this thing. I think it's getting slower now

38:30.780 --> 38:33.980
I'll tell you my laptop is handling it poorly. Look at this

38:33.980 --> 38:38.220
You can really start to see the load average increase on the box. Now. It's starting to get cooked. Oh

38:38.700 --> 38:42.460
We just hit 45 percent. I think the internet connection is gonna go

38:42.500 --> 38:47.780
Do you have passive cooling on that one or do you have some kind of ventilation just passive?

38:48.380 --> 38:53.980
It's gone up not too much. It started around like 46 or so and now it's up to 52

38:54.060 --> 38:59.060
It's just out in the open. Like I said, don't build it like this. I think if I was gonna build this for real I

38:59.060 --> 39:04.780
Would probably probably try to get some sort of cooling solution on it, but I'd want it to still be quiet

39:04.780 --> 39:08.020
So it'd have to be somewhat passive, but there's no heat sink or anything on it right now

39:08.020 --> 39:11.740
I didn't get anything like that on the box. So we're just using it out of the box. Whoa

39:11.740 --> 39:16.940
Oh, oh, we just hit 54 percent there on the old usage. Look at the net data charts

39:16.940 --> 39:18.940
It's really starting to get up there now. I

39:19.300 --> 39:24.400
Wonder if I could see how many network connections we have will it tell me? Oh my gosh

39:24.400 --> 39:26.400
Oh

39:27.520 --> 39:29.520
Holy crap

39:29.620 --> 39:35.440
We have over four hundred and four hundred nineteen active sessions right now on this box

39:35.760 --> 39:40.680
Look at that line just rocking up there and this thing's still going. I

39:41.840 --> 39:44.500
Don't know if we can kill it. I don't know if we can do it

39:44.500 --> 39:48.480
Do you know in that laptop handle? Can you launch another 200? I can try

39:48.480 --> 39:54.440
Doesn't seem very convincing there. We're running into the limits of what West's think-pack can handle. What do you think Wes?

39:55.440 --> 39:59.920
All right, launching if anybody listening live has a way to spawn multiple telnet sessions

40:00.640 --> 40:05.000
Go ahead and do it. Just give us the number in the chat room so we can do it. I've got like 60 of them. Go. Yeah

40:07.480 --> 40:12.120
Yeah, one easy way to view if you launch a whole new terminal telnet can be a little fussy to run in the background

40:12.120 --> 40:16.480
But if you just launch a whole new terminal and find whatever your terminal is for console stash

40:16.480 --> 40:20.520
II and you can pass in the telnet command. So now we're at 47% 45%

40:21.160 --> 40:26.920
We're almost halfway pegged. It's really impressive. We're at 61% ram usage now

40:27.520 --> 40:31.480
We did hit a hundred and thirty megabytes a second on the disk IO for a brief moment

40:31.480 --> 40:37.320
But it's settling down now because I think the batch of sessions is has settled. Isn't that impressive though? I think I think

40:38.160 --> 40:41.640
Point may I mean you have nearly I wonder if we could see again

40:41.640 --> 40:46.640
I mean the number of connections is just staggering at this point five hundred active connections

40:47.000 --> 40:50.760
Could you imagine doing this back in the day? Oh, we're up to like five megs

40:51.760 --> 40:56.760
Your text goodness five megs of pure text. How about that? Isn't that something?

40:57.760 --> 41:01.160
Well the pine 64 rock pro 64 gets

41:01.800 --> 41:05.360
My such a solid nod of approval after this modification

41:06.080 --> 41:07.280
that

41:07.280 --> 41:13.120
This is what I'm buying from now on. So the other nice part is I just SSH back into the box and you can't tell anything

41:13.120 --> 41:16.480
Right, so it's not like it's a horrible experience for the admin while this is going on

41:17.640 --> 41:21.640
Wow, wow, wow, wow, you guys can keep throwing at it if you want

41:22.360 --> 41:23.480
but

41:23.480 --> 41:26.560
This is this is a game changer as far as I'm concerned

41:26.560 --> 41:32.200
I mean, it's just for the power and the price and all of that. It's just it's remarkable

41:32.200 --> 41:39.200
So Wes, we did a real quick brief modification to start loading the system off of the MVME

41:39.200 --> 41:44.920
Versus the SD card. So job one was to attach the MVME format it

41:45.480 --> 41:52.200
Label it and then our sink over the SD card to that excluding like, you know proc and things like that

41:52.880 --> 41:57.040
But then there was another tweak that we had to make to get it to actually load from the MVME

41:57.040 --> 41:59.680
Yeah, and maybe here's a good time to mention that we're running in Mutt & Jones

41:59.680 --> 42:03.940
Yeah, and maybe here's a good time to mention that we're running in Manjaro arm on this thing. Yes

42:04.400 --> 42:07.160
Thank you. It started out with army and and that was working. All right, but

42:07.720 --> 42:09.720
Manjaro has been such a dream

42:10.160 --> 42:16.320
Partially because it already had kernel 5 6 ready to go working perfectly and that also man

42:16.320 --> 42:20.320
It was really easy right now. We're funneling this through a droplet back here so that you don't get the studio

42:20.320 --> 42:22.120
I yeah, it's just over wire card

42:22.120 --> 42:26.320
that's a nice little advantage to using Manjaro on the pine 64 is

42:26.320 --> 42:30.000
That the latest kernel means wire guards ready to go

42:30.000 --> 42:34.500
And so you guys have all been doing this through you're going through a wire guard connection. You didn't even know it

42:35.720 --> 42:39.880
So on top of that it's handling the crypto for wire guard like a freaking champ

42:39.880 --> 42:43.960
I might add so we that's really impressive and it's meant that you know

42:43.960 --> 42:46.960
All the various tools we needed getting you know Docker up and running

42:47.320 --> 42:52.760
Getting the benchmark tools we were using going all that was easy because it was just right there in the repo. Yeah, and

42:52.760 --> 42:55.600
with them focusing on the

42:56.400 --> 42:58.080
pine book

42:58.080 --> 43:03.200
Which is essentially the same internals as far as I understand it. It means that this thing's pretty much ready to go

43:03.200 --> 43:06.380
So we grabbed I think it was actually labeled the pine book image for those

43:07.260 --> 43:11.560
Which has worked just fine to get it actually running on the nvme was surprisingly easy

43:11.600 --> 43:16.560
It looks like they're using the ext Linux bootloader at least as part of the boot chain

43:16.560 --> 43:22.460
So really all we had to go do was modify ext linux.com and change, you know at the start

43:22.460 --> 43:25.560
It's just it's just a label brute. So it finds that on the SD card

43:25.560 --> 43:30.080
We just repointed that at the nvme drive and no problems that I mean we were a little skeptical

43:30.080 --> 43:34.560
We hadn't tried this before and we're both not that familiar with some of the booting on these ARM systems

43:34.560 --> 43:36.000
I figured it wouldn't work

43:36.000 --> 43:41.680
We'd have to pull the SD card off and you know change things around a couple times worked first time flawlessly. Yeah, and

43:42.640 --> 43:46.400
We knew instantly because it booted in a blink

43:46.940 --> 43:50.200
We put it so fast. We're like, oh well that that had to be it

43:50.200 --> 43:55.120
And of course we logged in and immediately confirmed it and I just I got underscore all of this for

43:55.600 --> 44:00.260
150 US greenbacks off Amazon or wherever you get your pine pine rock pro 64

44:00.640 --> 44:03.920
So man Jarrah was pretty great having wire guard in there is really nice

44:04.000 --> 44:07.680
There's also a bunch of other OS as though cheese you told me about arm being recently

44:07.760 --> 44:10.520
Yeah, so there's arm being it's out there that

44:11.000 --> 44:17.800
You know is developed for a lot of these other boards, but there are a ton of other builds available for this rock pro 64

44:17.800 --> 44:20.440
I mean if you want to get your slack wear on your

44:21.200 --> 44:24.400
Open media vault might be a great solution if you're gonna use this as a NAS

44:25.040 --> 44:26.560
centos

44:26.560 --> 44:28.200
Manjaro obviously

44:28.200 --> 44:30.200
Straight-up Debian if you want

44:31.560 --> 44:33.560
You know, I would like to see maybe

44:33.880 --> 44:35.800
Punishing it with other things as well

44:35.800 --> 44:39.600
Like I don't know throwing a mumble server on there seeing how many we could get on there or something like that

44:40.040 --> 44:42.040
You're getting you know

44:42.280 --> 44:44.280
610 megabits a second

44:44.280 --> 44:49.640
Read write on the disk compared to the 22 that you were getting off the SD card

44:49.760 --> 44:52.680
You'd probably get anywhere from 100 to 150

44:53.200 --> 44:58.440
Off an eMMC module, but at that 610 that you're getting off the NVMe

44:58.500 --> 45:03.760
You could go with an SSD might be a little bit less expensive if you wanted to double up drives

45:04.240 --> 45:08.500
Might cost you a little bit more money, but you're gonna run around the 500 megabits a second

45:08.500 --> 45:14.400
Speed on that so you are gaining a little a little bit by using the NVMe and I'm sure

45:14.620 --> 45:22.200
Like you said whenever you initially logged in you immediately were able to tell the difference the pine folks. They sell a rock pro like compatible

45:23.140 --> 45:27.780
SAT adapter that has two ports on it. So you could easily probably do that. That's a great. That's a great idea

45:27.780 --> 45:30.460
I wasn't really clear on what kind of performance I was good

45:30.460 --> 45:36.980
I didn't I was just gonna be happy with several hundred megabytes, but I'm pretty thrilled because it's peaked above 600, too

45:36.980 --> 45:41.700
Which is nice. I'll tell you what. I'm building everything with this for my home server stuff. I'm gonna keep my pies

45:41.700 --> 45:46.240
I think they're great. But in the future, I'm just gonna use these they're just that much faster

45:46.240 --> 45:51.240
the PCI slot means that I could use them for different tasks Wes and I are already kind of

45:51.660 --> 45:53.660
Thinking about how great you could

45:53.660 --> 45:58.240
Really build a router out of this thing if you just put a nice gigabit Nick in that PCI slot

45:58.240 --> 46:00.980
Yeah, I think over the weekend. I saw Ryan Huber

46:01.420 --> 46:05.100
One of the nebula depths we've had on the show and he's got himself a little PI router

46:05.100 --> 46:10.280
This seems like it'd be a great upgrade for that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, especially because it'd be out right there on the PCI bus

46:10.340 --> 46:15.060
It's sort of it sort of sets my benchmark now for any kind of small board computer

46:15.060 --> 46:21.420
It needs to have PCI Express like this is the game changer for me when it comes to these devices

46:21.940 --> 46:25.540
And manager has been super solid on there. I look forward to also trying to boot too

46:25.540 --> 46:29.180
I don't know if but is there an Ubuntu image for I don't think oh no I did

46:29.180 --> 46:32.420
I said I know for one at least I haven't seen a 2004 one

46:32.420 --> 46:38.380
One of the things the pine 64 folks have is I think it's a fork of etcher

46:39.020 --> 46:45.280
That just downloads images that are compatible with the pine 64 that you so you select which one you have

46:45.480 --> 46:50.660
Which model of device you have and it downloads the image and then writes it for you to an SD card

46:50.920 --> 46:53.820
Which makes it really simple. I mean, it's pretty big difference

46:53.820 --> 46:59.540
I mean an average of 610 megabytes a second versus 22 and then you're really fueling that processor

46:59.540 --> 47:01.540
you combine that with the gigabit Nick and

47:01.540 --> 47:06.740
It's remarkable what Linux can do on a computer that costs

47:07.500 --> 47:13.380
$80 to make this all happen. We discovered a handy little open-source Python program called ASCII tell that server

47:13.380 --> 47:16.220
Yeah, it does exactly what it sounds like so we didn't have to go

47:16.220 --> 47:22.100
You know hammer some other person's server and it's a pretty simple little Python script ready to go in a Docker container

47:22.100 --> 47:23.740
And if you want to try yourself

47:23.740 --> 47:24.660
Just hit the show notes

47:24.660 --> 47:30.860
Why wouldn't you so everybody kind of calmed down on the old server punishment and then Alex got in on the fun

47:30.860 --> 47:35.020
And he spawned a thousand sessions and for a second there

47:35.020 --> 47:41.500
We just hit 60% load when he after he spawned a thousand telnet sessions to this thing 10,000 sessions

47:41.780 --> 47:43.620
Well, I'm sorry what?

47:43.620 --> 47:50.540
10,000 sessions at least that's what his numbers say. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. Oh my gosh. That's a lot

47:50.740 --> 47:55.380
It really is impressive. It's it is using 74% of the RAM now

47:57.060 --> 47:59.300
And it is definitely loading up the CPU

47:59.300 --> 48:00.300
Oh

48:00.300 --> 48:05.020
Man, that is really nuts. Look at that thing go. It's hitting that disk, too

48:05.100 --> 48:09.140
That's fascinating every time a new batch starts the disk IO really kicks up

48:09.140 --> 48:14.260
Yeah, there are some optimizations that could be had in this Python program. Yeah, but it seems like it's really delivering

48:14.260 --> 48:18.260
so that's pretty neat that was fun. Thank you everybody for participating and

48:19.460 --> 48:23.180
Don't do what we do. But if you do, I think you're gonna be impressed with the results

48:23.180 --> 48:28.760
All right. How about some app picks before we get out of here? This is one

48:28.760 --> 48:31.860
we've been kicking around for a couple of weeks, but we finally had a chance to

48:32.820 --> 48:35.940
Sneak it in its beats and not the headphones

48:36.100 --> 48:42.740
So yeah this week beats with its cute little beat icon is a media library management system for

48:43.100 --> 48:45.340
Obsessive music geeks is how they label themselves

48:46.420 --> 48:52.060
Basically allowing you to pull all the metadata from your collection of music or media files

48:52.060 --> 48:57.580
Allow you to easily tag those with music brains discogs a beat port

48:58.340 --> 49:05.520
Transcode your audio into any format that you'd like and even launch a web server from within beats to allow you to

49:06.280 --> 49:12.140
You know query your your music collection that way you can listen to your tracks there provided

49:12.140 --> 49:15.460
You know, you have an HTML 5 browser, which you wouldn't

49:16.580 --> 49:21.060
you know, it's a great little tool command line basically and

49:21.060 --> 49:23.740
get in there and tag all your music and and

49:24.340 --> 49:30.100
Get it all sorted up the way you like to have your music tagged and sorted and I think it's a cool little app

49:30.100 --> 49:33.420
I think it's perfect for people who are obsessive about

49:34.020 --> 49:36.900
Tagging their music and wanting their tags to be correct

49:37.500 --> 49:42.580
Or at least consistent so get out there and give it a shot. Very nice. That is something I will check out

49:42.580 --> 49:48.120
It's beats be ETS and we'll have a link in the notes if you want to check that out

49:48.120 --> 49:51.880
It is nice to have that stuff figured out. I know I've got some old music collection

49:51.880 --> 49:58.680
Then I just kind of stay away from it because I know it's a mess. Yeah, it's MIT licensed to so have added Haas

49:58.940 --> 50:03.840
It's all yours. That's pretty nice. Well, there you go. That's our episode for today

50:03.840 --> 50:07.300
Be sure to check out the Ubuntu podcast where you can get more poppy

50:07.300 --> 50:11.320
be sure to check out tech snap where you can get Westpain along with Jim Salter and

50:12.340 --> 50:16.160
check out my personal site Chris last calm where I have new projects and

50:16.160 --> 50:22.120
What nots over there as well as self-hosted where a lot of the stuff about things you run yourself on your own infrastructure

50:22.640 --> 50:28.460
Or where you make compromises and host in the cloud are discussed on the self-hosted podcast at self hosted dot show

50:28.720 --> 50:34.600
Any other business with maybe you have some homework to finish watching Star Wars after the show. I

50:37.120 --> 50:43.400
Like this whole outfit this quarantine outfits good. I I didn't know they sold the quarantine outfits sort of styled as a pimp suit

50:43.400 --> 50:47.580
It looks good on you. I mean, it's getting a little warm, but thankfully it's sealed up. So you can't smell anything

50:47.580 --> 50:50.120
Yeah, no, it's kind of nice. It's kind of nice

50:50.240 --> 50:55.520
Although that hole in the face mask so you can use the microphone seems like it invalidates the entire point

50:55.520 --> 50:58.920
I have to look up the science. Yeah, I noticed you coughing into the mic, too

50:58.920 --> 51:06.600
I don't like that check out Linux unplug calm slash three four nine four notes for everything. We talked about please join us live next Tuesday

51:06.600 --> 51:10.640
We love having you here. It makes it that much better at JB live TV noon Pacific

51:10.640 --> 51:14.980
And of course, we're in that mumble room this Sunday at noon. See you next Tuesday

51:40.640 --> 51:48.360
Well, we've now hit 82% 86% on the rock pro 64 at 98% memory usage

51:48.360 --> 51:54.200
Wow, I can't believe we haven't run out of sockets yet. This is unbelievable really Oh up to 61 degrees Celsius

51:54.200 --> 51:59.920
And how is net data even still responding? I don't even know that data. You're the best. How is this happening right now?

51:59.920 --> 52:04.920
Yeah, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?

52:04.920 --> 52:10.920
To accomplish 81% CPU uses. Oh, we're starting to get drops in the data. I just got my first drop in the data

52:10.920 --> 52:12.920
So we're really getting there now

52:13.560 --> 52:16.640
98.1% memory usage by the way, we are doing a consistent

52:17.520 --> 52:19.520
253 megabits of disk reading

52:20.040 --> 52:24.520
Can I just read these stats for a second 82% CPU usage?

52:25.160 --> 52:28.760
253 megabits consistently from the disk and 98.1%

52:28.760 --> 52:34.840
RAM and I think it may have just finally locked up. Are you still on the console over there? Are you still ssh-ed in?

52:34.840 --> 52:38.080
Yeah, it's still responding. It looks like net data has died

52:42.080 --> 52:47.360
Yeah, I got dropped too. This is so bad. I was just in the middle of the movie

52:47.360 --> 52:53.640
Yeah, I got dropped too. This is so bad. I was just in the middle of the movie
