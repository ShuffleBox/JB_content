WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
How are you guys feeling about the deck?

00:01.400 --> 00:03.640
I'm sure you've been watching the reviews.

00:03.640 --> 00:05.140
How are you feeling at this point?

00:05.140 --> 00:06.980
I'd say fairly positive.

00:06.980 --> 00:11.180
I mean, it's not like it was 100% blown everyone

00:11.180 --> 00:13.840
out of the water success, but considering

00:13.840 --> 00:16.080
how early we are in the journey, at least

00:16.080 --> 00:18.120
if some of the rumors about potential future plans

00:18.120 --> 00:21.480
are to be believed, seems like it's going pretty well.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.560
Yeah.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.160
I feel like my angle where I could just potentially use it

00:25.160 --> 00:27.840
as a portable podcast rig for travel

00:27.840 --> 00:30.960
that fits in a backpack that doubles as a machine

00:30.960 --> 00:33.960
to play games on occasionally, I feel like that is

00:33.960 --> 00:35.760
looking good for me right now.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.680
That's probably going to play out pretty well.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.480
But they haven't released the actual OS image

00:41.480 --> 00:42.960
to run on a desktop yet.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.660
And that's really, I think, when I get my hands on that,

00:44.660 --> 00:46.280
I'm going to have a much sounder,

00:46.280 --> 00:48.280
kind of deeper understanding if I'm actually

00:48.280 --> 00:49.800
going to be able to use that thing as a daily driver.

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
Come on, we want to play.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.960
The recovery image came out.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.240
You see that?

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
Oh, no, I missed that.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.640
It's kind of funny, actually.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.100
If you download the recovery image

00:56.100 --> 00:58.560
and you manage to get it up and going in a VM,

00:58.560 --> 01:00.760
and I've got some tips linked in the show notes,

01:00.760 --> 01:03.040
when it first boots, it's sideways,

01:03.040 --> 01:04.080
like the deck would be.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.600
So it boots from the right side of your screen to the left.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.880
That's some attention to detail right there.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.200
There's a fix, though, for that as well.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.040
But this is just the recovery OS.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.400
This is not Steam OS.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.800
I'm not going to base my decisions and my opinions

01:18.800 --> 01:20.100
off this, but I'm watching it.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.160
It's pretty fun.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.920
I love seeing this stuff slowly come out.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.320
And you've got to figure, like, Valve probably

01:25.320 --> 01:28.080
saw tens of thousands of more downloads

01:28.080 --> 01:30.000
of the OS recovery image, and they've actually

01:30.000 --> 01:31.300
shipped of decks at this point.

01:31.300 --> 01:31.800
No kidding.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.280
Ha, ha, ha.

01:33.280 --> 01:44.720
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.560
My name is Chris.

01:45.560 --> 01:46.560
My name is Wes.

01:46.560 --> 01:47.640
And my name is Brent.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.480
Hey, guys, coming up on the show this week, well,

01:50.480 --> 01:51.640
I actually have no idea.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.480
We have three topics, and I have no idea

01:54.480 --> 01:55.900
what these guys want to talk about.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.940
So to be specific, I know my topic, but each of us

01:58.940 --> 02:01.960
has a secret that we've brought to the show today.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.560
And we have no idea what those are,

02:04.560 --> 02:06.200
because we have encrypted our show notes

02:06.200 --> 02:08.120
to prevent each other from discovering what

02:08.120 --> 02:09.920
we want to talk about today.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.880
So we're going to sit back and just chat

02:11.880 --> 02:14.600
about whatever the three of us would like to talk about.

02:14.600 --> 02:18.040
Doesn't even necessarily have to be Linux specific, I suppose.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.280
And then we'll wrap it up and round it all up

02:20.280 --> 02:23.160
with some boosts and picks and more.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.840
But before we go any further, it's

02:24.840 --> 02:27.560
time to say hello to our virtual lug.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.080
Hello, Chris.

02:30.080 --> 02:30.840
Hello, Wes.

02:30.840 --> 02:31.720
Hello, Brent.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.520
Hello.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.120
Hello.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.120
16 of them in there.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.400
Not our biggest showing, but a decent showing.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.480
Nice to have them there.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.280
And always available to anyone.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.280
More details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.880
So before we get into the topics,

02:46.880 --> 02:49.240
and I know it's going to be a lot, so we want to make room.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.200
I have no idea how long, but I assume

02:51.200 --> 02:53.240
because of the length of these notes,

02:53.240 --> 02:54.840
it's going to take us a bit.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.840
So I want to mention, just remind everyone,

02:56.840 --> 02:58.800
that we are planning finally.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.880
It's been way too long.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.320
I think it's really been since Ohio Linux Fest.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.080
We have an East Coast Jupiter broadcasting meetup coming up.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.400
They said it couldn't be done.

03:07.400 --> 03:07.960
That's right.

03:07.960 --> 03:08.800
But they were wrong.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.160
Now, are you sure you're still thinking about going?

03:11.160 --> 03:13.840
Yeah, I was just trying to work through some of that planning

03:13.840 --> 03:14.760
earlier this week.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.000
I know both of you and I have to figure out doggy care.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.800
Yep, dog care, life plans.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.440
I booked my flights, though, because I'm a cheapskate,

03:21.440 --> 03:23.600
and so I wanted to get one that was cheap as possible.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.560
Yeah, you should.

03:24.560 --> 03:25.800
Excellent news.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.200
But oh, man, you should go.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.840
Throw a little party.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.440
I'm just saying, if you had a special occasion that weekend,

03:32.440 --> 03:34.200
it'd also be a good way for you to spend that special occasion.

03:34.200 --> 03:34.880
It's true.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.640
If you had such a special occasion

03:36.640 --> 03:39.240
that I wouldn't want to mention on air for security reasons.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.440
But anyways, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting,

03:42.440 --> 03:45.160
that's where you go to sign up.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.520
Yesterday, I think, Alex went there and confirmed.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.040
Oh, a scout out, nice.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.520
I was like, this sounds too good to be true.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.680
But it is true.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.840
There is a barbecue joint that could easily

03:55.840 --> 03:56.880
handle like 30 people.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.840
We're going to try to get an idea from the meetup

03:58.840 --> 04:01.120
and give them a heads up.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.960
But it's a big joint.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.200
And on the other end of the park,

04:04.200 --> 04:05.840
where I think we'll hang out in the park,

04:05.840 --> 04:07.120
and on the other end of the park,

04:07.120 --> 04:09.720
he confirmed it with pictures, there is indeed a brewery.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.080
Amazing, what a good find.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.600
So, so awesome.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.720
It's all coming together.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.760
We're also going to bring some snacks,

04:15.760 --> 04:17.600
so there'll be some snacks there.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.000
And it's going to happen at 3 PM Eastern time.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.520
The meetup is in Pacific time, but that's just because that's,

04:24.520 --> 04:26.240
I guess, how meetup.com runs it.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.600
Listen, date times are hard, and programmers hate them.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.760
As long as we've been using meetup,

04:29.760 --> 04:31.140
we've always struggled with this.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.360
It's like, why not set the time based

04:33.360 --> 04:34.560
on the location of the event?

04:34.560 --> 04:36.300
But they don't, I guess, expect you to be throwing

04:36.300 --> 04:37.520
events in other time zones.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.040
Yeah, we're not like the normal folks.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.920
Anyways, we've got about 24 people, including

04:41.920 --> 04:43.200
ourselves so far, going.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.720
But I'd love to see as many that could make it,

04:45.720 --> 04:47.160
because we don't make it out there very often.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.600
So again, it'll be in Raleigh, North Carolina,

04:49.600 --> 04:52.680
on Saturday, April 9 at 3 PM.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.600
And we have details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.760
I think it's like the Nightdale station run.

04:58.760 --> 04:59.520
There's a park there.

04:59.520 --> 05:00.320
There's a barbecue joint.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.400
If you know the area, we'd love to see you there,

05:02.400 --> 05:04.880
because it's going to be a blast.

05:04.880 --> 05:09.560
And then from the category of how amazing is our audience,

05:09.560 --> 05:11.160
I got an email from listener Cole.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.640
He says, a longtime listener here.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.080
We've met many times at Linux Fest Northwest

05:16.080 --> 05:18.720
in episode 444.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.480
You were talking about some RV problems.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.480
I am an electrician with 20 years of experience

05:23.480 --> 05:25.120
in the building trades in Seattle.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.280
I'd be happy to help any way I can.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.640
And so I reached out to Cole.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.140
Wow.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.040
And Cole's coming up next Saturday

05:31.040 --> 05:33.080
to hang out with Hadi and I at JOOPS.

05:33.080 --> 05:33.960
That's amazing.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.160
Because he said he wanted to see the power system.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.920
So we're going to show him the power system.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.080
I'm going to show him the wiring that's still not working

05:40.080 --> 05:41.520
that we've kind of patched around.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.720
Oh, for your slide.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.720
And see if maybe he has any ideas for that.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.440
I know it's a simple job, but it's just

05:46.440 --> 05:49.720
we tried patching it up, and it's still not working.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.320
But I am trying to get a road trip ready.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.680
So this is going to be a big help.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.280
And there's a really great walk-up diner.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.920
I don't know if that's what you call it,

05:57.920 --> 06:00.280
but there's like a walk-up diner 10 minutes

06:00.280 --> 06:01.800
from where we're parked.

06:01.800 --> 06:02.960
I thought maybe we'd go in and get a little lunch.

06:02.960 --> 06:03.880
Cole's about to find out.

06:03.880 --> 06:04.520
Yeah, he is.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.600
Oh, it's going to be great.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.680
Our audience, they have so many amazing skills.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.280
Yeah, they do.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.040
It's so great.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.320
It's just, man, you're sitting there.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.480
And some people are behind, but they're like,

06:14.480 --> 06:15.600
oh, I'm going to give it a shot anyways.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.040
I'll reach out.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.560
And I know I'm about a month late, but I'll try.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.680
Turns out you still have problems.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.920
They sure do, Wes.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.800
I do.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.680
They're better.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.600
But Wes, I still definitely have problems.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.240
All right, so we're going to break this up,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.720
and we're each going to present our topic this week.

06:31.720 --> 06:35.120
And I think I'll go last, just in case they go long,

06:35.120 --> 06:37.400
because I can make mine as short or long as I need.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.800
Only because you know what it is.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.160
Yeah, that's true.

06:40.160 --> 06:40.680
That's true.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.280
So we'll start with Brent, and I'll

06:42.280 --> 06:43.480
begin the decryption process.

06:43.480 --> 06:58.160
Now, to make sure that Wes and I had

06:58.160 --> 07:01.000
no idea what Brent was going to talk about,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.160
he did all of his show notes in the language of love

07:04.160 --> 07:05.080
this week.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.480
What do you have for us, Mr. Brent?

07:06.480 --> 07:09.520
Well, I did write my show notes en Francais.

07:09.520 --> 07:14.520
And I also threw in a few little social decoys.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.040
So I'm just curious, do either of you

07:17.040 --> 07:19.960
have any idea what I'm about to talk about?

07:19.960 --> 07:21.680
Decoys, really?

07:21.680 --> 07:22.400
I love this.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.320
You're trying to throw us off your smell.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.400
I see what you're doing here.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.880
OK, so a quick scan of a I'm not trying to read it,

07:27.880 --> 07:30.000
but I'm trying to read it is I see something

07:30.000 --> 07:32.880
about voter method technique, and then I also

07:32.880 --> 07:36.380
see something about a DMG to image file.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.960
So those are separate things.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.080
I don't know how they relate.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.200
I'm looking at the commands.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.640
I see HFS plus in here.

07:41.640 --> 07:42.960
Oh, yeah, what's going on there?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.000
So I'm feeling like maybe this is something

07:45.000 --> 07:48.480
about converting a DMG, but I don't know, because.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.200
Or is it a trap for Mac users?

07:51.200 --> 07:51.760
Right.

07:51.760 --> 07:55.240
Oh, yeah, it's very mysterious, Brent.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.880
It sounds like you have no idea, which I'm totally fine with.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.480
No, it sounds like we're way off.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.920
Are we way off?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.440
You have little tiny hints, and that's

08:03.440 --> 08:05.600
what I wanted this to be was kind of interesting.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.440
I wanted to give you guys little tiny hints,

08:07.440 --> 08:12.160
but they'd be so not obvious that you actually have zero idea.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.480
OK, I got another.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.560
OK, the other thing I'm noticing in here

08:15.560 --> 08:21.320
is that our app get installing CD to ISO,

08:21.320 --> 08:24.200
and you're likely converting something

08:24.200 --> 08:27.400
that was old to a new image standard,

08:27.400 --> 08:31.360
so that way you can access it in a machine that needs it

08:31.360 --> 08:33.080
as an ISO file for some reason.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.800
Yeah, you do have a link here that has some dates,

08:35.800 --> 08:38.360
like 2005, something Brent, 2007.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.920
So old media would make sense.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.160
Yeah, yeah, all right.

08:41.160 --> 08:43.040
You guys have only dug down to layer one.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.280
That's great.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
But I was thinking about this kind of interestingly,

08:46.280 --> 08:47.940
because when we came up with this concept,

08:47.940 --> 08:49.440
I thought, OK, I'm going to write mine in French,

08:49.440 --> 08:50.720
because that seemed to work last time.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.640
Everybody sort of loved that, and you guys,

08:52.640 --> 08:55.120
as far as I understand, don't understand French that well,

08:55.120 --> 08:57.120
despite it being pretty close to English.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.680
And then it got me thinking, any language you don't know

09:00.680 --> 09:03.840
is a form of encryption, because it may look kind

09:03.840 --> 09:09.600
of seemingly familiar, and yet you can't figure it out.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.160
But I didn't want it to be too easy,

09:11.160 --> 09:14.720
because you could just go and convert that in Google

09:14.720 --> 09:15.720
Translate or something.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.220
So glad you guys didn't do that, and thanks for not breaking

09:18.220 --> 09:19.520
my encryption so easily.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.260
We have, I mean, we're somewhat comfortable with the honor

09:22.260 --> 09:24.700
system.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.440
So my topic, I think, is each of us

09:27.440 --> 09:28.940
will have something to say about it.

09:28.940 --> 09:32.960
So Chris, I think I'll go with you first, and so here we go.

09:32.960 --> 09:37.520
So I would like to know, each of you, how you manage,

09:37.520 --> 09:40.840
or if you even have a way of managing a knowledge

09:40.840 --> 09:42.720
base, a personal knowledge base.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.520
So this is a topic that's dear to me

09:45.520 --> 09:48.360
and that I have found extremely useful,

09:48.360 --> 09:51.120
and there are a few technologies that I'll mention

09:51.120 --> 09:52.920
once you guys are done that I use.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.460
But I'm curious, for information that you

09:55.460 --> 09:59.960
learn on a daily basis, which is how it is for me,

09:59.960 --> 10:01.160
how do you record that stuff?

10:01.160 --> 10:02.320
Where do you record it?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.520
Has that been working for you?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.880
How have you done in the past?

10:05.880 --> 10:07.360
Boy, what a great question.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.080
What a great question, and I will actually

10:10.080 --> 10:12.200
be touching on this a little bit today.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.400
But I will say this, it depends on the context.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.980
I feel like there's institutional knowledge

10:17.980 --> 10:19.800
about how things work in JB that need

10:19.800 --> 10:21.920
to be captured in one way.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.240
Then there's knowledge about how my server set up

10:25.240 --> 10:28.900
in my LadyJuice RV, how that's built and interconnected.

10:28.900 --> 10:32.640
That's another type of knowledge that needs to be captured.

10:32.640 --> 10:36.320
And then there's the family records, medical records,

10:36.320 --> 10:38.800
maintenance records for your vehicles, and all of that.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.320
And each one of them, I've kind of

10:40.320 --> 10:42.320
stumbled into different solutions.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.880
And I mean, I don't love that, to be honest with you.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.880
And some of it's because maybe I started tracking

10:46.880 --> 10:49.360
this particular thing 15 years ago.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.980
And this next thing I started tracking,

10:50.980 --> 10:52.360
I started tracking two years ago.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.340
So I'm using something more modern.

10:54.340 --> 10:56.780
So I have a bit of a range depending on the topic.

10:56.780 --> 10:58.360
It's a bit of a hot mess.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.560
I fantasize about having one central knowledge

11:01.560 --> 11:04.600
base of all things, but I also don't want to manage that.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.360
Yeah, that was sort of my approach as well.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.220
But I feel like you mentioned a bunch

11:09.220 --> 11:11.920
of different types of sensitivities of information.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.680
Some of it you want to share.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.520
Others, it's deeply personal, and you

11:15.520 --> 11:17.720
should keep somewhere that nobody has their hands on.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.680
So that's where my curiosity came in

11:19.680 --> 11:23.920
is I feel like shortcuts to the things we learn

11:23.920 --> 11:25.080
are deeply personal.

11:25.080 --> 11:30.340
I have a giant folder of notes that are specific to technology.

11:30.340 --> 11:33.480
And someone else who might look at it

11:33.480 --> 11:35.240
might have no idea what it actually

11:35.240 --> 11:39.440
is because they're all just shortcuts to spaces in my mind.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.700
They're like reminders of there might be a command there.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.120
And if you don't understand what it is,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.620
then you have no idea what it does.

11:45.620 --> 11:49.960
But through decades of learning about R Sync, for instance,

11:49.960 --> 11:52.800
I've memorized most of the flags that I use on a regular basis.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.360
But sometimes you just need a quick little, you know,

11:55.360 --> 11:57.560
you need to be able to get there really quickly.

11:57.560 --> 11:59.880
So, Chris, do you have access to this stuff on your phone

11:59.880 --> 12:01.040
or only when you're at home?

12:01.040 --> 12:04.440
Or is there a favorite platform that you're using right now

12:04.440 --> 12:05.840
that you're really excited about?

12:05.840 --> 12:08.680
This is where Tailscale changed it for me.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.240
Because with Nebula, I had connected my servers.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.880
But with Tailscale, I've connected

12:13.880 --> 12:15.220
all of my front-end systems.

12:15.220 --> 12:16.720
And then all of a sudden, the stuff

12:16.720 --> 12:19.640
that was the domain of Lady Joops

12:19.640 --> 12:22.560
and only lived in Lady Joops now existed

12:22.560 --> 12:25.400
on this private mesh land that I have.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.440
And that all of a sudden opened up all of access

12:28.440 --> 12:31.240
to all of that stuff that I had stored there.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.760
So now I do have access to all of it.

12:32.760 --> 12:36.840
But my most common high-level way to collect information

12:36.840 --> 12:40.320
is I generally attempt to just store the link where

12:40.320 --> 12:43.720
I found that information and archived if possible.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.440
So I've used a lot of different tools,

12:45.440 --> 12:48.880
like WallBag and Pinboard and Deego and, geez,

12:48.880 --> 12:51.040
probably ones I'm not even remembering at the moment.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.080
There's different eras of those kinds of tools.

12:53.080 --> 12:53.920
For sure, right?

12:53.920 --> 12:57.000
And so a lot of times, I have, like,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.560
say something with WallBag or Pinboard, I will tag it.

13:01.560 --> 13:05.300
I'll tag it with a show, a topic, a project that's

13:05.300 --> 13:07.000
mentioned in there.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.080
And then I can go back and filter on those tags later

13:10.080 --> 13:11.880
and find the links.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.520
And then we've even gone as far as generating

13:14.520 --> 13:19.200
bots that ingest the feeds and these tags

13:19.200 --> 13:22.840
and then put them into different discussion groups that

13:22.840 --> 13:24.480
are relevant to those shows.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.380
And so that was sort of the next step,

13:26.380 --> 13:27.920
is then exposing that information

13:27.920 --> 13:30.320
to the appropriate place once I've ingested it

13:30.320 --> 13:32.480
so it doesn't just get out of sight, out of mind.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.960
It sounds like a nice level of sophistication, actually.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.400
Wes, I'm curious about you.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.560
Yeah, you know, I've also kind of dabbled with various tools.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.600
And I've had a few different wikis that I've run for myself

13:42.600 --> 13:46.480
and also kind of kept, like, some of the open source

13:46.480 --> 13:48.560
Kanban board systems.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.720
So far, Markdown files and plain text

13:50.720 --> 13:53.360
has been mostly what I've stuck with.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.520
I think because I don't actually, at the moment,

13:55.520 --> 13:59.080
have that much, I'm not really cataloging or using

13:59.080 --> 14:01.800
the interrelationships of data very much.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.560
A lot of the things that I tend to have

14:03.560 --> 14:06.520
will be focused on a particular domain and then have examples.

14:06.520 --> 14:08.760
Or, yeah, Chris, you've said some archive of links

14:08.760 --> 14:10.360
and sort of, like, here's some references

14:10.360 --> 14:12.040
if you want to go dive back into this topic.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.600
And here's an example of what you were playing

14:13.600 --> 14:15.040
with last time you were here.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.400
Right now, I don't care that much

14:16.400 --> 14:18.920
about going to find my own notes from that beyond what

14:18.920 --> 14:19.520
Grep is doing.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.840
I know that there's a lot of tools for that.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.760
I just didn't find myself really taking advantage of it.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.000
Right.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.800
Sometimes if you just see the source again.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.280
OK.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.160
Yeah, yeah.

14:26.160 --> 14:26.520
What about?

14:26.520 --> 14:27.760
It's not great, though, and it's not fancy.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.680
And to your guys' point, I don't have a way.

14:30.680 --> 14:31.800
I've thought about doing it.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.200
I just kind of haven't of, like, capturing that stuff on the go.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.360
So I just have ways of sending myself notes for later anyway

14:36.360 --> 14:36.680
that I just integrate.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.360
What about dollar sign day job where

14:38.360 --> 14:41.000
you're, like, developing maybe a piece of code

14:41.000 --> 14:42.400
or solving a problem?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.840
Do you have anything to store?

14:43.840 --> 14:46.120
Like, do you ever go back and, like, oh, I

14:46.120 --> 14:48.320
know I solved this problem a couple of years ago

14:48.320 --> 14:50.960
and have something tucked away?

14:50.960 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, I mean, that's a similar kind of thing, right?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.640
Various scripts and sources on the same stuff.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.760
But it's mostly just files with, you know,

14:58.760 --> 15:00.800
there's, like, a little bit of folder structure.

15:00.800 --> 15:03.640
Are you more likely to just write the solution again

15:03.640 --> 15:06.320
from scratch with modern skills than go back and grab it

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
and just re-implement?

15:07.320 --> 15:08.520
I think it depends, you know?

15:08.520 --> 15:09.640
I find that, yes, it will probably

15:09.640 --> 15:11.480
need a little bit of diving back in anyway.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.440
So it's sort of like, how much do I capture

15:13.440 --> 15:15.880
and how much do I provide ways of getting back

15:15.880 --> 15:17.760
to where that knowledge, you know, where?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.400
Because sometimes the difficulty is not necessarily

15:19.400 --> 15:19.880
understanding.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.960
It was just, like, how did I find the details of, you know,

15:22.960 --> 15:24.920
where the inner workings of X thing was?

15:24.920 --> 15:26.840
And so if you can capture a little bit of that,

15:26.840 --> 15:29.320
like, here's how I used it, or here's

15:29.320 --> 15:31.680
where those API docs are actually stored,

15:31.680 --> 15:33.480
that's, like, all the jump back that you need.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.160
But that depends, like, that's the frequency with which you

15:36.160 --> 15:38.720
access it and plan to access it is a huge factor in all

15:38.720 --> 15:39.120
of that, right?

15:39.120 --> 15:39.640
True.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.840
That sounds very similar, though, to how I operate,

15:41.840 --> 15:43.560
very much how I kind of think about it.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.460
And then I do have, for, like, bookmarks and stuff there,

15:45.460 --> 15:46.800
I have more of a tagged system.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.040
I've thought about having more, you know,

15:48.040 --> 15:49.880
tags or other things more widely used,

15:49.880 --> 15:51.840
but right now it's a bit of a minimalist system.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.920
I'll be quite upfront about that.

15:53.920 --> 15:54.720
I ebb and flow.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.080
Like, sometimes it's minimal tags,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.440
and sometimes, like, all the metadata.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.480
See, I lean a little bit towards Wes's approach,

16:01.480 --> 16:03.920
and I'll give you a sense of why in a second here.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.200
So for me, I've landed on Nextcloud a few years ago,

16:07.200 --> 16:10.520
actually, and just marked down text files for most of it.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.560
You know, not everything can be captured that way,

16:12.560 --> 16:17.040
but that has been an amazingly simple solution for me,

16:17.040 --> 16:20.360
and with a problem I struggle with for years before that.

16:20.360 --> 16:25.200
And I think the main reason is for future proofing.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.800
Like, Chris, I know you're using some fancier technologies

16:27.800 --> 16:29.600
than maybe some marked down text files,

16:29.600 --> 16:31.400
and there's some people in the chat room who

16:31.400 --> 16:33.000
I'll bring in in a sec who are also

16:33.000 --> 16:34.880
using some pretty cool stuff.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.720
But I worry about, you know, the maintenance that goes into that,

16:37.720 --> 16:41.600
and, you know, in five years, is that stuff still

16:41.600 --> 16:42.480
going to be accessible?

16:42.480 --> 16:43.760
That's something I worry about.

16:43.760 --> 16:43.920
Yeah.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.300
Do you have a way to export it?

16:45.300 --> 16:47.880
Even then, are you going to then convert it or hope

16:47.880 --> 16:50.280
that whatever your next tool is supports importing from that,

16:50.280 --> 16:52.800
or there's some middle ground format you have access to,

16:52.800 --> 16:55.960
which is then maybe some kind of just plain or plainish text?

16:55.960 --> 16:59.240
And there's another big constraint for me as well,

16:59.240 --> 17:01.720
but I think I'll probably touch on that during my topic

17:01.720 --> 17:02.600
as a hint.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.200
Do-do-do-do.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.960
Ooh.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.840
In the chat room, Casey, can you talk a little bit

17:07.840 --> 17:08.840
about what you're doing?

17:08.840 --> 17:09.340
Yeah.

17:09.340 --> 17:12.240
I've been using an open source app called Trillium

17:12.240 --> 17:14.640
for about a year and a half now.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.320
It just hit version 0.5.

17:17.320 --> 17:19.320
So I highly recommend folks go check it out

17:19.320 --> 17:21.020
if they checked it out before and it wasn't

17:21.020 --> 17:22.440
quite mature enough for them.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.680
I think it has a lot of the points

17:23.680 --> 17:25.400
that you guys have been mentioning here.

17:25.400 --> 17:30.920
So for starters, it does have markdown kind of support

17:30.920 --> 17:31.920
when you're editing.

17:31.920 --> 17:36.080
It's a rich text editor that uses markdown to indicate,

17:36.080 --> 17:38.520
hey, you put a hashtag, that means that's a header,

17:38.520 --> 17:41.080
or stars turn into bullets, things like that.

17:41.080 --> 17:45.000
But I think that probably a little more on the nose of it,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.720
it does have a self-hosted component to it.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.720
So you can have a Trillium server

17:50.720 --> 17:53.000
that you put in a Docker Compose config.

17:53.000 --> 17:53.960
That's what I do.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.200
You put it behind whatever security

17:56.200 --> 17:57.280
you want to put it behind.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.120
It has its own password system, but you can also,

18:00.120 --> 18:03.000
I have it set up so I have to actually wire guard

18:03.000 --> 18:05.400
into the network that I'm posting it on.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.240
And then from there, it has desktop, well,

18:08.240 --> 18:11.480
Electron apps or web browser interfaces to it

18:11.480 --> 18:13.280
that you can use to sync your notes

18:13.280 --> 18:18.080
from an offline copy of it to this centralized server.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.760
So it's sort of a start topology.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.880
And then what I think is really cool

18:21.880 --> 18:24.640
is because it does have the support

18:24.640 --> 18:26.640
for this centralized server, you get

18:26.640 --> 18:30.000
a lot of really cool ways to get data into it.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.200
So for instance, there's a browser extension

18:32.200 --> 18:36.440
that you can just one click go when you have a page open,

18:36.440 --> 18:39.040
and it will save a copy of the page in your journal

18:39.040 --> 18:41.160
under that day that is fully searchable.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.640
It's all in a SQL database.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.280
And then you can just dump that SQL database

18:46.280 --> 18:49.280
if you want to back it up, or it saves

18:49.280 --> 18:50.440
in a particular directory.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.480
So I just back up that whole directory on NextCloud.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.400
But on top of that, I think it's really cool

18:55.400 --> 18:57.600
because of the fact that, Wes, you

18:57.600 --> 19:00.200
said you hadn't really talked about the interrelationship

19:00.200 --> 19:01.520
between notes.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.680
This has first class support for linking

19:03.680 --> 19:06.840
between notes, which is always like, OK, that's table stakes.

19:06.840 --> 19:10.480
But you can add metadata properties to your notes.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.800
So I actually have on my journal both a weight tracker

19:13.800 --> 19:16.080
so I can keep track of how I'm gaining and losing weight

19:16.080 --> 19:17.040
over time.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.800
And I just punch in the number via my cell phone

19:20.800 --> 19:21.920
browser each morning.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.240
And then I can go back and scrape that data later

19:24.240 --> 19:26.360
to get a nice little line chart of how I've been

19:26.360 --> 19:27.640
doing over the last few months.

19:27.640 --> 19:28.280
All right.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.000
All right.

19:29.000 --> 19:29.640
You know what?

19:29.640 --> 19:31.000
I'm going to check this out after the show.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.560
You're kind of speaking my language here.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.840
It does sound very cool.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.040
It's really awesome.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.560
It's still kind of new.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.240
We're still only at 0.50.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.880
But like, oh, man.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.680
I'm really proud of how things have

19:42.680 --> 19:43.720
been going on this project.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.040
And I contribute both financially and technically.

19:46.040 --> 19:49.680
So I'm always happy to speak to how cool Trillium is.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.680
Takes a little bit to set up and get used to.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.520
But once you get into the groove of it,

19:53.520 --> 19:55.820
that's something that's going to stick with me for years

19:55.820 --> 19:56.320
to come.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.520
Yeah, I'm liking you're just entering information

19:58.520 --> 19:59.720
in on the phone as you go.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.920
So Trillium, we'll have a link to that in the show notes

20:01.920 --> 20:03.540
if people listening want to check it out.

20:03.540 --> 20:04.680
That's very cool.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.260
I wanted to touch back on some of my show notes,

20:07.260 --> 20:09.040
gentlemen, because you mentioned them.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.480
There is a command that I ran there,

20:10.480 --> 20:12.800
nice little find command that told me what the oldest

20:12.800 --> 20:14.840
note is in my notes folder.

20:14.840 --> 20:19.560
And so it looks like 2010 is the oldest modification

20:19.560 --> 20:21.520
time from what I can gauge.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.160
But the first time I really started building this knowledge

20:26.160 --> 20:32.840
base was way back in 2007, I think, on a Palm Z22.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.800
I don't know if anyone had a Palm device.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.640
Chris, you might have had some.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.080
Well, I actually never owned one,

20:38.080 --> 20:40.680
but I definitely was responsible for fixing them.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.800
That I definitely did.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.560
I would have definitely taken it as someone

20:43.560 --> 20:45.320
who would have grabbed it up right away.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.280
They were super useful.

20:46.280 --> 20:46.920
I dabbled.

20:46.920 --> 20:47.760
Dabbling.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.260
Yeah, I definitely dabbled.

20:49.260 --> 20:52.960
And so this was a relatively simple device back then.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.880
And it just took notes and kept track of contacts and things

20:56.880 --> 20:58.880
like that, the things that we take for granted, I think,

20:58.880 --> 21:00.000
these days on our phones.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.760
But that was a total change, a shift in paradigm for me.

21:04.760 --> 21:08.320
And I just have been endlessly curious and gathering

21:08.320 --> 21:09.560
information ever since.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.440
Yeah, I should have mentioned, I also

21:11.440 --> 21:14.180
keep paper notes, which these are not the notes I

21:14.180 --> 21:16.160
expect to capture forever.

21:16.160 --> 21:21.480
But I really don't like it when I end up using the platform's

21:21.480 --> 21:22.760
note system.

21:22.760 --> 21:28.200
And I have ended up using Google Keep or Apple Notes.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.680
It's just a quick note, Chris.

21:29.680 --> 21:33.080
So that's definitely something I'm going to work on.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.600
Trillium sounds like it has some real potential

21:35.600 --> 21:37.000
over the long term there.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.480
Yeah, Brent, I've watched you take notes, too, with paper.

21:39.480 --> 21:42.280
I know just pen and paper can be a way you'll capture thoughts,

21:42.280 --> 21:42.780
too.

21:42.780 --> 21:43.960
Do you back those up later?

21:43.960 --> 21:46.480
Do you save those notebooks?

21:46.480 --> 21:47.640
Do you capture that?

21:47.640 --> 21:52.120
I think you probably see me doing that mostly for show prep.

21:52.120 --> 21:56.880
I have clearly decided that trying

21:56.880 --> 21:59.300
to grab stuff outside of Linux Unplugged,

21:59.300 --> 22:03.180
but trying to grab stuff for real deep person-to-person

22:03.180 --> 22:04.920
conversation is just better on paper.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.000
And I know you've dabbled with that a little bit.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.620
But anytime I'm doing a brunch interview or a one-on-one

22:10.620 --> 22:14.200
with someone, I find just spending five minutes

22:14.200 --> 22:17.160
and writing things down, there's something

22:17.160 --> 22:20.560
that happens where I hardly refer to those notes

22:20.560 --> 22:23.040
because the process of writing them down just kind of

22:23.040 --> 22:24.360
solidifies them in my mind.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.440
And the thing that I think you'll

22:26.440 --> 22:29.020
appreciate that I most enjoy about that

22:29.020 --> 22:33.120
is that because it's in my mind in a slightly more

22:33.120 --> 22:35.520
permanent way in that moment, I could then

22:35.520 --> 22:39.240
be very creative on the spot about the layout

22:39.240 --> 22:42.040
of those topics as the conversation's flowing.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.920
Whereas on paper or notes, I find that a little bit

22:44.920 --> 22:49.200
more difficult. So I'll often, as the conversation is going,

22:49.200 --> 22:53.080
just kind of like scratch notes out or add extra ideas

22:53.080 --> 22:55.560
as the conversation's happening.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.800
But I certainly do keep all those notebooks.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.240
There's one actually right in front of me.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.040
I'm looking at it.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.240
And it's every brunch conversation

23:03.240 --> 23:05.000
I've had in one notebook.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.680
And there's another one just next to my desk

23:07.680 --> 23:11.440
here that's a bunch of scribbles about when we were at the studio

23:11.440 --> 23:13.480
last doing a bunch of projects and just

23:13.480 --> 23:17.820
some creative fumbling around with paper

23:17.820 --> 23:20.320
and sketching out the server cabinet that we made.

23:20.320 --> 23:23.920
And so I think there is a place for both digital notes you

23:23.920 --> 23:27.560
want to keep for a while and paper notes that are

23:27.560 --> 23:29.460
more just a creative process.

23:29.460 --> 23:31.400
I do envision saving some of those,

23:31.400 --> 23:32.600
but I never get around to it.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.720
So there you go.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.880
Yeah, there is something about thinking on paper that's slower.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.560
It sort of absorbs into you as you have painstakingly

23:39.560 --> 23:41.360
go along and capture all of it.

23:41.360 --> 23:45.400
I can't quite understand why I could type a note

23:45.400 --> 23:47.200
and forget it in 10 seconds.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.520
And if I write that same exact note down,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.000
I may remember it forever.

23:51.000 --> 23:51.600
It's so weird.

23:51.600 --> 23:54.240
Maybe it's because I do one thing all the time,

23:54.240 --> 23:56.720
and I comparatively do the other thing rarely.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.560
I feel like maybe that's a feature as well.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.440
If you're typing something in a digital note,

24:00.440 --> 24:02.600
the whole point is for you to be able to forget it

24:02.600 --> 24:03.680
until you need it again.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.400
So I don't know.

24:05.400 --> 24:09.540
Different space for different type of ideas, perhaps.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.240
Oh, I think shout out to OneNote.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.840
I think we should get the OneNote story in the post-show

24:13.840 --> 24:17.160
because I think that's a post-show topic.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.200
If you're asking me.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.040
Not quite on topic.

24:20.040 --> 24:25.040
So gentlemen, you skipped right over a honeypot I left for you.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.400
I left a little doom on the Z22 link for you,

24:28.400 --> 24:29.840
and you guys didn't even mention it.

24:29.840 --> 24:30.720
I'm surprised.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.640
I did see that.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.000
However, out of respect to the honor system,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.400
I did not click any links.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.200
So I saw it.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.960
I left that there to test your sort of, hmm, ideals.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.200
You were testing us?

24:43.200 --> 24:43.700
Ouch.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.440
Where's the trust?

24:46.440 --> 24:47.440
Amazing.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.280
So that was another decoy in here?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.600
Oh, yeah.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.000
I'm very impressed in both of you gentlemen

24:54.000 --> 24:55.200
for not having clicked on it.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.880
But maybe you'll click on it at some point.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.120
Yeah, I mean, jeez.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.360
Now I'm going to wonder.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.320
Now I'm going to wonder.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.000
Very good.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.120
Well, a fascinating topic, and one

25:04.120 --> 25:06.040
that I'd love to hear from the audience,

25:06.040 --> 25:10.320
linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.720
lino.com slash unplugged.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.920
You know, I don't know, I was feeling nostalgic.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.840
I pulled out my old original notes

25:16.840 --> 25:19.040
when Linode first became a sponsor like two and a half

25:19.040 --> 25:20.480
years ago or whatever it's been now.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.200
Paper notes that you still have.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.600
Paper notes.

25:23.600 --> 25:24.760
It's awesome.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.560
So you go to linuxunplugged.com slash unplugged,

25:26.560 --> 25:27.480
according to my notes.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.920
And if you go there, you'll get $100 in 60-day credit

25:29.920 --> 25:31.300
towards a new account.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.360
And it's also a way to support the show.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.800
We've been spinning up Linodes recently just to play around.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.300
Actually, we always do that.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.600
I should mention, this is a great way

25:38.600 --> 25:39.520
to actually use Linode.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.020
Because if you look at the pricing,

25:41.020 --> 25:42.960
it's fantastic for this, especially

25:42.960 --> 25:44.560
if you get $100 credit.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.960
But it's a great way to spin up fast machines

25:46.960 --> 25:48.840
and try out an open source project.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.120
Because the software installs crazy fast.

25:51.120 --> 25:52.760
Linode's got 40 gigabit connections

25:52.760 --> 25:53.880
coming into those machines.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.320
So they download software crazy fast.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.180
They got all the different distributions.

25:58.180 --> 26:00.280
In fact, I noted in my notes right here,

26:00.280 --> 26:03.840
this is a legit note to Chris from two and a half years ago.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.300
Personally, one of the things that I

26:05.300 --> 26:07.840
think is great about Linode is that they have all

26:07.840 --> 26:09.280
these distributions they support.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.800
They even have Alpines, Arches, CentOS, and for some reason,

26:12.800 --> 26:15.400
they have openSUSE.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.720
You were a cold, cold fellow back then.

26:18.720 --> 26:20.520
I just didn't like SUSE that much back then.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.240
I just didn't like it very much.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.160
And I was like, why would they have that?

26:26.160 --> 26:27.200
Now I'm like, it's great.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.520
Now I think it's a feature.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.160
But I said, what I really get about them

26:31.160 --> 26:33.080
is you can definitely tell they love Linux.

26:33.080 --> 26:34.600
I put that in there, right there.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.640
This is the fake paper.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.760
It's not real, but it's not fake either.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.600
It's paper.

26:38.600 --> 26:39.760
What is it?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.160
Who knows?

26:41.160 --> 26:43.120
Those are things that still resonate with me.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.480
But go over there and get the $100.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.600
Try it out and build something.

26:45.600 --> 26:48.320
The great thing is their infrastructure is so impressive.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.280
I mean, they've been doing this for 19 years.

26:50.280 --> 26:52.320
You could throw millions of users at your website,

26:52.320 --> 26:53.680
and it's going to do fine.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.280
But they have a pricing structure such

26:55.280 --> 26:57.560
that if you just want a website, maybe you

26:57.560 --> 27:00.680
want to run a public version of Prism for friends and family,

27:00.680 --> 27:03.080
the photo hosting thing that's like Google Photos

27:03.080 --> 27:05.800
but self-hosted, you could do that for a few users up there.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.360
You could do it for thousands.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.080
They have that kind of power.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.360
And I've put it to the test.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.120
We have, I think, probably one of the more stressful things

27:13.120 --> 27:16.400
we've done is we ran a really aggressive test

27:16.400 --> 27:18.720
against PeerTube on Linode, where

27:18.720 --> 27:20.480
we spun up multiple Linodes because they've

27:20.480 --> 27:22.520
got 11 data centers around the world.

27:22.520 --> 27:26.040
So we spun up one Linode here, I think, on the West Coast,

27:26.040 --> 27:28.040
or sometimes we do it in Texas, depending,

27:28.040 --> 27:29.760
or sometimes in the East Coast.

27:29.760 --> 27:32.160
But we spun up one Linode, started a PeerTube instance

27:32.160 --> 27:34.400
on there, and then spun up a bunch of other Linodes

27:34.400 --> 27:36.280
around the world and had it all connect

27:36.280 --> 27:38.120
in to that PeerTube instance.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.680
And then while we were live, we also

27:39.680 --> 27:41.880
had the audience all connect in.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.840
And really, it was damn impressive

27:44.840 --> 27:46.960
what that thing could take.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.360
They just really built it well.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.120
So go build something.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.320
Go try something.

27:51.320 --> 27:51.800
I don't know.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.280
Go learn something and support the show.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.240
Linode.com slash unplugged.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.800
That's Linode.com slash unplugged.

27:59.800 --> 28:04.240
All right, just let's do a quick spot of housekeeping here

28:04.240 --> 28:07.440
because I don't think we want to take too long on this.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.560
But there's a couple of things we wanted you to know.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.760
To know about.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.520
There is a testing week coming up for Ubuntu 22.04.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.680
The release is about seven weeks away.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.480
And the alpha testing is happening now,

28:20.480 --> 28:24.640
which is the 6th of March, to the 10th of March.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.320
The beta release will be March 31.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.440
And the final release of Ubuntu 22.04 is currently scheduled.

28:30.440 --> 28:35.640
And they usually hit it every time for April 21, 2022.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.280
So now is the time to help the Ubuntu project out.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.200
And it really matters on these LTSs.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.800
They reached out, and we wanted to make sure

28:42.800 --> 28:43.960
that we got that covered.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.960
Yeah, go bang on things.

28:44.960 --> 28:45.960
See if you can break it.

28:45.960 --> 28:46.760
Yeah.

28:46.760 --> 28:49.440
And then we're thinking about covering IPFS.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.640
By the way, I'm thinking about covering IPFS, guys.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.440
I love it.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.080
It just came to me this morning.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.320
We've been meaning to talk about IPFS for a while.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.080
It was an interplanetary file system, right?

29:00.080 --> 29:02.720
I checked it out years ago, but I need a deep dive again.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.880
I'm fascinated by its potential.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.320
So let's talk about it.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.240
And if you are a topic expert, send us

29:09.240 --> 29:13.080
a boost to what you know or linuxunplug.com slash contact.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.640
Let us know your experience with it and what you use it for,

29:15.640 --> 29:18.640
so we can integrate that into our coverage next week.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.680
Yeah, and then eventually it'll get captured in one trillion.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.680
Yeah, probably.

29:22.680 --> 29:27.520
All right, Mr. Payne.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.240
Are you ready?

29:28.240 --> 29:30.080
Yeah, let's decrypt this.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.800
This is a big, big old block of something in here.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.280
I have no idea, because I just figured why bother.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.360
But let's begin the decryption process.

29:39.360 --> 29:46.400
Oh, wait a minute.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.880
Why does it smell like dog food?

29:47.880 --> 29:51.160
Well, that's an integral part of the process.

29:51.160 --> 29:56.080
No, actually this is just some base 64 encoded binary bytes,

29:56.080 --> 30:01.200
which is itself a XE compressed brainfuck program.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.000
OK.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.800
And that was mostly just so that it could actually

30:04.800 --> 30:06.240
fit in the doc in a decent way that

30:06.240 --> 30:07.360
didn't overwrite the whole thing.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.920
I was wondering how you were going to pull that off.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.760
That's why I ended up going my route, which

30:10.760 --> 30:13.440
we'll talk about in a bit.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.280
Because if you properly encrypt show notes,

30:15.280 --> 30:17.200
it's just going to be pages and pages, right?

30:17.200 --> 30:19.640
So I was curious how you'd solve that problem.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.520
Yeah, so that didn't seem obscure enough,

30:22.520 --> 30:24.520
because this is all just a little bit of security

30:24.520 --> 30:26.880
theater, of course, and the trust

30:26.880 --> 30:30.400
that Brent didn't show for us.

30:30.400 --> 30:33.400
If you got through base 64 on XE,

30:33.400 --> 30:35.600
I wasn't sure if either of you had ever seen or heard

30:35.600 --> 30:36.760
of brainfuck before.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.520
It's a bit of a weird one.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.120
I have heard of it, but I have to admit

30:40.120 --> 30:42.600
I am ignorant as to really what it does.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.680
But that's a name that just happens to stick.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.800
Well, it's great because it's an esoteric programming

30:47.800 --> 30:49.280
language, but it's super simple.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.760
It has a very limited set of basic commands.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.320
So you're programming at a super low level.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.560
And that means you can't really tell what's going on here.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.440
I'll put a little sample in the doc for you.

30:59.440 --> 30:59.920
OK.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.720
And we'll link to some.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.040
It's right above my encryption.

31:03.040 --> 31:03.560
Yeah, I see that.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.600
And so you just see a bunch of dashes and pluses

31:05.600 --> 31:07.040
and caret symbols.

31:07.040 --> 31:10.240
But you can write a brainfuck program to print out text.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.360
So if you get my brainfuck program,

31:12.360 --> 31:15.760
load it up in a brainfuck interpreter, run it,

31:15.760 --> 31:17.840
it'll print out my topic for the day.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.760
But it's specifically your brainfuck program?

31:20.760 --> 31:22.200
You built a brainfuck program?

31:22.200 --> 31:24.800
Well, I used a tool that helped me do that, but yes.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.400
So it's like your own personal executable?

31:27.400 --> 31:27.900
Mm-hmm.

31:27.900 --> 31:28.400
Cool.

31:28.400 --> 31:29.120
Well, it's interpretive.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.080
It's a little script that runs.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.080
Yeah, so I have to have brainfuck installed.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.000
And then I have to run your brainfuck little interpreter

31:35.000 --> 31:35.520
thing.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.840
Yeah, you put my program through it, and then it will.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.080
Is it in the repo?

31:39.080 --> 31:40.240
Oh, you can do it online, too.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.120
Oh, really?

31:41.120 --> 31:42.200
Like a web-based version?

31:42.200 --> 31:42.960
OK, where do I go?

31:42.960 --> 31:44.160
This is exciting.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.640
This is quite exciting.

31:45.640 --> 31:50.880
Yeah, so you're going to want to go to copy.sh slash brainfuck.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.120
That's brain with a y, right?

31:52.120 --> 31:53.000
No, OK.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.880
All right, so I see I have a do it now.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.280
I go take what you've added here?

31:56.280 --> 31:59.080
Yeah, although you probably want the full version, huh?

31:59.080 --> 32:00.240
Right?

32:00.240 --> 32:01.680
This is big.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.240
This is fun.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.320
I'm curious how much data is in this, too.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.280
That's one of the interesting things about this.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.760
All right, so I've got the full thing.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.640
Oh, no, so that won't, because I'm getting it for you here.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.640
Oh, OK.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.400
And we'll put a link to copy.sh slash brainfuck in the show notes,

32:17.400 --> 32:19.240
too, because you've got to see this.

32:19.240 --> 32:22.840
This is a great way to just pass information around right out there

32:22.840 --> 32:24.520
in the open.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.080
This is fantastic.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.160
We're really teaching people how to be sneaky.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.480
Isn't that our goal every week?

32:29.480 --> 32:30.560
I guess.

32:30.560 --> 32:31.760
How to take over the world.

32:31.760 --> 32:35.040
OK, so let me replace this sample with,

32:35.040 --> 32:36.960
and you'll see why I didn't paste it directly,

32:36.960 --> 32:38.920
because it's kind of beefy.

32:38.920 --> 32:40.880
All right, I'm looking forward to this.

32:40.880 --> 32:41.840
Where to go with?

32:41.840 --> 32:43.120
Oh, it's in there.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.040
Oh, this whole thing, I have to take all of this?

32:45.040 --> 32:45.520
Yeah.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.960
Holy crap.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.600
Do I start with the periods?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.800
Yep, it starts at the.

32:49.800 --> 32:50.440
Oh, my gosh.

32:50.440 --> 32:51.480
No wonder.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.040
Oh, my gosh.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.840
This is, what, eight pages, nine pages deep?

32:55.840 --> 32:57.040
Maybe more?

32:57.040 --> 32:59.400
Maybe way more?

32:59.400 --> 33:00.400
Holy crap.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.240
If you double click, if you take a look in the rendered one.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.160
Can you double click it, make it easy on myself?

33:05.160 --> 33:05.640
Yeah.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.680
I could have done that, huh?

33:06.680 --> 33:07.680
Now do I hit Run or what?

33:07.680 --> 33:08.640
Hit Run.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.800
OK, oh, my gosh.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.400
OK, so now I think is this markdown that's

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
coming out on the other end?

33:12.400 --> 33:13.240
Yep.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.440
This is pretty cool.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.080
A moment of appreciation for open source

33:16.080 --> 33:17.880
maintainers and community.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.960
Oh, that's a great idea.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.240
So tell us what you have here.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.640
It looks like you have some links.

33:22.640 --> 33:26.800
Yeah, well, I wanted to see if you guys kind of agreed.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.080
You know, we talk a lot about open source.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.240
Obviously, we all sort of talk about how we love it.

33:31.240 --> 33:35.320
But I worry, too, that maybe we get a little jaded, somewhere

33:35.320 --> 33:36.920
between jaded, take it for granted.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.840
And then especially, like you and I on land,

33:39.840 --> 33:41.200
we're covering a lot of the news.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.200
And a lot of times, a lot of the news are like security issues,

33:44.200 --> 33:47.680
like just whenever you're talking about NPM and left

33:47.680 --> 33:49.840
pad and log for shell.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.320
Color.js, Faker.js.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.080
And there's just over the past year or two,

33:53.080 --> 33:54.840
I think there's been a lot of articles kind of mentioned

33:54.840 --> 33:55.480
just like this.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.360
Oh, how will we solve open source software security?

33:58.360 --> 34:00.760
And is it even tenable to use open source software?

34:00.760 --> 34:03.040
And I mean, some of these are quite hyperbolic takes.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.440
I'm not saying we take those seriously, but it.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.920
All right, and the other end of the spectrum is,

34:06.920 --> 34:08.800
how is open source going to be sustainable?

34:08.800 --> 34:10.440
The cloud vendors are eating it alive.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.600
Right, yeah, exactly.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.600
And we talk a lot about the difficulties

34:13.600 --> 34:15.640
of being an open source maintainer and all the work

34:15.640 --> 34:17.800
that goes into it, often thankless or underpaid

34:17.800 --> 34:20.800
or if paid at all.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.280
So I'm not trying to say that those are not real,

34:23.280 --> 34:25.160
because those are absolutely real.

34:25.160 --> 34:27.440
I just worry that because we talk so much about them,

34:27.440 --> 34:31.760
it's kind of like a news covers the bad things sort of same

34:31.760 --> 34:35.640
thing that we forget sometimes about how nice it

34:35.640 --> 34:37.800
is that we get to use and interact with all

34:37.800 --> 34:38.800
this open source software.

34:38.800 --> 34:40.640
And I had a small example at work this week

34:40.640 --> 34:43.240
that I thought I'd share just as like, oh, this was nice,

34:43.240 --> 34:45.920
and it reminded me about why I value being able to use it

34:45.920 --> 34:46.920
and depend on it so much.

34:46.920 --> 34:47.960
Oh, great.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.120
So here I was writing some tests and built up

34:51.120 --> 34:54.560
a thing on my system, and it's broken.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.000
Doesn't work, weird cryptic error.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.720
And a little bit of background is I'm using a couple of things.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.920
One is PyTest, which is a framework for testing.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.840
So it sort of lets you write your test files,

35:03.840 --> 35:05.840
and it'll go find them on disk and get things up

35:05.840 --> 35:07.560
and set them all up for you and execute them

35:07.560 --> 35:09.400
and report back how your tests went.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.280
Python also has asynchronous programming.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.840
So in addition to regular functions,

35:13.840 --> 35:16.160
you can make async functions.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.480
PyTest has a plug-in that helps make these

35:18.480 --> 35:19.960
act more like regular functions.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.660
So you don't have to worry about some of the async details.

35:21.660 --> 35:24.080
It'll handle automatically setting them up and scheduling

35:24.080 --> 35:25.280
them on an event loop.

35:25.280 --> 35:26.640
Oh, yeah.

35:26.640 --> 35:29.720
So it does some little magic wrapping to make that happen.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.760
I also use a project called Hypothesis,

35:31.760 --> 35:34.280
which is a great name, although kind of hard to Google

35:34.280 --> 35:35.820
sometimes if you don't know what you're doing, especially

35:35.820 --> 35:37.560
because there's so much data science that's

35:37.560 --> 35:38.680
done in Python as well.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.040
And they also use hypothesis testing.

35:41.040 --> 35:44.200
So you've got to figure out, OK, what do I pin this with?

35:44.200 --> 35:44.920
Yes.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.120
Thankfully, they've got a good read the docs page that

35:47.120 --> 35:49.200
has basically all you need.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.240
It's a tool for what's called generative testing.

35:52.240 --> 35:54.740
And so the idea is instead of specific test cases,

35:54.740 --> 35:56.200
not that you wouldn't do this too,

35:56.200 --> 35:59.020
but to go to the next level, you describe

35:59.020 --> 36:00.160
the shape of your inputs.

36:00.160 --> 36:03.400
Maybe that's input to an API or to a particular function call.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.400
And so that can be nested data structures.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.240
It could just be like, this function

36:07.240 --> 36:09.680
takes one integer and one string type.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.360
And then Hypothesis will handle generating

36:12.360 --> 36:14.360
a bunch of data from that description

36:14.360 --> 36:16.680
and then throwing it against your function or API.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.760
And then you can give it some sort of assertions.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.800
They say, given this input, I expect these things

36:21.800 --> 36:23.880
to be true about whatever happened in the background

36:23.880 --> 36:25.460
or whatever output I got.

36:25.460 --> 36:26.880
So then are you essentially doing

36:26.880 --> 36:29.360
programmatic input at scale to these things?

36:29.360 --> 36:29.520
Yeah.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.160
And then it can handle making a bunch of stuff.

36:31.160 --> 36:33.520
And then it tries to find little test cases to show.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.240
And it's really good, especially with some strings

36:35.240 --> 36:37.840
and other stuff, it'll test all the really big numbers.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.960
If you say, I'd just take a number or weird Unicode

36:39.960 --> 36:42.860
strings, it's a nice way to get yourself some extra testing

36:42.860 --> 36:44.960
and check your own assumptions about what you

36:44.960 --> 36:46.920
think your program is doing.

36:46.920 --> 36:50.440
But to do that, they're both manipulating these tests.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.400
Because Hypothesis sort of takes some of the role

36:52.400 --> 36:54.640
of executing, because it does a whole bunch of examples

36:54.640 --> 36:56.560
and kind of takes over from the test framework.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.720
So somewhere between Hypothesis, PyTest itself,

36:59.720 --> 37:02.760
and this PyTest async plugin support,

37:02.760 --> 37:04.640
it just wasn't working anymore.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.560
Jeez, man.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.540
Now, normally, these stuff, whenever I find an issue,

37:08.540 --> 37:09.380
it's already reported.

37:09.380 --> 37:11.560
This time, it had only just been reported.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.600
So I was able to dig in a little bit and help.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.840
But I was just really impressed, because there had just

37:15.840 --> 37:17.680
been a Hypothesis release.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.400
Before knowing any details, they were already like, OK,

37:20.400 --> 37:23.600
within 24 hours, we'll try to have this either fixed

37:23.600 --> 37:24.700
or rolled back.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.560
And admittedly, this is not a huge deal.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.160
It really isn't, because I can just pin that to the last

37:29.160 --> 37:30.500
release and move on.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.760
It's a particular tool used during testing.

37:32.760 --> 37:34.080
It doesn't affect production.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.200
It's really not a big deal.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.360
But I thought that was the thing.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.480
They didn't need to be that immediate about it.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.360
Yeah, it strikes me.

37:40.360 --> 37:43.520
It's like, when the developer is engaged,

37:43.520 --> 37:48.320
the experience at your position is so far above and beyond

37:48.320 --> 37:50.880
the kind of care you get from a commercial software developer.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.080
It's next level.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.040
It reminds me when you and I were implementing that DCA bot

37:56.040 --> 37:56.800
on the server here.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.120
And you discovered, what was it?

37:58.120 --> 38:00.840
There was a Python project in there that had a bug.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.320
And the developer was all over it.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.720
Oh, it was some of their getting the Docker stuff working

38:04.720 --> 38:06.760
and how the libraries were packaged in.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.840
Yeah, and I thought internally, there was some other thing

38:08.840 --> 38:09.920
that you discovered.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.040
And then you went to their GitHub,

38:11.040 --> 38:12.840
and the developer was already all over it.

38:12.840 --> 38:16.680
And you can really see, if you pick the right stack,

38:16.680 --> 38:18.880
in other words, if you use a well-supported software

38:18.880 --> 38:20.600
project when you're building stuff,

38:20.600 --> 38:25.080
the response and the care and the enthusiasm and joy

38:25.080 --> 38:27.440
that the developer can get out of it is infectious.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.360
And it's, like I just said, it's beyond anything

38:30.360 --> 38:32.240
you're ever going to get from a support contract.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.680
I was also impressed in this case,

38:33.680 --> 38:35.840
because it actually turned out that one

38:35.840 --> 38:37.320
of the issues with the hypothesis had,

38:37.320 --> 38:39.720
so it kind of has to detect, try to auto detect some stuff

38:39.720 --> 38:43.360
about the function that it's wrapping and running under test.

38:43.360 --> 38:46.440
And it got better at doing that with that latest release.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.280
Unfortunately, that meant it kind of uncovered a bug

38:49.280 --> 38:52.680
in the PyTest async IO support.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.360
Or it was one of those situations where

38:54.360 --> 38:56.800
it's kind of murky, like, is it both having bugs?

38:56.800 --> 38:59.720
Is it, like, what should happen here?

38:59.720 --> 39:01.440
But there wasn't any blame.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.320
The hypothesis folks weren't like, no, this

39:03.320 --> 39:04.640
was a PyTest async IO problem.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.640
We're not doing anything.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.280
They still fixed and did some updates

39:08.280 --> 39:10.240
and opened an issue with the other team who

39:10.240 --> 39:12.000
were receptive about it and got it fixed.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.120
And so at the end of the day, like a day later,

39:14.120 --> 39:16.840
I could undo my pin and just keep going about my life.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.880
But seeing immediately, like, all the hard work

39:18.880 --> 39:20.360
that went into it to make that happen.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.720
Yeah, and not that, no, it's his problem, not my problem.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.520
Which, it's not that I should expect,

39:24.520 --> 39:26.360
but just with humans and, you know,

39:26.360 --> 39:29.160
and we certainly sometimes cover the drama that can happen

39:29.160 --> 39:31.920
in pull requests out on GitHub.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.840
It was just nice to not see that.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.660
Indeed, that is a great story.

39:35.660 --> 39:37.240
Thank you for sharing that with us.

39:37.240 --> 39:40.160
It does remind me that there is a lot of good going

39:40.160 --> 39:41.920
on in open source, which is probably

39:41.920 --> 39:42.920
exactly what we needed.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.480
We'll have a link to BrainFuck, which

39:45.480 --> 39:49.000
has looked like a great way to hide stuff in plain sight.

39:49.000 --> 39:49.680
And it's neat.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.600
There's just some weird programming languages out there

39:51.600 --> 39:53.000
and it can be fun to play with.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.480
That's absolutely true.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.440
All right, so I decided for my topic

39:58.440 --> 40:02.920
to encrypt it in a very in plain sight kind of way.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.400
And I was also trying to solve the problem of how

40:05.400 --> 40:08.000
to not completely overtake the doc with like 32

40:08.000 --> 40:09.860
pages of characters.

40:09.860 --> 40:14.240
And I thought, well, I could link to like a pastebin

40:14.240 --> 40:15.800
kind of thing.

40:15.800 --> 40:16.920
And I almost went that route.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.600
But I felt like kind of was in violation

40:19.600 --> 40:20.640
of the spirit of the idea.

40:20.640 --> 40:22.840
And I thought we should have talked about that first.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.380
So what I decided to do instead is go for a simple route,

40:26.380 --> 40:30.480
a classic route that works every time.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.360
A mystery in plain sight.

40:33.360 --> 40:46.000
I went for steganography with a picture of Levi.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
It's got a little bow tie in here.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.960
And steganography is great because you can hide information

40:53.960 --> 40:55.440
in plain sight.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.520
And it would have worked perfectly

40:58.520 --> 41:00.680
if I wasn't using Markdown.

41:00.680 --> 41:04.640
But the encoder tool I used butchered my Markdown

41:04.640 --> 41:05.360
a little bit.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.280
So it wasn't great.

41:07.280 --> 41:08.960
But I think the concept was still solid.

41:08.960 --> 41:09.560
I felt like it.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.560
So not only did you ruin partially your Markdown,

41:11.560 --> 41:13.880
you made the picture of Levi slightly degraded,

41:13.880 --> 41:15.680
which that should be a sin right there.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.920
And 8.9 megabytes.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.880
Yeah, it really.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.600
It's like if you were looking to see which photo had

41:23.600 --> 41:25.360
the secret information, and this isn't even

41:25.360 --> 41:27.880
a ton of information, you would just look at the file size

41:27.880 --> 41:30.120
and be the one of these is not like the others.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.360
So it's not that sneaky.

41:31.360 --> 41:34.680
But I have found this great little spots

41:34.680 --> 41:37.600
from friends of the family out in really just

41:37.600 --> 41:42.080
like the bottom of the Cascades, just really at the foothill.

41:42.080 --> 41:44.400
But the only problem is, and we want

41:44.400 --> 41:46.720
to go out there to visit them, but the only problem is,

41:46.720 --> 41:50.520
well, it's a great thing, but there's no internet out there.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.160
It's possible the Starlink might work.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.280
But I actually, I don't know, because they

41:54.280 --> 41:55.920
tried to get Starlink out there and they told them

41:55.920 --> 41:56.720
it's not available.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.760
Oh.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.080
Now, I've decided what I want to do

42:00.080 --> 42:02.280
is rebuild my offline Oracle.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.560
And this is an idea that I've talked about on self-hosted

42:04.560 --> 42:05.160
before.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.160
And it's to create a self-sufficient knowledge

42:08.160 --> 42:11.560
base in the RV that essentially creates

42:11.560 --> 42:14.400
the experience of being online without being online.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.880
And so here's my thinking on this.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.880
Oh, I like this.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.200
There are two different options, and I'm

42:20.200 --> 42:22.360
going to play with both of them, but I'd really

42:22.360 --> 42:23.840
like people's feedback too.

42:23.840 --> 42:27.360
On YouTube server, YouTube DL servers,

42:27.360 --> 42:31.600
I'd love it to be YTDL server, that runs in a container

42:31.600 --> 42:33.800
on a Raspberry Pi, and it gives me a web interface

42:33.800 --> 42:36.360
that I just drop a YouTube URL into.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.000
And then it downloads in the background

42:38.000 --> 42:41.960
and saves the MP4 from YouTube to my local hard drive

42:41.960 --> 42:43.480
where I tell it to.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.880
And then I have a local PeerTube instance

42:46.880 --> 42:51.160
that is indexing that folder that these videos download to.

42:51.160 --> 42:53.680
So then the idea being that later on when

42:53.680 --> 42:54.680
we need to do something.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.300
So we wanted to go out to this location

42:56.300 --> 42:58.600
because our friends here are very handy.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.920
They've helped us build things in the past.

43:00.920 --> 43:03.880
But have the ability to watch the tutorials and stuff

43:03.880 --> 43:05.480
that we have found so useful on YouTube

43:05.480 --> 43:06.560
without having YouTube.

43:06.560 --> 43:06.800
Right.

43:06.800 --> 43:08.840
I mean, that's kind of a lot of the workflow, especially

43:08.840 --> 43:10.160
for home improvement stuff these days, right?

43:10.160 --> 43:11.880
It's like, can I re-consult this six times

43:11.880 --> 43:12.920
so I can figure out what I'm doing?

43:12.920 --> 43:13.920
Oh, it's so great, right?

43:13.920 --> 43:16.920
Like, seriously now, if we need to go fix something

43:16.920 --> 43:19.720
in the plumbing or check something with the wiring,

43:19.720 --> 43:22.040
one of my first stops now is I check YouTube

43:22.040 --> 43:24.880
and see if somebody else is torn this thing apart in their RV

43:24.880 --> 43:26.400
and has replaced it before, or how do you

43:26.400 --> 43:27.560
change the oil in the generator?

43:27.560 --> 43:28.480
I learn via YouTube.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.360
So I want to collect all those.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.760
And I have a playlist where I've saved a lot of these

43:31.760 --> 43:33.800
on YouTube already, not all of them, but a lot of them.

43:33.800 --> 43:36.100
And I want to be able to add more as time goes on when

43:36.100 --> 43:37.640
I do have internet connectivity.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.280
I think Brent, Casey, and myself all have the same question.

43:40.280 --> 43:41.320
Brent, take it away.

43:41.320 --> 43:43.320
Chris, why are you landing on PeerTube instead

43:43.320 --> 43:45.940
of something like Jellyfin or EvenPlex

43:45.940 --> 43:47.280
that you already have in place?

43:47.280 --> 43:48.240
That's a great question.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.000
Can't you just download it to a folder there,

43:50.000 --> 43:51.740
and it's already doing everything for you?

43:51.740 --> 43:53.320
So I'll do all of the above.

43:53.320 --> 43:56.680
I will have it indexed by Plex or Jellyfin.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.920
So it'll be available on the TV.

43:58.920 --> 44:02.040
But I am imagining, in five years,

44:02.040 --> 44:04.360
we could be looking at 300 videos,

44:04.360 --> 44:06.200
because it's not just going to be RV stuff.

44:06.200 --> 44:08.440
It's going to be any kind of construction things

44:08.440 --> 44:09.800
that Hideo wants to work on.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.600
It's going to be gardening topics.

44:11.600 --> 44:13.880
It's going to be an oracle of information.

44:13.880 --> 44:16.320
And I think one of the ways to browse

44:16.320 --> 44:19.720
that is by having a YouTube-like front end that

44:19.720 --> 44:23.560
has search, that has categories, that has playlists.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.340
I think there is real utility to that.

44:25.340 --> 44:26.640
I don't think it's going to be.

44:26.640 --> 44:30.480
And what's great about having this as my own oracle here

44:30.480 --> 44:32.480
is I can consume it in any way I want.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.600
So I could just bring up the file system

44:34.600 --> 44:36.420
and look at the MP4 files.

44:36.420 --> 44:38.840
I could bring it up on Jellyfin on the TV.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.600
Or I could do PeerTube on our computer.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.560
And if you think about how you kind of start

44:42.560 --> 44:43.920
a project like this, it's usually

44:43.920 --> 44:45.920
you bring up the laptop or something like that.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.720
You start looking at stuff.

44:47.720 --> 44:49.640
I think it's just one of the nice ways to do it.

44:49.640 --> 44:54.680
But combine that with right now, and to your question earlier,

44:54.680 --> 44:57.560
Brent, I'm using something called, oh, I always

44:57.560 --> 44:59.560
get the name wrong, Wes.

44:59.560 --> 45:01.520
Oh, I can't wait for this one.

45:01.520 --> 45:03.360
And you only have it in your secret doc.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.040
So we can't help you.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.360
You're on your own this time.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.640
I think it's Ranteo.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.280
OK.

45:10.280 --> 45:14.760
R-A-N-E-T-O. Ranteo?

45:14.760 --> 45:15.240
Ranteo.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.480
Ranteo.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.960
I don't know because that E is before the T. I don't know.

45:18.960 --> 45:23.920
But this, oh, god, it's such a simple but powerful tool.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.760
Markdown-powered knowledge base.

45:25.760 --> 45:29.920
It sits on top of just Markdown files, not a database.

45:29.920 --> 45:34.400
You could SSH in, write it all up in nano, like a gentleman,

45:34.400 --> 45:35.640
save it to the file system.

45:35.640 --> 45:38.600
And then the next time you load this page up,

45:38.600 --> 45:39.400
it'll be on there.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.480
And then it displays it as the HTML version.

45:41.480 --> 45:42.720
Moustache templates.

45:42.720 --> 45:44.640
It also gives you search.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.000
It's just basically it's a Node.js app, right?

45:47.000 --> 45:49.280
I think I don't remember, but I seem to recall just

45:49.280 --> 45:50.760
being a Node.js app.

45:50.760 --> 45:54.080
But it's a really nice way to present the information.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.640
It supports syntax highlighting.

45:56.640 --> 46:00.160
It does have a search powered by Lunar, L-U-N-R.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.520
And of course, it uses Markdown, which is my preferred way

46:02.520 --> 46:03.360
to take notes.

46:03.360 --> 46:07.040
And so you can document, like what I've done in the past,

46:07.040 --> 46:09.280
I'll document something using VS code.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.160
I have the SSH save as extension installed.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.240
And then I just save as to this directory.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.080
And then the next time we pull this up,

46:16.080 --> 46:17.280
all the information is there.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.560
That's nice.

46:18.560 --> 46:22.160
I'll also, it's where I also capture my Docker compose files

46:22.160 --> 46:25.160
for looking up later on.

46:25.160 --> 46:27.080
And I really like this workflow.

46:27.080 --> 46:29.160
But I'm also, and I would love feedback

46:29.160 --> 46:31.600
if anybody out there has tried Bookstack.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.240
I'm looking at Bookstack.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.160
This is really similar.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.720
It's at bookstackapp.com.

46:37.720 --> 46:39.600
This leans a little more towards wiki.

46:39.600 --> 46:43.120
And I know, oh man, I know there's so many wikis.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.560
Tiny wiki, tiddly wiki.

46:44.560 --> 46:45.880
I know, and they're really good.

46:45.880 --> 46:47.520
I like, no one else can see this,

46:47.520 --> 46:51.040
but you pointed at the IRC room as if they were trying

46:51.040 --> 46:52.200
to send you wikis.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.520
I totally like just wagged my finger.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.360
I know chat room, I know.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.760
Like a torrent of wikis is coming for you.

46:57.760 --> 46:59.520
The links are coming.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.280
But Bookstack is a simple, self-hosted,

47:01.280 --> 47:03.040
easy to use platform for organizing

47:03.040 --> 47:04.280
and storing information.

47:04.280 --> 47:08.040
And again, Markdown supported, MIT licensed.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.000
It's up on GitHub.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.080
And you can use a WYSIWYG interface

47:12.080 --> 47:13.720
to take the notes if you like.

47:13.720 --> 47:15.440
It supports things like chapters.

47:15.440 --> 47:19.240
You can organize things into books.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.960
I mean, it seems really powerful.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.840
And it also has some authentication options.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.480
You can actually be, that's my one thing is.

47:25.480 --> 47:27.000
Yeah, that's a whole other layer here.

47:27.000 --> 47:27.760
Yeah.

47:27.760 --> 47:30.000
I don't have that kind of security with Ranteo

47:30.000 --> 47:31.560
or however you say it.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.840
And this even supports two-factor authentication,

47:34.840 --> 47:36.240
which could be really nice when you

47:36.240 --> 47:38.440
want to put sensitive information in there.

47:38.440 --> 47:40.480
And I could then take it to the next level.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.880
And it'll also integrate with a single sign-on provider

47:42.880 --> 47:44.920
and that kind of stuff.

47:44.920 --> 47:47.720
So I'd love to know if anybody has experience with Bookstack.

47:47.720 --> 47:51.200
Send me a boost or send me an email

47:51.200 --> 47:53.160
and let me know what your experiences are with it,

47:53.160 --> 47:54.080
if you have.

47:54.080 --> 47:57.880
Because I'm considering it, but it seems like a big jump.

47:57.880 --> 48:00.200
And then last but not least, I think

48:00.200 --> 48:04.040
it's pronounced Heemdall, H-E-I-M-D-A-L-L.

48:04.040 --> 48:06.360
This is what I'm going to set on our home

48:06.360 --> 48:10.520
pages for our browsers at home that is a really easy

48:10.520 --> 48:13.080
to build home dashboard, where I'll have links

48:13.080 --> 48:15.240
to the knowledge base, links to Home Assistant.

48:15.240 --> 48:16.360
You can have widgets in there.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.860
I'll have the Bitcoin price in there

48:17.860 --> 48:20.760
because I like to torture myself like that.

48:20.760 --> 48:23.560
And you can have news headlines in there, feeds in there.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.080
Very easy to set up.

48:25.080 --> 48:29.520
And just about all of this is even available as a Linux server

48:29.520 --> 48:30.160
I.O.

48:30.160 --> 48:30.880
Oh, cool.

48:30.880 --> 48:31.520
Great.

48:31.520 --> 48:34.000
I don't know if all of it is, but most of it, if not all of it.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.640
So this is my journey I'm starting.

48:35.640 --> 48:40.320
My goal is by August to have all of this implemented.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.320
The reason why I'm giving myself that much time

48:42.320 --> 48:45.480
is because I'm still considering hardware changes.

48:45.480 --> 48:47.560
I'm going to go into a lot more detail and self-host it

48:47.560 --> 48:48.480
once I have it all figured out.

48:48.480 --> 48:50.120
And I'll document the journey there

48:50.120 --> 48:51.360
and what I end up with it all.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.000
But I'm at the very beginning phase

48:53.000 --> 48:57.200
right now with the idea of really taking this offline home

48:57.200 --> 48:59.920
that I have in our in-juice right now, which

48:59.920 --> 49:02.040
is made up of two to three pies, depending

49:02.040 --> 49:05.280
if I want my camera recorder going or not.

49:05.280 --> 49:08.840
And I'm curious to know how I can refactor that

49:08.840 --> 49:11.880
and what this next generation of software is looking at.

49:11.880 --> 49:15.080
I'm kind of reconsidering doing my entire home assistant setup.

49:15.080 --> 49:17.080
Like, it's a big summer project coming up.

49:17.080 --> 49:18.120
Yeah, I like this.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.840
Yeah, I think it's going to be good.

49:19.840 --> 49:23.040
And I suspect it's all going to really come down

49:23.040 --> 49:25.720
to just the least friction for the family

49:25.720 --> 49:27.080
to get the information they need.

49:27.080 --> 49:30.560
Like, whatever system they take, whatever they're good with,

49:30.560 --> 49:31.400
I can adapt.

49:31.400 --> 49:32.200
I'll adapt to that.

49:32.200 --> 49:35.160
Yeah, you just need them to buy into the system at all, right?

49:35.160 --> 49:36.560
That's going to be part of this process

49:36.560 --> 49:38.160
is you've got to get family buy-off.

49:38.160 --> 49:41.120
Otherwise, for example, if my wife, Adia,

49:41.120 --> 49:43.680
isn't inputting the information, then we're

49:43.680 --> 49:44.920
only capturing half the stuff.

49:44.920 --> 49:47.680
And she keeps really good track of all of the repair records

49:47.680 --> 49:48.040
and stuff.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.640
And that's a great example of something

49:49.640 --> 49:51.360
I'd love in a system like this.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.040
So we shall see.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.840
But I'd love to hear people's experience with it.

49:55.840 --> 49:58.280
And it was an adorable picture of Levi, wasn't it?

49:58.280 --> 50:01.000
Oh, I could share the link, couldn't we?

50:01.000 --> 50:04.160
Yeah, I'll put a link to the show notes

50:04.160 --> 50:06.560
if you want to run that through a decrypter.

50:06.560 --> 50:08.080
That's my Levi right there.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.800
Can you tell us which piece of software

50:09.800 --> 50:12.960
to throw your information behind to Levi?

50:12.960 --> 50:14.760
Your Dagonography, let's say?

50:14.760 --> 50:16.560
You know, I tried a couple of desktop apps.

50:16.560 --> 50:19.560
But then I realized I wanted to just do it here

50:19.560 --> 50:20.760
at the studio machine.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.600
I didn't want to install anything.

50:22.600 --> 50:25.240
So I just Google searched a web's Dagonography tool,

50:25.240 --> 50:27.200
which is why I think it botched my markdown.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.280
If I'd used a proper app.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.600
You're throwing shade on the tool, huh?

50:30.600 --> 50:31.400
Oh, yeah.

50:31.400 --> 50:33.520
My markdown's not solid, dude.

50:33.520 --> 50:34.600
What are you talking about?

50:34.600 --> 50:38.720
My markdown is absolutely solid.

50:38.720 --> 50:41.800
It's not my fault.

50:41.800 --> 50:45.960
And now, as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

50:48.920 --> 50:51.600
Why don't we do, before we get to the Boost, just some super

50:51.600 --> 50:54.520
compact follow-up to last week's episode.

50:54.520 --> 50:57.840
Last week, we talked about the Umbral project,

50:57.840 --> 51:00.240
which lets you run containers and do self-hosting

51:00.240 --> 51:01.880
with their front-end UI.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.960
And they followed up on our episode

51:03.960 --> 51:07.520
and let us know that one of the features they're rolling out

51:07.520 --> 51:09.200
in the near future is the ability

51:09.200 --> 51:12.720
to uninstall the Bitcoin node aspect of that.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.440
So Umbral sounded interesting, but you

51:14.440 --> 51:17.520
didn't want to dedicate the disk space to a node.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.600
That's going to now just be like one of the apps

51:19.600 --> 51:21.600
that you'll be able to install or remove.

51:21.600 --> 51:22.240
Nice.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.080
Yeah.

51:23.080 --> 51:25.360
Also on the topic of Umbral, a software update

51:25.360 --> 51:28.840
included the Snowflake Tor proxy, which is really easy.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.520
Just one click to install now.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.600
They're doing this to help Ukrainian and Russian

51:32.600 --> 51:34.600
journalists and activists and civilians that

51:34.600 --> 51:37.160
are trying to bypass internet restrictions

51:37.160 --> 51:39.520
and really anyone who needs to use the Tor project to help

51:39.520 --> 51:41.120
bypass censorship.

51:41.120 --> 51:44.000
This Snowflake Tor proxy is a standalone project on its own.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.640
I'll have a link to it in the show notes

51:45.640 --> 51:46.960
if you're interested.

51:46.960 --> 51:51.040
And it's a way to add some capacity to the Tor network

51:51.040 --> 51:53.280
without revealing your own IP.

51:53.280 --> 51:55.800
It uses an IP from the Tor node internally.

51:55.800 --> 51:57.360
And you're helping route some of that.

51:57.360 --> 51:58.760
And it's run by volunteers.

51:58.760 --> 52:01.800
And now it's a one-click app install on Umbral

52:01.800 --> 52:03.680
if you would like to do so.

52:03.680 --> 52:05.600
Slick.

52:05.600 --> 52:07.080
But we do have some boosts.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.800
We do have some boosts.

52:08.800 --> 52:11.920
Batvin321 sent this in two days ago.

52:11.920 --> 52:17.640
50 sats, which is like 0.2 cents, I think.

52:17.640 --> 52:19.280
Something like that.

52:19.280 --> 52:21.880
But Bat lives on the East Coast.

52:21.880 --> 52:24.560
And he's looking to hitch a ride with somebody from Maryland

52:24.560 --> 52:26.600
for five hours to get to the meetup.

52:26.600 --> 52:29.800
So if you want a road buddy from Maryland on,

52:29.800 --> 52:32.280
send a boost to us with your contact info.

52:32.280 --> 52:34.800
And we will put you guys in touch.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.520
Heck yeah.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.240
We got another boost from Dave Jones.

52:38.240 --> 52:40.080
He seems to be one of our favorites.

52:40.080 --> 52:41.200
He says, 8 terabytes.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.320
Holy crap.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.280
You have enough room for 50 years of blockchain.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.280
Huzzah.

52:45.280 --> 52:47.240
Yeah, but I got to run multiple nodes, right?

52:47.240 --> 52:48.040
I got to have space for it.

52:48.040 --> 52:49.480
I'm running other nodes.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.040
Yeah, you're on all kinds of chains.

52:51.040 --> 52:52.440
I love it.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.080
George Boosts in with 1,000 sats.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.520
Trying out the Lightning Network.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.400
Thanks for the awesome recommendation.

52:58.400 --> 52:59.600
Thank you, George.

52:59.600 --> 53:02.360
One of the reasons we are featuring the boosts

53:02.360 --> 53:05.020
in the show, because seriously, that's not a lot of money,

53:05.020 --> 53:06.800
although we really do appreciate it.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.880
I think the more we build this out,

53:08.880 --> 53:11.560
and it's a peer-to-peer network, the more possibilities

53:11.560 --> 53:15.160
we have down the road of finding other alternative ways

53:15.160 --> 53:16.920
to finance free software.

53:16.920 --> 53:21.240
And we have free software developers in Ukraine right now

53:21.240 --> 53:23.800
that their whole world's just changed.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.080
We have free software developers in Russia.

53:26.080 --> 53:27.680
Their whole world just changed.

53:27.680 --> 53:30.520
We need to have a system that maybe runs parallel

53:30.520 --> 53:31.600
to all of that.

53:31.600 --> 53:35.280
And so as the audience of the world's largest Linux podcast

53:35.280 --> 53:38.080
begins to adopt a system like this,

53:38.080 --> 53:40.560
we are building out a peer-to-peer network that

53:40.560 --> 53:42.480
is the same exact kind of audience

53:42.480 --> 53:44.880
that is likely to help contribute to free software.

53:44.880 --> 53:48.000
So I think there is, when George gets all hooked up here,

53:48.000 --> 53:49.600
he's trying out the Lightning Network.

53:49.600 --> 53:52.760
He's building a pathway now that if his favorite free software

53:52.760 --> 53:54.560
project down the road starts doing this,

53:54.560 --> 53:57.000
starts running free software and taking a free software

53:57.000 --> 53:59.160
currency over the internet, he now

53:59.160 --> 54:01.640
has all the plumbing to support that project.

54:01.640 --> 54:03.400
I think that's huge.

54:03.400 --> 54:04.880
Also, Matt wrote in as well.

54:04.880 --> 54:08.760
He says, y'all should really check out Start9's embassy.

54:08.760 --> 54:10.680
Same idea as Umbral with a different approach.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.320
I personally use Umbral and love it.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.400
But it seems like the Start9 guys

54:14.400 --> 54:16.480
are focused on the long term.

54:16.480 --> 54:19.320
Great interview with one of the guys from Start9,

54:19.320 --> 54:21.160
and he linked to us.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.280
Guys, have you heard of Start9 before?

54:23.280 --> 54:25.040
We got a few people writing in about it,

54:25.040 --> 54:26.640
and I hadn't heard of it before.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.760
I don't think I had either.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.880
No, no.

54:28.880 --> 54:29.760
It looks great.

54:29.760 --> 54:30.800
Same kind of idea.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.120
You can either buy a box.

54:33.120 --> 54:37.320
So they got a $630 box that has a two terabyte SSD connected

54:37.320 --> 54:39.720
to a Raspberry Pi 4.

54:39.720 --> 54:43.280
And it's that same idea of a plug and play private server

54:43.280 --> 54:47.280
that allows one click installation with some good

54:47.280 --> 54:50.240
sane defaults of some of the most powerful popular self

54:50.240 --> 54:53.440
hosted applications that allow you to take sovereign control

54:53.440 --> 54:56.560
over your data, or your finances, or your chat,

54:56.560 --> 54:57.560
or whatever it might be.

54:57.560 --> 55:01.040
And what do you know, a DIY guide with a Raspberry Pi.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.760
Yeah, that's pretty nice.

55:02.760 --> 55:04.840
I thought their model was kind of interesting too.

55:04.840 --> 55:09.100
You can buy Start9 OS for like $180 USD,

55:09.100 --> 55:11.080
or you can build it yourself, which

55:11.080 --> 55:14.360
is their seemingly, I think, only sort of do

55:14.360 --> 55:15.600
yourself open source version.

55:15.600 --> 55:17.880
So I thought that was fascinating,

55:17.880 --> 55:19.920
and hopefully it keeps the project going as well.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.960
Seems like they're doing some interesting work.

55:21.960 --> 55:23.760
Yeah, I mean, imagine, dude, if this thing

55:23.760 --> 55:25.840
helped you de-Google completely, that's

55:25.840 --> 55:27.320
probably worth $180.

55:27.320 --> 55:28.280
Oh, I'd say so.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.000
Yeah.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.440
Sometimes it's nice to see that they've at least,

55:30.440 --> 55:31.720
whether or not you like it, they're

55:31.720 --> 55:34.640
at least thinking about how to support themselves and keep

55:34.640 --> 55:35.400
development going.

55:35.400 --> 55:36.760
So if you're going to buy into the platform,

55:36.760 --> 55:37.600
that's probably good.

55:37.600 --> 55:42.000
The reality is putting a price on it that's $180 is real money.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.960
That's $5 isn't going to pay the bills.

55:43.960 --> 55:46.140
$180 maybe actually makes a difference,

55:46.140 --> 55:49.200
and it makes a project sustainable.

55:49.200 --> 55:51.320
I think we're going to have to come around and realize

55:51.320 --> 55:54.360
that boutique software, anything that's a small boutique team

55:54.360 --> 55:56.280
working on something for a niche audience

55:56.280 --> 55:58.560
is always going to be struggling to monetize.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.120
And that comes for content, or it's

56:01.120 --> 56:02.560
true for free software development.

56:02.560 --> 56:07.000
And that's why I look at the price $630 for a machine,

56:07.000 --> 56:09.640
that's probably not even a lot of profit in that for them.

56:09.640 --> 56:10.840
But there's definitely some, because they're

56:10.840 --> 56:13.560
building around a pie and a case and a whole setup.

56:13.560 --> 56:15.760
So hopefully start nine is something

56:15.760 --> 56:17.040
that could be around for a while.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.920
Because sovereign computing, as this term

56:19.920 --> 56:21.920
is becoming more popular, I can really

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
wrap my head around that.

56:22.920 --> 56:25.960
It doesn't have to have anything to do with Bitcoin.

56:25.960 --> 56:30.280
It can just mean you switched to Bitwarden from LastPass.

56:30.280 --> 56:33.480
Maybe it means you switched from WhatsApp to Matrix,

56:33.480 --> 56:35.040
or something like that.

56:35.040 --> 56:38.400
It is, I think, going to be a really important topic

56:38.400 --> 56:42.120
on the show for a while, is applying self-control where

56:42.120 --> 56:46.200
you decide it's appropriate, and not being a hardliner about it,

56:46.200 --> 56:48.460
not being a purist about it, but being

56:48.460 --> 56:50.480
sensible and realistic and practical about it,

56:50.480 --> 56:54.000
and realize that each one of us has our own comfort level.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
So let's talk about what some of our options are.

56:56.000 --> 56:56.880
Yeah, Chris, I agree.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.880
And Dave also wrote in about start nine.

56:59.880 --> 57:01.560
He sort of clued us onto that.

57:01.560 --> 57:03.680
But he asked a question about Tor, specifically.

57:03.680 --> 57:05.360
And I thought that was worth mentioning,

57:05.360 --> 57:06.760
since we forgot to mention it last week.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.160
He said, I've been hearing you guys rave about Umbral.

57:09.160 --> 57:10.800
And it sent me down the rabbit hole

57:10.800 --> 57:13.520
of this type of all-in-one server solution, which

57:13.520 --> 57:15.480
I'm diving in with you.

57:15.480 --> 57:17.000
While doing my research on Umbral,

57:17.000 --> 57:19.560
I caught a post about start nine.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.800
On the surface, it seems very similar to Umbral,

57:21.800 --> 57:24.640
with a focus on Bitcoin and privacy-based apps.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.720
What I found interesting was their use of the Tor network

57:27.720 --> 57:31.120
to allow secure access to your home lab remotely.

57:31.120 --> 57:32.160
Have you seen this before?

57:32.160 --> 57:34.200
I currently rely on WireGuard via TailScale

57:34.200 --> 57:35.460
for my home lab access.

57:35.460 --> 57:37.800
But I was intrigued by the Tor idea.

57:37.800 --> 57:39.040
That is really handy.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.340
Umbral does this as well.

57:40.340 --> 57:41.480
We didn't really get into it.

57:41.480 --> 57:45.360
But my methodology is actually to use TailScale.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.120
I'm a little more comfortable with that.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.800
And I prefer to turn the Tor stuff off.

57:49.800 --> 57:53.840
However, the nice thing is some developers

57:53.840 --> 57:58.440
are building Tor support into the client app on your phone.

57:58.440 --> 58:01.760
And so you can connect to your Umbral services

58:01.760 --> 58:06.000
or your start nine services over Tor.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.280
The advantage to that is, besides the obvious privacy

58:09.280 --> 58:13.280
advantages, which are not insignificant,

58:13.280 --> 58:15.780
the advantage is that you don't have

58:15.780 --> 58:18.120
to fumble around with NAT or port forwarding

58:18.120 --> 58:19.080
or any of that junk.

58:19.080 --> 58:21.920
You don't have to start bringing in outside connections

58:21.920 --> 58:24.240
from any WAN address into your LAN.

58:24.240 --> 58:26.040
You don't worry about any of that.

58:26.040 --> 58:30.680
These systems help generate Tor addresses

58:30.680 --> 58:33.200
for your individual applications running on them.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.720
Now, you can look into the security or safety of that.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.440
I have preferred just to turn it off.

58:37.440 --> 58:39.800
But it's certainly nice, because if you leave it on,

58:39.800 --> 58:41.800
then you get one of these apps like BlueWallet

58:41.800 --> 58:42.840
or some of these other apps that can

58:42.840 --> 58:44.280
connect to these different services.

58:44.280 --> 58:45.960
And you give them your Onion address,

58:45.960 --> 58:48.300
or whatever it's called, or whatever the URL is.

58:48.300 --> 58:50.540
I really don't use Tor enough to probably talk

58:50.540 --> 58:51.760
about it intelligently.

58:51.760 --> 58:53.760
But then the app can connect to it without, again,

58:53.760 --> 58:55.720
any ports being opened or anything like that.

58:55.720 --> 58:56.160
It's really nice.

58:56.160 --> 58:58.880
Yeah, you can see it acting as sort of the standard, right?

58:58.880 --> 59:00.540
That, yeah, different parties can come to,

59:00.540 --> 59:02.800
and then you're all in the same high-level network.

59:02.800 --> 59:03.560
Yeah.

59:03.560 --> 59:05.760
You know, what I loved about these platforms is that,

59:05.760 --> 59:08.060
and I think I mentioned this last week, is that for me,

59:08.060 --> 59:09.800
it was just maybe a touching stone

59:09.800 --> 59:13.520
on investigating a bunch of technologies I'm curious about.

59:13.520 --> 59:17.640
And so getting to play with Tor, I've heard of it for decades.

59:17.640 --> 59:22.240
But to have it just be accessible so easily via Umbral,

59:22.240 --> 59:24.720
it was really fun, actually, just booting up the Tor browser

59:24.720 --> 59:26.280
and seeing kind of how that works.

59:26.280 --> 59:30.800
Maybe we should do an episode on unique use cases for Tor.

59:30.800 --> 59:33.520
And maybe, because that kind of would go well with our IPFS

59:33.520 --> 59:34.040
episode.

59:34.040 --> 59:34.480
Yeah.

59:34.480 --> 59:37.360
I don't know, something to think about if people have any ideas.

59:37.360 --> 59:38.360
Send us a boost.

59:38.360 --> 59:39.360
Boost a grant.

59:39.360 --> 59:42.720
Get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

59:42.720 --> 59:45.000
And then send us a boost and let us

59:45.000 --> 59:49.200
know what you think we should cover with Tor or IPFS.

59:49.200 --> 59:50.320
That would be pretty great.

59:50.320 --> 59:52.840
I think that could be an area that we could probably

59:52.840 --> 59:54.000
find some unique uses for.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.880
I wonder if there's a way we could get access

59:55.880 --> 59:58.880
to a system in the studio using Tor,

59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.340
and then people could do something.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.840
I think we could have fun with that.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.460
Come find us at a future Onion address.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.040
Yeah.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.840
We may have one for you soon.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.680
Or join us live and hang out while we're

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.640
producing these shows.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.200
We do them on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern,

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.920
at jblive.tv, or you can t'watch us at twitch.tv

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.240
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.640
And then you get a t'watchification

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:21.400
when we go live.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.000
And that seems pretty useful.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.320
See you next week.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.000
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.760
If you haven't caught Linux action news yet,

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.400
what are you doing?

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.200
How about some accurate, concise coverage

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.720
that tells you exactly what you need

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.560
to know without any of the stupid drama

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.920
added in with clear explanations on how it impacts you

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920
and the wider industry?

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.320
Because that's Linux action news.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.520
That's what you're missing.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.360
Oh my god, that's embarrassing.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.520
Linuxactionnews.com.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.760
Go get it.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.440
More Westpane over there as well.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.760
So how could you miss it?

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.520
Links to everything we talked about today

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.560
are at linuxunplug.com slash 448, our contact page

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.800
for your emails, which we love, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.800
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.080
of the Unplugged program.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.200
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:23.200
Oh.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200
Mm-hm.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:50.600
All right, while we vote on the title at JBtitles.com, I think we should give some airtime to One

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:56.440
Note because I know it has its lovers. And in full balance, I think it's only appropriate.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.320
So none of us use it. So New West has offered to be the One Note guy.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.240
You know what I appreciate on a Linux show, a guy who's willing to come on

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:10.280
and admit he uses One Note. So tell us why you love it so much.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:16.120
I don't know if I love it so much is the right term. Try and save a little bit of face there,

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:25.080
right? Fair enough. But I like how it's so incredibly easy to set up and get going and

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:29.640
you don't have to worry about manually syncing anything. You don't have to worry about self

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:36.200
hosting. It's kind of along those lines of why your average person doesn't have a NextCloud

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:41.960
instance, right? Because there's a lot of things that you have to do in order to get that kind of

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:48.200
functionality working. And so I've never looked into note taking apps. And y'all always talk

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.840
about, oh, I just take my notes in Markdown or whatever. It's like, I'm not great at Markdown.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:59.720
Not yet. So I can't really, that doesn't come as easy to me. And so the fact that One Note just

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:09.720
syncs and I can access it via a web UI as well, right? Which is how I use it on Linux.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.240
Oh, I was going to ask about that. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, tab the brakes.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:18.280
Is this a hosted OneNote that you're accessing? Is it your own local instance over the web? Like,

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.520
how does that work? It's Microsoft. So, so you just, so it's like a hosted thing. Yeah. It's

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:27.560
like a hosted thing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then I log into my Microsoft account and it syncs

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:35.240
all of my OneNote notebooks that I have. I've got the apps on my phone and my tablet too,

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:41.400
which is great. It's got really good pen support. So I've got like a Tab S6 Lite. And so if I want

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.280
to do handwritten notes, I just pull out my pen, I pull out my tablet and I just write handwritten

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.400
notes down. That part's tempting too. Best of both worlds right there. I would like to try that.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:58.520
Man, I would like to try. Yeah, it's really, it's, it's super easy. And I think the one thing I don't

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.600
like about it, aside from obviously the privacy concerns, right, is probably that it gets a little

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:08.200
messy. I feel like I have to go in and prune my notebooks because I've got a whole bunch of them.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:13.160
And because you don't really control the data, like I haven't, I, and I haven't really dedicated

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:16.680
a lot of time to this either, but I find that I have like a bunch of old notebooks that I've kind

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.640
of like created and jotted one or two notes down. And now they're just like forever. They're getting

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:28.920
synced across all of my devices. Yes. All right. Well, thanks for the OneNote perspective.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.920
Here's to you, Microsoft.
