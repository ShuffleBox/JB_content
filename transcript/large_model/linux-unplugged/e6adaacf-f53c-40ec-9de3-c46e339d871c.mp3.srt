1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Well, if you bet that the LinuxCopter would make it more than a year,

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,120
you might be able to cash in.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,920
It looks like the Pioneer Little Chopter has made the one-year mark on Mars,

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,560
which I can't believe.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,360
I don't know, Wes, I would have guessed six months.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,480
It's been six months.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,680
I think after it did so well, I thought it would just keep going.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,680
But from the start, I was, I was pretty nervous, you know, like you just,

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,680
until these are proved out, anything could happen on Mars.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm also still bracing myself every time I see one of these articles.

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm like bracing myself for, well, it did so good and exceeded our

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,600
expectations, but it's definitely starting to fade now.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,480
There's too much dust on the solar panels, right?

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,400
Cause it's not like they can go out there and brush those things off.

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,720
But there's a quote here that says, we're quote, still going very strong.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,760
And that was from the deputy operations lead at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
So they would know.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,040
More exciting science to come.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,600
It's probably because it runs Linux, right?

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:59,800
It's gotta be.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,040
My name is Chris.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,920
My name is Wes.

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,960
And my name is Brent.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Hello, gentlemen.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,120
Thanks for joining me today.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,120
Hello.

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,240
You know, last week we had fun talking about low end $15 Linux boxes.

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,360
Well, this week we're going to the other extreme and we're reviewing a new

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,240
Ryzen powered kudu from a system 76.

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,120
I gave this thing the full ML special.

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,840
No, not machine learning.

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,600
The Michael Larable special.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,680
No, actually, it was machine learning benchmarks from the Franxx test suite.

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,160
But I also just punished the heck out of it with my Steam library because.

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
Yeah, it's got an RTX 3060 in it.

37
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,480
I don't think I've used a graphics card that new since the pandemic began.

38
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,600
So I was excited.

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,640
So after we talk about what I did with this thing and who I think this laptop

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,160
is going to be good for, we'll round it all out with some great emails,

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,800
some great emails, a whole rash of pics.

42
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,520
It's a rash, Wes, and more.

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,000
So you're going to want to stick around for all of that.

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,080
I mean, I would.

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,640
But before we go any further, we got to say hello to our virtual log

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
time appropriate greetings.

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,080
Mumble room.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,560
Hello.

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
Hello, hello, Brent.

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
Good to have you all in there today on a Sunday on a Sunday.

51
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,960
Come on and join us.

52
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,200
Sometimes you're listening to this.

53
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,160
You want to join us on Sunday?

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,160
JB live dot TV, we usually get the stream going around noon, 30, sometimes noon.

55
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,440
There's just kind of be like the standby screen, but, you know, you can get there,

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,240
get yourself set up, get your chair ready, walk your dogs.

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Wes is always good about that.

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
You know, before he does something for a while, he goes and walks the dogs.

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,120
I mean, yeah, you got to that way.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,880
You don't get any annoying interruptions while you're trying to enjoy yourself.

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
There is that there is that there is that advantage, I suppose.

62
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,760
So before we get to the kudo kudu, we'll try not to do that the whole episode, I

63
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,800
wanted to talk about our thoughts on Linode and the acquisition with Akamai, because

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,520
this has probably been the number one thing that's come in via like Telegram

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,040
and Twitter.

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,560
And so I wanted to take a few days and think about it because like, you know,

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,320
it's hard to really say anything at this point because the deal is still so new.

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,240
But I know that all of us and we've watched or even been through good or bad

69
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,880
transitions, so I know some of us are like, oh, it's going to happen.

70
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,560
I've seen that I felt like that vibe, you know, and it's it's totally understandable.

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
But the truth is, you know, we don't know yet.

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
We're going to watch and see.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,160
But we do know that Linode has a pretty good history with transitions.

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
It's tough transitions.

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
I mean, I've watched them deal with a lot of that.

76
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,160
And I think the other thing that gives me some comfort for sure is that Akamai

77
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,880
doesn't have a compute VPS solution.

78
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,880
There's not like duplicate work being done there.

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,920
They're just going to roll Linode into their existing thing.

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
And yeah, yeah, it seems like they're adding Linode as a way to give their

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,120
large customers good, fast compute resources that complements their worldwide

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,640
CDN.

83
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,640
That's probably a best case scenario because you figure like these folks at

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,480
Linode have been hard at this for like 19 years, right?

85
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:03,560
And so where do you go in a world where AWS, Google, Amazon, Amazon,

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,720
and Microsoft are sucking all of the air out of the room, right?

87
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
Like, what do you do here?

88
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,520
And if Linode was, I say, acquired by AWS, for example, that'd be a lot of

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,600
duplication of effort.

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,600
I would be pretty concerned about the future of Linode.

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,280
And, you know, I look out there at the market and there's not anywhere I really

92
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
want to move our systems to.

93
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,920
We have over a dozen boxes in production on Linode.

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,240
And I don't really want to move anywhere else.

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,840
Linode has like the sweet spot there.

96
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
And this isn't part of the ad.

97
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
This is just how I feel about it.

98
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,560
And I'm looking at it from like, not as like, oh, JB's kind of concerned about

99
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,600
future sponsor revenue and how we're going to be sustainable as a business.

100
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,560
Like putting that aside, I'm looking at it from a customer who uses this for my

101
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,320
business and I'm really glad they didn't get bought by something like a Microsoft.

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
Yeah, really?

103
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Geez.

104
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
It'd just be, you know, it just sort of, the product would fade away.

105
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,920
Guess we're using Azure now.

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Yeah.

107
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Yeah.

108
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:06,360
You know, you think about it too, I hope this works out for the best simply because

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,920
I don't really see like another Linode starting at this point.

110
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
They started at a special time.

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,880
And now with AWS and the other big cloud providers, it doesn't seem like anybody's

112
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
going to...

113
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
How are you going to catch up?

114
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Yeah.

115
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,760
Which VCs are you going to trick into, you know, funding you to compete against these

116
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,720
monsters at this point?

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,800
So I feel like as far as like, you know, you can go get a Linux box that you can SSH into

118
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,560
and it's a full OS that you have access to.

119
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
Do whatever you want on?

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
That's a bit of a dying breed.

121
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,240
And so there's a lot at stake here, but I can't see like quitting Linode in protest

122
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,800
over this because A, the product's still the same product, right?

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
The product hasn't changed.

124
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Right.

125
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Yeah.

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
If that doesn't change then...

127
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,600
And if a bunch of us took our business away in protest, that would only kind of accelerate

128
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,820
a future we don't want to have happen.

129
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,060
So like, I'm not going to quit over...I'm not going to stop being a customer over this

130
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,240
and I'm not going to stop having them sponsor our shows over this because it hasn't changed

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
the last 19 years.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
It's a new era.

133
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,640
It means it's a new era and we don't really know where things are going to go.

134
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,760
And it's these waves in the industry that the show has rid since the very beginning.

135
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,880
I mean, the whole network has sort of observed these trends and rode these waves.

136
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,680
I feel like all these changes are happening in the backdrop of the podcast advertising

137
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:33,040
market getting rougher because the reality is Spotify and YouTube are sucking a lot of

138
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
the oxygen out of the room.

139
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,080
They're just so dominant now.

140
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,320
There's another key piece to it too.

141
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,840
It's not just their network effect.

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,840
They give the advertiser a single point to sell.

143
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,740
They go to a dashboard, they pick the demographic, they pick all of the options about runtime.

144
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,440
There's no email chains and back and forth with individual creators.

145
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
No negotiating.

146
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,760
It's all just automated.

147
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,680
That's why Facebook ads do so well too.

148
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,400
It's like taking the Facebook ad model and applying it to podcasts, including the monitoring.

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,680
So Linode is like super pivotal in helping keep podcasting decentralized and independent.

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,160
I also feel like ultimately podcasting can't hitch its wagon to whatever is the big wave

151
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,560
in the industry right now because these waves fade over time and they transition.

152
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
That's what happens, right?

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
That's this industry.

154
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,520
That's the novel we want to have happen to the shows.

155
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,360
So I'll tell you, this is a little bit of confession time.

156
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,080
I don't think I've ever said this on air, but this whole sponsor race, always trying

157
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,480
to get the next sale, the stress of that is ultimately the number one factor that led

158
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:47,140
me to sell JB back in 2018 because a sponsor relationship can take anywhere from two months

159
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,280
if you're extremely lucky, that's probably the shortest deal I've ever experienced, to

160
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,660
about a year.

161
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,920
If anybody's ever worked with sales or worked with a salesperson, you know what I'm talking

162
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,440
about.

163
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,120
It takes a ton of investment in time.

164
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,200
It takes reaching out every single day.

165
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,760
It takes being willing to be told no 20 times for every yes.

166
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,200
It means sometimes you're constantly worried about how you're going to balance all of this.

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,740
Then of course there's the meta pressure of making sure that you serve the audience first,

168
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,920
the content isn't impacted, like there's so much stress behind it that it was ultimately

169
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,120
the number one factor in why I sold because it was impacting my health.

170
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,360
That's why when we talk about things like the value for value payment systems or the

171
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,720
Jupiter.party membership, I can't see, and maybe I hope I'm wrong, but I can't see a

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,600
future 10 years down the road when I turn 50 where I'm still doing this unless it's

173
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
audience funded.

174
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,560
I just can't really see that sustainably working out because I'll probably die before then

175
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,560
to be honest with you that the, what has become really kind of clear to me in the second year

176
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,160
is a lot of the pressure and stresses that led me to sell.

177
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,360
I can feel them building again.

178
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,840
I'm already experiencing health side effects that I don't really feel like talking about

179
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,880
on air and it's a very dynamic marketplace.

180
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,720
The tech industry, specifically the very technical aspect of it is extremely fluid.

181
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,160
I would not have been able to do this if Linode wasn't such a great business partner to work

182
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
with.

183
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,540
They made it okay to do sponsorships again for me.

184
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,900
They were the first to answer my email.

185
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:35,480
When I jumped on a video call with them, they had JB Swag on the desk and it has been a

186
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,080
great relationship since day one.

187
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,400
Since I knew I was going independent, but I couldn't say anything public.

188
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Since that moment forward, they were just right there supporting us and so I'm not going

189
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,120
anywhere with them and as far as I'm concerned, these guys have earned a payout after 19 years

190
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,180
of hard work, guys and gals of course, but we don't know what the future will hold.

191
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,360
They don't know what the future will hold.

192
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,380
Wes and I have been through acquisitions and we know how it goes.

193
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,880
The staff aren't aware and things are fluid, they're dynamic, but nobody's going to also

194
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,000
throw away a valuable business.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,800
They didn't spend nearly a billion dollars on Linode to just throw out what it does.

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,760
That's not how you make good on an investment.

197
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,200
So I am of the opinion that when it comes to working with potential possible sponsors,

198
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,120
we couldn't have found better alignment with Linode because we do use them, right?

199
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,600
Yeah, absolutely.

200
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,120
And they're clearly providing a valuable service for our audience and that $100 credit is legit.

201
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,280
That's like real monies that you can use on their platform for a while, right?

202
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,240
And I don't like AWS, I don't like Azure.

203
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,700
It's way too expensive, it's way too complicated.

204
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,580
The dashboards are like their own proprietary land now and I don't want to have to interface

205
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
with any of that.

206
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,160
I want a Linux box.

207
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,960
Maybe I'll orchestrate it, centrally manage it, maybe I'll use containers, maybe I'll

208
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,560
just use it as a traditional Linux box and I'll gasp, maybe I'll install something from

209
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
the repo.

210
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,920
I want that kind of flexibility and there's only a few businesses now that offer that

211
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,200
and so I still think Linode is the best of them, regardless of this, but we'll see.

212
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
And that's just it, right?

213
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Like we won't.

214
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
We won't know.

215
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
It's a long kind of time frame.

216
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,160
We have friends there and so far none of them are panicking, so that's usually a pretty

217
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,040
good sign.

218
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,240
But yeah, it's a stressful thing and managing sales while you're also running four or five

219
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,720
shows and running a business and I'm not trying to complain here, I love what I do.

220
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,480
I don't mean to come across like I'm complaining, I'm just saying.

221
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,240
It's frustrating to you when you're focused, when you're having to spend so much time focusing

222
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,000
on the sponsorship, not that you don't value those relationships, but it's a secondary

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,520
thing to making really good shows.

224
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,360
And I just don't know if I'd ever have a relationship like I've had with Linode again.

225
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,080
Maybe it's possible, you know?

226
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
So I hope it just continues.

227
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,560
I hope they want to keep working with us forever.

228
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
We'll see.

229
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,640
We just don't know at this point, but they're still, you know, they've still got ads on

230
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,780
here and we're still happy to run them for as long as they want to.

231
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,320
So that's sort of it.

232
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
And you know what?

233
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,080
I've chatted with them briefly about this because really, what can they say, right?

234
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,800
But we've chatted and you know, business continues as usual for now.

235
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,280
That's the word.

236
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,520
And I hope that maybe even this inspires somebody else to invest in this area.

237
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
We'll see.

238
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
We'll see.

239
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,600
And you know, Akamai kind of makes a lot of sense.

240
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,680
I couldn't really, if you're going to ask me who else really could make this acquisition,

241
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,480
I can think of a lot of bad names.

242
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,520
They've been around much like Linode for a long time as sort of an independent actor

243
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
in the space.

244
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,880
So all respect to the folks that work at Cloudflare, but I'm kind of glad it wasn't Cloudflare.

245
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,200
In conclusion, if you find value out of these shows, I would love your support Jupiter.party

246
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,680
so you can support all of the shows or you could become a core contributor at unpluggedcore.com

247
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,240
and support just this show directly.

248
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Because you know, when I get to a certain age, there may be a point and I'm not saying

249
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,240
this jokingly, but there may be a point where maybe the only shows I still do are the shows

250
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,660
that have enough member support because you know, at some point my health will have to

251
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,400
come first and this isn't an ultimatum.

252
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,880
I don't mean to make it sound weird like this, it's just, this is what's been on my mind

253
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
in the news.

254
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
This is what I've been processing.

255
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,480
And I want to be transparent with everybody because if there's ever a shift that happens,

256
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,240
I want everyone to know what my thought process is and I don't want to surprise anybody.

257
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,800
A lot of you have been listening for a really long time, following this journey, and I

258
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,480
just want to be straight with you.

259
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,680
Right now everything's fine, but you know, there could be a day where I decide we need

260
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,560
to scale back a little bit for health reasons and it's going to be the shows that have member

261
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,380
support that stay on the air.

262
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,840
I would love one day to just do these shows until the day I die and have it be member

263
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,580
supported because I have been doing this for 15 years.

264
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:52,040
About 13 of those years, maybe 12 of those years have been primarily sponsor funded and

265
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,820
I figure I can do that.

266
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,720
I'm a pretty good salesman, I feel, and I have a pretty good success rate once I actually

267
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,620
get into a conversation with somebody.

268
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,580
So I feel like I could keep doing it for a while, but you know, the tricky thing is when

269
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm selling ads for Linux Unplugged, I'm typically not selling an ad for self-hosted or Koda

270
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,760
Radio.

271
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,740
Every now and then you can bundle them, every now and then a sponsor is interested in that,

272
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:24,120
but most of the time energy spent on one show is energy not spent on another show and you

273
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,540
could see how when you have four or five things you're buying, you're selling ads against,

274
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:34,060
how that really multiplies in time and stress and anxiety, especially when it's just one

275
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,520
person doing it.

276
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,100
So my thoughts on this really are if you're in a position where you can support us through

277
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,700
a membership program or you want to participate in the value for value system with one of

278
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:49,600
the new podcast apps at newpodcastapps.com, please do because long-term that's probably

279
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,940
what's going to make it all viable and long-term I'd rather the network spend its energy on

280
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,460
super serving the show content to super serve the audience and taking the energy that we

281
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,100
have and putting it 100% into the content.

282
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,640
The only way to do that is with membership programs.

283
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,700
Now that all said, we've made it work for a while, I think we can keep making it work

284
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,060
for a while, but I just wanted to be straight with everybody where we're at on that.

285
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,300
And we will get to some of the boost messages that have been sent in using the new podcast

286
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
apps.

287
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,780
This is my new favorite thing, but we'll talk about in the feedback because now it is time

288
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
to talk about this laptop.

289
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,020
Yeah, we got some work to do.

290
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,020
So we have the new CUDA.

291
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,340
I think this is like the sixth generation from system 76.

292
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,900
This thing is a multitasking Linux boost.

293
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,960
It has an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX CPU.

294
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,660
It turbos up to 4.6 gigahertz.

295
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,420
Take that in for a second.

296
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,660
It turbos up to 4.6 gigahertz, eight cores, 16 threads.

297
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,840
That also is packed with an Nvidia RTX 3060 GPU.

298
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:06,620
It has an integrated GPU as well, which is an RX Vega 8 class GPU, which is still actually

299
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,940
surprisingly great.

300
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,580
Right, that's no slouch.

301
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,300
You could really just get by on the integrated graphics for most jobs until you need to do

302
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,940
something that really pushes that GPU.

303
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:21,180
It has a 1920 by 1080 FHD matte display.

304
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:28,700
So it's a 1080p display, however, it's very vibrant and it runs at 144 hertz.

305
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,100
It does seem pretty darn smooth.

306
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,540
Yeah, it really adds to that.

307
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,540
That is the thing about it.

308
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,700
It's got two M.2 SSD slots in it, so you could put two disks.

309
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,780
Everything's configured with 500 gigs, a single M.2 with 500 gigs.

310
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,100
It's got kind of a weird smattering of connectivity.

311
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,860
I thought this was really odd.

312
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,040
I just don't get the USB ports on this.

313
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,100
So it has one USB-C Gen 2, but it doesn't support power delivery over that.

314
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Doesn't support Thunderbolt because, again, this is an AMD system, most of them don't.

315
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,540
I like none of them really.

316
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,900
But it does support DisplayPort out that.

317
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,940
So you got a USB-C port that can do DisplayPort.

318
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,460
You've also got HDMI out, and you've got a mini DisplayPort, and you've got the internal

319
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
screen.

320
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Wow.

321
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,940
So you could pretty easily run four screens off this sucker.

322
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:25,100
But continuing on with the USB, it's got one Gen 2 Type-A, one Gen 1 Type-A, and one 2.0

323
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,540
Type-A. So it's got three different types of Type-A USB ports.

324
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
Oh, okay.

325
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,460
Maybe that's good if you've got some sort of very fiddly USB device.

326
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,460
I guess.

327
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,340
And, like, wouldn't it just be nice if they were all just one generation and it was the

328
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,260
latest generation?

329
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,500
That feels like something most users might not understand.

330
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
And you put in a disk...

331
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
That could be very confusing, yeah.

332
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
But what are you going to do?

334
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,060
I don't think they necessarily have control over the board layout and that kind of stuff.

335
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,520
It has a whopper of a power supply with a barrel connector.

336
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,380
It's a 230-watt power supply because, I mean, again, this thing is taking some serious power

337
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:05,060
when it needs it, rocking a 5.5-millimeter barrel connector on that thing.

338
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,560
It's got a 48-watt-hour battery, about 49-watt-hours, really, four-cell lithium-ion battery.

339
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,380
So this is not a lot of battery life, especially when you turn on the RTX.

340
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,500
It actually did better than I expected.

341
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
I got, like, a solid three hours.

342
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Okay.

343
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
I did not expect that.

344
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
That's, I mean, that's...

345
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Yeah.

346
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,660
That's long enough to hang out in a coffee shop for a while or something.

347
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,740
And definitely long enough to, like, get something done if you forgot your power adapter.

348
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,380
You know, that too.

349
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,540
But not long enough to go all day, you know, nowhere near, like, the MacBook Pro level.

350
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,620
But I did benchmark this against a MacBook Pro.

351
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,380
Now, granted, not a lot of the machine learning stuff is actually available on the Mac.

352
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,660
And from what I can kind of tell, it doesn't seem like what is available is necessarily

353
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,660
M1-optimized.

354
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,240
So keep that in mind.

355
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,060
But I did do a little Pharaonic's benchmark comparison against this KUDO and a MacBook

356
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Pro Max.

357
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Oh.

358
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
Okay.

359
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,900
Totally loaded out MacBook Pro Max.

360
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,300
And fresh boot on both.

361
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Still running Pop!

362
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
OS on this guy.

363
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
Latest version, I assume, of Mac OS on the Mac.

364
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
I don't know if I...

365
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
But I'm pretty sure it's the latest.

366
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
You're not updating it?

367
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't see it.

368
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,380
I have to say, the KUDO kicked the butt of the MacBook Pro in just about every category

369
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,580
where the MacBook Pro could run a viable comparison.

370
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,620
With just a few exceptions.

371
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,380
There were actually a couple of exceptions where the MacBook Pro pulled ahead.

372
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Okay.

373
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,060
I bet those are probably M1-optimized benchmarks.

374
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,680
I didn't dig further than that.

375
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,300
But for the most part, almost universally, the KUDO just kicked butt, especially in the

376
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,700
RTX version, accelerated versions of the benchmarks, because I compared it with the AMD GPU and

377
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
with the video.

378
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Oh, the built-in compared to...

379
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Yeah.

380
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,620
And when you turn on the RTX graphics, it just takes things up to a level that the MacBook

381
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,740
can't touch.

382
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,460
So there is definitely more performance to be had there.

383
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,140
At least in these Ferronix benchmarks.

384
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,180
If you're doing something that really takes advantage of a GPU.

385
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,180
Yeah.

386
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,140
And he's downloading real tools like TensorFlow and running them against the system.

387
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,500
So they're legit tools.

388
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,700
They're not just like synthetic benchmarks.

389
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,060
The trade-off obviously is the KUDO is making more noise.

390
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Yeah.

391
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
I've got it going here right in front of me.

392
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,060
You may be able to hear.

393
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,060
Maybe.

394
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,060
Is that where we're...

395
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,060
Are we hearing that right now?

396
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
I think so.

397
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
Oh, you're right.

398
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
What are you doing?

399
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
That's making it go.

400
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,460
I thought I heard that breaking through your gate.

401
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
I just...

402
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,460
I had opened Steam a while ago.

403
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
Maybe that.

404
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,460
You're downloading, right?

405
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, probably.

406
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Yeah.

407
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,460
While we're streaming was...

408
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Geez.

409
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,020
Well, I had to put the thing to the test.

410
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,580
So it definitely has a fan noise that the MacBook does not.

411
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,580
You can hear...

412
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,580
You can kind of hear it right now.

413
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:41,620
Here, why don't you point your microphone down at it or pick it up, yeah.

414
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,380
And now you've picked it up and pointed at the mic.

415
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,620
So of course that's...

416
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,900
But it can kick up.

417
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,020
It's I think they've managed the fan curve here.

418
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,940
I don't actually know this for sure, but it seems to me it goes quite a while before it

419
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
kicks in.

420
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,300
And then once it kicks in, it stays spun up for a bit and then very slowly ramps back

421
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,300
down.

422
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
I suppose that's the safe way to do it.

423
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,100
You know, when you're putting that kind of horsepower in there, I don't know how you're

424
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
going to get away from it.

425
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,180
And it's blowing out both sides as well.

426
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,980
That's already tripping down a little bit though.

427
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Okay.

428
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,980
That's not bad.

429
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,980
Yeah.

430
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,980
It is coming down now.

431
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
You can tell.

432
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,700
And I don't know how you're going to have an RTX graphics card in there and not have fans.

433
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,700
I don't think that...

434
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,900
And it's 230 watts of power this thing's taking.

435
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,780
That's another reason why it's not doing USB-C power delivery, right?

436
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,060
Now you do have some options, right?

437
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,580
With POP for switching between what graphics card you're actually using.

438
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
Yeah.

439
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,580
Take a look at that.

440
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,120
So if you go in the system menu there in GNOME and you go to the power, like where the battery

441
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
is at.

442
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Oh yeah.

443
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
It powers it.

444
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
Okay.

445
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Yeah.

446
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
You've got integrated graphics, hybrid graphics.

447
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
You can do the discrete Nvidia graphics only.

448
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
And then they have compute mode.

449
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Do you see that?

450
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Compute graphics.

451
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Disables external displays.

452
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Right.

453
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,900
So it's supposedly just even more performance for the internal GPU.

454
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
So if you've got some sort of job you're going to do.

455
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Well, you don't, yeah.

456
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,180
You're not actually using any of the ports.

457
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Right.

458
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Wow.

459
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,180
Right.

460
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,060
I like that they give you that option because by default I'm going to want those ports.

461
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,940
And this thing really, if you're buying this, you're somebody who's running four or five

462
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,140
pretty performance intensive apps simultaneously.

463
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,800
Because you could load this thing with multiple M.2s.

464
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,660
This thing can take up to 64 gigabytes of RAM.

465
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,580
I mean, you know, like you could really push this thing and it really doesn't flinch at

466
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
all.

467
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,220
It's got so much bandwidth it's working with.

468
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,220
It reminds me of a high performance car that is maybe, you know, kind of has like a tight

469
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
suspension.

470
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,060
So it's a little bit of a bumpy ride sometimes, but this thing corners like a bastard and

471
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,320
goes like zero to 60 in like three or four seconds.

472
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,480
And it even kind of has a bit of a car look to it.

473
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,560
If you look at it, the hood is a brushed metal look.

474
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,940
It's got a discrete set of LED lights that kind of almost look like a scoop in a hood,

475
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,060
but they're done in a tasteful way.

476
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,060
I'd say it's less distracting than a glowing Apple logo.

477
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,060
And then the keyboard area has kind of a brushed metal look.

478
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,020
It's a plastic that's pretty comfortable to put your arms on, but it has kind of like

479
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,300
an almost an automotive look to it.

480
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,480
It kind of reminds me of a car like that.

481
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,340
It kind of has an aesthetic to it like that.

482
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,220
And something about the back vents remind me of like the hood of a car.

483
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,540
Yeah, well, it's kind of got the same style of design, a few elegant lines and curves.

484
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,780
Now you'll notice if you hold that under your microphone right now, pick it up, do you hear

485
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
that buzz?

486
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
I do, yeah.

487
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,340
That's one downside that as a podcaster, yeah, I don't know.

488
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,820
That's just some machines do that.

489
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,300
Even some wireless keyboards do that, where if you put them under a microphone, you get

490
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
a buzz like that.

491
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,660
That's just something we have to deal with.

492
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,340
This one does create that issue.

493
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,940
The audio in and out are good and clean.

494
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,520
They sound just fine, but it does seem to buzz when it's near a microphone.

495
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,980
So that's one thing that I noticed.

496
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,200
I was sitting there using it underneath my mic the other day and it was buzzing like

497
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
that.

498
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
You know.

499
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
But that doesn't...

500
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Fairly niche use case right there.

501
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Yeah, it's fairly niche.

502
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,300
That's one of our problems, but...

503
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,460
I can't podcast and play Steam games at the same time.

504
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,140
So I did throw a bunch of Steam games at this and I think it goes without saying, it just

505
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
crushes everything.

506
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,460
I literally played every single game, including Cyberpunk 2044 or whatever it is, 20 whatever.

507
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,100
I played that at ultra graphic settings, everything at max freaking graphics.

508
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I'm like, you know what?

509
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,340
The deck's coming.

510
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,820
Let's see what the state of Linux gaming is.

511
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,980
And basically if it works on Linux at this point, it worked on the Kudu and at max settings.

512
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,380
And I have not got to experience that treat in a couple of years.

513
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,560
And if you were looking for gaming, I mean, yeah, 4k might be nice, but Linux does so

514
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
good at 1080p.

515
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,060
We've really got that nailed down.

516
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
It does, dude.

517
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:39,380
And graphics with that RTX at 1080p, you can run everything at max and just love it.

518
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,380
Just super smooth.

519
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,380
All right.

520
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,940
I got a question for you guys.

521
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,060
How's the keyboard on this thing?

522
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,200
Great question.

523
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Great question.

524
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
What do you think Wes?

525
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,060
I put it somewhere in the middle personally.

526
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,860
Yeah, it's definitely not the worst laptop keyboard I've used by a mile.

527
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,260
You know, it's backlit.

528
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,260
I appreciate that.

529
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,460
That is legitimately handy.

530
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,100
It's got, I'd say, yeah, maybe middle, these pretty decent key travel.

531
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,940
It's a little, it's kind of got a light feeling.

532
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,140
And then the position of the track pad relative to the keyboard is throwing me off at the

533
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,140
moment.

534
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,900
That's the first, literally the first comment I get from anyone I've shown it to.

535
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,980
Is that the track pads off center, the track pad is actually centered with the QWERTY part

536
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,220
of the keyboard, but this laptop has a 10 key.

537
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,620
And so it's not centered with the entirety of the laptop keyboard, but it is centered

538
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,060
with the QWERTY part of the keyboard.

539
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,700
Do you get what I'm saying?

540
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,100
It's like, I get it because when you're typing, where is your thumb?

541
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,020
Your thumb is where the track pad is at.

542
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
But it looks weird.

543
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,680
It's not, it's just not symmetrical.

544
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,900
The solution honestly is just a giant track pad.

545
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,020
That is really, it should just be a huge ass track pad and then problem solved.

546
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,500
I think I would worry, now I haven't really tested this, I suppose it's doing a pretty

547
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,980
good job here, but I think I would worry that while I was typing, I'd be constantly bumping

548
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,980
the track pad and making my mouse jump around.

549
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,780
If I'm thinking like I'm on like a train to work or a bus with tight quarters kind of

550
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
thing.

551
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
I could see that.

552
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,860
Okay guys, that being said, how is the track pad?

553
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,700
I know that's been an issue in Linux for a little while.

554
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,500
I think we're getting better at that, but how's this one performing for you?

555
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,660
You know, the fact that I didn't even notice a single problem is probably all of the commentary

556
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,740
you probably need from it.

557
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,980
I actually, huh, I had very little, I had no complaints about the track pad at all.

558
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,980
It just worked.

559
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,300
I'd love it to be bigger, but the buttons are a little loud.

560
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
Yeah.

561
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Yeah.

562
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,580
And I'd love to have buttons at the top of the track pad.

563
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,380
I'd love to have buttons at the top, but the surface itself, it feels quite nice.

564
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,780
It's smooth.

565
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,860
By default here, the integration with pop, I think the cursor speed and the track pad,

566
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,020
like the combo of total speed to get across the screen, but still having fine control

567
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,100
is pretty dialed in.

568
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:51,620
Yeah, this is probably nicer than any desktop computer I have by a pretty good percentage

569
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,780
and it's in a laptop form factor.

570
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:59,380
And for somebody who lives in a small space, I'm never probably ever going to buy a desktop

571
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,500
for home.

572
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Just never going to do that.

573
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,780
Where would you put it?

574
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,780
Right.

575
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,080
But I absolutely loved being able to play my games again.

576
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,780
You know, like just having access to all those games, it honestly made me super stoked for

577
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
the deck.

578
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,680
Just having access to my games and making them look good again and stuff like, whew,

579
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,140
this is a really nice machine.

580
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,660
And if it wasn't for the buzzing under the mic, I'd probably be really tempted to have

581
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,460
one for the RV, I have to be honest, because the multiple display support is pretty great.

582
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,940
Really does have quite a few ports, even if it's a somewhat odd set.

583
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,520
And it's got Wi-Fi 6, which is nice because I can't really run ethernet in the RV.

584
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,220
So having good Wi-Fi is huge for me.

585
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,120
And the other thing I have to note because I think this stuff really kind of matters

586
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,900
is it's really, at least in my personal Chris score, it's getting high marks for repairability

587
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,580
and upgradability.

588
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,220
This is something I want to look at more is like, what are the DIY options for these machines?

589
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,580
And I have to say, they nail this.

590
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:07,740
They have a technical document, which I'll link in the show notes, that gives you a brilliant

591
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,340
under the hood look at this thing.

592
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,040
And they have specifically labeled and identified every major component you might want to replace

593
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,460
or upgrade.

594
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,020
The RAM is immediately accessible.

595
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:23,500
The two M.2 slots are instantly accessible, but they kind of went above and beyond that

596
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
too.

597
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,820
They even labeled like the fan connectors, the LCD connectors, how the keyboard is wired

598
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,420
to where the keyboard connector is wired to the main board, where the Wi-Fi card's at,

599
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,940
the speaker connectors, the CMOS battery.

600
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,240
They've gone through and labeled everything in highlights and then have a map that shows

601
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,860
you what that stuff is that you can repair.

602
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,500
This is really nice.

603
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Yeah.

604
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,660
I think every menu, this is a standard that every manufacturer should be held to.

605
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,720
Yeah, definitely.

606
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,380
You could sit here and say, yeah, okay, it's kind of big.

607
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:56,420
It's a big laptop, although compared to my Bonobos and Aurexes, this is not big.

608
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,860
You're talking to a guy who's had multiple Bonobo workstation laptops that were probably

609
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,460
twice the thickness of this thing, at least, maybe even more.

610
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,920
And it's really not that heavy even for, if it's a little thicker here, but it's, yeah.

611
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,140
They say it's four pounds, like 4.8 or something.

612
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,360
I don't know about that.

613
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,460
If it is, it's very well distributed.

614
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,940
It does not feel heavy.

615
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,900
And the fact that you can pop that bottom off and get access to replace the fans to,

616
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,980
I don't know, maybe in eight years, maybe 10 years down the road, you want to put a

617
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,620
little more heat transfer treatment on your CPU, you're going to be able to figure out

618
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,620
how to do that.

619
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,580
And they make all that information documented.

620
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,580
And I don't know, I feel like everybody should have to do that.

621
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,620
And if it means that it's a little bit thicker to have a removable bottom, that seems like

622
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,460
a pretty good trade-off because if I'm buying this kind of machine, I'm not looking for

623
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,100
like the half pounder that I throw on my laptop for my, you know.

624
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
That's a different system.

625
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
Yeah.

626
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,820
This isn't my coffee shop machine.

627
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,240
This is my multitasking, heavy workload machine.

628
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,780
That's why I bought Bonobos.

629
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,320
In the past, I bought them because I would go to my clients and I would run five or six

630
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
virtual machines.

631
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,620
I would like do test migrations in VMs on my laptop and then give them the results.

632
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,140
And I would just, you know, I had data machine with a lot of horsepower to do that.

633
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,660
So I was fine that it only had a, you know, two hour battery because I just needed to

634
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,140
set it up at a desk and plug it in.

635
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,140
Right.

636
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,140
You would have it out there.

637
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,500
So, you know, a lot of us still have those kinds of workloads and I think it nails that

638
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
so well.

639
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
I'm so impressed.

640
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,860
Like I'm really sad that I have to send it back.

641
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,780
It's just a review unit because it's been really fun to have a machine that games as

642
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,900
good as my son's laptop.

643
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,080
And it's a nice compromise.

644
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,660
It does get loud, but for the horsepower, I mean, it's pretty understandable.

645
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,660
Okay.

646
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,500
One last question for you, and it's a bit of a long form one.

647
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,140
We were lucky enough to get a really wonderful tour of system 76 over the summer.

648
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,660
And ever since that I've had a hesitation with system 76 as laptops.

649
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:03,300
And I wonder if you guys share this sentiment because of the quality and the care and attention

650
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,100
that we saw them putting into, you know, the launch keyboard and everything they manufacture

651
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:15,700
in house, I've had this hesitation about buying a system 76 laptop because they're not quite

652
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,940
making those in house yet.

653
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,600
I think maybe I feel like they might be headed that way, but how do you each kind of bridge

654
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,080
the gap between what we saw over the summer and the amazing quality and thoughtful engineering

655
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,860
that went into everything they make in house versus these laptops?

656
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,340
I think you're definitely right to point out that it's not quite the same because yeah,

657
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,380
they're creating these things from whole cloth for the most part, which is very impressive.

658
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,140
But I think the nature of what you're talking about, that same intention, those same skill

659
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,700
sets, they're applied to the base that they work with for their laptops.

660
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,420
I think that's, you know, that's like the fan curves, some of the nice integrations

661
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,580
with BopOS itself, a lot of these firmware efforts that have been going on, those are

662
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,300
things that just not that many other folks are doing.

663
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,460
So yeah, you do need to look at the hardware and look at the aesthetics of the hardware,

664
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,340
look at, you know, those things they can't change right now, but they add some nice stuff

665
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,340
on top.

666
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:15,180
There's still like the net benefit of them doing something for so long, like they bring

667
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,500
all that experience to every machine they make.

668
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:26,580
Like I spent my own money, full price, on a pretty loaded out ThinkPad X1, and I haven't

669
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,340
been super thrilled with it.

670
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,340
And you notice we haven't seen any updates.

671
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,780
There's been a few releases of Fedora, there's been a few Intel chip setup dates that have

672
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,820
come out, and there's been nothing from Lenovo on a new Fedora ThinkPad.

673
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,060
I don't know what that's about, but I wonder if maybe it wasn't a huge success or maybe

674
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:49,340
that's just not something they're super focused on, but that experience that System76 brings

675
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,020
to the product is noticeable.

676
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,620
I definitely have noticed over the years their ideas working their way into these machines

677
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,900
that they don't necessarily manufacture themselves, I would prefer them to build it in-house.

678
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,220
And when they get there, I'm probably going to be one of the first people in line to pick

679
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,940
one of those machines up.

680
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:14,460
But Linux users have always had a limited set of truly Linux-first native hardware to

681
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,260
pick from, and System76 has always kind of been there offering something.

682
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,620
Yeah, and you just don't have to worry about that, right?

683
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,740
I mean, you can install, you know, it's going to support whatever Linux workload you really

684
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,300
want to throw at it.

685
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Yeah.

686
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,100
And in the moment, Maroum, you've got some thoughts on this?

687
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,540
Yeah, I purchased a System76 laptop about a year ago now, the Lemur Pro when it first

688
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
came out.

689
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:39,580
And I agree that it's clearly not a device that they made themselves.

690
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,020
But at the same time, when you're checking out, it has that one-year warranty that comes

691
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
with it.

692
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:50,020
And the quality that they put into their post-sale care is just as good as the quality that they

693
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,160
put into the devices they make themselves.

694
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,860
They take great care of you when things go wrong, and they do it in a way that is much

695
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,180
more upfront and, like, honest than a lot of companies that have had to do laptop warranty

696
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
repairs with.

697
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Right.

698
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,500
At the end of the day, you know, even if maybe you like some aspects of a, say, Dell machine

699
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,980
a little more, who do you want to be on the phone with?

700
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,580
Yeah, we know the support team, and we definitely have seen them working.

701
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,260
You know, obviously, we're friends with them.

702
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,180
They have sponsored Coder.

703
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,580
They don't sponsor this show.

704
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,020
I don't know if they've ever sponsored Linux Unplugged.

705
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,380
But we're friends with them because they've made something good, and so we were drawn

706
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,380
to them.

707
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,420
I mean, it's a bunch of nerds making some needs, yeah, right?

708
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:36,820
And we just, you know, being fancy podcasters, I guess, get to be lucky enough to get to

709
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,740
meet these people sometimes.

710
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,420
It's going to be interesting to watch them when they do get the opportunity to build

711
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,540
their own laptops.

712
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,220
I would imagine that's got to be the hardest thing they're ever going to try to do.

713
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,860
They were smart to start with the keyboard.

714
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,860
You get that, right?

715
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,860
That does a lot.

716
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,900
Well, and they have a high—they clearly have a high bar for what they make, so.

717
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,900
You can't put it into words.

718
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,460
It's not like they're—they're not making the job of implementing this for themselves

719
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,060
any easier just in that regard.

720
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,660
I think it'd be so great if they could bring customers through their factory on the regular

721
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,620
because people—there's people who have seen System76 Factory and there's people who haven't.

722
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:13,380
And it's a ridiculous obsessive amount of attention to detail they put into this stuff.

723
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,780
And it really only—you can only really wrap your head around how much goes into a business

724
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,300
like this unless you go there.

725
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,420
Humans are so bad at this.

726
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
We do this.

727
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,300
I'm sure people do this about JB.

728
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,900
You think you understand how a business can work, so you think you can conceptualize it,

729
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,620
and then you get in that industry and you realize it is infinitely more complex.

730
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
It is an entire world.

731
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,420
A thousand more things that you had no idea about and debates and trade-offs.

732
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,980
Totally, totally.

733
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,220
So that is them to a T right there is I realize when I toured that factory, which I've done

734
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,180
a few times now, every time I'm like, holy shit, I had no idea they were even worrying

735
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,500
about this or thinking about this or solving this.

736
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,820
Or a whole problem that requires a machine or a custom setup to handle, even if it's

737
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,020
a small little thing at the end.

738
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,140
Leno dot com slash unplugged.

739
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,980
Go there to support this here show and get yourself $100 in stick credit on a new account,

740
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,980
and you go there to support the show.

741
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,460
Oh, I almost got a little prospector in there.

742
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,980
He's in the back.

743
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,180
Brent mentioned him in the pre-show, so now the prospector is—

744
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,180
I'm ready for him.

745
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,180
Coming down from the hills.

746
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,180
Yeah.

747
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,540
He was just there for a moment, but then I said something and he snuck away anyways.

748
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,980
But real, you know, actual Chris will tell you, it's just the best place to host something

749
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,900
like I've looked at the options and Linode's got the perfect mix.

750
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,780
They have a bonkers, crazy fast bandwidth.

751
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,180
They have 11 data centers you can choose from.

752
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,640
Their pricing is, you know, 30 to 50 percent less than the hyperscalers that want to lock

753
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,500
you into their complex platforms that just want to just essentially create their own

754
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
version of the Internet.

755
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,260
You don't have to deal with any of that with Linode, none of that stuff.

756
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,020
And they've invested in their infrastructure year after year after year.

757
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,020
They've been really clever.

758
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:57,060
Like they just did a round of AMD epic processor upgrades not too long ago.

759
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,400
And then they just got done doing a round of MVME PCI storage upgrades not too long

760
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,460
ago.

761
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,080
And they're working on a new product that they haven't even announced yet.

762
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,740
And there's always stuff going on in the background.

763
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,740
They're always taking stuff to the next level.

764
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,580
And the thing that's really cool about them that I've really appreciated is they are Linux

765
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,580
geeks.

766
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,020
Like they've looked at the way the industry does stuff and they'll often go, OK, that's

767
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
great.

768
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,740
How do we do that with Linux instead?

769
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,820
Which now is just like you can do everything with Linux.

770
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,500
But that wasn't always the case.

771
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
That wasn't always the case.

772
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,080
And, you know, they spent 19 years figuring this stuff out and building the best platform

773
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
to host your stuff.

774
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,980
Anything that is user facing, man, I just wouldn't have it anywhere else but Linode.

775
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,180
You know, it's like when you're running a business, you don't have to worry about this

776
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
stuff.

777
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,440
You don't want to have to worry about it and you want it to be reliable.

778
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,060
You don't want complaints.

779
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,020
I sleep easy at night having our infrastructure on Linode.

780
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,660
So go get a hundred dollars.

781
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,460
Try it out and support the show.

782
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,980
It's Linode dot com slash unplugged.

783
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
All right.

784
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,380
Well, I already did.

785
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,220
My plug is really unplugged core dot com.

786
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,740
If you want to become a member, you get two options.

787
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:08,340
You get the full live uncut, like when I screw up and hit the wrong button or Wes goes into

788
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,460
one of his cussing rants.

789
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Happens sometimes.

790
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Happens.

791
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,500
You get the pre and post in the show, plus you get the pre and post show, which you think

792
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,540
you you think you get the pre and post show.

793
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Oh, no.

794
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
Oh, no.

795
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,540
There's so much more show.

796
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
You're responsible about it.

797
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,820
Or maybe maybe you don't want to spend like two hours listening to a Linux podcast.

798
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,860
We also make a shorter version.

799
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,780
It's still got all the fine touches from our editor, Joe.

800
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,140
So it sounds great, but it's ad free.

801
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,140
So it's shorter.

802
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
It's a little tighter.

803
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:40,020
And it it's like a special like Joe signature edition.

804
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,780
That's what we should call it.

805
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,780
That's what we should call it.

806
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,780
Because it's great.

807
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,460
You know, it's all the same production, but we just out the ads.

808
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,460
Yeah.

809
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
He cuts all of our crap out.

810
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
Yeah.

811
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,460
It's not crap.

812
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,460
Wait.

813
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,060
I mean, it's we presume our members are so dedicated to the show.

814
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,900
They already have enjoyed our sponsors offer.

815
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,420
And so now they listen to the member fee.

816
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,140
Oh, I meant I meant I meant our ramblings.

817
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Oh, yeah.

818
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,140
You're cussing rants.

819
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
Yeah, for sure.

820
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Definitely get that.

821
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,700
Well, actually, that's my favorite part.

822
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,700
That's my favorite part.

823
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,700
We'll get it.

824
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,260
We'll have to have its own dedicated feed someday.

825
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,260
Definitely.

826
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
We also love your feedback.

827
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,260
We didn't get a lot this week.

828
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
We got a lot of boosts.

829
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,340
We'll cover those.

830
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,740
But Brent went through and he said, Chris, this is the biggest pile of shit I've ever

831
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,740
seen.

832
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,740
That's what he said.

833
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
It takes a lot to rile him up.

834
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,740
He didn't really say that.

835
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,740
I wouldn't.

836
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:28,220
But we'd love to get your feedback at Linux unplugged dot com slash contact thoughts on

837
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:34,180
what we've said, ideas for the show, projects to check it out, put it all in there and join

838
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,220
our matrix community.

839
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,560
It's growing every single day.

840
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,540
We got dedicated feedback rooms for each show.

841
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,500
We've got discussion topic rooms for individual topics.

842
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,300
There's even a Bitcoin room because Brent insisted all of that.

843
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,260
You can get information at Linux unplugged dot com slash Matrix.

844
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,140
And last but not least, the last thing I have to say, this is going on way too long and

845
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,460
I'm just making it worse right now.

846
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,860
So it's like getting really bad now.

847
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,740
The last thing I'll say is Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble.

848
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,740
You know, we got a mumble room.

849
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,860
I don't need to repeat it again.

850
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:06,900
Join it for God's sakes.

851
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,820
You know, I told you both that we didn't get much feedback this week, but actually we got

852
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:16,260
a ton of great feedback this just long form ideas that people have been working on, which

853
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
have been really great.

854
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
OK, good.

855
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
But it takes you know.

856
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
So why were you swearing so much?

857
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,520
It just seemed like completely inappropriate in retrospect.

858
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,500
More that I only have certain, you know, only so much brain capacity for all the great things

859
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,900
that everyone's sharing with us.

860
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,900
And true.

861
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,400
It was early to some of them can only be put into the show at the right time.

862
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,580
So we do have a few and we'll get to the boost in a sec, but Joshua did share some cool things

863
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,900
he's working on with his pie.

864
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,500
Since that was our topic, he says, I like playing with circuits and I have used Arduinos

865
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
a lot.

866
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,980
Recently, I acquired the new pie zero to w and decided to use the GPIO on it instead

867
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,420
of an Arduino.

868
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,740
The workflow was so much nicer.

869
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,780
First I could program in Python instead of C++.

870
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,580
And he says here, I think I could even do rust.

871
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Second, I can connect the pie to Wi-Fi, code remotely and upload to the pie without having

872
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,380
to power it down, connect to my computer and reflash it.

873
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,980
I can also just SSH in and pull up a Python interpreter to experiment live.

874
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,260
I even could imagine a setup where I hook up VSCode to seamlessly code on the pie from

875
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
my computer.

876
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,660
I'm not even sure I'm going to go back to Arduinos, he says.

877
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:29,500
Yeah, that's those are all great ideas.

878
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,560
Now there may be some times, you know, whether you just need something smaller or for power

879
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,140
reasons or for the particulars of connecting to hardware that an Arduino makes more sense.

880
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,680
But yeah, I mean, pies are super capable these days and all the reasons that Joshua points

881
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,620
out here, they're just super friendly and accessible to development because everything

882
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
runs on them.

883
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:53,060
I also feel like that capability that VSCode has to do the debugging on a remote system.

884
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,420
I hear from so many people that write into Coder Radio that love that kind of stuff and

885
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,860
not just specifically that, but we have people that write into Coder Radio that are on Windows

886
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,980
and Mac because that's what they use for their day job, but they have a Raspberry Pi running

887
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,300
that they can execute builds on and stuff or a VM or a VPS.

888
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,300
Like that's so cool.

889
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,060
Casey, you're doing the Rust on there?

890
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,260
I'm doing Rust based robotics on there.

891
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,900
I have a blast working on it.

892
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,740
Yeah, the tools that are available for the pie inside of crates.io, which is the Rust

893
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:31,540
package manager, are like top tier and actually when the 02W first came out, the Rust devs

894
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,820
had support for the 02W before a lot of Python devs.

895
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,560
I was really impressed.

896
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,660
That is very impressive.

897
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,660
Dang.

898
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,420
What I feel like is really amazing about the pie that I'm learning and we'll soon get a

899
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,460
chance to play with is its versatility.

900
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,340
And I know there are like about 12 different pies to choose from, from old ones to new

901
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,340
ones.

902
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
Pick the right one, Brent.

903
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,260
You can't get any of them, but I feel like that's its real advantage.

904
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,740
It's just a platform for people to throw their ideas at and see what comes out the other

905
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,660
side, which feels like a beautiful thing.

906
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,660
Yeah.

907
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,380
Low cost, low risk, but all the possibility.

908
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,380
Yeah.

909
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,780
I want to say thanks to our audience again.

910
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:17,300
It turns out New West has a Pi 4 2 gig that he has offered to ship my way, which is really

911
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,300
great.

912
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,460
So I, you know, despite betraying you both, I think I might have a chance to jump on the

913
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,460
bandwagon.

914
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:25,460
So thank you to New West.

915
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:30,540
I've been wondering how we're going to do this because now that I know you've never

916
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,620
tried a Raspberry Pi, like I want it to be a good experience.

917
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,180
I was going to say we want to be there.

918
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,180
We want you to document it.

919
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,180
Yeah.

920
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,020
We definitely want to document it, but I feel like I wish I could be there to guide you

921
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:45,580
through the experience because I want to set the expectation right and, you know, like

922
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,580
I'll say this.

923
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,420
If you set it up and expected to use it as a desktop, I think your first impressions

924
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:56,780
would be bad, but if you wanted to set it up and use it as a Docker system or a way

925
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,260
to run us a couple of packages, I think your impressions would be good, right?

926
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,260
Like it.

927
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,740
So, uh, you have to make sure you don't necessarily buy into the hype that it's like a desktop

928
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:10,140
replacement because that's been said for years and it's definitely getting there and with

929
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:15,140
faster storage, it's closer to being possible, but it's definitely not quite there yet.

930
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,620
And so you just got to go in with expectations set, right?

931
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:23,320
I think we might need like a Brent's Pi road trip when we could just like drive around

932
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,980
and then we come up with ideas on the road.

933
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,460
I'm imagining a photo essay sort of thing where you're taking pictures of you with a

934
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,860
Pi at various like monuments and parks.

935
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,660
We will like go to different places, get inspiration for what it could do.

936
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,660
Yeah.

937
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,900
It'd be like a $3 million trip, but totally worth it.

938
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:40,900
Yeah.

939
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,180
Low budget.

940
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,340
I think what I will work on actually that we can talk about a little bit more in the

941
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,580
future is I think I'm going to put together a list of hopes and dreams I have for things

942
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,100
I think it might be able to do.

943
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,220
Like for instance, one thing I've always wanted, because as you gentlemen know, I tend to record

944
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:01,280
in this space with my laptop and we've just been talking about how laptops are sometimes

945
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,100
problematic when it comes to microphones.

946
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:09,460
I've always for like the last three or four years wanted a little setup that would just

947
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:14,300
be my little recording machine that's completely silent, no fans, no nothing, no like electronic

948
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,300
noise or anything.

949
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,900
And I'm curious to know if you think that's even possible with this thing.

950
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,540
And I think the answer might be no, but I'm curious what you think.

951
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,540
I think you're going to have to try it.

952
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,540
Yeah.

953
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,540
I mean, you could try it, right?

954
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,700
So a Pi 4 has a pretty good little CPU on it.

955
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:33,260
I think you're probably going to run into disk IO issues.

956
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,660
You're going to want to run your OS probably off a USB disk and probably not off of an

957
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:43,260
SD card, which then means your OS disk is consuming a lot of your USB bandwidth.

958
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,220
So you don't have a lot of bandwidth leftover for recording to the disk.

959
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:48,220
So it'd just be tricky.

960
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,140
It might be doable, you know, but it's just something you'd have to play with.

961
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,420
Reaper is available for the Raspberry Pi.

962
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,420
Yeah, right.

963
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,100
I mean, it's got that handy little web interface even too.

964
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,140
Yeah, that's true.

965
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,940
Wes and I have also talked a lot about this.

966
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,940
We've thought about this too.

967
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,180
I don't know why we haven't actually tried it yet.

968
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:07,740
Well, because, you know, turns out these x86 boxes do a pretty damn good job.

969
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,740
So we just stick with that.

970
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,740
All right.

971
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,340
Well, we did get some boosts.

972
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,700
If you don't know what I'm talking about, that's totally understandable.

973
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,740
This is part of the value for value system that the new podcast apps support.

974
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,500
And so when listeners have the app, one of these apps that supports us, which is really

975
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,940
only a small handful at this point.

976
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,620
We've been using Fountain and Cast-O-Matic, but it's iOS only.

977
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,300
And the neat thing is, is when you're listening, you can use the Lightning Payment Network

978
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,700
to send Satoshi's to the podcast.

979
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,500
So it's a direct way to support the show without like going through a payment process or something

980
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
like that.

981
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,820
And JB actually runs its own node.

982
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:54,940
So the payments literally come to the studio and are held here at JB one, which is pretty

983
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:55,940
neat.

984
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:05,620
So if you're using some cloud server somewhere or, you know, safely in a bank account, so

985
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,620
please send them there.

986
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,620
Actually, you know, when it comes to money, you want to be careful, but it's really not

987
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,620
about the money.

988
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,380
I was saying this on the pre-show, like I've been doing this for a while, and this is my

989
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:20,600
absolute favorite way to get feedback from the audience.

990
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,500
It's just neat to see it originate from the episodes, you know, it's sort of like a like

991
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,460
a, oh, it's you're right there with them as they're listening and experiencing the content.

992
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,140
It feels like I'm hearing from a new set of people too.

993
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,340
And it's just so, I don't know, it's so novel too.

994
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,940
But all right, we got one here from Dale.

995
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,420
And Dale's boost came from last week's episode, Brent's Betrayal.

996
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,680
And he writes, I made this little tool that helps me pay JB while listening.

997
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,540
It's the value for value calculator, and this is really for anybody, but it lets you kind

998
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:59,140
of figure out like, OK, if I want to send these guys two bucks, like how many sats

999
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,140
is that?

1000
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,140
This is handy.

1001
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,140
Yeah.

1002
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,140
OK, yeah.

1003
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,140
You put two bucks in and that.

1004
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,140
Let's see.

1005
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,540
He says, I am no crypto enthusiast, so I just tend to think about these things in dollars,

1006
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,100
which feels more real to me than some block change coinage.

1007
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,500
But he still made this, which is so awesome.

1008
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,300
Like talk about actually, truly trying to support, right?

1009
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,740
Like he kind of gets where this kind of maybe has to go.

1010
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:27,340
And also, I wonder if we push this, and I know nobody else in our sphere is going to

1011
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,380
push this, but maybe someday in a few years when people realize what's going on and they

1012
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:36,020
start pushing for this, I feel like we could get something here that works for open source

1013
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,020
too.

1014
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,900
And who knows what it'll be one day, but I feel like we're testing something out bigger

1015
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,900
here.

1016
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,700
And Dale sent 500 sats to say that.

1017
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,740
I don't know what 500 sats works out to even.

1018
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,500
It's because you're not using the value for value calculator yet.

1019
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,140
We also got 500 sats from anonymous who said no to discord.

1020
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,860
I can't use it without doxing a phone number.

1021
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:01,540
And you know, I have heard that from multiple listeners when I talk to them in person and

1022
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,580
they say, oh yeah, I'm not on the telegram group or I'm not in discord.

1023
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,620
I don't want to give them my phone number.

1024
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,820
I don't think we can really appreciate how many people were excluding because they're

1025
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,660
not participating in the conversation.

1026
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,660
So they're not getting representation.

1027
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,140
It's true.

1028
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,260
So I don't know who anonymous is that sent 500 sats to make that mention about no discord

1029
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,020
because of the phone number thing, but that did resonate with me.

1030
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,580
So I appreciate you sending that in and that's something I'm going to take into serious consideration.

1031
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,180
Hopefully we'll see you on our matrix.

1032
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,940
Wes, you earned the network a few sats.

1033
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,780
Dave Jones sent us one, two, three, four, five sats.

1034
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,980
I like that number.

1035
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,980
What is that?

1036
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:36,980
Can you do the calculator?

1037
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,060
One, two, three, four, five.

1038
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:44,140
Dave Jones, he's the creator of helipad, which lets us read these boost messages and he says,

1039
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,540
thanks for helping me bug fix hella bad guys.

1040
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,500
Here is a bug bounty.

1041
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,060
So do you want to just give us like a super brief synopsis on what actually let me set

1042
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,060
it up.

1043
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,060
Okay.

1044
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,980
Cause you will not give yourself the fricking credit that you deserve because you are a

1045
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,300
mad lad.

1046
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,500
And so here we were on last Sunday during the super bowl and it was after the show where

1047
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,780
it was still daylight out and the super bowl was still going.

1048
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,740
And instead of going home, what Wes Payne did is he helped us troubleshoot.

1049
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,660
We were having an issue rendering these boost messages, uh, because you know, they come

1050
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,500
in and they get stored in a database.

1051
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:23,020
And then Dave has this back, this backend rust app actually.

1052
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,020
Yeah.

1053
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,020
Hella bad.

1054
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,020
Yeah.

1055
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,700
That kind of acts as like this, um, API that we can, it has an API that we can connect

1056
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,700
to and get the messages.

1057
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,580
And it kind of, it kind of is like this backend tool to pull those messages and he's built

1058
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,180
a front end that displays them.

1059
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,220
But it wasn't working.

1060
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:41,780
We could see the messages were in the database, but the front end wasn't displaying the message.

1061
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,020
So like the legit mad lad that he is, Wes sat down during, I don't know, the last half

1062
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,380
of the super bowl.

1063
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:53,300
And before the super bowl was over, had rebuilt portions of the entire app and Python.

1064
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:58,420
So I don't know, in like an hour rebuilt 20, 30% of the app and Python got it querying

1065
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:03,460
the backend rust server to troubleshoot what the issue was, reproduce the bug in his own

1066
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,340
app that he had just built during the last half of the super bowl, tracked it down to

1067
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,300
like a weird character that was in the database, removed that line from the database and fixed

1068
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,640
it and then sent the info over to Dave.

1069
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,640
That was really well done.

1070
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,640
Wes.

1071
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,640
Well done.

1072
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,640
Well done.

1073
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,640
Nobody else will give you the credit, but I was there.

1074
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,780
Hey, we had a lot of fun and it was a great excuse to learn a little bit more about like

1075
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:26,900
the lightning Damon and helipad and umbral and just how all some of these neat tools

1076
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,900
work.

1077
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,900
Yeah.

1078
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,900
It was actually very educational.

1079
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,900
It turned out to be a really, really good kind of under the hood.

1080
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,220
And I walked away even more impressed actually.

1081
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,500
I really like it.

1082
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,940
That's one of the areas I think, depending on, you know, whatever your interest in crypto

1083
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:44,140
generally, a lot of these tools are very familiar to us, like self hosting, loving Linux users.

1084
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,100
And so they're very accessible to just play with.

1085
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:51,000
Very exciting too, to like to cut out any kind of payment processor means that nobody

1086
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
could censor us.

1087
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,620
Not that we really even say anything that would be censored, right?

1088
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:56,780
But just the idea that that's not a threat anymore.

1089
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,100
Well, or just as we've said before, you know, not everyone loves PayPal.

1090
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,780
I don't love PayPal, but all kinds of different things.

1091
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,260
Like you don't have to necessarily worry about the affiliation of the middleman that you

1092
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,100
have to choose to go do business through.

1093
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,100
That is a huge thing.

1094
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,860
A lot of people in free software don't like PayPal.

1095
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,620
That is something I have run into a lot.

1096
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,620
All right.

1097
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,620
Last one.

1098
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,620
We got a thousand.

1099
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,140
Oh, by the way, uh, Hydra looked it up.

1100
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,820
One, two, three, four, five Satoshis is about four dollars and seventy cents.

1101
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,820
Thanks, Dave.

1102
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,820
Isn't that great?

1103
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,820
Yep.

1104
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,900
So we got a thousand stats from another anonymous who came in, um, on episode 444 much to do

1105
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,700
about Ubuntu.

1106
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:34,900
And he said, I'm pressing boost to pay my respects for lady tubes or too soon.

1107
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,900
I don't know.

1108
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,900
No, actually.

1109
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,580
Um, so we, we did get out of the rat town that we were in.

1110
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,700
I don't mean to be disrespectful, but it was bad.

1111
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,740
Um, and we hired professionals.

1112
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,860
We actually, we, and a few other people like they're, it's all getting taken care of.

1113
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,820
It's all getting addressed.

1114
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,940
And you know, we were kind of shaken up actually.

1115
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,780
I won't lie because after Tucson and then getting stuck in the woods and then getting

1116
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,580
out of the woods and getting a rat that chewed up some of our electrical wiring and mad props

1117
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,360
to my wife who like learned on the fly with help from Brent on how to like rewire this

1118
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,340
stuff while I was down here doing a show.

1119
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:13,580
And we got out of there and we went to the coast and we got this beautiful spot on the

1120
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:19,140
coast where I had the most epic shot for, for Starlink.

1121
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:24,140
So I was getting like 200 megabits down on my Starlink glorious and we spent about three

1122
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,140
weeks out on the coast.

1123
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,520
I think it's been about three weeks, two and a half weeks.

1124
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,980
We just left on Saturday and uh, it was a real nice reset.

1125
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,940
And I spent a couple of mornings watching otters fish, man, those things can swim.

1126
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,100
You know, they sit there all playful and but when they're hunting, they move like a missile

1127
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,860
underwater and I actually saw one of them get a salmon.

1128
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,500
That salmon put up a big old fight flopping all over the place.

1129
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,820
It's so wonderful when you're just around nature like that.

1130
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,820
Yeah, yeah.

1131
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:54,460
Big old crane birds and it reminds you to get your outside of yourself a little bit.

1132
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,500
Reminded me also why we did the art, why we chose to do the RV thing.

1133
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,800
And you know, my whole, my whole philosophy was that is like, yeah, maybe I could do that

1134
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:05,080
one day, but I don't really ever plan to retire.

1135
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:11,460
So I'd rather do this stuff now when I'm in my 30s and 40s than when I'm in my 60s and

1136
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,460
70s.

1137
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:16,140
Uh, because I'll tell you what, it is a ton of work loading and unloading and packing

1138
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,140
stuff up.

1139
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,000
It is a physical job.

1140
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,100
And so God knows I'm probably not going to be in better shape when I'm in my 60s and

1141
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,100
70s.

1142
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,100
So I figured do it now.

1143
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:29,420
It was really a nice reset and reminded me, um, I don't think we've repaired all the damage.

1144
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:35,180
I still actually, I am manually rewiring my slide right now.

1145
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:39,160
I go underneath to the controller and I switch the wires around.

1146
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,620
So I, I always push the extend button, which is up, but I switched the wires.

1147
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:48,540
So up is now reversed to in or out or whatever, you know, like, so I reversed the in and outs

1148
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,940
and I do it manually and it's working, but we still have more wiring repairs to do.

1149
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,620
We're not completely fixed, but she's operational enough that we can do work.

1150
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,020
You're not in pure manual mode.

1151
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,020
Right.

1152
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,020
Exactly.

1153
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,020
I'm not like breaking a rib trying to get the slide in.

1154
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,860
So it's, it is in a much, much better place now.

1155
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:10,060
And we had a really great time on the coast and the kids absolutely loved it.

1156
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,420
They just loved being on the beach so much.

1157
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,180
They did so much fricking exploring.

1158
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,580
So it turned out to be really great, but thank you anonymous.

1159
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:23,580
We are still, we are still making fixes and we have more fixes to do, so I appreciate

1160
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:30,420
the thousand sats, which is probably like a buck, but yes, all right, we've got to bust

1161
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,420
through these pics.

1162
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,780
Cause I was rambling on today.

1163
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,180
I, you, did you find spot cast?

1164
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,180
Yeah.

1165
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,180
All right.

1166
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,180
Spotify.

1167
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:43,940
These bastards love to have RSS shows, uh, that could just be on the open web, locked

1168
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,940
up behind their app.

1169
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,940
They're probably even powering the damn system with RSS.

1170
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:47,940
Let's be honest.

1171
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:48,940
Yeah.

1172
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,580
Uh, you know, you know what I'm talking about.

1173
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,700
And so Wes came across spot cast, which fixes this.

1174
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,700
Yeah.

1175
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,260
It's a caching Spotify podcast to RSS proxy.

1176
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:03,900
So you do have to do some setup, you know, there's some, uh, get, get your Docker going.

1177
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,140
And then it basically talks to spot podcast.

1178
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,260
I can't even talk, talks to Spotify API via some Python.

1179
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,200
So you got to sign in with your Spotify account to get access to that, but then it'll run

1180
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,580
and build you an RSS feed that you can play in any old player.

1181
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,580
Right.

1182
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,580
So you got to have that.

1183
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,220
You got to have the Spotify account, but this thing handles all of the Spotify interactions

1184
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,220
for you.

1185
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,780
And then you just plug that into your app of choice.

1186
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780
Now I got to be honest.

1187
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,760
I don't have a Spotify account these days, so I've not actually tested it, but I could

1188
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,460
imagine if I did, or there was some, maybe there's some shows that you could only find

1189
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:35,780
on Spotify, but you just want in your regular old podcast player or antenna pod or something.

1190
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:40,100
Well, and maybe your favorite show gets like deleted, like they've pulled a couple of creators

1191
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,700
recently and they've pulled episodes from back catalogs before.

1192
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,260
This would be a great way to just back that stuff up.

1193
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,080
If you're a collector, that's a pretty neat pick.

1194
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,920
So we'll have that at linuxunplug.com slash four, four, six, if you want the link to that,

1195
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,920
but then get ready.

1196
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,260
We got a whole batch of Rust picks.

1197
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:08,300
Ha man, you know, I've wanted a replacement for that boring old watch command for so long,

1198
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,300
right?

1199
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,300
It's, it's one of the worst.

1200
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,300
Oh, so old fashioned.

1201
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,300
Yeah.

1202
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:13,300
I know.

1203
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,300
We'll rewrite it in Rust.

1204
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,140
All of, all of these core utils seem like they're getting rewritten in Rust stuff.

1205
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:22,840
That's like just, I've taken for granted for 20 years is just getting completely redone

1206
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,840
in Rust these days.

1207
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,900
So why would I want Rust watch or what are they calling it?

1208
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,900
H watch?

1209
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,900
Yeah.

1210
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,900
H watch.

1211
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,540
Well, well, and it's easy to install cause you can just download the Rust app.

1212
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,940
They've also got a Deb, which I tried here on non-pop OS on the kudu, which worked, worked

1213
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:35,940
just fine.

1214
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:36,940
All right.

1215
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,940
All right.

1216
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,940
Do you need a, no, probably not.

1217
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,940
But does it have some niceties?

1218
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,980
One, it's got some color support, which Hey, that's handy right there.

1219
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,980
Okay.

1220
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,940
And then you can do some clever difference tracking and kind of scroll through the differences

1221
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,940
as well.

1222
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,520
And then it also, it's not just like a dumb pipe.

1223
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,280
You can scroll through the execution result.

1224
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,860
So just like a little quality of life upgrade for your terminal experience.

1225
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,860
All right.

1226
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:56,860
You got me.

1227
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,860
You got me.

1228
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,860
You got me.

1229
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,860
That actually sounds pretty great.

1230
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,860
We've got another one.

1231
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,180
This one looks like it's, it's a note taking of a form, right?

1232
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,860
But not like regular notes.

1233
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,980
No, this is more like if you're trying to doodle or draw or add annotations free for

1234
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:14,980
maybe you've got a pen on a tablet, something like that, or a touch screen and it's available

1235
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,980
on flight hub.

1236
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:16,980
Yeah.

1237
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,140
And it's GTK four too.

1238
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:23,100
So this is a super easy install and we have had people that have written in and asked

1239
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:29,180
us, do you know of an app we can use with like a Wacom style pencil interfaces and always

1240
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:31,080
asking us, how can I use this on Linux?

1241
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,420
Our note seems like the way to go.

1242
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,660
Also if you just want an easy to try out GTK four first application that does something

1243
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:40,340
a little different, our note could be a great way to go.

1244
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,820
Or maybe you're a developer and you're curious to see some GTK four and rust interactions.

1245
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,540
Maybe take a look in the source code.

1246
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:46,540
All right.

1247
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,980
Now I know you're a dog man.

1248
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:48,980
So tell me about dog.

1249
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,100
Well, it's another rust app.

1250
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,100
Yeah, that's right.

1251
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,100
Our last one for this episode.

1252
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,100
It's command line DNS client.

1253
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,100
I know you need another one, right?

1254
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:02,540
You're probably still doing a host or something terrible or still using dig when you could

1255
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:03,540
be using drill.

1256
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,540
No, now you can use dog.

1257
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,540
Oh, I like dog.

1258
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,540
D O G is easy.

1259
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,540
It's quick.

1260
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,540
It's easy.

1261
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,100
I like the little catch line here too.

1262
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,940
Dog can look up.

1263
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,700
Dog is an open source DNS client for the command line.

1264
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,540
It has colorful output.

1265
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,660
I'm noticing a trend with us.

1266
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:20,660
That's pretty great.

1267
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,000
Oh God, of course.

1268
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,680
And it can also output the results as JSON, right?

1269
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,580
It's also got, um, you know, DNS over TCP, DNS over HTTP support built right into.

1270
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:33,920
So if you've got some of those modern fancy DNS going on, you want to build a query that

1271
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,980
with first party support, that's great.

1272
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,660
And yeah, JSON support, maybe you're doing something you shouldn't or setting up a crazy

1273
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,740
little shell pipeline.

1274
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:42,740
Dog could fit right in.

1275
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:46,420
I think as soon as Brent and I saw JSON support on there, we're like, oh yeah, no, this is

1276
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,420
why West.

1277
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,420
Oh yeah, here we go.

1278
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,420
Yep.

1279
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,420
That's got West written all over it.

1280
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,580
You don't have to grab and do like text parsing.

1281
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,580
It's data.

1282
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,140
You know, it's fun when we do a lot of picks.

1283
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:59,500
It's been a little while since we've done a, like a whole bunch of them.

1284
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,100
We usually try to like reserve it to just one and make one really good one.

1285
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,620
But sometimes you just can't choose.

1286
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,620
Those are all good.

1287
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,380
And you know, there's so many rust apps coming out these days.

1288
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,420
If we just did one a week, we couldn't keep up.

1289
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,420
No, no.

1290
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,420
All right.

1291
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,420
Well, I think that's probably everything.

1292
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,420
Yeah.

1293
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,420
I think we're all done.

1294
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,420
Man, that laptop's been fun.

1295
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,660
Kind of be sad to see it go, but now it must get packed back up probably for someone else

1296
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,660
to review.

1297
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,620
I would imagine they're going to have fun though.

1298
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,620
Yeah.

1299
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,620
Yeah, absolutely.

1300
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:30,060
So if you want links to anything we talked about today, Linux, unplug.com slash four,

1301
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,060
four, six.

1302
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,340
I do remember we do have that love plug getting together.

1303
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,000
They get together before the show starts.

1304
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,660
We do the show on Sundays, Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar is your place to do

1305
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:41,660
that.

1306
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,660
See you next week.

1307
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,660
Same bat time.

1308
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,660
Same bat station.

1309
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:49,740
I didn't know you called YouTube a bat station these days, but okay.

1310
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:56,460
You know, I, I guess the hip thing to do would be to like follow and do the bell thing, right?

1311
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,660
If you're on the YouTubes or if you're on the Twitch to do what they do on Twitch, which

1312
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,660
is whatever.

1313
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,660
I don't know.

1314
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:02,660
I don't know.

1315
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:09,060
You know, the pod ping folks that, that, uh, are part of podcasting 2.0 are working on

1316
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:13,940
announcing live streams in podcast apps podcast app could tell you when they're live.

1317
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:14,940
I like.

1318
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:17,620
It's probably a year or two away, but they're laying the groundwork right now.

1319
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,620
All right.

1320
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,620
That's everything for today's episode.

1321
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:35,540
We'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1322
01:01:49,620 --> 01:02:07,180
Maybe I should start running an ad for the donations, you know, cause we only have one

1323
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,820
sponsor right now and the show's kind of built around a two sponsor format.

1324
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,500
Um, you could do like a Jupiter dot party.

1325
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,340
I should just, can we come up with a really like, like, uh, yeah, we need like a great

1326
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:20,180
ad, like we need something that's really good.

1327
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:21,500
We need a little jingle music.

1328
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,500
Yes.

1329
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,500
Yeah.

1330
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,500
Somebody that could create a, we need a director and a producer.

1331
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,780
I think I'm going to need a character to play.

1332
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,780
Obviously you're going to need a character.

1333
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:29,780
Yeah.

1334
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,420
Sort of a, uh, how about a burnt out podcast host?

1335
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,420
Yeah.

1336
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,420
Yeah.

1337
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,420
Yeah.

1338
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,420
Maybe like a cowboy hat character for me.

1339
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,260
I don't know why, but like, you know, with like a lasso and I'm like, I was thinking maybe

1340
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,100
you had like a gold pan in your hand.

1341
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,100
Oh yeah.

1342
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,100
Or what about like, we'll podcast for food side.

1343
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,340
That's pretty much what it is, dude.

1344
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,340
It is.

1345
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,100
You weren't going to do the show until I brought those tacos.
