WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.260
Well, Chris, did you hear someone posted a native in kernel patch set for wire guard to open BSD?

00:07.260 --> 00:11.880
Is that possible? Yeah, you know actually they've been working with upstream with with Jason

00:12.280 --> 00:17.540
They've learned a lot from the Linux kernel implementation and they've got the right licensing in place

00:17.540 --> 00:19.820
So yeah, I mean it hasn't been accepted

00:19.820 --> 00:21.640
I don't know if it ever will be

00:21.640 --> 00:37.800
But it actually might be simpler than Linux because turns out open BSD already had good crypto

00:37.800 --> 00:43.680
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello Wes

00:43.680 --> 00:50.160
It's episode 354 and I think it's too big of a show way too big. We're not being very responsible today

00:50.160 --> 00:54.720
I know we needed to get one of those vehicles behind us with the sign that flashes that says

00:55.500 --> 00:59.800
Oversized show just go around us on the internet. There's too much to cover today

01:00.080 --> 01:04.400
We have a bunch of great community news. It turns out this is one of those weird weeks

01:04.920 --> 01:11.800
That only 2020 brings us these days where Microsoft is going to dominate a large portion of our community news section

01:11.800 --> 01:14.480
Say what? I know it's not just gonna stop there

01:14.480 --> 01:16.520
We have a bunch of other things to get into including

01:16.520 --> 01:20.520
Philip is here from Manjaro. Hello, Philip. Thank you for joining us again. Hello. Hello

01:21.080 --> 01:26.280
So stay on the line there Phil because we're gonna be talking about some Manjaro hardware here in a moment

01:26.520 --> 01:32.600
But before we go any further, I gotta say a big hello to drew and cheese who are also here today. Hello guys. Hello

01:33.080 --> 01:39.100
Hello. Oh, hello gentlemen cheese. You're looking fabulous today. I like this new beaded sweatshirt. You've got here

01:39.100 --> 01:44.520
Did you hand bead this thing hand beaded and hand sequined? I'd never seen a hoodie made out of beads before

01:44.520 --> 01:47.480
It's really pretty impressive. This is one of those times. I wish we are a video show

01:47.480 --> 01:53.260
And of course a huge time appropriate greetings to that mumble room. Hello virtual lug. Hello

01:56.480 --> 02:02.540
Hello who let the eagle in the lug? Oh my gosh ridiculous. Well, I didn't want you to get lonely

02:03.600 --> 02:07.800
Yeah, it is nice to have a pet eagle. I gotta say it is it is pretty pretty sweet

02:08.100 --> 02:11.640
We have some strange news to start with

02:11.640 --> 02:18.640
Everybody take a moment prepare yourselves because today is Microsoft build and we have a build

02:19.640 --> 02:21.640
blast of Microsoft news for you

02:24.640 --> 02:29.640
It starts with a Microsoft executive recently saying we got it wrong on open source

02:30.640 --> 02:35.640
Microsoft's Brad Smith acknowledges they were wrong in past remarks made by Balmer and other executives

02:35.640 --> 02:42.640
Brad Smith has served as the president of Microsoft since 2015. He held a virtual talk slash Fireside Chatskies

02:43.640 --> 02:47.640
During that there was a quote that Michael liberal at pharaonic scrapped

02:47.640 --> 02:52.640
Microsoft was on the wrong side of history when open source exploded at the beginning of the century

02:52.640 --> 02:55.640
And I can say that about me personally

02:56.640 --> 03:01.640
The good news is that if life is long enough, you can learn that you need to change

03:01.640 --> 03:07.640
Today Microsoft is the single largest contributor to open source projects in the world when it comes to business

03:08.640 --> 03:11.640
When we look at GitHub, we see it as the home for open source development

03:11.640 --> 03:17.640
Now we see our responsibility as its steward to make it a secure productive home for developers

03:17.640 --> 03:21.640
How does that make you feel when you read that? Do you feel like they get it? They actually get it this time

03:21.640 --> 03:26.640
I mean, you know Brad Smith is is high up there and it does seem like their workforce gets it

03:26.640 --> 03:31.640
So at this point the executives sort of have to play catch up, you know, all the best talent that they want to hire

03:31.640 --> 03:35.640
Those are folks that want to be involved in are involved in open source

03:35.640 --> 03:37.640
And you heard that little business reference in there

03:37.640 --> 03:41.640
I think really what they picked up on is hey, this is working for our bottom line

03:43.640 --> 03:44.640
Yeah, indeed

03:44.640 --> 03:49.640
So build like I said happening right now Microsoft's annual developer conference

03:49.640 --> 03:54.640
And there's been a couple of bombshells that apply to the Linux world

03:54.640 --> 03:57.640
Let's start with the biggest the one that made me go. Holy crap

03:57.640 --> 04:04.640
There was some hints going around about this that a developer on Twitter named Alex happened to mention

04:04.640 --> 04:09.640
And notice and took some screenshots of some weird DirectX stuff that seemed like it was being baked into WSL

04:09.640 --> 04:11.640
But he didn't know what was going on behind the scenes

04:11.640 --> 04:18.640
And today we learned that Microsoft, Sachi Nadella himself up on stage actually announced that WSL

04:18.640 --> 04:27.640
The Windows subsystem for Linux on Windows 10 will include GPU compute support and full GUI application support

04:27.640 --> 04:34.640
And there's even some DirectX magic happening here to support certain DirectX calls on your WSL applications

04:34.640 --> 04:39.640
This is full fledged graphics supports

04:39.640 --> 04:44.640
And their initial prototypes right now are even using Wayland as some of the windowing technology

04:44.640 --> 04:51.640
To make it possible to run full fledged Linux GUI applications with GPU acceleration via WSL

04:51.640 --> 04:55.640
They're going to beat us to Wayland on the desktop. Oh, no

04:55.640 --> 05:05.640
It turns out how they're accomplishing this is essentially making this technology on par with what Windows applications can achieve

05:05.640 --> 05:11.640
Graphics performance wise will link to the developer post where Microsoft explains all of this

05:11.640 --> 05:19.640
But essentially for a while now Microsoft has been baking in para virtualized GPU support into the core of Windows

05:19.640 --> 05:25.640
And Windows drivers including requiring all of the OEMs to support this

05:25.640 --> 05:26.640
Think about this for a moment

05:26.640 --> 05:30.640
This has been a long term project actually in part to support HoloLens of all things

05:30.640 --> 05:39.640
And launching with WSL 2 and WDDM version 2.9 which is part of the Windows display driver model

05:39.640 --> 05:47.640
They're going to expand the reach of GPUs to Linux guests using this para virtualization technology that Windows itself is already using

05:47.640 --> 05:53.640
So it's the same pipeline Windows is using for graphics rendering now being opened up to the WSL

05:53.640 --> 06:01.640
And it's one part Windows software but it's also one part Linux kernel software

06:01.640 --> 06:09.640
Yeah, they've made a new kernel driver DXG kernel brand new and it basically exposes a little device slash dev slash DXG

06:09.640 --> 06:12.640
To the user mode Linux running in your virtual machine there

06:12.640 --> 06:18.640
And it's got an iOctal that basically mimics the native WDDM stuff that happens on the Windows side

06:18.640 --> 06:23.640
And it sits there on the bus between the virtual machine and the host and just sort of forwards those calls along

06:23.640 --> 06:28.640
So once you're in Linux, I mean, you just get the full capabilities that you would get in Windows

06:28.640 --> 06:33.640
And there's not a whole bunch of throttling, it's not like the Linux has some sort of second tier access to the hardware

06:33.640 --> 06:36.640
It competes just the same as any native Windows application

06:36.640 --> 06:45.640
Yeah, like Bruce in the chat room puts it, so now you can play your Steam games using Proton on Linux on Windows

06:45.640 --> 06:54.640
And as Jill very accurately and acutely puts it, there's really no need for VMware on Windows to run Linux with the full GPU anymore

06:54.640 --> 07:00.640
Applications that are running inside of the Linux environment have the same access to the GPU as native applications on Windows

07:00.640 --> 07:06.640
There's not a partitioning of resources between Linux and Windows or limits that are imposed on the Linux applications

07:06.640 --> 07:12.640
None of that exists, the sharing is completely dynamic just based on what application needs what

07:12.640 --> 07:19.640
Also sort of interesting from the open source perspective, not really the open source perspective but just the targeting Linux at Microsoft perspective

07:19.640 --> 07:26.640
Is they've added stuff like DXCore and D3D12 to Linux, so this is like DirectX driver code now running on Linux

07:26.640 --> 07:31.640
But it's compiled from the Windows codebase, the same codebase that they make the DLL for Windows

07:31.640 --> 07:34.640
That's what they make the.so file for Linux on

07:34.640 --> 07:39.640
Although it seems that their kernel, while it shares some of the same names as Windows components

07:39.640 --> 07:43.640
The kernel driver they've created is a clean room implementation that will be GPO

07:43.640 --> 07:49.640
Nice to see, now of course you know we mentioned Proton and I had the same thought but

07:49.640 --> 07:55.640
Probably what a lot of this is targeted to especially right now before the full you know the GUI stuff comes into WSL

07:55.640 --> 07:57.640
Well it's machine learning

07:57.640 --> 07:59.640
Yeah those kind of jobs and stuff like that

07:59.640 --> 08:06.640
And I think it's also about reassuring certain OEMs that if you wanted to continue to invest in DirectX

08:06.640 --> 08:10.640
You've got still a Windows Avenue here as long as they're running it under WSL

08:10.640 --> 08:14.640
And they do address the question around Vulkan in this post

08:14.640 --> 08:19.640
And they say they're still exploring how to best support Vulkan in the Windows subsystem for Linux

08:19.640 --> 08:24.640
Although it seems like they're looking at basically adding stuff to Mesa that implements OpenCL and OpenGL

08:24.640 --> 08:27.640
And some of those technologies on top of DX12

08:27.640 --> 08:32.640
So this is like the reverse of the shims that we've been using to get DX implemented on those

08:32.640 --> 08:34.640
They just flipped the script on us Wes

08:34.640 --> 08:35.640
What?

08:35.640 --> 08:44.640
On one hand it's really nice to see that Microsoft is giving more prominence to Linux as a whole even in their conferences

08:44.640 --> 08:53.640
But like my principal worry about this is that it'll continue to suck the oxygen out of further advancing the Linux platform

08:53.640 --> 09:01.640
In favor of just well Windows is good enough so we'll just do that and then all the crap that we have to run on Linux will just run on Linux on Windows

09:01.640 --> 09:08.640
And it's a very very dangerous and bad path for the success of free and open source computing

09:08.640 --> 09:14.640
Because if people in large droves actually do embrace this attitude

09:14.640 --> 09:21.640
Like I don't want to bring up an old dead meme but it's embrace extend extinguish in a very very real way

09:21.640 --> 09:27.640
Yeah I see others in the chat room saying the same exact thing they're echoing the embrace and extend extinguish

09:27.640 --> 09:42.640
I think it's the other way around though is I think this is a dramatic reaction to trying to shore up what has been a pretty lacking aspect of their quote unquote workstation desktop OS

09:42.640 --> 09:50.640
And I think they've looked at what sold a whole bunch of MacBooks few years ago when a bunch of people bought MacBooks for development in the cloud

09:50.640 --> 09:55.640
And they're looking at that going well a rich command line a good terminal

09:55.640 --> 10:04.640
And now moving towards the future machine learning and being able to use the GPL for the GPU I should say for compute

10:04.640 --> 10:10.640
Is a big part of what's going to make the future workstation for developers I think they're making that calculus as a reactionary move

10:10.640 --> 10:18.640
And I think the problem here is because of the nature of the GPL because of the nature of Linux as sort of a unifying technology platform that anybody can kind of build on

10:18.640 --> 10:21.640
And then bring their final value to make it a complete product

10:21.640 --> 10:26.640
I think that's an unstoppable force and it eventually will continue to consume the desktop

10:26.640 --> 10:31.640
It'll just be a 10 15 it's the it's the multi 20 year multi decade saga

10:31.640 --> 10:38.640
But when you zoom this thing out and you go 5 10 15 years down the road it's not a Windows future

10:38.640 --> 10:47.640
This is a stop the bleeding kind of move right now Windows itself and the NT kernel has a limited long term potential

10:47.640 --> 10:57.640
Windows 10 is sort of the big last hurrah for that platform and in a way what they're essentially doing is just making Linux the de facto runtime

10:57.640 --> 11:04.640
If you target Linux you can run it on the cloud you can run it on Android you can run it on Windows you can run on Linux desktops

11:04.640 --> 11:08.640
You can run it on ARM you can run on everything that's in everyone's pockets

11:08.640 --> 11:15.640
And I think that is just too big that's bigger than any one product is bigger than any one company

11:15.640 --> 11:23.640
And this is sort of just attempting to become at least competitive with the kind of workstation you get out of the box with Linux or Mac OS

11:23.640 --> 11:29.640
It's almost Microsoft sort of just selling you know fancy developer tooling on top of Linux like here's this whole OS

11:29.640 --> 11:34.640
But but really it's just a wrapper around Linux to smooth that experience and let you play games on the side

11:34.640 --> 11:41.640
That's it we're taking what you know we're taking what you like and we're just going to shave off some of those rough edges

11:41.640 --> 11:44.640
Why even concern yourself with leaving the Windows experience

11:44.640 --> 11:52.640
But I don't think it will supersede Linux as a whole because it's just utilizing part of Linux which has already been so successful

11:52.640 --> 11:58.640
That doesn't mean it's not extremely clever and I think the company that's most at risk is Apple

11:58.640 --> 12:06.640
This is clearly going after the developer market in a very aggressive way and I think it's going at the heart of what made Mac OS good

12:06.640 --> 12:13.640
Because they've taken Windows 10 now and they're doing this iterative update process they're trying to make it a stable OS with WSL with all these new features

12:13.640 --> 12:17.640
It's not us Linux users that should be concerned. It's Apple

12:17.640 --> 12:26.640
If this was really the way that you know Microsoft was going towards us like they're trying to stave the bleeding and trying to recover a little bit and attack Apple more

12:26.640 --> 12:36.640
Why not invest in wine. Why not build up that part like essentially what Valve has been doing to beef up the GPU and and and the hot pads for supporting video games

12:36.640 --> 12:44.640
Why not do the same for the rest of the stuff that Microsoft tends to care about which is productivity and and things of that nature

12:44.640 --> 12:48.640
I've been wondering about that myself if that would be something we start seeing them do

12:48.640 --> 12:51.640
But I think instead you'll see them just start targeting the platform

12:51.640 --> 12:56.640
I've recently for the first time used teams on Linux Have you ever tried that

12:56.640 --> 12:59.640
It's not bad It's actually not bad on Linux

12:59.640 --> 13:03.640
They've done a decent job of creating the teams application for Linux

13:03.640 --> 13:09.640
It lacks some of the features like background blur right and it did take them a while to add that support

13:09.640 --> 13:12.640
But you saw it there as a bug and I think that that's part of their process

13:12.640 --> 13:14.640
Right they have ways to get feedback about products

13:14.640 --> 13:23.640
And when they saw that oh yeah there there are a bunch of Linux users out there who maybe wants not the right word but need to use our software and want a native ish version

13:23.640 --> 13:29.640
Let's make it for them I have this Chris last dot com slash consulting where I'm doing the podcast consulting for folks

13:29.640 --> 13:34.640
And I had a client who is interested in working with me for a serious chunk of hours

13:34.640 --> 13:41.640
But the requirement to work with them was I had to use teams because everyone on their team is using that

13:41.640 --> 13:47.640
And I was like OK I didn't realize that until like the call was supposed to start

13:47.640 --> 13:52.640
And so I was like I bet this is in the managerial repos

13:52.640 --> 14:00.640
And so I did I did a quick search there was teams I did a dash teams and hit enter and within 30 seconds I had Microsoft teams installed

14:00.640 --> 14:07.640
I click the link and I selected my audio source and I was done and I've used it three times since then and it's worked perfectly fine

14:07.640 --> 14:11.640
I think the only thing I can say to that is yeah exactly

14:11.640 --> 14:16.640
There's also called a couple of other Microsoft things before we move on to manager which I want to talk about next

14:16.640 --> 14:23.640
They also officially today released the Windows Terminal which was announced at build 2019

14:23.640 --> 14:28.640
And has become official with 1.0 at build 2020

14:28.640 --> 14:33.640
This is their open source terminal application where you can have in one tab the Windows command line

14:33.640 --> 14:40.640
And then in another tab any Linux distro you want and you can have four or five tabs open with different Linux distros in each tab

14:40.640 --> 14:45.640
It's a very well done piece of software it's something Wes and I were very impressed with when we tried Windows 10

14:45.640 --> 14:50.640
I hope it doesn't get too good or might be better than our native terminals I mean it's already graphically accelerated

14:50.640 --> 14:56.640
It's got a ton of customization options and of course first class emoji support right there

14:56.640 --> 15:03.640
You know it's one of these new breed of sort of Windows apps that have been reimagined in this Microsoft loves open source future

15:03.640 --> 15:05.640
So I imagine this be a lot of new workflows going on

15:05.640 --> 15:14.640
Well you and I met a couple of the individuals behind the project at WSL Conf and the people behind the project from what we could tell

15:14.640 --> 15:22.640
They came to Microsoft after this new open source kind of attitude so they came with this whole fresh perspective

15:22.640 --> 15:27.640
I mean I've known people who worked at Microsoft for a very long time because it's here in my backyard

15:27.640 --> 15:33.640
I've had family and friends that have worked there and there was an old way of looking at a Windows first world

15:33.640 --> 15:36.640
And then there's been a shift since then and they joined the company since that shift

15:36.640 --> 15:42.640
And they came in with that open source first mentality and then they built this terminal

15:42.640 --> 15:44.640
And it's just a fascinating story

15:44.640 --> 15:49.640
But last but not least in all of this because there's actually even more

15:49.640 --> 15:54.640
Microsoft announced a built in package manager for Windows now

15:54.640 --> 15:58.640
And this one's interesting the company today announced the Windows package manager

15:58.640 --> 16:02.640
I knew they would do this I felt like Windows needed this

16:02.640 --> 16:06.640
It's a new native package manager that will be built into Windows 10

16:06.640 --> 16:15.640
With the new win get or wing it if you want to be silly about it command Windows package manager automatically gets the latest version of an app you want to download

16:15.640 --> 16:19.640
Validates its authenticity I mean you want that too and installs it on your machine

16:19.640 --> 16:24.640
So as an example you can install the latest version of that Windows terminal we were just talking about

16:24.640 --> 16:28.640
Just by running win get one word install terminal

16:28.640 --> 16:31.640
And that just pulls down the latest version from the Microsoft store and sets it up for you

16:31.640 --> 16:36.640
Yeah so when I read this at first I was like oh so it's it's a command line front end to the Windows store

16:36.640 --> 16:44.640
That's not very exciting but no the company will also allow users to download apps from third party repositories

16:44.640 --> 16:48.640
Which I think is the key thing to actually making a package manager useful

16:48.640 --> 16:54.640
Yes right it's a little more it's generic tooling in that sense and not just tightly tied to their proprietary infrastructure

16:54.640 --> 17:00.640
Yeah command line front end of the store is boring but a legitimate package manager that also can pull from the store

17:00.640 --> 17:05.640
Okay that's interesting the Windows package manager supports Windows 10 version 1709

17:05.640 --> 17:11.640
So you need to build 1709 or later and it will come pre-installed with Windows 10's desktop app installer

17:11.640 --> 17:15.640
Once that reaches version 1.0

17:15.640 --> 17:19.640
It seems nice for automation too you know we'll tie this into some of your scripts and setups

17:19.640 --> 17:23.640
And instead of relying on third party tools well you just do it all with the Windows stuff built in

17:23.640 --> 17:29.640
This speaks to the larger point that you made about Microsoft looking at the landscape of Mac OS maybe

17:29.640 --> 17:36.640
What sold a bunch of Macbooks well brew sold a bunch of Macbooks so let's just copy brew and have our own thing

17:36.640 --> 17:42.640
I think that's it I think what you're seeing here with this package manager is Microsoft looking at Linux workstations

17:42.640 --> 17:48.640
And Mac workstations and saying what works how do we do a modern take on that and build that into Windows

17:48.640 --> 17:57.640
And where I sit as a Linux user it feels like it takes four freaking ever for this stuff to land in the operating system

17:57.640 --> 18:02.640
It could have been there for years but to Windows users this stuff's coming at a rapid pace

18:02.640 --> 18:04.640
They said it from a totally different perspective

18:04.640 --> 18:10.640
Definitely big changes I mean it's interesting just from the velocity aspect to see how much stuff Microsoft's able to get done

18:10.640 --> 18:16.640
And in the new Windows 10 world of you know frequent and smaller updates actually push this out to people

18:16.640 --> 18:23.640
I think as Linux users we're going to have to get comfortable with a new reality where there's a lot of people on Windows that are playing in our space

18:23.640 --> 18:31.640
And we need to be inviting and understanding and help them when they're ready to make a transition to a fuller Linux system

18:31.640 --> 18:39.640
Because if we're lucky we can set a good example we can make it look like a friendly place and we can encourage them to move to a richer fuller Linux ecosystem

18:39.640 --> 18:43.640
I mean that's just it all right you got Windows from your you know enterprise supplied workstation at work

18:43.640 --> 18:46.640
And oh hey you were able to start playing around with this Linux stuff

18:46.640 --> 18:50.640
Well now when you go home maybe you want to try putting some stuff on a Raspberry Pi and doing home automation

18:50.640 --> 18:55.640
We've got the tools for you yeah exactly we got to set our defensiveness aside as much as we can

18:55.640 --> 19:02.640
And just try to help these new users be successful so that way they become part of the greater community and further the cause

19:02.640 --> 19:07.640
And I think it won't be for everyone I mean every user of the system won't be thinking like that but we'll be able to get some of them

19:07.640 --> 19:14.640
All right I know that's a lot of Microsoft news and a Linux podcast but today's build and that concludes our build blast

19:14.640 --> 19:27.640
And we move on now to some new hardware the mangero book AMD Ryzen running a Ryzen 5 series which is a 3600 I believe

19:27.640 --> 19:35.640
Phil help me sort this out because I was thinking when mangero announced a Ryzen system it was going to be the 4000 series

19:35.640 --> 19:38.640
But looks like we have maybe an interim release hardware here

19:38.640 --> 19:47.640
Well it's like you have a normal desktop CPU flagged into your laptop so you can even change the Ryzen later on

19:47.640 --> 19:51.640
If you have a different CPU simply swap it to a powerful one

19:51.640 --> 19:54.640
Oh so this is like one of those workstation killer laptops

19:54.640 --> 20:00.640
Something like that this is a standard M4 CPU and you can simply swap it out

20:00.640 --> 20:11.640
There's a powerful cooling system so it works so we have a smaller version but you can also put in a Ryzen 9 up to 3900 12 core

20:11.640 --> 20:17.640
So we've got a whole range of systems here we mean we've had you on recently talking about Intel based systems now we have an AMD Ryzen system

20:17.640 --> 20:26.640
There was talk recently about a ultrabook style mangero system it would also be Ryzen based so how do we keep all of this straight now

20:26.640 --> 20:37.640
Well we have several vendors so this one is the computer shop from Belgium and they said hey we're looking also into the Ryzen plate and said okay let's go for that

20:37.640 --> 20:40.640
And we said yes why not and we promoted for them

20:40.640 --> 20:49.640
And so are they doing the bulk of the heavy lifting for getting the OS to run on there or is it because at this point the hardware is so well supported there's not a lot of heavy lifting to do

20:49.640 --> 21:01.640
Well we test with them the main developer of their shop is also using mangero so he is testing with us and we give him some pointers to get his hardware supported

21:01.640 --> 21:07.640
So yeah it's a win-win situation that he is so active in distributing mangero on his machines

21:07.640 --> 21:16.640
So I see kind of a split now in the strategies because some distros have one laptop and it's like the KDE neon laptop

21:16.640 --> 21:23.640
There's one machine you can get it when they update it they update it infrequently but it's that one box

21:23.640 --> 21:28.640
Mangero seems to be going the approach of working with multiple vendors with multiple different laptops

21:28.640 --> 21:32.640
Are you concerned at all about that getting confusing

21:32.640 --> 21:41.640
Normally not we have tuxedo laptops where we have the complete branding then we have mangero computer from Belgium which is also doing some kind of branding for us

21:41.640 --> 21:51.640
And having more vendors than only one you have more options and with this vendor from Belgium you can sell also to the US and Canada without the taxes

21:51.640 --> 21:55.640
So we get a discount of 21% of each automatically

21:55.640 --> 22:04.640
Oh that's pretty significant actually so you are in a sense trying a different model here and I couldn't be more for it

22:04.640 --> 22:09.640
I think it's great to see some just stick with one piece of hardware and they iterate it infrequently and there's that choice

22:09.640 --> 22:15.640
And then you have the mangero approach where there's several vendors which might work better for different customers with different machine options

22:15.640 --> 22:23.640
I absolutely for a very long time and long time listeners of mine will know this I was a fan of the battle station laptop

22:23.640 --> 22:31.640
I would haul these hunkers to my clients and then I would just plug in and I would have the power I needed of a desktop in a laptop

22:31.640 --> 22:40.640
These days and I think kind of like yourself I'm more of portability first because you know I end up on a plane or I'm carrying a machine around at home and work every day

22:40.640 --> 22:44.640
So it sounds like they'll just be multiple options for different types of users

22:44.640 --> 22:53.640
Well Phil I got you here let's just do a quick update on the mangero project itself I saw a bunch of updates come out recently for my workstation

22:53.640 --> 22:56.640
How are things in the land of mangero generally

22:56.640 --> 23:04.640
It's pretty good we're working on getting the updates for the 20.0 releases out so the first point release went out there as well

23:04.640 --> 23:11.640
And we found some issues we fixed them and we hopefully will also update the new KDE packages as they come out soon

23:11.640 --> 23:17.640
I love that I'm running plasma on my mangero workstation and I just I just love it

23:17.640 --> 23:23.640
I told the story recently on the show but it's so nice having one package manager for everything

23:23.640 --> 23:31.640
Even my stupid printer drivers were in the AUR and then you combine that with the curation that happens at the project level on top of ARJ

23:31.640 --> 23:38.640
I was initially skeptical but as an end user I have just absolutely loved it and I'm going to keep an eye on these hardware choices

23:38.640 --> 23:43.640
Will you let us know when the 4000 series Ryzen box gets close

23:43.640 --> 23:48.640
As soon as some vendor has a 4000 series then I'll let you know of course

23:48.640 --> 23:50.640
Oh I'm excited already

23:50.640 --> 23:57.640
Yeah I mean everybody is that's what everybody is and truthfully in our testing the Intel 10th generation CPU based systems are also very competitive

23:57.640 --> 24:00.640
So it's a good time there's lots of lots of choice

24:00.640 --> 24:06.640
Well thanks for coming on Phil and updating us on this it looks like a serious machine for anybody who needs workstation performance from a mobile rig

24:06.640 --> 24:15.640
Yeah and the 10 generation of Intel we will have some new laptops soon also from the UK and Germany so stay tuned for those as well

24:15.640 --> 24:19.640
Thank you sir

24:19.640 --> 24:28.640
Now on the other end of the price spectrum but also well supported by managerial are the pine devices and recently as in since the last show

24:28.640 --> 24:31.640
That's my definition of recently I'll take it

24:31.640 --> 24:44.640
Yeah the pine tab had a pretty significant update with dates on shipping and also other new features like unless I missed this and cheesy maybe you can correct me

24:44.640 --> 24:49.640
The last time I saw information about the pine tab I didn't see this keyboard attached with it

24:49.640 --> 24:56.640
Well yeah they've always had the idea of magnetic keyboard in play for the pine tab

24:56.640 --> 25:01.640
He was in November when they were initially kind of talking about it and there were dev units out there

25:01.640 --> 25:10.640
I know Marius from reports had gotten one the magnets on the keyboard case weren't very strong

25:10.640 --> 25:17.640
So they were having issues with those so I think they reengineered where those were placed and use stronger magnets

25:17.640 --> 25:27.640
I mean it seems like a great little tablet to get it kicked off there's already some videos out there of the pine tab running Ubuntu touch

25:27.640 --> 25:40.640
You know from reports with the five six kernel in it Lima graphics drivers seems like a solid little machine six thousand milliamp battery full size USB 2.0 socket

25:40.640 --> 25:54.640
Does have two gigs of DDR3 RAM which is a little low but it's definitely not a killer for a small tablet like that 10 inch 720 IPS display 64 gigs of EMMC flash storage

25:54.640 --> 26:03.640
But you can expand this and I thought that this was super cool so they have an optional M.2 adapter that you can open up

26:03.640 --> 26:17.640
Apparently with one screw you can take the back off tab toss in this M.2 adapter so you can add in your NVMe SSD even an LTE module

26:17.640 --> 26:21.640
They're talking about LoRa modules a lot of interesting stuff

26:21.640 --> 26:26.640
Yeah that really stood out to me cheese it just because you know they mentioned a little bit like some of this is for aimed at personal users

26:26.640 --> 26:33.640
But some of this is aimed also maybe at commercial applications like LoRa support which is that low bandwidth but long range wireless protocol

26:33.640 --> 26:40.640
So wouldn't a pine tab especially at that price be something just flash on your like commercial thing give it to your employees

26:40.640 --> 26:43.640
They've got it there in the truck with them they when they need to go service something that'd be awesome

26:43.640 --> 26:52.640
Precisely and the one thing that does seem to be kind of a hiccup with that adapter though is that you can populate it with two modules

26:52.640 --> 27:04.640
So you can populate it with the LTE module for example or a LoRa module which isn't quite out yet and say an SSD but you can only use one at a time

27:04.640 --> 27:15.640
But I mean you got to think that this is a $99 price tag with a $20 keyboard upgrade that's really a pretty awesome deal

27:15.640 --> 27:27.640
There's a lot of cool stuff that actually came out of this update so the pine phone itself they're going to be adding a QI wireless charging that attaches via the pogo pins

27:27.640 --> 27:34.640
They're exploring adding a another 5,000 milliamp battery to the back of the case to give you you know more runtime

27:34.640 --> 27:43.640
The keyboard that they've talked about for the pine phones kind of been put on hold but that's going to be coming around eventually whenever you know this kind of COVID thing has died off

27:43.640 --> 27:50.640
And I think that really comes down to they need some in-person visits which you really can't do right now with these factories

27:50.640 --> 27:56.640
So until that opens back up you know they won't be kind of going down the keyboard route for a little bit

27:56.640 --> 28:08.640
A couple of things jump out at me first of all $20 for a magnetic backlit keyboard is crazy and when you compare that to the $300 entry price for the new Apple iPad keyboard

28:08.640 --> 28:25.640
The other thing I really like to see is adding QI wireless to the pine phone is a big deal because there are millions of QI wireless devices already out in the market made by some of the biggest manufacturers in the mobile industry

28:25.640 --> 28:33.640
You know they've said that there's going to be compatibility there so any QI wireless devices that you already have or charging mats that you already have will work

28:33.640 --> 28:43.640
It's a genius idea that they added the pogo pins so that you can easily you know make these additional devices that you can attach to the pine phone

28:43.640 --> 28:49.640
As far as software I tried the latest UbiPorts I still don't have a SIM for it it is getting better

28:49.640 --> 28:53.640
In the video they released it looks like UbiPorts was designed for a tablet

28:53.640 --> 28:59.640
I think that really kind of crosses that convergence area where everyone's been talking about

28:59.640 --> 29:09.640
The tablet itself is also supposed to support display out I don't know if that's USB OTG how exactly they're going to handle that but should be interesting

29:09.640 --> 29:17.640
I got a question for you you said that they have the same quad core a64 system on a chip is that which is that just essentially the rock pro 64 in there

29:17.640 --> 29:30.640
Well it's similar they use the same CPU as in the normal Pinebook the original the 1080p so you have the same CPU in the phone in the Pinebook original and in the tab

29:30.640 --> 29:42.640
And with that you have the possibilities to have the same hardware and us as vendors of the software we don't have to release multiple kernels

29:42.640 --> 29:48.640
So it's easier for us to have one kernel for the Pine devices and to work on the phone on the tab and on the original

29:48.640 --> 30:00.640
Yeah I bet as a developer you're very pleased to see that I want to be the guy here for a moment who just says you know set phasers to stun on your expectations

30:00.640 --> 30:06.640
It's not going to be a performance powerhouse it's not going to shame the iPad Pro in that regard

30:06.640 --> 30:16.640
But in price, customizability, tinkering, future expansion and potentially your preferred workflow this could be an unmatched value

30:16.640 --> 30:19.640
I am very excited to see where they take this

30:19.640 --> 30:26.640
I mean it's just the beginning right I mean this will be the you know the first try out and I'm sure it will evolve as a platform as it keeps going

30:26.640 --> 30:34.640
Very cool all right well let's do a little housekeeping we don't have a lot in this week's episode

30:34.640 --> 30:40.640
I do want to mention that we'd love to have you join us live we have a great attendance today 33 people in the mumble room right now as we go

30:40.640 --> 30:50.640
You can join us on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv and we convert that to your local time zone with the assistance of robots at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash live

30:50.640 --> 30:53.640
And that's good because you don't want us doing it

30:53.640 --> 30:56.640
I'll mess it up every time, every time

30:56.640 --> 31:03.640
We also have the Luplug happening every Sunday and this is how I know some people skip housekeeping because they don't know about this

31:03.640 --> 31:08.640
They show up in the telegram group and they're like isn't there some sort of lug thing yeah the Luplug

31:08.640 --> 31:13.640
Sundays at noon pacific but we got that calendar so you can convert that stuff

31:13.640 --> 31:21.640
Noon pacific which is the same exact time we do this here show only on Tuesdays so it's the same bat time just a different bat day Sundays

31:21.640 --> 31:23.640
And we use our here mumble

31:23.640 --> 31:29.640
Yeah easy peasy and it's a great way to practice your setup if you want to come join us live on Tuesday which you should

31:29.640 --> 31:36.640
And you know Chris you did mention the telegram group and that's still happening going stronger than ever jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram

31:36.640 --> 31:40.640
Yeah some say it's too strong I say they don't know what they're talking about

31:40.640 --> 31:46.640
So we'd love to see you in there it's a great way to continue the conversation in between shows but also get us looking at something

31:46.640 --> 31:52.640
Is there something in the open source world that you think needs our attention that's a great way to get it in front of us

31:52.640 --> 31:57.640
So there you go also you know I'm going to plug right here linuxunplug.com slash contact

31:57.640 --> 32:01.640
Get your feedback in ha how about that we love that feedback

32:01.640 --> 32:08.640
How can we never plug that in the housekeeping West I don't know let's add that right now there you go

32:08.640 --> 32:16.640
Well let's just do a quick old update on our pie holes pie hole 5.0 came out and we run pie hole here in the studio

32:16.640 --> 32:26.640
I'm sure some of you run it yourselves but those that are not familiar pie hole is a network level ad blocking software

32:26.640 --> 32:33.640
That is predominantly designed to run on a raspberry pie there is where you get the name obviously

32:33.640 --> 32:43.640
But because we're maniacs we just run it on our big old x86 server in a container old school old school well actually kind of sort of I don't know

32:43.640 --> 32:47.640
Or new school I don't know what's old is new again

32:47.640 --> 32:56.640
So version 5.0 has landed and I thought well let's jump on the old server here at the studio and do an update right before the show

32:56.640 --> 33:03.640
Because what could go wrong on the very thing I used to access the internet and nothing did it was very boring

33:03.640 --> 33:12.640
I did a docker compose poll and then I did a docker compose up dash D and waited one minute impatiently

33:12.640 --> 33:20.640
And then the new page loaded and I was running the next version and it was the most boring upgrade in network software history

33:20.640 --> 33:22.640
It was just a good thing in my opinion

33:22.640 --> 33:28.640
Yeah you know they do have some notes as a project that this is a one way upgrade so if you leave version 4.0 and you go to version 5.0

33:28.640 --> 33:34.640
There ain't no going back except for your backups and yeah you probably should have some backups

33:34.640 --> 33:39.640
But they also note that docker is a great way to run this because the upgrades I mean they're just a little safer

33:39.640 --> 33:43.640
You don't have to worry about any intermittent state as long as the configs don't break

33:43.640 --> 33:46.640
Well you've got a time tested image right there available

33:46.640 --> 33:53.640
As far as 5.0 goes what I noticed pretty much immediately was improved graphics on the dashboard

33:53.640 --> 34:01.640
For like my history charts of what's been blocked and whatnot and a little bit of more information in log and areas like that

34:01.640 --> 34:06.640
But I think probably the biggest deal for me and why I went ahead with the upgrade

34:06.640 --> 34:11.640
Was the custom host names from the web GUI now through local DNS records tab

34:11.640 --> 34:14.640
This is where you can assign the host name to an IP address

34:14.640 --> 34:20.640
Which I think Wes was the reason why we ended up not using PyHole for our DNS

34:20.640 --> 34:24.640
Does that sound right to you because they didn't have this feature when we first deployed it

34:24.640 --> 34:28.640
Yeah exactly you know it wasn't quite ready to do everything on the network

34:28.640 --> 34:31.640
We had some other infrastructure options available to us at the time

34:31.640 --> 34:37.640
Now that they have this well yeah why not just do it in PyHole because it really does have a pretty friendly GUI

34:37.640 --> 34:41.640
Especially if you've been used to configuring things like DNS mask by hand in the command line

34:41.640 --> 34:48.640
Yeah it is so nice when you just once or twice or three times a year want to go in and do that kind of stuff

34:48.640 --> 34:52.640
It's really nice just to have a UI that sits on top of tried and true Linux technologies

34:52.640 --> 34:56.640
It's not creating some weird implementation itself

34:56.640 --> 34:59.640
Overall pretty solid release though I mean the update was done

34:59.640 --> 35:03.640
I got in there and is one of those experiences where I was like hmm I don't notice a lot of differences

35:03.640 --> 35:05.640
But what I have noticed is an improvement

35:05.640 --> 35:10.640
Her device blocking is quite nice so you're able to block individual clients

35:10.640 --> 35:14.640
So you have a teenager that wants to access Facebook between a certain time

35:14.640 --> 35:17.640
You can do that now through the PyHole web interface

35:17.640 --> 35:23.640
Yeah it's a pretty nice customization you know PyHole is one of those systems that by and large you sort of forget that it's running on your network

35:23.640 --> 35:27.640
But for folks all stuck at home right now with a lot of diverse use cases

35:27.640 --> 35:33.640
That might be causing some problems or maybe you don't need some of that blocking on your work computer that needs to get some stuff done

35:33.640 --> 35:36.640
But you do want it to block out those things for your smart TV

35:36.640 --> 35:41.640
Yeah very true I recently just did the math the back of the napkin math

35:41.640 --> 35:45.640
And I looked at some paid for blocking services for the kids

35:45.640 --> 35:49.640
I was actually kind of doing it on behalf of Angela for her because at the RV I have PyHole

35:49.640 --> 35:53.640
But she wanted something for her network and we were just kind of doing the math

35:53.640 --> 35:58.640
It's like if you look at it if you put this on a Raspberry Pi it doesn't need to be the latest Pi either

35:58.640 --> 36:04.640
So you may have one already which changes the math or maybe you just buy a Raspberry Pi 3

36:04.640 --> 36:10.640
For a very reasonable cost around $35 and then you load this image on there

36:10.640 --> 36:20.640
When you look at it it's probably a grand total of an hour of investment of your time at $25 to $55 worth of hardware

36:20.640 --> 36:27.640
So when we were done with that back of the napkin math 12 months or so you could kind of justify the cost of a subscription service

36:27.640 --> 36:31.640
But by year two you were clearly saving money by deploying this yourself

36:31.640 --> 36:38.640
I don't remember exactly how long ago we deployed PyHole on our machine here in the studio West

36:38.640 --> 36:40.640
But I think we're getting close to that year mark now

36:40.640 --> 36:45.640
Yeah and it's really been a good test that by and large nothing's broke you know

36:45.640 --> 36:51.640
It's not that like sites mysteriously fail or all kinds of stuff just hangs when you expect it to load

36:51.640 --> 36:53.640
So I've been pretty impressed

36:53.640 --> 36:57.640
They've improved some other stuff there just as from the admin perspective too

36:57.640 --> 37:00.640
They've got deep CNAME inspection which is pretty cool

37:00.640 --> 37:05.640
So you can have multiple CNAME redirects you know when you've got a DNS name and it could be a whole chain of them

37:05.640 --> 37:12.640
PyHole can now inspect that chain and determine if any of those are on your blacklist and then block that original request

37:12.640 --> 37:18.640
And you mentioned better logging info one of those things is more information about why something was blocked

37:18.640 --> 37:23.640
So now in the GUI you can go in find that something was blocked and if you're curious like what rule is blocking this

37:23.640 --> 37:27.640
Maybe it is something that you don't want to be blocked it'll tell you just what that rule is

37:27.640 --> 37:36.640
I do like that I always love seeing other notable features include quote unquote more efficient memory usage

37:36.640 --> 37:41.640
Always love seeing that on a new software release because it makes it easier to run it on lower spec hardware

37:41.640 --> 37:45.640
Which makes that whole cost calculation even easier

37:45.640 --> 37:49.640
I think there's other things in here for those of us who subscribe to different blacklist

37:49.640 --> 37:52.640
They've improved the parsing of imported blacklist

37:52.640 --> 37:57.640
They have a gravity script that will now show how many domains were not able to be imported from that list too

37:57.640 --> 38:02.640
And then give you some examples as to why they didn't import so you know where to start from

38:02.640 --> 38:09.640
Which is exceptionally nice especially for people who are doing this casually and don't spend a lot of time

38:09.640 --> 38:14.640
Managing these types of lists or even trying to block things at a DNS level

38:14.640 --> 38:20.640
Yeah exactly it's an interesting blend I think because it is you know actually pretty nice for the power user

38:20.640 --> 38:26.640
You can get in there and go into the command line you can customize the DNS mask or DNS FTL whatever they call it these days

38:26.640 --> 38:31.640
You can customize all that stuff if you need to we've got some custom configs and host files entry setup

38:31.640 --> 38:35.640
But if you just want to use this from a casual end-user perspective that works great too

38:35.640 --> 38:40.640
Do you struggle with the morality of using something like this Wes? I've never had this problem with piehole

38:40.640 --> 38:45.640
But when I use something in my browser, I've gotten a couple of hey, you know to use our website

38:45.640 --> 38:47.640
Please whitelist us from your ad blocker

38:47.640 --> 38:52.640
That is a little bit harder when you're using a network level blocker because it just you got to go login

38:52.640 --> 38:57.640
You got to go add the URL it takes more time than just clicking something in your browser toolbar

38:57.640 --> 39:03.640
There's a bit of a disconnect here when you're using this do you struggle with that at all because I kind of do

39:03.640 --> 39:09.640
Yeah, I mean you are just sort of blanketly saying hey, I want as few ads as possible and that's pretty great from you know

39:09.640 --> 39:14.640
The actual end-user experience, but we do have to acknowledge that many of our favorite sites on the internet

39:14.640 --> 39:19.640
Well traditionally a lot of their revenue let's and the things they use to pay for their servers or pay for their staff

39:19.640 --> 39:25.640
That does come from advertising. So it is a good workflow to get into maybe practice once you set this up

39:25.640 --> 39:30.640
Like what does it look like to whitelist something? What are the sites I go to a lot and you know, especially right now

39:30.640 --> 39:33.640
It's just it's just a good time if you have the resources available

39:33.640 --> 39:38.640
Maybe go subscribe send some money to those sites that you turn off ads for that's a good point

39:38.640 --> 39:42.640
Bloomberg just recently did a piece about piehole interestingly enough and

39:42.640 --> 39:47.640
According to their research piehole is installed on only a hundred and forty thousand network

39:47.640 --> 39:53.640
So we're not talking like, you know a plague that is impacting the advertising industry

39:53.640 --> 39:57.640
But what are your thoughts on this Alex aka? Mr. Ironic Badger

39:57.640 --> 40:04.640
Is this one of those situations where end-users are essentially robbing the creator of revenue?

40:04.640 --> 40:10.640
I mean, I hate to put it at such dramatic terms, but that is kind of what we're talking about here

40:10.640 --> 40:17.640
Yeah a little bit but then on the flip side you have websites that are designed entirely as ad revenue

40:17.640 --> 40:24.640
Farms, you know all these ones that have 10 things about this thing that you don't really care about

40:24.640 --> 40:29.640
They make you click through a 10 image slideshow instead of just writing the article properly

40:29.640 --> 40:35.640
Also trying to browse some of these websites on mobile is just horrible

40:35.640 --> 40:38.640
And there's no real good way to block ads on mobile

40:38.640 --> 40:45.640
So for me piehole or ad guard home is is just a it's a necessity to get a decent mobile browsing experience these days

40:45.640 --> 40:51.640
I completely agree, you know in lady dupes right now. I'm on a mobile connection

40:51.640 --> 40:59.640
I get maybe if I'm lucky 4 megabits where I'm parked right now and having a network level ad blocker

40:59.640 --> 41:03.640
That just prevents pre-rolls and prevents certain components from loading on the web page

41:03.640 --> 41:07.640
Means I put less traffic on the cellular network

41:07.640 --> 41:12.640
I've been subscribing to the New York Times for a couple of months now just to try and support proper journalism

41:12.640 --> 41:19.640
And I think that is the way that we should go about this not forcing advertisements down our our throats really

41:19.640 --> 41:24.640
Yeah, there is the tracking element to of this and I think in a way

41:24.640 --> 41:30.640
It's users pushing back saying this isn't the right way to monetize and I don't mean to make this about this

41:30.640 --> 41:37.640
But to your point the unfiltered podcast, I've relaunched it recently and I very intentionally am just crowdfunding

41:37.640 --> 41:41.640
I've committed to no sponsors. No advertising. It is very much

41:42.640 --> 41:46.640
Not a feasible way to monetize news in my opinion

41:46.640 --> 41:54.640
I think it's fraught with problems when it when it requires tracking of clicks tracking of views tracking across multiple properties

41:54.640 --> 42:04.640
It's fraught with so many user hostile issues that if you just took a more direct to audience approach would be completely avoidable

42:04.640 --> 42:07.640
And I'm not trying to justify the use of ad blocking

42:07.640 --> 42:12.640
But I do think in a sense it's users attempting to vote with their wallet

42:12.640 --> 42:16.640
Well, right. I mean we haven't had a lot of feedback mechanisms and there's you can talk to individual sites

42:16.640 --> 42:22.640
But there's no other real way to go yell at advertisers and marketers out there and we get that some of that stuff's needed

42:22.640 --> 42:30.640
Sometimes it might even be useful rarely maybe but sometimes but we've just seen a relentless increase in tracking and fingerprinting

42:30.640 --> 42:35.640
That's it was well said and it would be nice if you know

42:35.640 --> 42:40.640
Maybe a little more than 140,000 of us were using this because it might send a very clear signal

42:40.640 --> 42:48.640
Also, I want to mention this Bloomberg piece is worth reading because the other thing they talk about is the core developer now

42:48.640 --> 42:52.640
Who's taken over the project recently will kind of semi recently in the last few years

42:52.640 --> 43:00.640
He's got about five to 20 hours. He says to work on this thing between college and his project

43:00.640 --> 43:03.640
Now there is a flourishing community here. So it's not all on one individual

43:03.640 --> 43:11.640
But the elite dev for this project this piehole project that I think is it's one of those showcase open source projects

43:11.640 --> 43:17.640
That even people who have no idea what Linux or a Raspberry Pi or open sources you can show them piehole and they love it

43:17.640 --> 43:26.640
It's being created by somebody who's spending roughly roughly five to 20 hours depending on how busy he is at school

43:26.640 --> 43:34.640
I think that's pretty humbling when you think about it. It's a guy who started this when he was in high school

43:34.640 --> 43:39.640
Got involved with the project when he was in high school and now he's in college

43:39.640 --> 43:44.640
And when science classes are busy, he's only got about five hours a week to spend on this thing

43:44.640 --> 43:48.640
Yeah, I think that does underscore a little bit too of you know, this is an organic need

43:48.640 --> 43:56.640
It's not some conspiracy to hurt websites and advertisers. It's just end users getting frustrated and doing what they can

43:56.640 --> 44:00.640
All right. Well, let's cover a little feedback here on the show. I think that's a piehole for you

44:00.640 --> 44:04.640
And now let's talk about a Linux Mint success story from Zachary

44:04.640 --> 44:09.640
He writes I wanted to share a Linux Mint success story about my grandmother

44:09.640 --> 44:13.640
She loves it. Her computer is a six-year-old HP all-in-one

44:13.640 --> 44:20.640
It had all of the programs from Windows 8 and she hated Windows 8 didn't we all?

44:20.640 --> 44:25.640
Yeah, you know, it was amazing Wes. It really was something the touchscreen worked intermittently

44:25.640 --> 44:28.640
Oh, that's good took three minutes to boot

44:28.640 --> 44:34.640
Oh my god, and she had a metered internet connection that Windows did not respect

44:34.640 --> 44:38.640
Which she was constantly worried about going over her cab all the time

44:38.640 --> 44:44.640
There were weekly printer issues then eventually the Windows key deactivated itself

44:44.640 --> 44:51.640
So and not the key, but the actual like serial key. So she got the Windows watermark saying this is not a license copy

44:51.640 --> 44:55.640
She stuck it out as long as she could but it got horribly slow unreliable

44:55.640 --> 45:01.640
She desperately needed a new computer, but I convinced her to first try Linux Mint and she loves it

45:01.640 --> 45:08.640
I do as well because computer problem calls went from weekly to only twice in the last year

45:08.640 --> 45:12.640
Wow, isn't that the truth? I've noticed that as well

45:12.640 --> 45:15.640
She likes it and says that it's easier to use than Windows ever was

45:15.640 --> 45:18.640
I even forgot to show her how to shut the computer off

45:18.640 --> 45:21.640
And so I called her and told her how to do it, but she said she'd already figured it out

45:21.640 --> 45:26.640
Can you imagine how proud he must be of his grandma right now?

45:26.640 --> 45:31.640
Oh my gosh, I know. He said like really you figured it out and she just said yeah

45:31.640 --> 45:35.640
I mean it has a big red power symbol labeled shutdown. Of course I did

45:35.640 --> 45:41.640
Obvious. How simple. Yeah, yeah that grandchild pride is real though

45:41.640 --> 45:46.640
Camille writes in with a question that I get about once a day right now

45:46.640 --> 45:49.640
So I'm very thankful for the opportunity to clear this up

45:49.640 --> 45:54.640
It's about Pi Boot. He says hello in episode 347

45:54.640 --> 45:59.640
You mentioned putting some info about booting from the USB drive with the Raspberry Pi 4

45:59.640 --> 46:03.640
It's in the show notes you said, but I can't find it. Help please

46:03.640 --> 46:05.640
Well, we'll link it again

46:05.640 --> 46:08.640
And I'll say the guide we have linked here

46:08.640 --> 46:13.640
You really only need to jump down to about midway where it talks about preparing your SD card

46:13.640 --> 46:17.640
That's about where the guide is relevant today

46:17.640 --> 46:21.640
But what this question is getting at is something that I think is fantastic

46:21.640 --> 46:27.640
With Ubuntu 20.04 on the Raspberry Pi 4 and it's that you can run from an external USB drive

46:27.640 --> 46:30.640
Now you do need the SD card

46:30.640 --> 46:32.640
You got to have boot on the SD card

46:32.640 --> 46:35.640
But the process is so simple

46:35.640 --> 46:42.640
And once you do this the read and write access to the SD card is so limited that it's probably going to last forever

46:42.640 --> 46:44.640
Right. I mean at that point it's basically okay

46:44.640 --> 46:46.640
Anytime you boot it needs to read the RAMFS on the kernel

46:46.640 --> 46:50.640
And then when you update and get a new kernel then it has to write you back

46:50.640 --> 46:52.640
But that's about it

46:52.640 --> 46:55.640
And what's nice is it's so much faster

46:55.640 --> 46:57.640
And yes it's over USB 3.0

46:57.640 --> 47:07.640
So huge caveat, past Chris would never ever ever ever recommend that you run your system from a USB drive ever

47:07.640 --> 47:08.640
Don't do it

47:08.640 --> 47:14.640
Current Chris has accepted this compromise in hopes that the USB code base has gotten more stable as time has proceeded

47:14.640 --> 47:19.640
And so far, so far, current Chris has not been proven wrong

47:19.640 --> 47:22.640
Yeah I mean USB has been adopted for so many things these days

47:22.640 --> 47:24.640
And I think there are a lot of systems

47:24.640 --> 47:26.640
I mean I've definitely been guilty of that before

47:26.640 --> 47:28.640
Even running Windows off a USB drive once in a while

47:28.640 --> 47:30.640
So it seems to just work

47:30.640 --> 47:31.640
I hope so

47:31.640 --> 47:33.640
Because I'm doing it

47:33.640 --> 47:36.640
The way this works is you take the Pi image

47:36.640 --> 47:38.640
And this may work for other distros as well

47:38.640 --> 47:39.640
This is something I'm going to try

47:39.640 --> 47:42.640
But you take the Pi image for your favorite distro

47:42.640 --> 47:43.640
In this case I use 2004

47:43.640 --> 47:44.640
But try it with others

47:44.640 --> 47:46.640
It just really requires a more modern kernel

47:46.640 --> 47:51.640
You take that image, you flash it to the SD card like you always would

47:51.640 --> 47:53.640
Maybe using DD or using

47:53.640 --> 47:54.640
I don't know

47:54.640 --> 47:55.640
Do you do you?

47:55.640 --> 47:56.640
Maybe you use Etcher

47:56.640 --> 47:57.640
I'm not judging

47:57.640 --> 47:59.640
Then get ready for this

47:59.640 --> 48:00.640
Ready?

48:00.640 --> 48:01.640
Take the USB drive

48:01.640 --> 48:02.640
You plug it in

48:02.640 --> 48:06.640
You flash the same image to the USB drive

48:06.640 --> 48:07.640
I know

48:07.640 --> 48:08.640
Revolutionary

48:08.640 --> 48:09.640
You plug both devices in

48:09.640 --> 48:10.640
You log in

48:10.640 --> 48:13.640
You change the file system ID

48:13.640 --> 48:16.640
To match the SD card on the USB drive

48:16.640 --> 48:17.640
And from that point forward

48:17.640 --> 48:21.640
Once the kernel loads up from the SD card

48:21.640 --> 48:24.640
It sees that file system label

48:24.640 --> 48:26.640
But from what we could tell essentially

48:26.640 --> 48:28.640
It just the way that it's hard coded

48:28.640 --> 48:30.640
It first attempts to boot from USB

48:30.640 --> 48:32.640
Yeah, it seems to work out that

48:32.640 --> 48:34.640
How the kernel chooses its boot devices

48:34.640 --> 48:36.640
They both ended up having the same label

48:36.640 --> 48:38.640
But it just picks the right one to start with

48:38.640 --> 48:41.640
So we didn't even have to erase the label from the SD card

48:41.640 --> 48:43.640
So that means too that in the worst case

48:43.640 --> 48:44.640
Your USB dies

48:44.640 --> 48:48.640
Well, you can still boot to repair things from the SD

48:48.640 --> 48:50.640
Yeah, and we'll link to the guide that I used to do this

48:50.640 --> 48:53.640
And like I said, start about midway down

48:53.640 --> 48:56.640
And it's so much better

48:56.640 --> 48:59.640
First of all, you reduce the wear and tear on the SD card

48:59.640 --> 49:01.640
But these SD cards are slow

49:01.640 --> 49:02.640
So slow

49:02.640 --> 49:05.640
So slow, where I have USB 3 and an SSD

49:05.640 --> 49:07.640
It's about as fast as you're going to get

49:07.640 --> 49:10.640
In fact, I did some benchmarks just to test it

49:10.640 --> 49:12.640
Because I wanted to get some real numbers

49:12.640 --> 49:14.640
And from what I can roughly tell

49:14.640 --> 49:18.640
It's about as fast as I could possibly get a Raspberry Pi 4 now

49:18.640 --> 49:20.640
Without overclocking it

49:20.640 --> 49:22.640
You know, and just from our own experiments

49:22.640 --> 49:24.640
When you SSH into one of those things

49:24.640 --> 49:26.640
And it's on the SD card and you launch something

49:26.640 --> 49:28.640
Boy, can you tell

49:28.640 --> 49:30.640
But running from the SSD

49:30.640 --> 49:33.640
It just feels like you've SSHed into any old x86 VPS

49:33.640 --> 49:36.640
Yeah, you'd have no idea it's a Raspberry Pi

49:36.640 --> 49:37.640
You really wouldn't

49:37.640 --> 49:40.640
You'd just think it's a VPS or a physical x86 box

49:40.640 --> 49:43.640
And things just run

49:43.640 --> 49:46.640
Yes, and so much stuff is supported on these systems

49:46.640 --> 49:48.640
It's all been cross compiled, it works on ARM

49:48.640 --> 49:49.640
It's great

49:49.640 --> 49:52.640
Alright, well now Wes, you've got that brand new

49:52.640 --> 49:55.640
Really nice looking Dell XPS 13

49:55.640 --> 49:58.640
In your hot little hands for a review

49:58.640 --> 50:01.640
And we got some feedback on the

50:01.640 --> 50:04.640
Hey, include this in the review feedback that we asked for last week

50:04.640 --> 50:07.640
And it came from Cory and he said for the XPS 13 review

50:07.640 --> 50:10.640
I'd love to hear about using it with a generic install

50:10.640 --> 50:13.640
Of Ubuntu 2004

50:13.640 --> 50:16.640
He says, what changes has Dell made to the drivers?

50:16.640 --> 50:19.640
Do they submit them upstream? How will this machine run

50:19.640 --> 50:22.640
22.04 in two years?

50:22.640 --> 50:24.640
You know, Cory, thank you for that feedback

50:24.640 --> 50:26.640
Those are all definitely things I'll be checking out

50:26.640 --> 50:29.640
Actually, a little spoiler right here

50:29.640 --> 50:31.640
It came with 18.04 I think on there

50:31.640 --> 50:34.640
Everything worked out of the box, WiFi was working

50:34.640 --> 50:37.640
I just wanted to test it and I've been loving 20.04 so of course I overrode it

50:37.640 --> 50:39.640
And stuck that on there

50:39.640 --> 50:41.640
So far, no WiFi yet

50:41.640 --> 50:44.640
I'm going to do some more testing, I'll definitely dig into what drivers are in use

50:44.640 --> 50:47.640
And what you actually need to get this working

50:47.640 --> 50:50.640
Unfortunately, it's like it's still new enough that that's a little bit tricky

50:50.640 --> 50:53.640
Interesting

50:53.640 --> 50:56.640
I'm glad you're trying that, a little early discovery there

50:56.640 --> 50:59.640
The way my understanding of this process is

50:59.640 --> 51:02.640
Dell is not creating drivers

51:02.640 --> 51:05.640
And then creating a bastardized image

51:05.640 --> 51:08.640
That ships on the XPS to make it work

51:08.640 --> 51:11.640
They contract with Canonical

51:11.640 --> 51:14.640
And Canonical developers

51:14.640 --> 51:17.640
Make it work, they generate an image

51:17.640 --> 51:20.640
And they certify it and they deliver that to Dell

51:20.640 --> 51:23.640
And then Dell ships that on the XPS

51:23.640 --> 51:26.640
What I'm saying here is, this isn't Dell hacking it into an image

51:26.640 --> 51:29.640
It's the Canonical developers making it work

51:29.640 --> 51:32.640
So it has a very, very good shot

51:32.640 --> 51:35.640
That it's going to get upstreamed into mainline Ubuntu

51:35.640 --> 51:38.640
And that is part of the arrangement

51:38.640 --> 51:41.640
There is a licensing agreement that Dell

51:41.640 --> 51:44.640
Pursues with Canonical

51:44.640 --> 51:47.640
There is a revenue share for every laptop sold

51:47.640 --> 51:50.640
And those support services are part of that agreement

51:50.640 --> 51:53.640
That Dell makes with Canonical

51:53.640 --> 51:56.640
The good news for Dell is that the Ubuntu developers themselves

51:56.640 --> 51:59.640
Are doing some of the coding necessary to get things to work

51:59.640 --> 52:02.640
Like maybe that WiFi

52:02.640 --> 52:05.640
Or maybe that new fingerprint reader

52:05.640 --> 52:08.640
The nice advantage for end users is

52:08.640 --> 52:11.640
You're not having some third party OEM just slam jam code

52:11.640 --> 52:14.640
Into your image where they've hard coded a PPA and you're good to go

52:14.640 --> 52:17.640
You actually have the maintainers of the distribution

52:17.640 --> 52:20.640
That are writing this

52:20.640 --> 52:23.640
And Dell makes it always into the mainline ISO

52:23.640 --> 52:26.640
But it has a very good shot

52:26.640 --> 52:29.640
And it also is a revenue source for Canonical

52:29.640 --> 52:32.640
Yeah absolutely, and I should note I was just using the same

52:32.640 --> 52:35.640
Random 2004 USB stick I had laying around from our review

52:35.640 --> 52:38.640
So that hadn't been updated and because I didn't have WiFi during the install

52:38.640 --> 52:41.640
I actually haven't updated the thing yet

52:41.640 --> 52:44.640
So it may be that I do some updates and everything just works

52:44.640 --> 52:47.640
Yeah and on top of that, you know me, I'd be also interested in other distros as well

52:47.640 --> 52:50.640
You know what you've got to do Wes, you've got to kegzak into some RAM disks

52:50.640 --> 52:53.640
As if I won't be doing that already

52:53.640 --> 52:56.640
Yeah I know, you've got to put at least some of the major ones

52:56.640 --> 52:59.640
I'm sure Fedora 32 will be getting a run on there and Menjaro as well

52:59.640 --> 53:02.640
One of Wes' most recent duties was

53:02.640 --> 53:05.640
He was put in charge of hiring our new soundboard guy

53:05.640 --> 53:08.640
Who just sits here

53:08.640 --> 53:11.640
Too soon, he just did it too soon

53:11.640 --> 53:14.640
Come on, we talked about this

53:14.640 --> 53:17.640
I don't know what to do about this guy

53:17.640 --> 53:20.640
But we do have some pics to get into

53:20.640 --> 53:23.640
It's not the same now

53:23.640 --> 53:26.640
We've got to get rid of this guy

53:26.640 --> 53:29.640
Maybe one of our pics eventually will be a machine learning model that replaces him

53:29.640 --> 53:32.640
I told you hiring a soundboard guy out of Bangladesh

53:32.640 --> 53:35.640
Was going to be fraught with latency

53:35.640 --> 53:38.640
I told you that

53:38.640 --> 53:41.640
But doing this for a long time Wes, that's how these things work

53:41.640 --> 53:44.640
Yeah you're right, in fact I think he's paying us

53:44.640 --> 53:47.640
I don't know how that works

53:47.640 --> 53:50.640
Well we have a couple of pics

53:50.640 --> 53:53.640
This one was sent in by several individuals

53:53.640 --> 53:56.640
I think the whole internet in a way that doesn't typically happen noticed this pic

53:56.640 --> 53:59.640
But we'll give credit to Stephen because he actually used the contact form

53:59.640 --> 54:06.640
Stephen wrote in and he says I just found this little tool that converts any USB thumb drive to a multi boot ISO stick

54:06.640 --> 54:10.640
All you do once it's finished is copy over the ISO and reboot

54:10.640 --> 54:14.640
It can hold numerous ISOs all at once

54:14.640 --> 54:18.640
Also any normal files you might want just to use it as a USB stick

54:18.640 --> 54:22.640
It's got a GitHub page and it's undergoing very rapid development

54:22.640 --> 54:25.640
Alex N on Twitter also sent this in

54:25.640 --> 54:30.640
Interestingly enough on my own accord I also found this one and tagged it

54:30.640 --> 54:34.640
Everybody found this and it does seem like a super cool pic Wes

54:34.640 --> 54:36.640
Oh yeah absolutely

54:36.640 --> 54:40.640
Way back in the last days I think you guys talked about some hardware that could do this

54:40.640 --> 54:43.640
You know a special USB stick that you could copy ISOs on

54:43.640 --> 54:48.640
But talk about easy peasy when you're making these USB drives from ISOs all the time

54:48.640 --> 54:51.640
Why even bother with Etcher when you can just use CP

54:51.640 --> 54:55.640
Yeah it's like the last USB stick you need and you just throw the ISOs on there

54:55.640 --> 54:58.640
And you're right I had I think it was a Zalman drive

54:58.640 --> 55:03.640
Yeah that's what it was and that's pretty slick and kind of makes sense that you might do this in hardware

55:03.640 --> 55:08.640
I'm really impressed I'm going to have to do some digging here in the repository to see how they're making this work

55:08.640 --> 55:14.640
And just how slick it is because they even talk about having UFI support and legacy BIOS both working the same way

55:14.640 --> 55:18.640
It presents you with a nice little menu that finds all your ISOs and lets you choose between them

55:18.640 --> 55:19.640
Holy cow

55:19.640 --> 55:24.640
Yeah you just now stick the USB disk in copy the ISO over

55:24.640 --> 55:30.640
I mean I love this about my Zalman USB drive but it would do classic CD-ROM emulation

55:30.640 --> 55:36.640
So it would actually show up to the host OS as an actual USB CD-ROM drive which is just too much

55:36.640 --> 55:40.640
This is much simpler and you just copy them over and you're good to go

55:40.640 --> 55:44.640
I think this is going to change my Linux distro hopping game forever

55:44.640 --> 55:45.640
Big statement

55:45.640 --> 55:47.640
I think you might be right

55:47.640 --> 55:52.640
Well how can we top that that brings us to the end of this week's unplugged broadcast

55:52.640 --> 55:55.640
We'd love to get your feedback at linuxunplugged.com slash contact

55:55.640 --> 56:01.640
Please do and if there's anything else you want to know about that XPS before we do the official review let me know

56:01.640 --> 56:06.640
It's coming soon and you can hit me up on Twitter I'm at ChrisLS, Wes

56:06.640 --> 56:07.640
At Wes Payne

56:07.640 --> 56:09.640
And go get yourself some cheese bacon cheesy

56:09.640 --> 56:11.640
At cheese bacon

56:11.640 --> 56:18.640
Oh it's magic and of course the show is at linuxunplugged on Twitter the network is at Jupiter signal

56:18.640 --> 56:22.640
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode of the unplugged program

56:22.640 --> 56:25.640
And I'll see you right back here next Tuesday

56:52.640 --> 57:10.640
I found the WSL content really refreshing because I got to know the change from within Microsoft when it happened

57:10.640 --> 57:14.640
So I was there with the Windows 7 to Windows 8 and Windows 8 to Windows 10

57:14.640 --> 57:18.640
And you really notice the change from Baltimore to Nadella

57:18.640 --> 57:26.640
And it's like day and night and people are still in the embrace, extend, distinguish mentality and I really can't hear it anymore

57:26.640 --> 57:28.640
It's just so like tiring

57:28.640 --> 57:30.640
So you were an employee of Microsoft?

57:30.640 --> 57:34.640
It was a close contract, it was like subcontracting I did

57:34.640 --> 57:35.640
They have lots of contractors

57:35.640 --> 57:42.640
Yeah so I was teaching sales for the Microsoft employees and for the retail guys and stuff

57:42.640 --> 57:48.640
So from what you witnessed personally you felt like the transition was legitimate internally

57:48.640 --> 57:49.640
Yeah for sure absolutely

57:49.640 --> 57:56.640
They had meetings, they had people flying out to Redmond and showing them Azure

57:56.640 --> 58:02.640
And when the whole canonical stuff happened people started getting really curious

58:02.640 --> 58:08.640
So I did some workshops because I was always Linux curious and did use it privately

58:08.640 --> 58:13.640
And so I did some workshops for the sales guys that had to deal with Azure back then and stuff

58:13.640 --> 58:18.640
So I mean I'm from a little country like I'm from Austria but you know small changes

58:18.640 --> 58:29.640
Yeah I feel like my proximity to people at Microsoft gave me a bit of a view into the company that people maybe outside of this area don't have

58:29.640 --> 58:40.640
Not only that but I will be honest that I now looking back at it feel like I was childishly irrationally angry at Microsoft

58:40.640 --> 58:48.640
In the late 90s and the early aughts Microsoft was the greatest evil in the technology industry that I perceived

58:48.640 --> 58:52.640
And the technology industry had the greatest potential for influence on mankind

58:52.640 --> 58:55.640
You might even say they were a cancer

58:55.640 --> 59:05.640
Yes and so it became my life's work to inform people about alternatives to Microsoft

59:05.640 --> 59:13.640
And so when I had the opportunity to go down to Redmond because of some content we were covering in Koda Radio

59:13.640 --> 59:17.640
I actually was contacted by some folks at Microsoft and asked to come down there

59:17.640 --> 59:27.640
And when I sat down there and started chatting with folks that were Gentoo users and SUSE users and Fedora users and Windows users all around the same table

59:27.640 --> 59:38.640
I went oh this is different this really is like something that's been multiple years at that point when I went in it was like five years in the works

59:38.640 --> 59:48.640
And I just couldn't be intellectually and emotionally honest with myself without recognizing the cadence difference in everything they were saying to me

59:48.640 --> 59:59.640
And the fact that a lot of the employees there were listening to our podcast because they're interested in what Linux users are thinking and doing and care about

59:59.640 --> 01:00:06.640
Was also very telling because when I walked around there it was like I was kind of at a Linux conference like people knew me and I didn't know who they were

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:15.640
You know that awkward kind of like you know me and I don't know you but you know me that's weird and that was the Microsoft office

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:24.640
And I walked away from that and I brought my wife with me and I walked away and I remember talking to her and I'm like this isn't the Microsoft that I grew up with

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:29.640
Now we can all just circle up hold hands sing kubaya and just beat up on Oracle

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:36.640
Amen
