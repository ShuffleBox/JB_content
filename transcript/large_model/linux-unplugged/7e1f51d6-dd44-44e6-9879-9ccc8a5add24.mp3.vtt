00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
You know, I came across something kind of interesting today.

00:02.320 --> 00:06.040
Do any of you guys in the mumble room ever struggle with like anxiety problems or things

00:06.040 --> 00:07.040
like that?

00:07.040 --> 00:08.920
Anybody ever have battle with that kind of stuff?

00:08.920 --> 00:12.960
I know like it's kind of not like a normally socially acceptable thing to talk about, but

00:12.960 --> 00:17.200
I think a lot of geeks and probably the geekier you are sometimes, the more likely you could

00:17.200 --> 00:19.460
be to have some sort of anxiety problem.

00:19.460 --> 00:23.120
Maybe there's social anxiety, maybe it's just, you know, stress anxiety.

00:23.120 --> 00:28.320
I found a really interesting article today that kind of put it all in perspective that,

00:28.320 --> 00:34.600
you know, it felt like it connected me to one of the OG geeks and that is Darwin.

00:34.600 --> 00:42.520
There's a post over on brainpickings.org that was posted on the 28th of last month and it

00:42.520 --> 00:46.160
goes into detail on Darwin's struggle with anxiety.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.160
And there's a couple of interesting things in the article that I found.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.400
So here is a quote from Darwin that he wrote in 1865.

00:54.400 --> 01:00.160
He says, for 25 years, extreme spasmodic and daily and nightly flatulence, occasional vomiting

01:00.160 --> 01:03.160
on two occasions prolonged for months.

01:03.160 --> 01:07.840
Vomiting proceeded by shivering, hysterical crying, a dying cessation or half faint and

01:07.840 --> 01:12.400
copious pallid urine, I'm not even sure what that is.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.200
He says, now I have vomiting and every passage of flatulence proceeded by a ringing of my

01:16.200 --> 01:17.480
ears.

01:17.480 --> 01:23.940
He says, I have nervousness when E leaves me and E refers to his wife.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.280
He would be stricken with horrible anxiety.

01:26.280 --> 01:32.520
He goes on to say that, this was in the Chronicle of Darwin's Problems, it says, Darwin was

01:32.520 --> 01:37.880
frustrated that dozens of physicians beginning with his own father had failed to cure him.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.640
By the time he wrote to Dr. Chapman, Darwin had spent most of the past three decades during

01:41.640 --> 01:48.640
which time he struggled to write on the origin of species because of his anxiety.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.320
He was bound to his household based on his diaries and letters.

01:51.320 --> 01:57.040
It's fair to say he spent a full third of his daytime hours since the age of 28 either

01:57.040 --> 02:02.560
vomiting or lying in bed because of crippling anxiety.

02:02.560 --> 02:07.200
You know, you hear a lot about these historical figures but you don't ever hear about this

02:07.200 --> 02:09.240
part do you?

02:09.240 --> 02:13.120
You never hear too much about the background.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.520
And their own personal struggles like this.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.520
Oh yeah.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.080
A lot of people have struggles with anxiety.

02:20.080 --> 02:25.400
I for one am somebody who suffers from anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified.

02:25.400 --> 02:30.080
I've actually been diagnosed and yeah, I can totally relate to that.

02:30.080 --> 02:31.560
Do I believe in Darwin's philosophies?

02:31.560 --> 02:32.560
No.

02:32.560 --> 02:37.640
That's just because of all sorts of other factors but in terms of struggling with anxiety

02:37.640 --> 02:39.920
I totally get that.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.760
And I think it's something that a lot of intelligent people are probably afflicted by a lot too

02:43.760 --> 02:46.920
because your mind maybe wanders more than it should, or faster than you can control

02:46.920 --> 02:49.200
it in some cases.

02:49.200 --> 02:54.360
I have described that over and over again to friends and family is that like at night

02:54.360 --> 02:59.400
my mind will just take all sorts of different paths which is why I have to read before I

02:59.400 --> 03:01.000
go to bed otherwise I don't sleep.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
You got to do what I do.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.040
Just call up Aaron Saigo and then hang up after he answers the phone.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.040
Yeah.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.040
That's what makes me feel better.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Huh.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
He's in here with us.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.040
Hey there, Aaron.

03:10.040 --> 03:14.040
Hey, I always wondered if that was you.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.040
Yeah.

03:15.040 --> 03:20.600
I thought maybe you'd recognize the breathing but it's fine, I hoped.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.960
I'm glad you could join us today.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.080
Congrats on the new project, by the way.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.080
That's very cool.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.080
Oh, thank you.

03:26.080 --> 03:34.280
Yeah, I suppose you're referring to the Luminosity Reboot.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.520
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that always recommends building

03:38.520 --> 03:41.000
your own online photo backup.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.520
My name is Chris.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
And my name is Matt.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
Hey there, Matt.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.560
Happy post-labor day to you.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.040
Are you all rested up and ready to go?

03:48.040 --> 03:49.440
We got a big show today.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
Absolutely.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.920
Joining us in just a little bit will be Aaron Saigo.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.280
He's launching a new project that I'm pretty excited about.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.120
And he's also been talking a lot about convergence.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.120
What is the desktop?

03:59.120 --> 04:00.120
What are laptops?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.440
Where does mobile fit into all of this?

04:02.440 --> 04:06.400
Sort of really doing a good meta-analysis of a lot of things we've been talking about

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
lately.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.400
So we'll chat with him in just a bit.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.400
I'm excited about that.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.360
Plus, I don't know if you caught it.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.840
We mentioned it earlier, but Linus was at DebConf, the Debian conference.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.020
And I guess they had it in Portland.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.020
So Linus showed up.

04:18.020 --> 04:21.720
You know, he just threw on his socks, then he threw on his sandals, in that order, like

04:21.720 --> 04:22.720
a man.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.160
Went down there and talked to the DebConf folks about what was going on.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.160
And I love it.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.160
We're only going to...

04:28.160 --> 04:29.480
I haven't even seen the whole video yet.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.480
But the first five minutes of the video are like, I got to play this in the show.

04:33.480 --> 04:40.200
Because he goes into a rant, and he perfectly summarizes kind of what's wrong with distributions.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.920
And it turns out, kind of around the same time, the System Decabal app, they called

04:43.920 --> 04:44.920
that themselves.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.200
I'm not making that up.

04:46.200 --> 04:51.440
The System Decabal thinks they have a solution to some of Linus's complaints.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.800
And also, if we have a little time, we'll see, I'm not quite sure, but if we have a

04:54.800 --> 05:01.400
little time, we'll also discuss Fedora's future package manager, what it can do and what it

05:01.400 --> 05:03.600
can't do quite yet.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.400
But what you should be seeing, starting in Fedora 21, and why DNF might be a big deal.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.520
But first, Matt, as is tradition on the Linux Unplugged show, it is time for emails.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.720
Dave writes in on a pre-show discussion we had a week or so ago about System D. He says,

05:16.720 --> 05:18.800
hey guys, I've been listening to Linux podcasts for a few months.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.800
I enjoy them very much.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.760
Your discussion of System D seemed to come down to innovation versus stability.

05:25.760 --> 05:30.600
I've seen this tension throughout my 30-year career in the Unix arena, and in the past

05:30.600 --> 05:34.120
20, developing a couple of big commercial Unix operating systems.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.620
Customers love stability.

05:35.620 --> 05:40.120
And many will place stability over innovation to a large degree.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.680
Innovation in these operating systems has to come from something completely new that

05:42.680 --> 05:45.840
doesn't disturb the old stable features.

05:45.840 --> 05:51.640
Or at defined points, where an OS vendor can warn the customers, there could be breakage

05:51.640 --> 05:52.640
ahead.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.600
What we're seeing play out in the Linux arena is a maturing of the operating system and

05:55.600 --> 06:01.520
a growing group of users valuing stability over innovation, particularly when innovation

06:01.520 --> 06:02.520
is disruptive.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.600
Fortunately, with Linux, the different distributions are free to introduce these innovations in

06:05.600 --> 06:07.000
ways that make sense for them.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.360
E.g., I wouldn't expect Red Hat to put System D into Red Hat Enterprise Linux for a while,

06:11.360 --> 06:14.960
but other distributions might choose to jump right in.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.920
And I don't know if I totally, completely agree that it comes down to the camp that

06:19.920 --> 06:25.040
likes System D is for innovation, and the camp that doesn't like System D is for stability.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.080
Because A, it implies-

06:27.080 --> 06:28.720
Yeah, I can't speak to that.

06:28.720 --> 06:34.640
Yeah, it to me implies the people that don't want System D are curmudgeons.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.560
And they're afraid of change.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.680
I wouldn't go that far, but I think it's assuming a lot in both directions, and I wouldn't necessarily

06:40.680 --> 06:41.680
go there.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.680
Because I don't know what their opinions and thoughts are on it.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.680
Yeah, I agree.

06:43.680 --> 06:44.680
I think it is going too far.

06:44.680 --> 06:49.760
And I think that sometimes it's not so much about avoiding change as it is just a philosophy

06:49.760 --> 06:50.760
disagreement.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
And that's what makes-

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
That I would agree with.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.720
It's a multi-spectrum thing, I suppose.

06:54.720 --> 06:58.360
It's some people that are curmudgeons about change, some people who don't like the design,

06:58.360 --> 07:01.400
it's some people who don't like the people behind the design, it's some people who question

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
the political reasons.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.480
And if it's all of these things that make it into one big issue, then that's why it

07:05.480 --> 07:06.480
won't die.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.560
If it was just one or two things, people could rationally debate and argue it and shut that

07:09.560 --> 07:10.560
down.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.160
It's not just one thing, though.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.160
Jeremy writes in.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.400
He says, my thought on Linux desktop managers.

07:15.400 --> 07:16.400
Get ready for this, Matt.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.400
Are you ready?

07:17.400 --> 07:20.520
He says, hello, all, and thanks for the Jupyter broadcasting Netcast.

07:20.520 --> 07:24.000
And he says, not just Netcast, but resources as well.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.480
Now, I'm thinking, I'm wondering if-

07:26.480 --> 07:28.480
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.040
I'm wondering if he's a Leo fan.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.040
He says, but he likes to Netcast.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.600
You caught that with Netcast, huh?

07:32.600 --> 07:37.540
I said, I recently wrote a little blurb slash rant on my thoughts of Linux desktop managers.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.640
He said, and he links us to it.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.520
I'll read a highlight from a second.

07:40.520 --> 07:45.000
But the TLDR is I avoid all desktop managers and I run my own lean environment, which makes

07:45.000 --> 07:46.440
my life easier.

07:46.440 --> 07:47.440
And here's what he does, Matt.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.680
Get ready for this.

07:48.680 --> 07:54.400
So he wrote on his blog, he says, I've always felt that at some point, someone out there

07:54.400 --> 07:59.280
would develop a manager that would not try to be an all-encompassing ecosystem, but rather

07:59.280 --> 08:03.200
maybe just something that attempted to just simply be a powerful desktop manager.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.760
That time, though, never came.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.480
It seems that every iteration of every major open-source desktop environment, the wheel

08:08.480 --> 08:12.680
is being reinvented again from scratch, and the idea of how things should look, feel,

08:12.680 --> 08:15.320
and behave kept changing unnecessarily.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.520
They rarely provided any improvements that I felt were positive.

08:18.520 --> 08:22.120
So if I'm not using a desktop manager, what do I use?

08:22.120 --> 08:25.880
Well first of all, I removed the default window manager and replaced it with a highly customizable

08:25.880 --> 08:27.800
window manager called Sawfish.

08:27.800 --> 08:32.240
Sawfish is very customizable, with themes, keyboard shortcuts, customizable menus, and

08:32.240 --> 08:33.240
scripts.

08:33.240 --> 08:37.760
It focuses on being a great window manager and doesn't attempt to be anything else.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.560
It's easily exceeded my expectations of what a window manager could be.

08:41.560 --> 08:46.720
So I switched to Sawfish about 10 years ago and never looked back.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.720
Anybody in the mumble room using Sawfish?

08:49.720 --> 08:51.920
Never tried it over here.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.720
Nobody in the mumble room is using it either, Matt.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.720
Nobody.

08:54.720 --> 08:55.720
Never heard of it.

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
No, no.

08:56.720 --> 08:57.720
Been around for a while.

08:57.720 --> 08:58.720
But I just, I don't know.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.720
I'd have to...

08:59.720 --> 09:00.720
Makes me want to try it out, though.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.720
Yeah, I'd be curious to see what you could do with it.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.240
And I like that he's stuck with it for 10 years.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.720
Yeah, that's really says something, actually.

09:06.720 --> 09:07.720
Quick question.

09:07.720 --> 09:12.240
Wasn't Sawfish the window manager in older GNOME releases?

09:12.240 --> 09:16.240
Yeah, I was wondering about that too, actually.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.240
I wasn't sure.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.240
I didn't want to say anything.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.240
You know, I'm Googling it right now.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.240
Sawfish.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.240
I'm going to search for it right now.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
Window.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.240
Yeah, look at this.

09:25.240 --> 09:26.240
And look at this.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.240
This is the 1.x times.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.240
Yeah.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.240
Yes.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
Yeah, yeah.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.240
Yeah, yeah.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
That sounds right.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.240
Yeah, here's a screenshot of it, actually, on Wikipedia.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.240
Boy, that's pretty hardcore.

09:37.240 --> 09:38.240
Wow.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.240
Yeah.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.240
Well, I mean, you could...

09:40.240 --> 09:41.240
I think it was...

09:41.240 --> 09:42.240
More power to him.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.240
Wasn't it extensible with Lisp or something?

09:43.240 --> 09:44.240
Yeah.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.240
And yeah, he mentions...

09:45.240 --> 09:50.240
I think that was the scripting aspect to it.

09:50.240 --> 09:54.840
And he also mentions that all the key bindings are totally customizable too, which is kind

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
of cool.

09:55.840 --> 09:56.840
Yeah.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.840
I like that too.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.840
That's really funny though, looking at that.

09:58.840 --> 09:59.840
Huh.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
Yeah, I don't know.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.840
I mean, you know, a little comp file massaging, that's fine, but I don't really want to get

10:03.840 --> 10:04.840
into scripting something.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.840
So I don't know.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.840
Yeah.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.840
I'd have to try...

10:07.840 --> 10:08.840
I'd have to kind of weigh that out.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.840
Yeah.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.840
Yeah.

10:10.840 --> 10:11.840
Maybe on an older system, that'd be a great way on a...

10:11.840 --> 10:12.840
Yeah.

10:12.840 --> 10:13.840
On a resource.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.400
Or if you have a DigitalOcean droplet, which brings us to our first sponsor this week,

10:17.400 --> 10:18.400
DigitalOcean.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.440
And you know, I mentioned if you have a DigitalOcean droplet, I actually have a droplet up there

10:21.440 --> 10:27.200
that I've installed Exxon, and you're going to laugh at me, audience, but you got to understand

10:27.200 --> 10:28.200
the way I work.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.840
I even installed Chrome on my DigitalOcean droplet.

10:29.840 --> 10:34.800
I SSH in, I turn on compression and X11 14, and then I can manage all of my server side

10:34.800 --> 10:39.000
stuff just using local host, and I don't have to expose any of that stuff to the web.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.200
And that's just another layer of security for me.

10:41.200 --> 10:45.800
So for me, because I'm always on an X11 based system, well for now at least, I can SSH in.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.200
You guys know about SSH and X11 14.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.920
You use compression, it runs like a champ, and you can start Chrome up.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.800
And to be honest, I've actually had more success with Firefox.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.920
I've both of them installed.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.920
And Opera too.

10:56.920 --> 10:57.920
I have Opera installed.

10:57.920 --> 10:58.920
Hey, man.

10:58.920 --> 10:59.920
I can't help it.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.360
You know, Firefox runs really well under X11 14.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.720
Yeah, it does.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.080
It does work quite well, as a matter of fact.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.480
So there's a lot of options you could do with a DigitalOcean droplet.

11:09.480 --> 11:13.880
Go over to DigitalOcean.com and arm yourself with the knowledge of Unplug September.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.960
That's the promo code you're going to want to keep in mind as I tell you about DigitalOcean

11:16.960 --> 11:18.400
because it's going to get you a $10 credit.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.240
So what is DigitalOcean?

11:20.240 --> 11:23.760
It's a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
to spin up a cloud server.

11:24.760 --> 11:30.480
And users can create a cloud server in under 55 seconds or 25 seconds if you're our audience.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.600
And the pricing plans are incredible.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.680
They start only $5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM.

11:34.680 --> 11:40.440
That gets you also a 20 gigabyte hard drive, one blazing fast CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

11:40.440 --> 11:44.160
DigitalOcean also has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

11:44.160 --> 11:45.160
and London.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.920
The interface is simple and their control panel is crazy intuitive.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.880
But on top of all of that, they have an amazing straightforward simple API that you could

11:52.880 --> 11:55.920
just write your own scripts against or take advantage of any of the community applications

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
that are out there.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.480
There's plenty of them that you can get your hands on.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.640
They're really nice too because once you get a system spun up, you still have the option

12:01.640 --> 12:03.440
to do one click deployment of applications.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.440
You're like, oh, that's interesting.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.600
Yeah, they're going to use Docker to do some of that stuff.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.600
How cool is that?

12:07.600 --> 12:11.440
They're using KVM for the virtualization and they're sitting on top of those SSD drives

12:11.440 --> 12:15.400
and they work their butts off to make sure that they're at some of the best data centers

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
in the world.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.200
They just spun up a new one with IPv6 in New York.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.600
They got that new one in London.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.160
They're growing like crazy.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.640
Tons of you out there in the community have been trying out DigitalOcean because it works

12:23.640 --> 12:25.000
so many for you.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.060
That's why they invested in those SSD drives to get you that performance.

12:28.060 --> 12:31.780
That's why they use the amazing hardware all wrapped up in this incredible interface.

12:31.780 --> 12:35.320
They recognize that it takes all of that together to make an amazing product.

12:35.320 --> 12:40.000
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code unplugseptember.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.720
You get a $10 credit.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.560
You can try out the $5 rig that I've been getting a heck of a lot of use out of for

12:44.560 --> 12:47.240
two months for absolutely free.

12:47.240 --> 12:51.040
Digitalocean.com and the promo code unplugseptember.

12:51.040 --> 12:56.000
And a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Love my D.O.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Rufflets.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
I got multiple now.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.160
It's like phones up in here with me, Matt.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
It's like phones.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.520
Yeah, I think you've got me beat.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.000
I had like four of them at the peak.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
I dropped back to three.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.720
Well, actually looking at doing a fourth one again.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.200
Oh, what are you running on there?

13:08.200 --> 13:10.720
Are you doing WordPress?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.760
I'm actually doing more WordPress than anything.

13:12.760 --> 13:18.480
I'm still rocking BitTorrent Sync, this big thing for me.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.240
I do a lot of data back and forth.

13:21.240 --> 13:25.080
But WordPress, it's like it's the best WordPress experience I've ever had and I've had a lot

13:25.080 --> 13:26.080
of them.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.080
Same here.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.080
It's really, really smooth.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.080
Super fast.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.080
Love the setup.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.080
You control it from top to bottom.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.640
My wife, Angela, has been talking about how she kind of wants to get back into blogging

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
more regularly.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.200
And one of the things we're thinking about doing is we're looking at all the different

13:36.200 --> 13:41.200
options but definitely one of them on the list is just set up a WordPress site on a

13:41.200 --> 13:43.600
DigitalOcean droplet and she can manage it even.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.000
It's really straightforward.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It's kind of awesome.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I would recommend it.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
It's fast.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
It's just DIY.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
But it's also easy.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
It's really great.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah, absolutely.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Okay, Matt.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.860
So we've got a couple more emails we're going to get into.

13:54.860 --> 13:58.280
This next one came from Ryan and this is a topic I love.

13:58.280 --> 14:02.360
First of all, Ryan wants to know, just to clarify off the top, all he has to do to be

14:02.360 --> 14:05.480
a guest on the show is take a shower with me because apparently when Eric was here last

14:05.480 --> 14:11.720
week we implied that Eric took a shower with me so therefore he was allowed on the show.

14:11.720 --> 14:17.360
So Ryan, just to clarify, that only works under two circumstances.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.940
Number one, you're a lady.

14:18.940 --> 14:22.760
Number two, if you're not a lady, I'm really lonely that day.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.440
And then if you get me on the right day, you take a shower with me and I do have a shower

14:25.440 --> 14:27.480
here in the studio, I'll probably let you on air.

14:27.480 --> 14:32.280
I mean, you know, I'm a nice guy after all.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.280
So that happens.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.280
Hey, man.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.120
Just telling it like it is and Ryan wanted to know, I'm just here to help the people

14:38.120 --> 14:39.320
with the information they require.

14:39.320 --> 14:44.480
So he says he's been a listener for a while now and he wanted to get to his actual question,

14:44.480 --> 14:45.480
not just the shower question.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.120
He says, I'm relatively new to Linux.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.440
I tried to switch my five-year-old desktop last September but I had to switch it back

14:51.440 --> 14:54.160
to Windows for both game-related and school-related reasons.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.840
I recently bought a laptop with explicit intent of installing Ubuntu 14.04.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.000
It took about eight hours because it came pre-installed with Windows 8.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.120
Don't get me started on that OS or UEFI.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.520
But I got it loaded and it works beautifully.

15:06.520 --> 15:11.600
With the next six to eight months, I'm looking to get a refurbished desktop with a faster

15:11.600 --> 15:17.000
processor, more RAM slots, and the MMOs I want for it aren't friendly with Linux.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.400
So unfortunately, Windows 7 for that one.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.920
Once I get the second desktop, I'll be looking to repurpose my current desktop as a local

15:22.920 --> 15:28.880
file server for cohabitating my girlfriend and my files with a little backup action.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.920
She has a Windows-based PC, so we have a mixed OS environment.

15:31.920 --> 15:35.240
When I repurpose it, I plan on using Linux for this new machine.

15:35.240 --> 15:39.320
What would be your top choices for distros to use for a home file server?

15:39.320 --> 15:42.880
I'm going to set this up in VirtualBox on my laptop in the meantime so I can play around

15:42.880 --> 15:46.760
with it before I actually go into it and put it in production.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.720
Thanks for everything and I hope we had a great Labor Day.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.680
So I have a few suggestions.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.200
Matt, I'm sure you have a few.

15:52.200 --> 15:58.120
Anybody in the Mumber room have a home file server distro recommendation for our email

15:58.120 --> 16:02.240
Ryan here?

16:02.240 --> 16:03.240
Not really.

16:03.240 --> 16:12.200
It's not a Linux distro, but I can't speak of FreeNAS high enough.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.760
I run an OpenMedia file.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.040
Yeah, something's up, guys.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.040
No, go ahead.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.680
I was just seeing what else I was giving you guys a chance to say.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.680
So we've got OpenMedia, FreeNAS.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.640
Oh, sorry.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.640
What else?

16:28.640 --> 16:29.640
What else do we use?

16:29.640 --> 16:37.360
Well, I just use SFTP into an OpenSUSE server and that's how I get my stuff done.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.360
Matt, do you think...

16:38.360 --> 16:39.360
I mean, come on.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.360
Nobody's going to say Ubuntu LTS, right?

16:40.360 --> 16:41.360
Come on, right?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.080
But Matt, that makes a good home server.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.560
I think Ubuntu's good.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.300
I think anything Debian-based is certainly worthwhile.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.300
That's kind of my go-to thing.

16:48.300 --> 16:52.000
I think really moving more toward a Debian situation is just a comfortable place to be.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I like that.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.920
I think even if it's not Ubuntu, I think Debian's good.

16:54.920 --> 16:58.280
I also think OpenSUSE, like the Evergreen release, would be quite good.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.640
Wouldn't recommend Fedora.

16:59.640 --> 17:02.260
And if you're in the Red Hat camp, check out CentOS.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.760
That's also a pretty solid option to go.

17:04.760 --> 17:10.360
But like Wimpy says, OpenMedia Vault also a great opportunity to look into and one we're

17:10.360 --> 17:13.240
going to do a review on soon here on the show.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.240
Maybe we should do that next week.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.840
Those of you doing the OpenMedia Vault, would you be ready to do the review next week?

17:17.840 --> 17:18.840
Yep.

17:18.840 --> 17:19.840
Okay.

17:19.840 --> 17:20.840
Yep.

17:20.840 --> 17:21.840
Okay.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.840
So we'll do on Linux Unplugged next week, unless something changes, we'll have a review

17:23.840 --> 17:25.400
of OpenMedia Vault, Ryan.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.200
So that might help you as well.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.200
Okay.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.600
Last but not least, Sean writes in with the real cost of a MacBook.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.120
He says, I know I'm a little behind on this comment, but I just started looking to Linux

17:34.120 --> 17:37.260
within the past year and I came across Linux Action Show a few months ago and he's been

17:37.260 --> 17:38.260
catching up.

17:38.260 --> 17:41.400
I have a MacBook from the spring of 2008.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.360
It runs better than Windows was my thought when I bought it.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.200
Now my thought is I can only run up to 10.7 and that's as far as I can go?

17:49.200 --> 17:53.080
In fact, he's stuck at 10.68 right now because as some of you may or may not know, after

17:53.080 --> 17:58.720
a little while, Apple kind of discontinues support for these older MacBooks and they

17:58.720 --> 18:02.240
don't really allow you to install the newer OSs on them anymore after a point.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.360
He says, I tried running Linux distros on a VM in the MacBook, but it's slow and sketchy.

18:06.360 --> 18:10.160
So I know I'm stuck with it for a while, but I got a hold of a couple of old desktops and

18:10.160 --> 18:16.480
I've been running Ubuntu 14.4 and I want to set one up as a home server as well.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.480
So I've downloaded CentOS.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.640
Well, there you go.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.940
All that to say the inability to move forward without shelling out major cash for a new

18:21.940 --> 18:25.120
hardware has made me look back towards Linux.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.040
Also getting back into computers and I'm in the process of getting an A plus and looking

18:29.040 --> 18:30.040
at Linux 101 course.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.720
So he says, keep up the great work.

18:31.720 --> 18:36.880
Boy, isn't that true though about the MacBooks is like one of the things is you could throw

18:36.880 --> 18:39.880
Linux on there and probably get a couple more years out of that, right?

18:39.880 --> 18:44.780
I think that's really it because I think that really when you're in their own ecosystem,

18:44.780 --> 18:47.760
they set the rules, they set the pace and you're limited to whatever they want to do

18:47.760 --> 18:48.760
with you.

18:48.760 --> 18:54.000
They, for example, have a old power PC, a Mac mini that runs a Linux.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.200
And the reason why is because that's all you're going to do with it short of using it as a

18:57.200 --> 18:58.200
doorstop.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.240
It's not, it doesn't have any benefit in the OS 10 universe.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.240
So very good.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.240
Very good.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.240
All right.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.880
Well, uh, we have, uh, we, I, we're having some connection problems with Aaron, so, uh,

19:08.880 --> 19:10.520
we'll see if he's able to make it back on.

19:10.520 --> 19:11.520
Okay.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.520
Oh, I hope he can.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.960
If not, we'll still give him a good plug for his project he's working on cause it's pretty

19:14.960 --> 19:15.960
exciting.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.480
So, uh, what we'll do in the meantime as the guys work that out on the server end is I'll

19:19.480 --> 19:23.000
tell you a little bit about our next sponsor and that's Linux Academy.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.240
And Linux Academy is a great sponsor for the Linux Unplugged show because it's an opportunity

19:27.240 --> 19:32.480
for anyone in the audience that's learned on their own or like if you're like me, self-taught

19:32.480 --> 19:36.680
on the job, you'd be surprised going back and taking some of these fundamentals, how

19:36.680 --> 19:41.400
much little bits of details they'll fill in and, and in my case at least, I won't speak

19:41.400 --> 19:42.400
for you.

19:42.400 --> 19:48.160
In my case, I learned, oh, I could have been saving myself quite a bit of time if I had

19:48.160 --> 19:49.160
learned this the right way.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.120
You ever had that now where you're like, oh, I guess I could have done this a lot easier.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.880
I've been doing this the hard way the whole time.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.240
So I have that at least once a week.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.240
So yeah.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.120
So here's just a little friendly reminder from someone who's been in this position.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.200
Uh, maybe it's time to just check up on things.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.800
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.280
That's going to get you the summer of learning discount.

20:05.280 --> 20:10.160
You should go jump on that right now because it's a 33% off offer and Linux Academy is

20:10.160 --> 20:13.300
offering new content every single week, so you're going to want that sub.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.680
So what is Linux Academy?

20:14.680 --> 20:15.680
Let me tell you.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.960
It's kind of an awesome service created by Linux enthusiasts and educators who really

20:19.960 --> 20:22.960
wanted to put something together that Linux users could go to and know they're getting

20:22.960 --> 20:25.880
really good content from people who love Linux.

20:25.880 --> 20:30.640
They have step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, and each course,

20:30.640 --> 20:33.120
when you need it, comes with its own server, spins it right up.

20:33.120 --> 20:37.320
You can pick from seven plus Linux distributions and they'll automatically adjust the courseware

20:37.320 --> 20:39.140
to match the distribution you've picked.

20:39.140 --> 20:42.160
So if you're a Red Hat guy and you need to get in on a little bit of Debian, you can

20:42.160 --> 20:43.760
take care of that or vice versa.

20:43.760 --> 20:47.300
It's really kind of neat and I've heard from a lot of you out there who've tried this out

20:47.300 --> 20:50.880
and say, you know, you mentioned the downloadable comprehensive study guides.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.680
You didn't mention that was also video and audio that happens to work really well as

20:54.680 --> 20:58.740
a podcast or you forgot to sometimes mention they do live events so you can ask the educator

20:58.740 --> 21:00.520
directly when you've been taking courses.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.680
I love all of that, but me, I'm a recluse.

21:02.680 --> 21:06.160
I sit up in my, on my office late at night when I'm not sleeping very well or when I

21:06.160 --> 21:09.320
want to accomplish a little something, get a little intellectual stimulation, I bring

21:09.320 --> 21:12.800
up my Linux Academy dashboard, I look at how long a course is going to take me, and I just

21:12.800 --> 21:13.800
go to town on it.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.560
And sometimes that's a scenario where I'm building something from beginning to end on

21:16.560 --> 21:22.320
S3 using S3, EC2, all of the Amazon web services, or maybe it's something on a Linux box.

21:22.320 --> 21:26.600
It's maybe something using OpenStack because it's not something I've had a lot of in-production

21:26.600 --> 21:29.280
experience with, but I still want to talk about it from an educated standpoint.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.320
That's what I love about Linux Academy is they're constantly adding this new stuff that

21:32.320 --> 21:37.420
I can continue to test myself, see where I'm at, they give me progress reports, and I can

21:37.420 --> 21:41.160
also see if there's a new kind of technology that's coming up that interests me, that sort

21:41.160 --> 21:45.120
of excites me, because it's, sometimes you run the risk when you work on a particular

21:45.120 --> 21:47.080
area of getting a little stale.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.840
This is my opportunity to prevent that.

21:48.840 --> 21:53.280
Go over to LinuxAcademy.com, check out their OpenStack Essentials, it's now 100% complete

21:53.280 --> 21:54.840
with tons of content.

21:54.840 --> 21:59.640
Their AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Prep Course has over 14 hours of content that you

21:59.640 --> 22:00.640
can check out.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.680
I think it's a pretty neat system.

22:02.680 --> 22:05.760
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged to get that Summer of Learning discount.

22:05.760 --> 22:09.360
Go over there right now, let them know you appreciate them supporting the Linux Unplugged

22:09.360 --> 22:10.360
Show.

22:10.360 --> 22:15.000
That's LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, and a really big thank you to Linux Academy for

22:15.000 --> 22:18.880
sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.880
Check them out, guys.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.880
They're great.

22:20.880 --> 22:24.760
I don't see Aaron back just yet, so while we work on that, I got another topic, we can

22:24.760 --> 22:28.280
move to our next topic because this, we've actually got, we've got way more show than

22:28.280 --> 22:33.240
we can fit anyway, so either way, we're totally fine.

22:33.240 --> 22:36.880
The meta story we've been covering is, is it too late for the Linux desktop?

22:36.880 --> 22:40.760
We covered John C. Dvorak's trolling in the Linux Action Show, right?

22:40.760 --> 22:43.960
And then the week before, actually for the last couple weeks on Linux Unplugged, we've

22:43.960 --> 22:49.280
been talking about the perceived threat that the Mac desktop represents to the success

22:49.280 --> 22:50.960
for Linux on the desktop.

22:50.960 --> 22:57.160
Well, this past week, Linus Torvalds, your buddy and mine, was over at, he actually wasn't

22:57.160 --> 23:01.720
just over there, he lives in Portland, so it's not that far for him to go, but he was

23:01.720 --> 23:08.360
at the Deb Comp 14 in Portland, and Linus' style these days is to do more of a Q&A session

23:08.360 --> 23:13.320
than it is so much to go up there and do a big speech, and so he sat, and just kind of

23:13.320 --> 23:17.480
right off the top of his talk, started taking questions from the audience.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.200
It's kind of cool when he does that, too, because anything goes, right?

23:21.200 --> 23:25.020
And it's not like it's this pre-manicured experience where he's going to hit on these

23:25.020 --> 23:28.760
bullet points and go out there and give the Linux talking point speech and really pitch

23:28.760 --> 23:32.840
Linux to all of the people, he's just a guy going out there answering questions, and I

23:32.840 --> 23:34.160
love that about him.

23:34.160 --> 23:39.960
So the first question is the one we're going to start with today, and then we'll move into

23:39.960 --> 23:44.920
what the System D cabal is trying to do to address this, and I think it should be for

23:44.920 --> 23:45.920
an interesting discussion.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.040
So I'll start with Linus' question here.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.440
I think he's wrapping up a statement and then the question begins, and we'll let him go

23:50.440 --> 23:51.440
for a bit, it's a great talk.

23:51.440 --> 23:56.680
I have a really hard time just doing something else because that means I have to switch over

23:56.680 --> 24:05.680
all my kids' machines, my wife's machine, and that's just painful, so that's why.

24:05.680 --> 24:11.040
Okay, so this is a little difficult.

24:11.040 --> 24:15.320
I guess we're all, at least for me, I'm kind of wondering very much like I think you are

24:15.320 --> 24:21.080
lately, how to get to the year of the Linux desktop, if you will, right?

24:21.080 --> 24:24.360
And we'd all like it to be the year of the Debian desktop, if possible, and I'm trying

24:24.360 --> 24:29.640
to figure out if anything, if you have any insight as to possibly how to get closer towards

24:29.640 --> 24:30.640
that.

24:30.640 --> 24:36.400
So, I mean, there's a lot of things that are getting closer to that, and I think, I mean,

24:36.400 --> 24:41.520
people, technical people don't tend to use Chromebooks, but I think that Chromebooks

24:41.520 --> 24:47.540
are the kind of thing that will make the year of the desktop more possible, right?

24:47.540 --> 24:53.520
Because once people get used to running their applications basically as a browser, that

24:53.520 --> 24:56.040
makes a lot of things much easier.

24:56.040 --> 25:01.840
That said, let me go on my first rant of the evening, right?

25:01.840 --> 25:10.180
One of the problems desktop has, I mean, ignoring all the purely market and getting free installs

25:10.180 --> 25:17.200
and making it just so that normal people, and by normal people I mean obviously non-technical

25:17.200 --> 25:20.640
people will just buy a machine and it just works.

25:20.640 --> 25:28.720
One of the things that none of the distributions have ever gotten right is application packaging,

25:28.720 --> 25:30.280
right?

25:30.280 --> 25:36.800
And now somebody will say, hey, dpackage is way improved and much better than RPM, and

25:36.800 --> 25:39.280
that's not at all what I'm talking about.

25:39.280 --> 25:48.080
I'm talking about actual application writers that want to make a package of their application

25:48.080 --> 25:55.000
for Linux, and I've seen this firsthand with the other project I've been involved with,

25:55.000 --> 26:01.800
which is my dialogue application, right?

26:01.800 --> 26:06.120
We make binaries for Windows and OSX.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.560
We basically don't make binaries for Linux.

26:08.560 --> 26:09.560
Ouch.

26:09.560 --> 26:10.560
That's Linus.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.560
Ouch.

26:11.560 --> 26:12.560
Why?

26:12.560 --> 26:16.760
Because making binaries for Linux desktop applications is a major fucking pain in the

26:16.760 --> 26:18.560
ass, right?

26:18.560 --> 26:19.960
You don't make binaries for Linux.

26:19.960 --> 26:29.440
You make binaries for Fedora 19, Fedora 20, maybe there's even like rel 5 from ten years

26:29.440 --> 26:30.440
ago.

26:30.440 --> 26:36.040
You make binaries for Debian, well actually you don't make binaries for Debian stable

26:36.040 --> 26:41.520
because Debian stable has libraries that are so old that anything that was built in the

26:41.520 --> 26:44.240
last century doesn't work, right?

26:44.240 --> 26:54.320
But you might make binaries available for Debian whatever the code name is for unstable,

26:54.320 --> 27:01.000
and even that is a major pain because, Christ, we had this small local flame fest just a

27:01.000 --> 27:08.720
couple of days ago, Debian has these rules that you're supposed to use shared libraries,

27:08.720 --> 27:09.720
right?

27:09.720 --> 27:17.440
And if you don't use shared libraries, getting your package in, like, is just painful.

27:17.440 --> 27:23.720
But using shared libraries is not an option when the libraries are experimental and the

27:23.720 --> 27:27.560
libraries are used by two people and one of them is crazy.

27:27.560 --> 27:32.660
So every other day some ABI breaks, right?

27:32.660 --> 27:40.120
So you actually want to just compile one binary and have it work.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.800
Preferably forever.

27:41.800 --> 27:46.600
And preferably across all the Linux distributions.

27:46.600 --> 27:51.820
And I actually think distributions have done a horribly, horribly bad job.

27:51.820 --> 27:57.280
One of the things that I do in the kernel, and I have to fight this every single release

27:57.280 --> 28:02.680
and I think it's sad, we have one rule in the kernel.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.880
There is one rule.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.600
We don't break user space.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.480
Everything else is kind of a guideline.

28:08.480 --> 28:14.060
The whole security thing, it's a guideline that we shouldn't do stupid shit, right?

28:14.060 --> 28:15.800
But that's not a hard rule.

28:15.800 --> 28:17.080
People do stupid shit all the time.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.800
I don't get that upset.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.880
People break user space.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.800
I get really, really angry.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.760
This is something that is religious for me.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.680
You do not break user space.

28:27.680 --> 28:34.360
And even in the kernel, every single release I have people saying, okay, I'm changing this

28:34.360 --> 28:37.360
ABI because it's cleaning stuff up.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.520
And I'm like, no.

28:40.520 --> 28:45.480
You're not changing that ABI because I will crush you, right?

28:45.480 --> 28:46.800
All right.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.680
So I'll link to the rest of the talk.

28:48.680 --> 28:52.440
It's available in WebM if you'd like to watch the whole talk in its entirety.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.440
Obviously it's a good one.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.400
I mean, Linus, that's what he does now.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.440
I love his frankness about these matters.

28:58.440 --> 29:04.440
And I think it's so telling that Linus does not package his own application for the Linux

29:04.440 --> 29:05.440
desktop.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.640
He makes binaries for Windows and Mac OS 10.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.880
Tell me that doesn't sting.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.880
That's just wow.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.560
I mean, that's really telling.

29:13.560 --> 29:18.200
I think we could debate all day long if the system is broken or not or if it's technically

29:18.200 --> 29:19.960
feasible or not.

29:19.960 --> 29:25.440
But at the end of the day, when the creator of the fricking Linux kernel won't package

29:25.440 --> 29:30.600
his own software, I think that's an indication of a failure at some point in the system,

29:30.600 --> 29:31.600
right?

29:31.600 --> 29:33.640
I mean, I think it's, and I don't think like a small failure, right?

29:33.640 --> 29:34.920
I don't think it's like a small failure.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.280
I think it's kind of like a fundamental failure.

29:37.280 --> 29:38.280
Am I wrong?

29:38.280 --> 29:39.280
It seems like a big deal.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.760
He said it was a major pain.

29:40.760 --> 29:44.480
I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, the fact that someone comically earlier asked,

29:44.480 --> 29:46.320
Hey, is, you know, when's the year of the desktop coming?

29:46.320 --> 29:47.560
Um, well, there you go.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.720
I think these are things that still have to be overcome.

29:49.720 --> 29:50.720
Big time.

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
Right?

29:51.720 --> 29:52.720
I mean, okay.

29:52.720 --> 29:53.840
So is there a solution?

29:53.840 --> 29:57.360
In fact, we've had people write in, Matt, you might recall to the Linux action show

29:57.360 --> 29:59.120
and been like, guys, this is so frustrating.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.120
Is there ever going to be a solution?

30:00.120 --> 30:01.120
And I kind of joked.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.800
I said, huh, I wouldn't worry about it.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.520
I'm sure the system D guys will eventually come up with a universal package format for

30:07.520 --> 30:08.520
all.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.520
Well, guess what?

30:09.520 --> 30:10.520
Oh boy.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.520
Oh boy.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.520
What?

30:12.520 --> 30:13.520
Guess what?

30:13.520 --> 30:16.080
Uh, you might've heard of him.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.080
His name is Lenart.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.680
Uh, he, he's done, he's, he's been around.

30:19.680 --> 30:20.680
He's done a few things.

30:20.680 --> 30:25.560
Um, Avahi, you might be familiar with Avahi project is the, uh, auto DNS discovery.

30:25.560 --> 30:32.100
Uh, you could be familiar with pulse audio, perhaps, uh, you may have heard of the system

30:32.100 --> 30:33.100
D project.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.640
Uh, you might've be familiar with a company called Red Hat.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.800
These are all things that you might attribute to Lenart Pottering.

30:38.800 --> 30:45.320
Well, another thing you can contribute to Lenart is fundamentally attacking how we put

30:45.320 --> 30:52.800
together a Linux system, changing what defines a distribution forever.

30:52.800 --> 30:57.240
And the best part is it's all powered by butter FS.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.920
Of course it is.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.080
It's all powered by butter.

31:01.080 --> 31:03.040
I'm sure a little system D is in there too.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.960
It feels like a big Reddit meme, doesn't it?

31:04.960 --> 31:05.960
All right.

31:05.960 --> 31:09.640
Before we get into this, I can see the mumble room has a few things they want to talk about.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.280
Let's start with Fred and then we'll go to Wimpy.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.840
Fred, what are your thoughts thus far with that Linus talk and all of that?

31:14.840 --> 31:16.400
What are you thinking right now?

31:16.400 --> 31:17.400
Yeah.

31:17.400 --> 31:23.400
So, um, somebody asked him later in the talk, if you did watch till the end, uh, you know,

31:23.400 --> 31:28.360
uh, he, he built this sparse C front end and then he, to solve a problem.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.720
And then he built Git to solve a problem.

31:30.720 --> 31:35.760
And then now is he going to build some solution to solve that packaging problem?

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
Yeah.

31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
Yeah.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
And then he says, no, this is a hard problem.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.840
And I actually really do think it's a hard problem.

31:40.840 --> 31:41.840
Oh yeah.

31:41.840 --> 31:42.840
Oh yeah.

31:42.840 --> 31:43.840
Big time.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.080
It's hard because of packaging issues.

31:46.080 --> 31:51.000
It's hard because, um, I just, uh, so I thought up an example while you were playing, uh,

31:51.000 --> 31:56.400
the video, even containers, I don't think containers can even solve that problem.

31:56.400 --> 32:00.640
Let's talk about GTK and GTK themes.

32:00.640 --> 32:06.080
So now you have this settings application, which you can go in and choose your GTK theme,

32:06.080 --> 32:07.080
right?

32:07.080 --> 32:10.480
And this changes for all applications, right?

32:10.480 --> 32:14.560
So the theme, the same, all applications get the same theme.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
Yeah.

32:15.560 --> 32:21.320
So, um, now everybody's statically linking, which, uh, doesn't cause problems, but then

32:21.320 --> 32:27.600
now everybody is bundling up applications dynamically linked with GTK, but they're just

32:27.600 --> 32:33.160
in their own separate container or bundle or whatever you want to call them.

32:33.160 --> 32:41.200
Which configuration file do you use to set the theme, are they separate configuration

32:41.200 --> 32:42.200
files?

32:42.200 --> 32:51.120
Uh, do you have a separate configuration file for GTK 2 and 3 or for GTK 2.12 and 2.14 or

32:51.120 --> 32:52.120
for GTK 2.12.1.

32:52.120 --> 32:56.560
All of the things, all of the things, my friend.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
Yeah.

32:57.560 --> 33:02.600
But then you cannot add new settings or, you know, like add more features to the configuration

33:02.600 --> 33:04.880
files without breaking everything else.

33:04.880 --> 33:05.880
Yeah.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.200
Well, how do you do that?

33:08.200 --> 33:10.400
And this is a simple problem.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.440
That's not also not so important.

33:12.440 --> 33:16.820
Theming is not that important functionally speaking, but it's a very good example.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.400
It's a very good use case.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.400
Something that would drive me nuts.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.400
Yeah.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.400
All right.

33:21.400 --> 33:26.200
A few of us in the Mumble Room were talking about this, uh, yesterday, I think.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.200
Oh yeah.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.200
Okay, great.

33:28.200 --> 33:37.840
And in general, I am, I am very pro-System B. I like System B, and I don't mind that

33:37.840 --> 33:41.080
they've taken a lot of the little stuff.

33:41.080 --> 33:48.000
That being said, anything to do with package management and changing that scares me because

33:48.000 --> 33:53.260
one of the things I, my favorite things about Linux, the thing that I think sits at above

33:53.260 --> 33:55.960
every other operating system is its package management.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.960
And I'm not saying that this will screw it up.

33:57.960 --> 34:01.640
I'm just afraid this will screw it up, or at least screw it up for a little while like

34:01.640 --> 34:02.640
Pulse Audio did.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.420
Well, I'm going to get into how they're going to pull it off in a second from like a package

34:06.420 --> 34:09.680
management standpoint and things like that, but before we do, I wanted to give Wimpy a

34:09.680 --> 34:13.200
chance to jump in, then Daredevil, and then we'll get into the meat of what the system

34:13.200 --> 34:14.200
do you guys want to do.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.720
So Wimpy, uh, what are your thoughts at this point so far?

34:16.720 --> 34:17.720
Okay.

34:17.720 --> 34:23.160
Well, I read Leonard's post this morning, that was my morning reading, so I had some

34:23.160 --> 34:28.200
time to think about that on the commute into work and I read it again and had to think

34:28.200 --> 34:29.200
about it on the way home.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.920
Yeah, I read it twice too and I'm still thinking about it.

34:31.920 --> 34:37.800
I was going to say, I think, I think it needs a third read to really absorb it, but, um,

34:37.800 --> 34:44.400
I think he, he and his team are very good at tackling the tough problems in the Linux

34:44.400 --> 34:45.400
world.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.400
Yeah.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.400
Yeah.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.080
And what they've fleshed out, I really like.

34:50.080 --> 34:56.720
So I noticed somebody referred to it in one of the comments as, Oh, it's, it's complicated.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.960
And I don't think it's complicated.

34:58.960 --> 35:03.140
I think it's complex, but not complicated.

35:03.140 --> 35:10.000
And if, if you're a Python programmer, one of the edicts in the Zen of Python is, uh,

35:10.000 --> 35:14.360
uh, choose complex over complicated, and it is a difficult problem to solve.

35:14.360 --> 35:19.000
So there needs to be some complexity to it, but I really, I'm really quite enamored with

35:19.000 --> 35:21.480
the approach and I say, I say, bring it on.

35:21.480 --> 35:29.000
I'm really looking forward to a world in which we can isolate the user environment, the framework

35:29.000 --> 35:34.120
environment for the desktop and, and with the appropriate configuration and then keep

35:34.120 --> 35:36.080
the staple OS separate from that.

35:36.080 --> 35:38.000
I'm really excited by that.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.320
So I would, for those of you who haven't read this yet, I bet a lot of you are probably

35:41.320 --> 35:43.600
thinking, you know, this is, they're going to use Docker.

35:43.600 --> 35:48.960
This is going to, this is not what containers can play a role in this, but in a way it almost

35:48.960 --> 35:51.000
demotes everything to the same playing level.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.920
The, the, the base OS containers and VMs, uh, in some ways are, are, uh, from a file

35:56.920 --> 35:59.720
consistency standpoint are the playing fields a little more leveled.

35:59.720 --> 36:03.920
So essentially you could see why they want to do this and, and Lenart summarizes it very

36:03.920 --> 36:08.120
well and Wimpy, please feel free to jump in as, as, as I go over this, uh, he says, what

36:08.120 --> 36:12.040
we want to do is an efficient way for vendors to package their software, regardless of it's

36:12.040 --> 36:17.000
just an app or the entire operating system directly to the end user and know the precise

36:17.000 --> 36:20.800
combination of libraries and packages it will operate within.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.640
I, you know, if we were to ship a Jupiter broadcasting media player that just played

36:24.640 --> 36:28.880
Jupiter broadcasting content, was all themed up with our logo and stuff, I'd have no idea

36:28.880 --> 36:31.040
what video libraries you might have on your distro.

36:31.040 --> 36:34.480
So I would want a way to know what libraries would be used when I gave you the Jupiter

36:34.480 --> 36:35.480
broadcasting app.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.560
He says, we want to allow end users, uh, and administrators to install these packages on

36:39.560 --> 36:45.000
their system, regardless of which distribution they have it installed on.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.120
We want a unified solution that ultimately can cover updates for full systems, OS containers,

36:50.120 --> 36:53.800
like Docker, end user apps, programming, ABIs, and more.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.920
These updates shall be double buffered.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.680
And what he means by that is like, if you guys have ever had a motherboard that has

36:58.680 --> 37:03.240
two bioses or like the way the Mars Rover does updates, there's two computers and what

37:03.240 --> 37:04.520
you do one update.

37:04.520 --> 37:08.700
And then once you have a successful boot, then, you know, you update the second install.

37:08.700 --> 37:12.000
So you have it, it's the, or in, in actually in the case of their approach, you'd have

37:12.000 --> 37:14.640
infinite buffering depending on your free storage.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.540
But they say we want at least in the minimal double buffer.

37:17.540 --> 37:21.040
He says there's an absolute necessity if we want to prepare the ground for an operating

37:21.040 --> 37:25.600
systems that can manage themselves, that can update safely without administrator involvement

37:25.600 --> 37:32.000
a la core OS, or maybe some of the directions Fedora cloud wants to go in where yes, the

37:32.000 --> 37:35.960
server OS is rolling, but the applications are protected.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.900
He says we want our images to be trustable.

37:37.900 --> 37:42.080
Now this is one that might have some controversy because he means signed and he doesn't just

37:42.080 --> 37:46.480
mean like the application signs, they want a fully trustable OS starting to sound a

37:46.480 --> 37:50.640
little bit like Microsoft here with images that can be verified by a full trust chain

37:50.640 --> 37:56.200
from the firmware, meaning secure boot through the bootloader, through the kernel, all the

37:56.200 --> 38:00.720
way up to the init cryptographically secure verifications of the code we want to execute

38:00.720 --> 38:05.320
is relevant on the desktop, just like Chrome OS does now, but also for apps for embedded

38:05.320 --> 38:09.480
devices and on servers, particularly in a post Snowden world.

38:09.480 --> 38:15.360
So what they are proposing on how to accomplish this, it's amazing.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.040
It's essentially a scheme built around a variety of concepts that are available either today

38:19.040 --> 38:21.960
or hopefully soon in ButterFS.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.960
I want to caveat something here.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.320
Everything they're talking about in ButterFS is in a read only capacity.

38:27.320 --> 38:31.880
So you're not really talking about ButterFS manipulating live data to accomplish this

38:31.880 --> 38:36.180
so much as basing it off of snapshot of data and working from that snapshot of data.

38:36.180 --> 38:40.040
So before you get too ButterFS freaky, do keep that in mind, although you probably are

38:40.040 --> 38:41.920
legitimately concerned.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.000
So they want to use the ButterFS file system namespacing.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.720
There's a large number of features in ButterFS that neatly fit this concept today, he says,

38:48.720 --> 38:51.720
and maintainers are busy working on a couple of others they want to eventually make use

38:51.720 --> 38:52.720
of.

38:52.720 --> 38:57.960
As part of the proposal, they will make heavy usage of ButterFS's sub volume capabilities

38:57.960 --> 39:00.520
and introduce a clear naming scheme for them.

39:00.520 --> 39:06.200
So you would have a user file system with a vendor ID, the architecture like ARM or

39:06.200 --> 39:07.200
x86, and then the version.

39:07.200 --> 39:12.320
And these would be volumes that could be mounted and mapped to your file system like a drive.

39:12.320 --> 39:16.720
So when an application launches and it needs a particular version for a particular architecture,

39:16.720 --> 39:21.880
it thinks it's talking to slash opt slash proprietary garbage slash bin, when in reality

39:21.880 --> 39:27.680
it's actually in this deeper ButterFS sub volume that's been mapped to that location.

39:27.680 --> 39:31.280
Kind of a little bit like that distribution we talked about a little while ago that would

39:31.280 --> 39:34.840
let you run applications from any distro and do a whole bunch of cherooting on the background.

39:34.840 --> 39:35.840
Oh yes.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.520
Wimpy, am I getting everything right so far?

39:37.520 --> 39:40.760
Yeah, you've totally summarized that correctly.

39:40.760 --> 39:47.960
And they talk about how you wouldn't even necessarily have to have a ButterFS file system

39:47.960 --> 39:48.960
to do this.

39:48.960 --> 39:53.220
A lot of this functionality could be contained within a loopback device that is formatted

39:53.220 --> 39:54.220
with ButterFS.

39:54.220 --> 39:59.400
If you still wanted to use XFS or ZFS or Extended 4 for your primary file system, some of this

39:59.400 --> 40:03.480
functionality may be capable of, I bet that's limited, but I bet some of the functionality

40:03.480 --> 40:05.160
could work out of a loopback device.

40:05.160 --> 40:08.840
Here's a couple of things that are really, really, really, really interesting and would

40:08.840 --> 40:12.200
fundamentally change the way software is distributed on Linux.

40:12.200 --> 40:16.600
They are taking advantage of a feature built into ButterFS called Send and Receive.

40:16.600 --> 40:24.080
ZFS has something similar where you can take the blocks from your drive, from your storage

40:24.080 --> 40:29.800
device, and send them over the network, over an SSH connection, or over the SATA cable,

40:29.800 --> 40:36.120
and write those blocks to another storage device in another computer or on another drive.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.120
It's kind of cool.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.960
It's kind of crazy because you can just take the whole thing, suck it up and spit it on

40:39.960 --> 40:41.680
another machine, and write it all down there.

40:41.680 --> 40:45.280
Well, they want to use that same technology to distribute software, so it would be bit

40:45.280 --> 40:47.960
by bit exactly what you got.

40:47.960 --> 40:51.800
And using some of things like ButterFS's deduplication features and things like that, even though

40:51.800 --> 40:56.760
you'd have a lot of the same libraries, on the back end, ButterFS would be doing dedupe

40:56.760 --> 40:59.840
to clean it all up, and they would do Delta differentials too.

40:59.840 --> 41:03.280
So if you're doing a Send and Receive of a ButterFS file system, it would just be the

41:03.280 --> 41:04.360
bits you don't have.

41:04.360 --> 41:07.320
So you would essentially have some Delta capability there too.

41:07.320 --> 41:12.340
Now, they're also saying all of this doesn't even eliminate RPM or deb because the distro

41:12.340 --> 41:16.060
maintainers would still be building the distros with those tools.

41:16.060 --> 41:18.960
This would be more for the users.

41:18.960 --> 41:24.360
The users would stop using the package managers as much, and would use systems more like this.

41:24.360 --> 41:29.720
And they paint a scenario where you would have Gnome and LibreOffice and Firefox all

41:29.720 --> 41:34.840
doing this system, and it escalates from there.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.960
Any gaps you need to fill in there, Wimpy, you think?

41:36.960 --> 41:37.960
Yeah.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.920
I think one thing you've missed there is you mentioned LibreOffice and Firefox, but in

41:41.920 --> 41:47.560
this brave new world, you can have the last six versions of Firefox, and the last three

41:47.560 --> 41:53.560
versions of LibreOffice, and the beta release, and you can transparently switch between them.

41:53.560 --> 41:59.720
Yeah, and that's, I think, where people think it seems a little complex.

41:59.720 --> 42:05.400
And it is complex, but SystemD is already capable of doing some of those switching activities

42:05.400 --> 42:06.400
now.

42:06.400 --> 42:10.120
So this is building on what SystemD is already doing with its stateless booting and all that

42:10.120 --> 42:11.120
sort of stuff.

42:11.120 --> 42:14.540
And in this system, everything, as they're calling it, is double buffered, or really

42:14.540 --> 42:18.800
end-fold buffered, depending on your storage, because user and the runtimes and the frameworks

42:18.800 --> 42:22.060
and the app sub-volumes can exist in multiple versions.

42:22.060 --> 42:25.220
You could roll back after a bogus update.

42:25.220 --> 42:28.760
You could see how a rolling OS becomes a lot more reasonable because you could individually

42:28.760 --> 42:32.080
or completely roll back different components or all of the components.

42:32.080 --> 42:33.640
You're doing bit-by-bit transfers.

42:33.640 --> 42:37.960
Wimpy, what do you think of the method they're proposing for software installation?

42:37.960 --> 42:40.760
Does it blow your mind a little bit?

42:40.760 --> 42:46.240
It's a little bit different, but there are some parallels to the way that we do some

42:46.240 --> 42:48.000
things at work currently.

42:48.000 --> 42:52.320
So we work almost exclusively with Python at work.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.080
And if anyone out there is a Python developer, they've almost certainly come across Virtual

42:56.080 --> 43:03.080
Env, which is a way of isolating a Python runtime and then installing just the packages

43:03.080 --> 43:08.680
and tools that you need for your application into this sandboxed, isolated environment.

43:08.680 --> 43:13.880
And it means to say that you can keep that separate from the system and stop the system

43:13.880 --> 43:20.680
packaging from stepping on your applications and new libraries breaking your application.

43:20.680 --> 43:24.820
And it's more complex, but it's like that.

43:24.820 --> 43:28.280
It's like virtual environments, but for all of your partitions.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.280
Right.

43:29.280 --> 43:33.880
And in an example, Lenart says, I've got three vendor operating systems installed.

43:33.880 --> 43:37.400
He's got like, I think it was two Fedoras and Arch Linux.

43:37.400 --> 43:42.200
He's got KD and Gnome and the home directories are shared.

43:42.200 --> 43:48.640
And using these namespacing concepts in ButterFS, he's free to mix and match apps and OSs or

43:48.640 --> 43:52.720
develop against specific frameworks and specific versions on any operating system.

43:52.720 --> 43:56.600
It doesn't matter if you booted the Arch instance or the Fedora instance, he can execute both

43:56.600 --> 44:00.360
LibreOffice and Firefox just fine because the execution time gets matched up with the

44:00.360 --> 44:02.960
right runtime at launch time.

44:02.960 --> 44:05.520
And all of them are available for all the operating systems you have installed.

44:05.520 --> 44:09.600
Kind of, I mean, part of this... Yeah, go ahead.

44:09.600 --> 44:15.160
As a developer productivity tool, that's really powerful because right now, if I want to develop

44:15.160 --> 44:21.960
against the Marte 1.9 branch, for example, I need to boot into a virtual environment

44:21.960 --> 44:27.560
with all of that, a virtual machine with all of that stuff installed and develop that sort

44:27.560 --> 44:31.440
of separately from my main machine.

44:31.440 --> 44:37.200
But being able to step in and out of environments like that sort of at will is extremely powerful

44:37.200 --> 44:43.600
and could in some way sort of usher out the hypervisor world altogether.

44:43.600 --> 44:48.600
Yeah, and he also points out that one FAT binary, if you wanted to, could include all

44:48.600 --> 44:49.600
of the architecture.

44:49.600 --> 44:53.480
So, you could have, sort of like when the Mac was transitioning from PowerPC to Intel

44:53.480 --> 44:57.640
and you could run either the PowerPC code or the Intel code with one icon.

44:57.640 --> 44:59.920
He says the same thing could be possible with this.

44:59.920 --> 45:05.400
An installer image could include the Fedora version compiled for x86-64, one for i386,

45:05.400 --> 45:09.760
and one from ARM, all contained in the same ButterFS subvolume.

45:09.760 --> 45:13.680
And due to ButterFS's deduplication, they'll share as much of the code as possible.

45:13.680 --> 45:17.300
And when the image is booted up, the right subvolume is automatically picked based on

45:17.300 --> 45:19.720
what architecture the system has detected it's had.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.640
Yeah, brilliant, isn't it?

45:21.640 --> 45:26.200
And he says here in this new system, it would also make installations of operating systems

45:26.200 --> 45:28.240
much easier.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.120
You could do it manually, but you could also automate this.

45:30.120 --> 45:35.360
Here is the process to install a Linux distribution with this new ButterFS-inspired subvolume

45:35.360 --> 45:36.360
system.

45:36.360 --> 45:38.440
You would create a GPT partition table.

45:38.440 --> 45:42.940
You would add an EFI system partition to that partition table.

45:42.940 --> 45:45.780
You would create a ButterFS volume, obviously.

45:45.780 --> 45:49.080
You would deserialize, that's what they call when you write one of these volumes right

45:49.080 --> 45:50.080
to your hard drive.

45:50.080 --> 45:54.400
You would deserialize a single user subvolume into that ButterFS volume.

45:54.400 --> 45:58.520
You would install the bootloader into the EFI system partition, and then you boot the

45:58.520 --> 46:01.760
system, and it's done.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.320
There's got to be a downside to this, other than the complexity.

46:04.320 --> 46:08.640
And the other thing is, he says right in here, he's like, A, we recognize this would take

46:08.640 --> 46:10.460
a massive level of adoption.

46:10.460 --> 46:12.600
That's why we're putting it out there right now.

46:12.600 --> 46:16.540
And he says, we think this could also help us accomplish things like factory resets and

46:16.540 --> 46:21.580
power wash features where users could press a button and all of their data would be protected,

46:21.580 --> 46:24.800
all of their apps, everything they depend on, but everything could go right back to

46:24.800 --> 46:25.800
a default.

46:25.800 --> 46:28.560
That could be incredibly powerful for users.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.640
But they've got to get adoption, number one.

46:30.640 --> 46:34.400
They've got to make sure people are comfortable with ButterFS, number two.

46:34.400 --> 46:39.320
And the real question is, how irrelevant does this make a distribution's built-in package

46:39.320 --> 46:40.320
management tools?

46:40.320 --> 46:43.840
Because for some distributions, their package manager sort of defines them.

46:43.840 --> 46:48.320
You look at Arch or really even, you know, dev distributions.

46:48.320 --> 46:51.500
There's folks that will only use dev-based distributions.

46:51.500 --> 46:54.080
If you're an RPM-based distro, you're de-qualified.

46:54.080 --> 46:58.800
This would sort of nullify that differentiator, right?

46:58.800 --> 46:59.800
It could do.

46:59.800 --> 47:08.240
I mean, you could build your framework and application sub-volumes just by compiling

47:08.240 --> 47:11.840
and installing the code into them.

47:11.840 --> 47:15.640
And maybe that's the simpler way to do it, thinking about it.

47:15.640 --> 47:19.360
Maybe that reduces some steps and some overhead.

47:19.360 --> 47:22.880
So yeah, thinking about it, yeah, maybe it does kill off the package manager.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.600
But it doesn't necessarily mean you have to do that.

47:25.600 --> 47:31.040
There's still some value in being able to package things and install things in a reproducible

47:31.040 --> 47:32.040
way.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.040
Right.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.040
Yeah.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.040
And in fact, I want to talk about that in a second.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.680
Before we move to that aspect of it, does anybody else have any thoughts on...

47:37.680 --> 47:40.440
It's early days on this proposal, so I know a lot of you haven't chewed on it yet.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.480
We'll have a link to it in the show notes, too, if you guys want to read it all.

47:42.480 --> 47:45.840
But anybody else in the Mamba Room want to chime up before we jump to...

47:45.840 --> 47:46.840
Yes.

47:46.840 --> 47:47.840
Definitely.

47:47.840 --> 47:53.520
Definitely. So this is one of those things that I actually think...

47:53.520 --> 47:58.440
So far from the proposal, I can see the feasibility of implementing it.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.720
I can see the benefits of implementing it.

48:00.720 --> 48:06.280
But I think we're misleading a little bit on a couple of things that we gained from

48:06.280 --> 48:07.800
not doing that before.

48:07.800 --> 48:10.960
So one of the things is people are now statically linking.

48:10.960 --> 48:16.620
And the reason we weren't doing that is because there was this major benefit of updating the

48:16.620 --> 48:18.560
library and getting it all updated.

48:18.560 --> 48:24.840
Yes, it breaks packages and makes the distro and the package manager much more relevant.

48:24.840 --> 48:31.960
However, it does make our applications to be following the path of later security, the

48:31.960 --> 48:39.800
path of the latest upgrades that were made in technology, which is no longer true when

48:39.800 --> 48:43.000
you have these kind of hybrid system.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.160
The other thing that I also think that this can actually provoke is a situation where

48:47.160 --> 48:57.880
you start just bringing everything to a monolithic state, and you lose the distro variety.

48:57.880 --> 49:01.960
It's not really the software, it's not really the...

49:01.960 --> 49:06.960
I think it's the experience that developers from different distros are trying to convey

49:06.960 --> 49:07.960
to their users.

49:07.960 --> 49:14.200
And I think that might be harder to tackle that philosophical issue of getting people

49:14.200 --> 49:17.240
on adopting it than the technical sides of it.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.520
I agree, that could be a big issue.

49:19.520 --> 49:23.960
I understand why Linux is looking at it.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.320
I don't package for Linux.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.640
I mean, I developed the kernel.

49:26.640 --> 49:32.720
I want to use wherever my kernel runs, and that's why he looks at it that way and he's

49:32.720 --> 49:34.160
not packaging it.

49:34.160 --> 49:40.280
But to be honest and fair, I think this will eventually become something of the past and

49:40.280 --> 49:41.520
be simple.

49:41.520 --> 49:46.140
If you want to develop an application, you want to target your end users.

49:46.140 --> 49:49.680
Actually currently, if you're developing a server application, chances are you're developing

49:49.680 --> 49:52.840
for Red Hat, OpenSUSE, or something like it.

49:52.840 --> 49:57.640
And if you're trying to get to the end user, you're doing it for Ubuntu.

49:57.640 --> 49:58.640
And that's simple.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.720
You are focusing on an OS.

50:00.720 --> 50:01.720
For now.

50:01.720 --> 50:09.320
And having said that, the Docker idea is pretty cool and dandy, but you're just bringing all

50:09.320 --> 50:12.840
your baggage to the desktop of the user.

50:12.840 --> 50:16.880
And that's just assuming that our machines are ready to just take it all.

50:16.880 --> 50:19.400
And yes, we have the hardware right now.

50:19.400 --> 50:22.360
We didn't have in the past, but I think that's completely bloated.

50:22.360 --> 50:27.440
It can be fixed in tooling for developers, not necessarily on this.

50:27.440 --> 50:32.160
And to that point, the storage point, the chat room is mentioning, what about ButterFS

50:32.160 --> 50:33.160
storage limitations?

50:33.160 --> 50:36.880
I assume as this gets worked out, storage will go up and those things have to be worked

50:36.880 --> 50:37.880
out too.

50:37.880 --> 50:41.000
I know Heavens wants to jump in and bring this one home.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.360
And then we'll move on to, hey, while package managers are still relevant, there's some

50:44.360 --> 50:46.720
big changes coming that I want to talk about.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.560
But first, let's thank Ting.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.600
Go over to linux.ting.com right now.

50:50.600 --> 50:51.600
Everybody go there.

50:51.600 --> 50:52.600
Linux.ting.com.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.920
First of all, that'll put Linux in your history.

50:54.920 --> 50:55.920
Let's be honest.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.760
Let's put Linux in your browser history, because I know what else is in there.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.760
And it's not what you want in your history.

51:00.760 --> 51:01.760
Linux.ting.com.

51:01.760 --> 51:02.760
Go over there.

51:02.760 --> 51:05.160
That'll also get you a $25 discount off your first Ting device.

51:05.160 --> 51:08.440
If you've already got a Ting compatible device and you want to bring it with you, well then

51:08.440 --> 51:09.440
good news.

51:09.440 --> 51:11.840
They'll give you a $25 credit for a lot of you out there.

51:11.840 --> 51:13.160
That gets you more than your first month.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.260
So why Ting?

51:14.260 --> 51:16.300
It's mobile that is zero BS.

51:16.300 --> 51:17.960
You only pay for what you use.

51:17.960 --> 51:21.480
Ting takes your messages, your megabytes, your minutes, adds them all up at the end

51:21.480 --> 51:23.440
of the month, whatever bucket you fall into.

51:23.440 --> 51:24.440
That's what you pay.

51:24.440 --> 51:29.080
It's flat, $6 for the line, and your usage includes hotspot, tethering, picture message,

51:29.080 --> 51:33.960
caller ID, all the stuff, everything, all of the things, plus more, all controlled by

51:33.960 --> 51:35.360
an amazing dashboard.

51:35.360 --> 51:38.720
Ting gives you the controls you need to see exactly where your account's at.

51:38.720 --> 51:42.840
Maybe turn something off, turn something on, disable voicemail, enable voicemail, set up

51:42.840 --> 51:48.360
caller ID, disable caller ID, all those things exposed for you right there in a crazy easy

51:48.360 --> 51:49.360
to use interface.

51:49.360 --> 51:54.080
Go over to Linux.ting.com right now and you can check out there's Ting savings calculator.

51:54.080 --> 51:59.720
You put your current usage in that bad mama jam and not like what you pay, but your actual

51:59.720 --> 52:03.240
usage and just get an idea of what you'd save by switching to Ting.

52:03.240 --> 52:07.120
If you're listening to this right now between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. Eastern, why not try giving

52:07.120 --> 52:11.120
Ting a call, 1-855-TING-FTW, guess what?

52:11.120 --> 52:13.240
No hold customer service.

52:13.240 --> 52:16.540
They'll answer your questions right then and there on the spot.

52:16.540 --> 52:17.720
It's kind of incredible.

52:17.720 --> 52:21.720
And if you want to sort of charge up your Ting device, if you're a recent Ting customer,

52:21.720 --> 52:27.560
they just posted a great top five app pick from one of the Ting associates, Ben, and

52:27.560 --> 52:30.000
he talks about some of his favorite apps for Android.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.440
He's got Waze on there and a couple of others for those of you in relationships or not in

52:34.440 --> 52:38.040
relationships too or that one which might break up a relationship.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.600
He's got a whole list over there on the Ting blog.

52:39.600 --> 52:42.480
You can go over to Ting.com slash blog, but do me a favor.

52:42.480 --> 52:44.440
Start by going to Linux.ting.com.

52:44.440 --> 52:46.040
Linux.ting.com.

52:46.040 --> 52:47.040
Go grab a device.

52:47.040 --> 52:50.640
I've got the Nexus 5 on Ting right now and I got multi-ROM on there.

52:50.640 --> 52:56.520
Rekai did and I've got Sailfish OS on that, badmama jamma, Firefox OS on that guy, Ubuntu,

52:56.520 --> 52:59.560
Touch and Android L all on the Ting system.

52:59.560 --> 53:03.600
It's cool because there's also other Ting customers who are doing the same thing and

53:03.600 --> 53:05.960
every now and then I chat with them in the Ting forums.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.760
Yeah, Ting has forums too.

53:07.760 --> 53:11.260
They have a great community where people are trying out stuff all the time, always pushing

53:11.260 --> 53:12.260
the envelope.

53:12.260 --> 53:13.600
Linux.ting.com.

53:13.600 --> 53:17.300
Go find out why so many of you out there have switched over to Ting and been super happy.

53:17.300 --> 53:20.880
You might just save enough money to buy a new laptop every couple of years.

53:20.880 --> 53:25.160
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

53:25.160 --> 53:29.440
All right, heavens, did you want to jump in before we moved off of the new universal package

53:29.440 --> 53:32.880
format that's going to save all of us proposed by Lenart and the system decabal?

53:32.880 --> 53:34.440
Oh, may I?

53:34.440 --> 53:36.080
Yes, sir, you may.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.360
All right.

53:37.360 --> 53:38.840
Sounds wonderful.

53:38.840 --> 53:46.560
Well, anyway, this is, okay, what happens if this wasn't from Lenart?

53:46.560 --> 53:50.080
Would people be more accepting of it or not?

53:50.080 --> 53:51.640
I would actually be more skeptical.

53:51.640 --> 53:52.640
Yes.

53:52.640 --> 53:53.640
Yes.

53:53.640 --> 53:59.700
Well, that too, but there is another situation here which, okay, most of the time or way

53:59.700 --> 54:05.680
back when system D was just coming out, we were saying there is a future here of Linux

54:05.680 --> 54:11.500
that we are going to come to that we have never seen before and guess what?

54:11.500 --> 54:18.000
This is one of those side effects that the creation of system D has spawned.

54:18.000 --> 54:24.040
It's actually one of those future things that we pretty much need because, what, libraries?

54:24.040 --> 54:29.680
That's a figment of our GCC linking past just because we need to statically or dynamically

54:29.680 --> 54:32.460
link to a certain library in the system.

54:32.460 --> 54:35.300
That's pretty much GCC's legacy.

54:35.300 --> 54:41.040
Just as rolling distributions and statically released distributions, this Lackware model

54:41.040 --> 54:45.280
versus the rolling model, I think those are a figment of the past.

54:45.280 --> 54:51.320
This is a very good headway into our future when it comes to partitioning the system.

54:51.320 --> 54:56.540
Even though I'm not very much of a big fan of this butter FS, it just so happens to provide

54:56.540 --> 55:02.360
the technology required in order to make this feasible or at least not insane.

55:02.360 --> 55:04.880
Yeah, I agree there.

55:04.880 --> 55:08.360
It does seem like it is a glimpse of the future that kind of has to come and Crossroads-

55:08.360 --> 55:09.360
And we know.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.360
Oh, go ahead.

55:10.360 --> 55:16.720
It's really, well, yes, because Lenart, he has the overview of the system which none

55:16.720 --> 55:21.480
of us have ever seen before because this is the future which we are coming to.

55:21.480 --> 55:24.280
No one has seen the abstraction level that he has.

55:24.280 --> 55:25.680
He is at that point.

55:25.680 --> 55:31.440
He's the epitome of where he sees all these distributions and all their problems.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.540
He's the person at the forefront.

55:33.540 --> 55:41.160
If he can see all these little weird discrepancies and can have a reasonable way or at least

55:41.160 --> 55:47.760
an idea on how to bring us forward, he's in a pretty good position when it comes to his

55:47.760 --> 55:52.920
position, where he is and what he sees to propose something like this.

55:52.920 --> 55:53.920
All right.

55:53.920 --> 55:56.760
So I want to give Crossroads a chance to chime in because he's been waiting.

55:56.760 --> 56:01.500
Crossroads 2 though, isn't this kind of a big win for Red Hat if all distributions are

56:01.500 --> 56:05.480
more like Red Hat, then Red Hat wins?

56:05.480 --> 56:13.120
I don't know about that, however, I think we can all acknowledge that this is an issue,

56:13.120 --> 56:19.080
that developing software for Linux is more difficult because of Linux's variety.

56:19.080 --> 56:22.600
I think we can all recognize that that's an issue.

56:22.600 --> 56:27.040
Once we realize it's an issue, we have to think who can solve this?

56:27.040 --> 56:32.480
In the Linux community, what in the Linux community can solve this?

56:32.480 --> 56:37.720
Systemd I think is the only thing that can because with the exception of Gentoo and Crux

56:37.720 --> 56:43.440
and a few of those other things, Systemd is on every Linux distribution, is or will be,

56:43.440 --> 56:45.200
on every Linux distribution.

56:45.200 --> 56:50.120
So if there's going to be one thing that can unite the package management of every Linux

56:50.120 --> 56:53.160
distribution, it has to be Systemd.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.720
Yeah, I agree.

56:54.720 --> 56:59.000
I know that's why I made that joke a few weeks ago in Linux Action Show, it's going to almost

56:59.000 --> 57:01.240
have to be.

57:01.240 --> 57:05.520
And you almost have to have a company that has some real reason to put that much effort

57:05.520 --> 57:08.560
into the game, and I think Red Hat is that company.

57:08.560 --> 57:12.300
Wimpy, I know you wanted to kind of, did you want to touch on anything else before we wrap

57:12.300 --> 57:13.300
up on the topic?

57:13.300 --> 57:18.520
Yeah, I think Crossroads and Heaven's Revenge have totally hit on the right point here.

57:18.520 --> 57:24.760
For decades, Linux has often been described as a Unix-like operating system.

57:24.760 --> 57:26.880
It was neither one thing nor the other.

57:26.880 --> 57:33.120
It wasn't, I mean, when I worked at Sun Microsystems, we used to joke that it was Solaris for a

57:33.120 --> 57:35.360
pro and Linux for show.

57:35.360 --> 57:36.360
Oh.

57:36.360 --> 57:38.400
Yeah, oh, indeed.

57:38.400 --> 57:43.280
And I think that what Systemd is doing is it's very clearly setting out the future of

57:43.280 --> 57:51.640
Linux and it's giving Linux its own identity for the first time, a distro agnostic identity.

57:51.640 --> 57:57.600
And Linux and Systemd are going to be the future of our platform, and I think people

57:57.600 --> 58:03.520
are either going to have to choose to adopt it and learn it and like it.

58:03.520 --> 58:05.840
And maybe now ButterFS is in that.

58:05.840 --> 58:06.840
Yeah, definitely.

58:06.840 --> 58:12.480
But I mean, I've said that despite ButterFS's foibles, I do use it on my root file system.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.760
Yeah, that's why I've been using it too.

58:13.760 --> 58:16.000
I felt like this was coming too.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.960
Linux has to have a file system with these capabilities, and this entire initiative gives

58:19.960 --> 58:24.720
you some insight as to why it's necessary to have functionality like this to have an

58:24.720 --> 58:29.840
operating system to overcome these limitations, despite its problems.

58:29.840 --> 58:35.760
Yeah, and I think the only question that leaves to be debated is do we continue calling it

58:35.760 --> 58:40.760
GNU slash Linux or Systemd slash Linux in the future?

58:40.760 --> 58:41.760
Ouch.

58:41.760 --> 58:42.760
Wow.

58:42.760 --> 58:45.240
We'll wrap the discussion there on that.

58:45.240 --> 58:46.240
We'll talk some more.

58:46.240 --> 58:47.600
I know Fred's got some stuff he wants to chime in on.

58:47.600 --> 58:50.840
We'll do that in the post show, but the show's gone long, even though we didn't get a chance

58:50.840 --> 58:54.040
to get Aaron in or the DNF discussion.

58:54.040 --> 58:57.240
And Eric's been looking at DNF too, so maybe we'll just bust that into its own segment

58:57.240 --> 59:01.200
next week and talk about Fedora's new package manager, because we've got to call it right

59:01.200 --> 59:03.000
there because I've got to get home.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.920
But a fascinating conversation.

59:04.920 --> 59:07.360
If you're curious, go read Lenard's post.

59:07.360 --> 59:11.120
He wants as many people talking about it as possible right now because I think he acknowledges

59:11.120 --> 59:16.120
to make this work, to make this successful, it's got to have huge community adoption.

59:16.120 --> 59:17.120
Buy off.

59:17.120 --> 59:19.200
You thought Systemd had to have big buy off?

59:19.200 --> 59:20.200
No.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
No.

59:21.200 --> 59:22.200
I mean, this is right.

59:22.200 --> 59:23.200
I mean, think about this, Matt.

59:23.200 --> 59:27.520
Universal package management using the file system across every Linux distribution.

59:27.520 --> 59:31.960
You just have to have ButterFS support and this version of Linux kernel.

59:31.960 --> 59:32.960
I mean, that's the biggest change ever.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.320
It sounds awesome, but there's huge changes.

59:35.320 --> 59:39.320
I mean, it's absolutely mountain moving, and it's one of those things to where you can look

59:39.320 --> 59:42.280
at it seven days from Sunday, and you think you got it all figured out, and then you're

59:42.280 --> 59:43.280
thinking, oh, wait.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
What if you do that, though?

59:44.280 --> 59:45.280
Yeah.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.280
What if you do that other thing?

59:46.280 --> 59:47.280
Yeah.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.280
There's so many things.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.280
How will it work on mobile devices?

59:49.280 --> 59:50.280
How will it work on embedded systems?

59:50.280 --> 59:51.280
Exactly.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.280
All these kinds of questions.

59:52.280 --> 59:54.840
How will we distribute software to switches running Linux now?

59:54.840 --> 59:55.840
Yeah.

59:55.840 --> 59:59.560
It's fascinating, and it's going to be one I think we will probably track for a while

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.440
as it sort of develops and grows.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.420
And we'll be curious to see, A, if it makes it, and B, how much it changes from this point.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.200
But I think tonight I'm going to give it another read.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.240
I've got it saved up to Instapaper, and I'm going to give it a go through.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.360
But Matt, guess what?

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.480
That brings us to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.120
Now, I don't know exactly what we've got scheduled for Sunday.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.080
I'm waiting to hear back from a guest, but I already have kind of like a let's get serious

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.040
about A, productivity under Linux, but B, how to take the Chromebook and actually make

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.760
all these Chromebooks that are coming out right now a drop-dead awesome Linux experience.

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:34.280
Not a second-class experience, but an awesome experience.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
How to do that.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.920
I might cover some of that on the Linux Action Show.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.080
We've got a whole range of topics, so Matt, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.080
All right.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.080
See you then.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080
All right, everyone.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.200
Well, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.200
Don't forget us.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.200
Join us live.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.240
We'd love to have you here on a Tuesday over at jblive.tv, jupyterbroadcasting.com, slash

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.760
calendar to get in your local time zone, and jupyterbroadcasting.com, slash contact to

01:00:54.760 --> 01:01:00.360
send in your contact info, and jupyterbroadcasting, or also our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360
is a great place to go.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360
All right, everyone.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.920
Well, if we don't see you on Sunday for the Linux Action Show, I hope we'll see you right

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:25.800
back here next Tuesday.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.720
And Fred, why don't you, in the post-show now, get a chance to jump in with what you

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.680
were going to say, because I know you were mentioning you're seeing some problems if

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.000
the distribution's kind of normalized out.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Yeah.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.160
First of all, you shouldn't feel that bad.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.120
I mean, you have to run the show, and for me, it's really no problem if I don't get

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120
to speak.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:02:00.760
So, first of all, I'd like to say something about Linux, or at least how I see the whole

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.360
distribution thing, you know, spanning out.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.960
So essentially, it's free software and open source is an evolutionary type of thing, yeah?

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.040
So made the best win, yeah?

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:17.920
And distribution's essentially branched off to solve different kinds of problems, to sort

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.200
of even solve the same problems in different kinds of ways.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.720
And it's time to converge back by taking the best of each, right?

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:33.920
So you know, it's really not a problem if they all just converge back, right, into a

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.160
single system.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.160
It's actually a good thing, because we get the best of each of them.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.160
That's a good perspective.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160
I like that.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.160
Yeah.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.280
I actually think it's like the natural course of things, right?

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.200
It is the sort of organic evolution that open source seems to take, where it sort of forks

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.200
out the strongest survive, and then it gets reincorporated, and we kind of focus on that

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.200
thing.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.200
Exactly.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200
Exactly.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:01.320
And also, on that point, you have so much of the differentiation between the different

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.960
distributions is the low-level plumbing that defines them.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.800
So ultimately, it's the package manager and the release cycle.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:15.720
If you take package management and release cycles out of the equation, and Upstream is

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:24.680
now responsible for distributing their binary subvolume, the distributions are going to

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:30.960
have to focus on the end user experience to differentiate from one another, rather than

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.320
technical masturbation.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.320
Yeah.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.320
Yeah.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.320
And philosophy and things like that.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.240
Oh, I wanted to give, before we go too far there, I meant to give a quick plug to Aaron

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:40.240
Saigo.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.240
He has a Patreon page up.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:48.200
He is bringing back Illumination of Free Software, kind of like a talk show discussion show.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.400
He's going to have it structured.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.400
He's looking for backers.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:57.000
You can go to patreon.com slash L-O-F-S, and I'm a backer, and he's got a video up there

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.880
talking about what he wants to do.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.160
And we talk a lot about getting good open source coverage, and I think the thing about

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:10.640
a Patreon campaign, just like a Kickstarter, you can back a Kickstarter and get absolutely

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.160
nothing, or you can back a Kickstarter and actually get the product, and I think it depends

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.720
on who's running the project.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.360
I think if anybody's going to be able to pull it off, it's Aaron.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.160
I think if he sees success with it, he'll keep at it.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:24.040
So go over to patreon.com slash L-O-F-S, and kick him a few over on Patreon if you want

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.040
to.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:26.040
I wanted to give him a plug for that.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.200
In other words, we're going to have him on the show, but we had some mumble connection

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.200
problems.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.200
Okay.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.040
So what about the fact that this is powered by ButterFS?

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.840
That does seem to be the elephant in the room that we're just kind of glossing over.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.840
Yes.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.840
Sorry, Fred.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.840
Go on.

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:50.560
No, I have a much bigger problem here, and so Leonard is the guy who should be doing

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560
this.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560
I absolutely agree.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:02.040
I think he has the view and everything, but the problems he tackles usually, they're quite

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040
big.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040
They're complex.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:11.580
They're made of many small parts, and he has always a grand vision, but never a stepwise

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.720
vision for solving something.

01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.180
He never gave out like, okay, now we're solving this little piece, and then that little piece

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:21.960
on top of that, and so on.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.840
He just goes out and says, I'm groundbreaking.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.960
I'm changing everything, and it's good for everybody.

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.280
Might be good for some people, might not be good for some people.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:38.040
Until this day, I've been running Arch with systemd on my laptop, and I have some serious

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.040
problems because I encrypt, so I raid my encrypted partitions.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:49.800
I don't encrypt my raided partitions, and systemd does not handle that properly.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:54.400
So there are special cases where, sorry?

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:58.760
It actually does if you handle the dependencies correctly for your file system startup, if

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:08.160
systemd is in your init read, although I don't think Arch has systemd in the init read.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.440
So I've read quite a bit.

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:16.760
I have went on the systemd IRC channel asking, I've read a lot of the documentation.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.400
My system starts up fine.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.960
It does not shut down properly.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:26.660
And then actually for debugging shutdown, by the way, I have to log to a text file.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:30.160
So I'm back to CSV init style of logging.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.400
I cannot use journal CTL for some reason, this journal D stuff.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.400
So there is a huge fuss, and then there is this one corner case that maybe somebody did

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:45.560
or didn't think about, and that he didn't manage to cover or systemd didn't manage to

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.400
cover or think about it somehow.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.920
And this is the kind of problem we have in today's technology.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:57.200
And Linux is going to turn into Windows if we keep doing this stuff.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.200
Windows works fine.

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.200
No, I'm serious.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.200
I'm serious.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.680
Because Windows works fine for the general case, not for the corner cases, right?

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:13.520
And this is why Linux was so flexible and susceptible on a use case basis.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:16.160
That's why it worked fine for so many technical people.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.720
But if we're going to keep skipping those, skipping that, we're really going to end up

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720
quite badly.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:28.160
I also, I think I want to, you know, blackout24 in the chat room brings a good point that

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.920
it's not just a Lennart effort.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:34.560
I think he's the name that has clicked the most with everybody because it does add some

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.720
credibility to the effort in a sense.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:43.280
But I don't want to, but I guess I don't want to over-cult a personality, this thing, too,

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.280
because it is not just his thing.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.200
However, let's not kid ourselves, he will become, if it's successful, he'll have to

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.400
become the figurehead of this, and it will become Lennart's baby.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.520
Well, he's done it before, he might be able to do it again.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.880
Well, he's just, simply put, he's one of the most followed online.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.840
He's one of the most well-spoken from like a, he'll come at you with a technical rebuttal

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.540
that is both scathing but yet also technically accurate, so therefore hard to quibble with.

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.680
He's really good at that, and he's got the name brand.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:20.080
So I mean, this is not a Lennart quote-unquote initiative, but I think by the end of it,

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080
it'll look like one.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080
Well, you know-

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.080
A lot of the time.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.080
Go ahead.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.040
I just think this trend continues forward is that we keep seeing innovation starting

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:34.640
around the Red Hat Fedora-type people like Lennart.

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:40.080
So I just wanted to point that out, that's pretty interesting.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.400
I wonder if our pace of development is getting a little bit too quick in a way that scares

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.880
most of our technical users now.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.120
Oh, one Linux that fits all is not bad.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.120
I'd say-

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.480
Well, you know, that's the thing that we have.

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:55.520
Our problem that we have so far is our variety.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.860
A lot of people bitch about there's too much choice in Linux.

01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:01.480
This helps, you know, unify.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.480
Just choose a district.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.480
A lot of people just like the village.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.440
I mean, I think part of the problem, I think we are part of the problem each time that

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.480
we go and we say we're using Linux.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.440
I mean, seriously, I'm not coming for the GNU plus Linux thing.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:18.280
I'm just saying you use a distribution and the distribution represents a whole set of

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.600
things, not only the kernel, they could actually change.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:23.880
That shouldn't matter to you.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:28.560
When you're using your computer, like for us technical people, yes, we care about it,

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:34.120
but let's face it, a regular user comes to the desktop and he doesn't know or care about

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.440
what kernel is in there, what is going on on the background.

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:41.320
If it's called Unity, if it's called Gnome, they don't care.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.320
They care.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.440
It works for them and that's the experience they want and that experience is under a name

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.280
of the distribution.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:56.120
That's the name you go for and if you do that, a lot of the issues of, oh, it's so fragmented,

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.420
just don't exist.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.720
That exists for us.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:03.520
We like to bitch about it, but let's face it, the user doesn't care.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.960
The user just wants it to work.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:11.920
Also, if we don't allow for change, if we don't allow for innovation, we can't move

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.920
forward.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.920
Of course, but just a minute.

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:19.800
Let's turn off distro so it can always happen.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:25.340
He can do it in the distro he's on and if people in there like it, some people like

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:31.840
everything else, when it proves useful and it proves to be worthy, it appears on others'

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:32.840
distros.

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.840
It can work.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.840
Yes.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.840
Thank you.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.840
Thank you.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.440
I'm trying to avoid the whole celebrity hacking topic because it's funny, not to even get

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.760
into the body parts aspect of the celebrity hacking, but I feel like so much of what we've

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.640
been talking about, building your own cloud, Team Fortress Chris or going with own cloud

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:56.560
or SyncThing or BitTorrent Sync and all of the encryption and all of this stuff and then

01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.880
you just have this huge story that drops, this sort of the personification of all of

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.560
the stuff that we've been a little worried about, people have been a little nervous about

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.840
and it has flavors.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.640
If you zoom out and look at the meta story, it has flavors of NSA spying and now it's

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.640
a new angle.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.640
Look at that.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.920
It has flavors of personal privacy and protection.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:18.200
It has flavors of controlling your own data.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:22.280
It has flavors of what the responsibility of these new corporate overlords that are

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:26.160
sort of forcing you into these new systems and these new ecosystems that just do this

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.560
stuff for you and at the same time, one of their marketing messages is, don't worry about

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.680
how it works.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.880
That's the selling point.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.000
You never have to think about it, which then encourages exactly these kinds of things to

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.800
happen.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.280
So I think it's a huge meta story.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:46.800
So yes, there's girly parts that are involved and of course, there has to be that adolescent

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.280
aspect to it that sort of gives it the traction, but I think when you take that away from it

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.280
and look at more of the violation and privacy aspect of it and the implications that this,

01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:00.440
I mean, this is happening to very public figures and so the reaction is very public and a lot

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.480
of people are talking about it and a lot are aware of it, but I was just saying a little

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:09.160
while ago that if you actually follow the news on this kind of stuff, this kind of thing

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:14.020
happens almost on a weekly basis on a much smaller scale and usually it involves kids

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:18.040
and it involves a high school and the shaming of someone and then that someone either sometimes

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:21.160
gets suicidal or they have to leave the school.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:28.440
There is a very real life aspect to this story and I think sometimes when we start talking

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.640
about it from a technical aspect, we'll talk about it from a, oh, well, they need local

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:37.400
encryption or we need transparency or the solution is open source code that can be publicly

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:43.080
audited, but we forget about the fact that on a much smaller scale and probably realistic

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.720
on a daily basis really, if you think about the amount of devices around the world that

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.060
are out there that this kind of stuff happens on, there is probably these kinds of violations

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:55.360
going on almost daily, but this story has given us the opportunity to actually stop

01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:01.440
and think about it because it involves people with names we know and faces we recognize.

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:11.120
Although these women have had an egregious privacy breach for which there is no apology

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:16.480
by anybody, I'm not so sure they were the target of this.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:22.520
Do you not think that Apple were actually the target of this in that this is, the timing

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.920
of this seems to be very precise?

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.680
Oh, snaps, look at you wimpy busting out the conspiracy bacon, very nice, sir, very nice.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.680
Where's this bacon from?

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:40.520
Well, okay, so they're about to have their big unveil, this is Apple's time of the year.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.920
They're going to introduce a new payment system supposedly partnered with Visa, MasterCard

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:50.640
and American Express, right, built on NFC, probably connected to your iTunes account,

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640
I'm sure.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:58.320
Yeah, and you look at the scale of what was disclosed improperly, this wasn't something

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:01.640
that just happened overnight, this must have taken weeks of planning.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.640
Yeah, I agree, I agree.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:08.520
So I think that the timing of this is very deliberate and I think it's designed to embarrass

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:09.600
Apple.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.040
So it definitely accomplishes those things, it publicly shames famous people for using

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.160
iProducts, which is something that, you know, it's one of these things where you'll see

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.800
like Samsung will pay a celebrity to take a selfie and like Ellen, for example, she'll

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.480
be out on stage, she'll take a selfie with the Samsung camera and then she goes backstage

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:30.520
and tweets about it on her iPhone and that drives people crazy.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.720
So wimpy, are you implying then that this was orchestrated by someone?

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.760
Well, I don't know who it might have been orchestrated by, but I'm wondering if the

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:47.480
motivations of the individuals behind it was to sort of slander Apple and use some salacious

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.360
means in order to accomplish that.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.480
Maybe it was an activist that wanted to derail the centralization of the payment system,

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:55.480
right?

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.040
Maybe it was like...

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:03.400
Possibly that or possibly it's just simpler, I don't like Apple and I'm going to, you know,

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:11.040
show them in a bad light because I want product X to win, you know, the mobile wars.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:16.440
I'm watching a video of my daughter right now on the baby monitor at home.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:21.280
I think that bacon was brought to you from Frank's meat market in Black Diamond, Washington.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.280
Ha ha.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.280
Oh, man.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:32.960
Well, yeah, I think that reasoning about us as activists or just a few people because

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:39.600
the nature of the simplicity of the brute force and it doesn't look like there's been

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.160
that huge of a technical effort behind it.

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160
Right.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:50.080
But also the other reason why I think this is an attack, I'm not sure if that's the right

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:57.800
word, an attack on Apple is looking at some of the files that were taken, it's implied

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:04.040
that other storage, you know, cloud storage platforms were potentially compromised.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.240
But those cloud storage platforms haven't been mentioned.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.920
They've very squarely pinned this on iCloud.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:16.360
I do recognize that as well, but I also I've noticed just in the tech news industry, quote

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:22.240
unquote, if you can even frickin call it that, if the story has Apple, you put that in the

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.500
headline.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.200
It does not matter anything else.

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:30.360
Because A, headlines are of limited length and B, it seems Apple headlines drive traffic.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:36.440
If you put Microsoft, you could put Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, Google, eBay in the headline

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.720
and they still drive less traffic than when you put Apple in the headline.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.720
So I think that might explain that aspect of it, is that's just the click baiting nature

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.400
of the tech media.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:52.160
But yeah, I mean, I think also if it is a simple, if it is truly as simple as a password

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:58.920
breach and perhaps aided by an inadequate lockout timer after a certain amount of invalid

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:03.200
attempts, then this is truly something that could affect any cloud service.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:08.720
Because for example, if I have a script and a computer and time on my hands and say Dropbox

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:14.040
allows me to do nine invalid login attempts, on the 10th attempt it locks my account, well

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.240
then I would just make a script that tries to log into Jennifer Lawrence's Dropbox account

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.720
nine times and then sleeps for the hour or whatever it needs to sleep and then tries

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.660
another nine and I would let that sucker run for a year.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:29.840
Just like people Bitcoin mine when they get nothing because if you get anything at all,

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:32.360
it's going to be such a payday, it's totally worth it.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.800
So yes, it absolutely makes a difference if you rate limit the login attempts.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.280
Fundamentally though, if these kinds of things, something this private, something this important

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:46.700
is being protected by a password and a password alone, I think that's a failure of the system

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:51.880
and I think you can give some of the blame to the user for using a dictionary password.

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:56.360
But I'll tell you guys, I've been guessing people's passwords since I was literally in

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.360
elementary school.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:00.760
I figured out my teacher's password just by looking around at their pictures.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.520
I've been doing it for years.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.520
Nobody has changed.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.760
I mean, I am, I'm getting to be an old person now and I'm telling you for 20 years now,

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.560
human beings have been using the most ridiculous, 25 years, people have been using the most

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.020
ridiculous passwords to log into their computers and that has not fundamentally changed.

01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:20.580
And you know, it's funny because people think they're really good at picking passwords and

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:23.920
they think they're really clever, but I've been able to figure out my mother's passwords,

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920
my father's passwords.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.140
I won't say other people's passwords that might be listening, I've been able to figure

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.560
out teacher's passwords.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:35.120
Human beings are not good at picking passwords unless you are educated on how to do it.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:41.840
The nature of this attack was to use the find my iPhone, which I believe you need to supply

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.920
an email account and a password combination.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:52.200
And once you get a valid credential, just think how many systems that can unlock, bearing

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:56.840
in mind the majority of people use the same password everywhere.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:02.720
Email accounts are often used as the assert your identity field.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.320
So you've now got an email account and password and you can just go around trying that Google

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.000
Dropbox and everywhere else.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.280
Well for most of those, you don't even need to try the password, you just need the email.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.880
Because you take your email and you go to whatever the service is and go, I forgot my

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.880
password.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.540
I mean, that's one of the brutal things about current online identity is that it's built

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:32.520
around your email and maybe your phone, two things which are remarkably easy to get your

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:33.520
hands on.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.520
Right.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.520
And especially when you have physical access.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.800
Like if you can sit at somebody's desk and you go to any website that they ever visit

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.080
and the chances are, even if that website's logged in, their Gmail or Yahoo or AOL Mail

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.720
is logged in and you just initiate a password reset.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:51.060
It sends the email to a tab they might already have open on their computer.

01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:52.060
You open up the email.

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.720
I mean, it's ridiculously easy to do this.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:00.580
We talk about this constantly on TechSnap because people really, really, really underestimate

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:03.480
the quote-unquote value of their email inbox.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:05.360
And really, that's where it's all at.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:10.040
And I think too, we have to ask ourselves if you can't consider a service secure unless

01:20:10.040 --> 01:20:11.880
it requires more than a password.

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.880
And would it be ridiculous, A, for a company to require two-factor, and B, if any company

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.560
could pull it off, wouldn't it kind of be Apple?

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:21.760
I mean, they do all kinds of stuff that's just like, you can't do that, and then all

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.320
of a sudden it becomes normal.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:29.400
What if Apple required to make iCloud changes like this, touch ID and a password?

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:35.080
If you have an Apple device that has touch ID, then they just require you use that as

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.340
a form of two-factor authentication.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.340
They could do it.

01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:39.340
Yeah.

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:43.800
At least what I see among my peers and people that I know is the reason they, how they justify

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:48.340
using the same password and the same weak password is because they think, oh, no one

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:52.320
will attack me, or no one will ask me.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.320
Yeah.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:54.320
I'm not important enough.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320
Yeah.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:57.440
But they don't realize it's not them that someone's going to try to hack.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:02.640
They're going to attack Facebook or some site they have an account on, get all those accounts

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.840
and then automate the attacks against everyone else.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.840
Right.

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.840
Yeah.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.840
Yeah.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:08.840
Yeah.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.200
Then everybody just gets swept up in it.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.560
So back to the app thing that you mentioned about, they could do it.

01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:18.240
What would be their motive, like what would motivate them to do this?

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.240
Marketing?

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.960
I mean, it's a good marketing point, right?

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.560
So two reasons why I think Apple could be the company to do it.

01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:31.480
One, because they'll do things that seem almost like suicidal sometimes, like they'll launch

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:33.840
a product that kills another product of their own.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.920
The other reason is because they're not making money off the monetization of the data.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.440
They're making money off the monetization of the hardware.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.000
So Google and Microsoft, both of them monetize the data for advertising purposes, but Google's

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
way beyond that.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.040
We all understand that.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.600
So Google, for example, even though they're working on encryption for Gmail, I would be

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.560
pretty impressed if they ever actually encrypted the actual email contents that they couldn't

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.800
read themselves, because then they lose out on a huge AdWords opportunity that would probably

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.820
literally cost them millions of dollars.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:04.740
But Apple, if they can't read my data, if it's impossible for them, if it's encrypted

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:10.960
at the operating system level on the device using their 64 bit fancy processor, they lose

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:11.960
nothing.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960
It doesn't cost them a dollar.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:13.960
Wouldn't that take longer to send the message though?

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.960
I mean, that would be, you know, one of the, it's not acceptable.

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:19.960
It's just not a sexy feature.

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:28.880
It wouldn't be a time thing, but I'll tell you what, after what's happened, it's a sexy

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.880
feature now.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.800
Well, maybe, maybe.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.240
I was hoping the NSA stuff would make it a sexy feature, but that seems to have sort

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.240
of petered out.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.240
Most iPhone users don't care.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:41.120
I mean, they just don't care.

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.240
Most people I know really don't, it doesn't matter to them.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.240
They don't care.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:50.080
The thing about my generation is that we've grown up with Facebook and we've grown up

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.680
with sharing everything about ourselves.

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:57.680
So most of us, and I'm not included in that, but most of us really, it doesn't matter to

01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.520
us if our information is out there.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.320
Maybe to an extent, but so take one of these friends you're talking about.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.960
They care if all of a sudden their dick's on the internet.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960
Yeah.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:10.720
Although, as long as their dick isn't on the internet, they'll just say, oh, he shouldn't

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720
have done that.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.720
Right.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.400
So anytime a dick or a booby gets on the internet, I think it brings it a little more home.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:20.720
Because now it's somebody you know, it's a face you recognize, it's a body part.

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.720
It's not an abstract concept anymore.

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.360
It's a dick or a booby.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:29.920
And I think that is more powerful than an abstract PowerPoint presentation published

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.800
by The Guardian.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.800
That is true.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.840
So maybe in regards to the nudes they're sending, sure that might get them to care a little,

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:44.980
but especially about all the stuff that Google collects, it doesn't matter to them that everyone

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.720
has a huge database on their life.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:54.660
I bet amongst Joe Public, this story has resonated more and made them think more about their

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:59.920
own personal privacy and how they use their, not just Apple devices, but how they use these

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:05.480
devices than anything that was disclosed by Snowden and The Guardian over the last 18

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.480
months.

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.480
Yeah.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.400
My favorite day weekend here in the United States was millions of US consumers going

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.200
through and purging their photo streams.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.000
And then there's the other half of them that were actually going and looking for those

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
other photos.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Right.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.920
And I'm thinking, hey, you know, maybe I should be taking, that was my thought process, hey,

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.220
maybe I should take some nudie photos.

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:24.560
And how would I do that exactly?

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:25.560
Polaroid.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.560
That's what I was thinking.

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:27.560
Just grab a Polaroid.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.560
If you want to succeed, you've got to have a sex tape.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.560
That's the thing.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.920
Jupiter broadcasts can really be catapulted into the spotlight, but not in the right spotlight.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.920
I feel like a calendar train wreck out of me.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.920
All right.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:44.720
At work, when Heartbleed hit, I just quietly went about the business of patching our stuff.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:48.160
And then at the next board meeting, I said, you know, there was this thing and did you

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.520
hear about it?

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.160
Nobody knew what I was talking about.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.160
Really?

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.160
We weren't affected in the first place, but we've done the necessary things.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.880
Today, my boss comes up to me and says, can I have a word with you for a minute?

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:00.880
And I say, yeah, sure.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.120
I go into his office and he says, so what do you know about this iCloud hack with all

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:07.680
of these celebrities?

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.240
Really?

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.240
So it is great.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:11.240
So I think this story resonates.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.240
Heartbleed knows not so much.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.240
Not on the radar.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.240
No.

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.880
But then this, everyone wants to know.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.880
Well, there you go.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.240
It's got everyone's attention.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.880
It's another reason to brag about that you have an iPhone.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:28.520
Boobies bring us life and maybe they'll finally bring us some privacy and concern about security.

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.200
I feel really bad for those gals that, the women that had to have this happen.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.200
Oh, I do too.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.560
I can't imagine if that were like my wife or whoever.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.680
I know.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.960
It's really awful.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:40.840
I think it's important to remember it's not just them it happens to.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:46.600
It's happening on a smaller scale that is affecting lives all the time.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.240
We can't do a lot in our position, but as advocates of free software and as folks, I

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.320
think a lot of you in the audience are those of you who work with your friends and family

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.440
to help them do these things.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.220
You have an opportunity to at least help the people around you, show them alternatives.

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:04.280
Don't be heavy handed about it.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.280
My mom's using iCloud.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.280
I let her go ahead.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.280
Mom, have at it.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.280
Whatever.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.240
But if you want an alternative, I'm there to help you set it up.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.240
It's more secure.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.240
Here's the benefits.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.460
We don't have to be heavy handed about it.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:18.600
But as folks in our position, I think we do have some opportunity if we want to engage

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.840
in it to help people with this.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.840
Yeah.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.680
I was just thinking back, it was a couple of years ago, I saw this on ABC.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.520
There was this girl who got hacked.

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.680
She was like maybe 14 years old at the time.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.320
And her life was essentially ruined by all these pictures that she was taking for her

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:40.880
boyfriend who I believe she's now engaged to or something or at the time of the thing.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.320
And they were kind of risque photos in a lot of cases.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.720
And her life was ruined from that point.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:53.560
Everybody, once her account got hacked, her high school friends spread all over the internet

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:58.720
and her high school friends called her a slut and whatnot.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.120
And she probably wasn't that way.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.400
But the fact that they were treating her that way is just sad.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.880
And a young person is probably not properly emotionally equipped to deal with it either,

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.880
which is sort of the unfortunate part.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.880
Exactly.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.760
The withdrawal from school and everything.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.960
This happens every day.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:19.720
And a lot of people don't understand that and don't recognize it.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.520
And I hate that it took a celebrity gang hacked, or several celebrities, I guess, before this

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.440
became a public problem.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.980
It's like natural disasters.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:34.520
People don't care until it happens to them, unless they have sympathy.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.180
We're kind of a martyr for our security systems at the moment.

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:44.020
And at least right now, we know there's a problem or at least normal jails of America

01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:48.680
and hopefully the world because it's not just America celebrities that got used here in

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.160
this situation.

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.880
The world's, or at least a lot of different countries, got involved in this.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.240
At least everyone will know that there's a problem that needs to be fixed versus just

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:04.240
the ladies being exposed or used for this sort of publicity.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.960
I just hope we don't have an overreaction from the political side of the spectrum, but

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:08.960
we'll see.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:09.960
Now, I think we'll leave it at that.

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:19.960
I think we've probably said enough.
