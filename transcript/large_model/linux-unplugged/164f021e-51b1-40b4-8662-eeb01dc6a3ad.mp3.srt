1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Brent has been officially initiated into the stay-up-all-night-at-the-studio

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,800
cramming to get a project done right before you got a travel club.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,400
Everybody gets to join that at some point.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Yeah, it doesn't come with a lot of perks, really.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,700
There is a jacket, but we have to measure Brent first.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,800
Yeah, we forgot to do that.

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,700
But Brent really banged it out with some help from my wife.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,800
Absolutely as well, Hadeah, she helped.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,000
And the two of them stayed up until 3 a.m.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
before Brent's flight to build something really special for us.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,900
You got to tell them what it is, Brent.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,500
I don't want to steal your thunder.

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,200
Well, I'll just say, you know, originally I was disappointed

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,900
because all my flights changed and I wasn't going to be able to do this project.

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,200
And then last minute, Chris, I don't know, you must have changed things

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,200
so I could manage to build the server rack.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,000
I bought out all the COVID tests around here.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,600
Clearly, I don't know how much you paid for that, but it must have been a lot.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,200
It's probably more than a server rack.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,700
I bought them all out so that way you had to delay your flight

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,200
and yeah, it worked out perfectly.

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,700
Yeah, we actually, you know, loaded the SUV up with a whole bunch of wood

23
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,900
and went and bought some used casters that are pretty awesome

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,200
and built a pretty sweet custom case for all the servers that we have inbound.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,000
So 3 a.m. at the studio. Totally worth it.

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,400
Yeah. And now we have a sweet server rack for our server studio data center garage.

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,900
I think we're going to need to remember to put some links on the show notes for this one.

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,400
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. And my name is Brent.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Hello, guys. Both of you are looking sharp and ready to go.

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
We have a great show.

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,400
You know, we've been looking at the data, we've been following the trends,

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
and we think we've cracked what it really takes to drive Linux user adoption these days.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Like, if we were saying, you know, we're going to need a lot of data,

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,400
we're going to need a lot of data, we're going to need a lot of data,

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,400
we're going to need a lot of data, we're going to need a lot of data,

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,400
if we were savvy YouTubers, we'd have a zany face,

38
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,400
and our thumbnail would say something like,

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,400
don't miss this one trick all distros should be doing.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
And it'd be really kind of like attention grabby.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
But we think we have something here.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,400
We're going to share with you our hypothesis that we formulated

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
after some late night binging of server builds.

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,400
But before we go any further, before we get into that and the picks and the feedback,

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
we got to say hello to our virtual lug.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Hello.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Hello.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Hello.

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
What a handsome bunch.

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Look at that.

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Oh, man.

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
And they all got matching hats.

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Why didn't we get –

55
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Yeah, we weren't clued in.

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
There's a whole like swag black market happening around the show,

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
and we're not getting any of that action, you know.

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
So I'm sure some of them will show up next Sunday,

59
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
because next Sunday is our meetup, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
if you're in the Pacific Northwest.

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
We're going to do a little – here's what I think.

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I don't know exactly how it's going to go down yet,

63
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
because we're always – we're flexible.

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
We're a couple of wild and crazy guys, so we're easy.

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,400
But I'm thinking we do a little meet and greet at 11 a.m.

66
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
So start showing up at 11 a.m. is what I'm thinking.

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
So that probably means you got to get here at like 10.30.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,400
And then we do a little meet and greet, do some introductions.

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll have a couple of devices out that I'd like to see if people could get working,

71
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
the devices that Brent and I have been playing with recently.

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
A few meetup challenges to go around.

73
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I like it.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I like many of those devices.

75
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
Yeah, actually, you know what I'm looking at?

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Here's another one right here.

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
We could throw that in the pile too.

78
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I got to get these charging though.

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
You're right.

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I just walk through the studio and pick a few up that are sitting around the studio.

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Then we'll do the show live, right?

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
So we'll put the speaker out there.

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
People can hang out in the living room.

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Throw the live stream on the TV.

85
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
You got it, right?

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,400
And then after we're done with that, we'll go out there.

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
We'll start cooking it up.

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
And I encourage people if they got something they can bring with them

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
that they can heat up in a microwave or an air fryer or oven or on the grill,

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
bring it with you or if it's cold.

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
But if you don't, we're going to try to come up with a few things.

92
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,400
And then we'll just do eating and hanging for a bit.

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Talk about cryptocurrency, I'm sure, because that always comes up now

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
anytime you do a public event.

95
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
And talk about Linux because whenever we're doing a JB event,

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
that always comes up too.

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
So we'd love to see you.

98
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
It'll be happening next week during the live stream.

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,400
And, you know, we could probably have the stream going.

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I could see that.

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,400
People come in.

103
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
We'll probably do, you know, a couple of chats on mic.

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Have them hot.

105
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Why not?

106
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
That could be fun.

107
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Try to capture a bit of the experience.

108
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Yeah.

109
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I know it's limited because it's just up here in the corner of the states.

110
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
We are.

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
But it is the times as they are.

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,400
But we are actually formulating plans for a 2022 road trip.

113
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,400
By formulating, I mean we're talking about how we should probably make plans.

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
That's how far we are in the planning.

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
The only one is think about needing to think about it.

116
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
We got real good intentions.

117
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
We sure do.

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
We got the best intentions.

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
We have some news to get into.

120
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,400
One of them I just love covering because one of my predictions is already coming true.

121
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
How great is this?

122
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Flat Hub is going to verify first party apps and allow developers to collect the monies.

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
We'll have a link to gaming on Linux here where Liam did a write up that's really good.

124
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,400
And he says Flat Hub is going to gain a way to process and verify apps from first party teams.

125
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,400
As in developers who directly publish their app and manage the Flat Pack package process for Flat Hub.

126
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Not only that, but Gnome want to give developers a way to collect donations and subscriptions too.

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Maybe important for sustainability.

128
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Then there's some talk about having a way for developers to share some of that revenue back up with Flat Hub.

129
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
So interesting.

130
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400
That I think is a great idea because Flat Hub is a good service and that listing.

131
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,400
I mean it takes resources to run.

132
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,400
And I think it plays a good important part in the ecosystem.

133
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,400
It looks like there's also going to be a way to distinguish first party publishers and third party publishers.

134
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
That's good.

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
We've discussed this a few times already.

136
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
It comes up a lot unfortunately.

137
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
So some clarity there.

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
That's appreciated.

139
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,400
And I think it means I've already won my prediction.

140
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I think.

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I mean we don't know the details but I feel like.

142
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
See now unfortunately I'm hoping that somehow Flat Hub goes bankrupt in the year.

143
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Flat Hub doesn't exist at the end of the year.

144
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Just so you know.

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
It's not worth it.

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Never mind.

147
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
How badly do you want to see me lose?

148
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I've just been so good lately.

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
I don't know.

150
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Did I do all right?

151
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I can't remember.

152
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
But I am very happy to see that news.

153
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:29,400
And isn't it fascinating that one of the things that's driving Flatback adoption and just sort of user adoption and developer adoption is centralizing on Flat Hub.

154
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,400
But one of the very core issues that people had with snaps was the centralization at Canonical.

155
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,400
This is just a different group with a different kind of centralization.

156
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
But because I guess it didn't start here.

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
We're OK with it.

158
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Or is it just because it's not Canonical.

159
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
I'm not sure.

160
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I don't I don't know.

161
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
There is a fun.

162
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I mean we're a funny bunch in that sense.

163
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,400
You know it kind of matters the some of the intention some of the philosophy for how we built it.

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
You know that.

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Well we could run our own if we wanted to.

166
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
We mostly don't though.

167
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Because why would we want to.

168
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,400
But we can.

169
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,400
OK now I want to talk about the Seuss Liberty Linux announcement.

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
This has been quite the clown show to watch.

171
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Now our backstory on this just under full disclosure is we've been watching this since I don't know October because there was some data that showed up in the repositories that suggested a distribution named Seuss Liberty Linux was hitting the update repositories in the Apple repositories.

172
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,400
And looking at it it seemed to be maybe there is even a good amount of them.

173
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
You know not just like one or two enough to be noticeable.

174
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Yeah yeah.

175
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,400
But this week we got the announcement of Seuss Liberty Linux and it's not a Linux distribution.

176
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,400
It is a support offering.

177
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I've been a fan of Seuss recently but I have to say this is one of the more hilarious boondoggles in Linux recently.

178
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
So they announced Seuss Liberty Linux which on its own sounds like a Linux distribution.

179
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
It does.

180
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah yeah.

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,400
It turns out it's a support offering that supports Seuss systems and RHEL based systems like CentOS.

182
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
You know those mixed Linux environments.

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,400
They use the offering of breaking you free of lock-in as like the main value pitch of the platform.

184
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:19,400
But the entire claim is ironic because if it was locked in they wouldn't be able to offer the Seuss Liberty service in the first place.

185
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,400
So it clearly shows there isn't lock-in and that you can use different vendors like Tuxcare or others.

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Was that ever surprising?

187
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
No. And so that's ironic too.

188
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,400
But then here's the other thing is nobody knew if it was a Linux distribution or not because it was the worst kept secret.

189
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Everybody knew there was a distro in the works for a bit.

190
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:43,400
And clearly all of the marketing and all of the communication language and the branding is Seuss Liberty Linux.

191
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:51,400
So when it launched there were even Seuss employees on Reddit claiming it was a Linux distribution.

192
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
And kind of embarrassingly the register ran with the headline that reads,

193
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Seuss announces something for those who missed the old CentOS Liberty Linux.

194
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,400
And the whole pitch was it's their new distro and they say it seems to be based on a rebuild of CentOS 8.

195
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Although how they knew that since there was no distro released is anyone's guess.

196
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,400
And everyone was confused by this and it's hilarious.

197
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
And I have a little bit of bacon.

198
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Oh fry it up.

199
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Before I get to it, do you have any thoughts on this entire boondoggle since we've been watching this since the beginning?

200
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
No, I mean it just does.

201
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Hearing you sort of go over it right now.

202
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Okay, trying to laugh a little less.

203
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
It's unfortunate that there's not very clear communication here.

204
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
You know like that's too bad.

205
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Maybe some folks will actually find this new product offering useful.

206
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Trying to look at that part of it seriously, it's just kind of unfortunate that that's all going to kind of get ignored for what we're talking about now.

207
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Right, and then to kind of add to the kind of funny launch.

208
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,400
It may not even still be, but the day that they launched it when Wes and I were going over everything to really try to put this all together.

209
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Because we wanted to get our first take in LAN right.

210
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
What was this?

211
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Right, we didn't want to go out of the gate calling it a distro because it's not.

212
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
But like at the time they launched it, I couldn't even see a way to buy it.

213
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Like they talk about it on their website like you can buy it online from the SUSE online store.

214
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
But when you go there it's not actually offered in the drop down of product offerings.

215
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,400
And you didn't, I tried to get you to, but you didn't seem interested in scheduling a call with them.

216
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,400
So I wouldn't be surprised if the sales aren't off the hook.

217
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
But I could see existing.

218
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,400
It's still 404 in at least this product page.

219
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
They changed the URL slugs for products.

220
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,400
So the link in the announcement, originally they edited it now.

221
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,400
But originally it had a singular word product in the slug.

222
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
But the URL is actually products with a plural.

223
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
See that's just unfortunate too.

225
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,400
So there's that and then you have the whole issue of why did everybody think it was a distro?

226
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Like why did everybody get it wrong?

227
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Besides the messaging just being totally wrong and the way they describe it, it sounds like a distro at first.

228
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,400
I got my theory.

229
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Here's my bacon about this.

230
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I think it was a distro.

231
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I think it was a distro until about the end of the year.

232
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:06,400
And then they pivoted strategy because maybe somebody listened to LAN or maybe it just became obvious or, you know, enough momentum build up.

233
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
But this was my take in LAN when we first talked about this rumor.

234
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
And I think it all kind of holds out.

235
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Everything makes sense if this was going to be a distribution and it was going to be part of this offering, right?

236
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
It was going to be part of the support services.

237
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,400
So if you wanted to get this, you could manage your SOO systems, CentOS systems.

238
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:29,400
And if you wanted to just maintain compatibility and not jump into stream, you could use their CentOS 8 rebuild.

239
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
That is what they were going to do.

240
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:41,400
But then they realized they would be creating the same exact paradox that Red Hat found themselves in, right?

241
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Red Hat had a problem where the thing that paid the bills was also be given away for free.

242
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
And it was basically engineering versus sales.

243
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
And you're never going to resolve that kind of conflict.

244
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Eventually, sales is going to win because sales has numbers they have to hit.

245
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
They have a KPI they got to hit and they got to deliver results.

246
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,400
So eventually that machine turns inward and looks for where they're giving away the milk for free.

247
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
And they stopped that.

248
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
That's exactly what SUSE was about to start doing.

249
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:15,400
They were about to start giving away for free a rebuild of CentOS that competes with SUSE Enterprise Linux.

250
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:23,400
And how the hell can you charge a premium, which they do charge a premium, for SUSE Enterprise Linux if you're giving away CentOS for free?

251
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
It just doesn't make any sense.

252
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:32,400
And I think they had to have that conversation internally and they realized it's a lot harder to fix this once we make this launch.

253
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,400
And we'll just end up committing the same exact crime in communities' eyes that Red Hat did.

254
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
This had to be the conversation.

255
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
This is our chance to not make the mistake.

256
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:49,400
We got to make this decision before we release it because once the cat's out of the bag, once the genie's out of the bottle, it's really embarrassing to put it back in.

257
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
It gets worse from that, right?

258
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:59,400
If you think about it, the other aspect of this that I don't think a lot of people think about is that those sales pay those engineers, right?

259
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,400
So it gets – what's the word I would use for this?

260
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Particularly sadistic or masochistic.

261
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
Masochistic, that's it.

262
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:23,400
When you do this to yourself because then you wind up in a situation where those people that build those things that you enjoy for free aren't getting paid to keep doing it and so they can't.

263
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,400
And that makes things super, super complicated.

264
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Yeah, that's complicated is a good way to put it.

265
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,400
So this SUSE Liberty thing, I know it sounds confusing.

266
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
It's not a dis or at least not yet.

267
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Maybe that's still part of the plan.

268
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Who knows?

269
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
We're going to keep an eye on things.

270
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

271
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Now I kind of feel like you should do this one.

272
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Somebody wrote in and said have Wes do the Linode read.

273
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,400
I wonder if you've heard me do it enough that you could do a Linode read.

274
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
So it's Linode.com slash unplugged.

275
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Go there for $100 in 60-day credit and support the show obviously.

276
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I mean you've got to support the show.

277
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
But why use Linode, Wes?

278
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
Oh, there's so many good reasons.

279
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I mean one, it's kind of a – it's one of the services that Chris can use reliably, you know?

280
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:12,400
You don't have – you can interface with all kinds of programmatic APIs and fancy command line clients.

281
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
But also –

282
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
You could use your Kubernetes.

283
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
You can use your Kubernetes, yeah.

284
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
But you can also just spin up, you know, Linux machines.

285
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
As soon as you want.

286
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,400
They've got like the distros that you probably already want to run.

287
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
I mean oftentimes –

288
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
All the distros really.

289
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
It's easier, you know, if there's a new server release.

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,400
I don't need to bother with something on my laptop because Linode's got the distro.

291
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
They've just released it.

292
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
It's on Linode.

293
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
You can just boot it up right there.

294
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Yeah, you want to go play with Stream?

295
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
It's on there.

296
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
You want to try Alma?

297
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
It's on there.

298
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
You know what else we use the heck out of?

299
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
That block storage.

300
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I mean do we store things any other way at this point?

301
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
No, probably not.

302
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I mean if you want to mess around with disks and partitions like an animal from the 90s, you could.

303
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
That does not sound like our style.

304
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
No.

305
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
There's so many great reasons to use it.

306
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Plus did you know, Wes, you might not have known this.

307
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Best customer support in the business.

308
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Oh, yeah.

309
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Yeah.

310
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
All the time.

311
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
They're available for you when you need them.

312
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,400
And 30 to 50 percent cheaper than those big hyperscalers that are just trying to vendor

313
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Lucky in anyways.

314
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Yeah.

315
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
And when you look at some of those hyperscalers, they've got everything.

316
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
There's no way to tell like is this a good product?

317
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Is this one of your like premier things or just a random offering you have to be competitive?

318
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,400
And I feel like with Linode, the things that they offer, they're really going to stand behind.

319
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
You nailed it.

320
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
You know why?

321
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
They've been doing this for 18 years, almost 19 years now.

322
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,400
And like legitimately 20 years on the internet is like 100 years in real life.

323
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Maybe even more.

324
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Same as dog rules, right?

325
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Yeah.

326
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Maybe even more, man.

327
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Like 20 years doing something on the internet is mind blowing.

328
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,400
They were really in on this stuff early and they just made a great product.

329
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
And you know, they're independently owned.

330
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,400
They didn't have to go the crazy VC funding route.

331
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
They got 11 data centers around the world and they've been supporting the hell out

332
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
of Linux media now for like almost two years.

333
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,400
They've also got some pretty great out of band access for when you really break your

334
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
machine.

335
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Not that I've had to use that.

336
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
No.

337
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Like when you want to load some crazy image on there that they don't have in the dropdown,

338
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
you can actually get it done.

339
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah.

340
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
They're not going to artificially limit you.

341
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
They're ready to get weird with it.

342
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
We have.

343
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
We have gotten really weird with it.

344
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

345
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
All right.

346
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Well, if there was one trick to win over Linux users, maybe we've discovered it.

347
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
I don't actually think it's us.

348
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I kind of say all this tongue in cheek.

349
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Well, we've crunched the data, done our research and maybe, maybe noticed a trend.

350
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I don't know.

351
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
I'm not too serious.

352
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,400
But I think we found something of a draw for Linux users.

353
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Yeah.

354
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
What they're looking for in a distro.

355
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
I think so.

356
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
In 2022.

357
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
At least a large percentage of Linux users.

358
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
I think it's almost beginning to trend depending on what data sets you.

359
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Yeah.

360
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
You know, it's hard to generalize.

361
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
We're not trying to say this is true for everyone.

362
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Yeah.

363
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Yeah.

364
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Yeah.

365
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,400
To understand where we're going with this, you got to come take a stroll with us through

366
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Linux Mint 20.3.

367
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
What?

368
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Yeah.

369
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
So this is going to get us to our point.

370
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,400
20.3 came out recently and it's a nice looking release.

371
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Brent, I think probably has the most experience with Mint as a former longtime user.

372
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,400
So I think we should start with you and your impressions on 20.3.

373
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend like a week or two with it, which I probably would

374
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
have loved to.

375
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Hey, not yet anyway.

376
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Not yet.

377
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
There you go.

378
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
But I do have a long history with Linux Mint.

379
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,760
When I first started, I used Subuntu for like, I don't know, six months or something and

380
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,000
then was desiring a little bit more and landed on Linux Mint.

381
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,440
This was probably, I don't know, five plus years ago, maybe even more than that.

382
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,080
And I used it for a few years.

383
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,160
I even tried their Linux Mint Debian edition for a while, which is their sort of rolling

384
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,420
release cadence edition.

385
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
And I liked it.

386
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:53,040
Eventually it felt, I've been trying for years to sum up why I moved away from Linux Mint

387
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,400
and I think it's because it felt like there were some restrictions on it.

388
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,120
It's almost like Mac in that if you're doing what they want you to, it works great.

389
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,000
If you're trying to do anything outside of what they want you to, then it becomes a little

390
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,380
bit of a challenge.

391
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,080
But at the same time, I was really interested in jumping back in.

392
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,080
It's been several years and I think I do have this fondness for Linux Mint, even though

393
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,340
I haven't thought of it for several years.

394
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:26,400
So jumping in was interesting because Cinnamon feels exactly like it used to, which was really

395
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
kind of nice.

396
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,080
It actually felt like coming home in a sense.

397
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,680
And then when I poked around, I started discovering, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, there's all these like

398
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,480
defaults that are seem sane and are pretty lovely for, you know, what they advertise

399
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,660
on their website, which is that most of their users come straight from Windows.

400
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,160
And I think that's a really reasonable approach.

401
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,840
But as I dug in, I started remembering all of those limitations that just felt, I don't

402
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,000
know, not quite our style these days, maybe.

403
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,800
And so I got mixed feelings.

404
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
I think that's fair.

405
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,600
I agree with everything you said.

406
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,040
It really is iterative improvements with Mint, which means that if you've taken a few years

407
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,400
off from trying it, and I also tried the Cinnamon edition, and you sit down and try it, I really

408
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,280
can perceive the improvements over time.

409
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,480
I felt specifically from just the last release to this release, out of the box, high DPI

410
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,800
support is nice.

411
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,220
The GTK theme is cleaner.

412
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,340
And so I, just as a thought experiment, because I haven't been using Mint for a while, I first

413
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,560
installed the previous release, brought that all up to date, used that for a day, and then

414
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,800
wiped it and installed 20.3 and immediately just wrote down my thoughts on the differences

415
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,500
just to kind of get an idea of what kind of improvements.

416
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,320
And for the most part, it's like new apps, like the new things app and the high DPI support

417
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,480
out of the box is really nice.

418
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,520
I also felt that Cinnamon was greatly improved from the time I'd used it previously, a little

419
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,680
less shiny, like less transparencies and window effects.

420
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,200
But now it feels very solid, really stable.

421
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,320
I didn't have any crashes.

422
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,440
I even threw a bunch of widgets in the menu because I used to always be a surefire way

423
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
to crash it.

424
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,480
But no, it did fine.

425
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,760
It really does kind of now hit that sweet spot between Plasma and Gnome.

426
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
There's rough bits still.

427
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,760
The app store feels really low effort, like they're just shipping the default and not

428
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,200
putting any curation in there.

429
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,720
Like when you go, for example, right now on mine, when you look at the editor's picks,

430
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,480
there's half a dozen apps that are listed in this editor's picks as if somebody hand

431
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,040
selected these.

432
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,840
But then there's two entries for wine with two different icons and one's version 3.7

433
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,160
and one's version 4.0 and I can't really determine which one is like the one they consider the

434
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,040
default because it doesn't expose that information.

435
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,840
And there's no flat hub, there's no flat hub integration.

436
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,520
So that kind of stuff I was a little disappointed to see, but I could see them adding that stuff

437
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,720
over time.

438
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,160
But what I'm really impressed by is if you get out of your head as a long time Linux

439
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,720
user, and you look at this as somebody who's just trying to get some damn work done, they

440
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,640
have really nice things in there like a USB image writer is installed by default, an application

441
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,560
called backup is installed by default, and it's a decent little app.

442
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,440
We've talked about time shift before.

443
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,120
They have just system diagnostic and information, you just click that, it's in there, it's obvious,

444
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,800
and they've managed to keep it uncluttered, which is impressive because you could see

445
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,440
adding all these little tools and these X apps over time would really clutter things

446
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
up.

447
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,680
They managed to keep it pretty clean and kind of decide when to pull things out as well.

448
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,080
So because they've done this iterative work, and they've been evolving all of this stuff

449
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,560
for a while, and they've been able to keep up in this release with some of the more recentish

450
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
GTK trends.

451
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,720
I mean, of course now GNOME 42 is out, and Libidwadi is now a thing, and they're nowhere

452
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
near that.

453
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
But...

454
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
You're right.

455
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,200
I mean, in the longer view sense, it was nice to see the dark style support and some

456
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,800
added accent colors and stuff.

457
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,680
None of that was there the last time I tried Cinnamon.

458
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Right, yeah.

459
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
And it's just all...

460
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,920
I could go over to the advanced side and turn on experimental fractional scaling.

461
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Oh, right.

462
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,440
And I think I'm running to 140 or some weird number, but it actually looks fine.

463
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
It doesn't look blurry.

464
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,020
They did a good job, and that kind of day-to-day steak and potatoes thing somebody needs from

465
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,840
a desktop computer like it used to always be, it really kind of feels like they're nailing

466
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,920
all that stuff while not getting sucked into the technology stack of the week kind of situation.

467
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,380
I'm curious on your thoughts, though.

468
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,560
I think I agree.

469
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,440
There's a lot of elements that stand out as being thoughtfully looked after.

470
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,600
And then there are some holes where they're just missing pieces.

471
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,200
I liked a lot of the welcome experience.

472
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,800
It detected and asked about, did I need to improve my video driver situation, which I

473
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
thought was pretty nice.

474
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,320
And there's just a few things kind of like prompting you to set things up.

475
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,800
Although once you start diving into, say, snapshots or the firewall, you do kind of

476
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,660
run out of rope on having your hand held.

477
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,500
So I think some of this stuff is maybe more easy in the welcome screen for someone who's

478
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,720
really just switching from Windows, and then it gets advanced kind of quickly.

479
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,040
But I can't fault them for that.

480
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,920
Those are just complicated topics.

481
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,600
In the past, you know, I did use Cinnamon a lot on a work machine that I had to do a

482
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
boot with Windows.

483
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,320
And so that kind of, you know, the interface style matched up pretty well, and it wasn't

484
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
a machine I customized.

485
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I was just curious to revisit.

486
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,720
Could I just could I use it as a boring old workstation?

487
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,880
And yeah, I think it still works pretty nicely for that.

488
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,880
It's somewhere in between, you know, maybe the pure simplicity of a GNOME experience.

489
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,660
You get some of the plasma things, but without having as much customization to maybe need

490
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,080
or be tempted to do, because that's exactly where I think I would still deploy Cinnamon

491
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
is.

492
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,380
In an environment where I just want to forget about the DE, you know, it's not ugly enough

493
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,380
to be offensive.

494
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,200
I can just forget about it.

495
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,400
Gets out of your way, but does have some power features when you want it.

496
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,780
It is interesting also, we mentioned sort of catching up in the, you know, the GTK world,

497
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,080
but catching up on the Ubuntu derivative world, when I was going through the, you know, the

498
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,840
boring old installer, I don't mean that in a bad way, but just the boring old installer

499
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
still knows EFS.

500
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,080
You know, you just get ext4 if you don't go with LVM, right?

501
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,720
Maybe wonder what's gonna happen with that flutter transition?

502
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,920
Is Mint keeping the sold version?

503
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,360
Are they gonna adopt where Canonical goes?

504
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,040
I bet they don't.

505
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
I bet they don't.

506
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
Yeah.

507
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Good question.

508
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I wonder.

509
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I mean, I'm kind of tired of that installer.

510
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,640
I mean, it sure does work, but I feel like I've been using it for about 10 years.

511
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,640
I don't know.

512
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,200
But I guess it gets the job done, right?

513
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,820
It'd be nice to see some like advanced options around ZFS or ButterFest, but I get that's

514
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
not their demo.

515
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,640
And I gotta take that into consideration.

516
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,720
So here's where we're going with this.

517
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,840
Even with all of this said, you know, it's the steak and potatoes.

518
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,680
It is the, what is on the label is what you get Linux distribution.

519
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,020
It's a great landing spot for Windows users.

520
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,900
And I think that makes sense for a lot of us, but there's still an element that's missing

521
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,360
that seems to be drawing users away from Mint at a rapid pace.

522
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,140
So much so that they seem to be attempting to address this over the last year or so.

523
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,620
And I wasn't familiar with this until I went digging around, but I've discovered that Mint

524
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,700
is now publishing Edge ISOs.

525
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,700
Have you seen this?

526
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,700
Yeah.

527
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,080
They've done it for the last couple of releases.

528
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,840
And it is simply a version of Linux Mint with newer kernel drivers, a newer kernel.

529
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:27,440
Like right now they are shipping 5.4 in Mint, but in the Edge version they're shipping 5.13,

530
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,720
which has a bunch of nice improvements in there.

531
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,680
And we talked a little bit about this on Linux Action News.

532
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,960
So for an expanded look on this, it's worth listening to that, but boilingsteam.com ran

533
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,280
a post and the headline is this.

534
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,960
All roads lead to Arch, the evolution of Linux distros used for gaming over time.

535
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,860
And you look at the data from ProtonDB and from Steam, and it seems kind of obvious.

536
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:04,560
Linux users are migrating over time in considerable numbers away from Ubuntu and Debian and Mint.

537
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Those are taking it the hardest.

538
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:12,440
And they're moving over to Arch Linux, Manjaro, Garuda Linux, and Endeavor OS.

539
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,480
Boilingsteam writes, Arch has gained progressively, some share solidly now at 20% for several

540
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,160
months, but the whole landscape looks a lot like Arch derivatives now.

541
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,000
Manjaro is almost as big as Arch itself, and Garuda Linux and Endeavor OS are 6 to 7% of

542
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
the mix.

543
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,400
In effect, almost half of the gamers on ProtonDB are running some form of Arch.

544
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
And when you look at the data trend, which they visualized here, we'll have a link in

545
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:46,360
the show notes over the years, you just see a steady progression of Arch over and over.

546
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,880
And it isn't really even kind of like a, it's not like a huge jump, it's just this slow

547
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,680
and steady, it does seem to speed up as we get closer to now.

548
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
What do you think this is?

549
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,800
Do you think it's the Arch user repository, Wes?

550
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,280
There's probably a lot of things, you know, we've kind of mentioned maybe the, what could

551
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,400
be perceived as a lack of investment or excitement around the Ubuntu desktop.

552
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,280
There's probably also an element of some of these Arch derivatives being more explicit

553
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,940
about marketing to gamers and having a lot of improved experience around just getting

554
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,400
up and going and having a system that's like ready to game.

555
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,640
So there's probably a few factors maybe combining, and Arch is just fun.

556
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Yeah, I think you're right.

557
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,400
And I think that one of those factors, which is what Linux Mint recognized is newer kernels

558
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,720
because people want newer drivers and they want newer drivers because they're switching

559
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,360
over to Linux to try it for gaming and they want the best frame rate, the best performance,

560
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,640
the best hardware support possible.

561
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,640
And while I was on Mint, I tried out the tool called Mainline.

562
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,920
So there used to be this Ubuntu kernel picker that would use the canonical PPA and install

563
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,240
a mainline kernel, but that developer quit work on the project, I guess.

564
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,820
But there's Mainline now.

565
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,800
It's a command line app that you install and it makes it really simple to list all of the

566
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
available kernels for your system.

567
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,040
And then you can just do like a mainline install latest.

568
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Oh, cute.

569
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,560
Like a little kernel manager right there for you.

570
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Exactly.

571
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,200
And it takes care of getting the right headers and the build files and doing all the boot

572
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,460
manager stuff and it all makes sure it gets pulled down from canonicals PPA.

573
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,940
So it's a legit source.

574
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,780
And so last night on my Mint box, and you could do this, you wouldn't have to get the

575
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,840
edge ice or you could do this on Ubuntu.

576
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,720
I installed kernel 516 using this tool.

577
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
Oh, look at you.

578
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
But hey, I mean, there's some stuff in Proton, you know, for Proton in there.

579
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
So why not?

580
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
You get the few tech stuff.

581
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,680
And here's the reality now is you get this really nice, tried and true, slowly iterated

582
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,480
Cinnamon Mint desktop that isn't going to change on end users very much.

583
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,480
And with this kind of tool, or you could do it yourself, you could get the latest kernel

584
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,600
and you get a lot of benefits that way.

585
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,120
And I think users are just opting to go with distributions that do it for themselves.

586
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,520
And I think even canonical sees this.

587
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,100
They see what's going on with these trends because they're hiring a Linux desktop gaming

588
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,900
product manager right now.

589
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,300
And canonical wants to, quote, make Ubuntu the best Linux desktop for gaming.

590
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,060
And they want to, quote, work with partners in the Silicon world to ensure the latest

591
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:15,000
graphics drivers and tweaks are built in for optimal frame rates and latency.

592
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,720
Well, how do you do that?

593
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,660
You got to get their code upstream in the Linux kernel.

594
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,600
So that means you have to ship a new kernel, right?

595
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,140
That's what the deck has to solve that you can have all this code going to Linux kernel.

596
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,480
But if you're shipping five dot four, it doesn't matter.

597
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,840
It's all it's not in a kernel that you're shipping anymore.

598
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,920
So canonical can't solve this problem.

599
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,240
They can't work with this is from their job post, quote, work with partners in the Silicon

600
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,600
world to ensure the latest graphics drivers and tweaks are built in.

601
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,480
They can't do that.

602
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,040
And they also say they want to work with mechanisms such as anti-cheat capabilities and make sure

603
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,320
that they are available to ensure fairness and product availability for Ubuntu users.

604
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,480
They're not going to do that again unless they work with an upstream kernel because

605
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,000
some of that stuff is landing in the kernel, thanks to Collabra.

606
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,880
I mean, I suppose you do have what you have hardware enablement, you got PPAs, but does

607
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,800
that just not have a different lack of appeal to feel more of a as an afterthought?

608
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,040
Well, I think if you look at why people are deploying Manjaro or Garuda, it's because

609
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,680
it's just the default.

610
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,920
It's defaults rule supreme.

611
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
You got that.

612
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,180
Plus, then you got, well, they're not testing against it, right?

613
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,880
Like the idea is these other distros are building their distro with the idea that you're going

614
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,620
to have the latest kernel like Fedora, but, you know, the Ubuntu developers aren't.

615
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,160
They're assuming you're using the kernel they're shipping.

616
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,080
I would imagine that probably factors into some people's thinking.

617
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,520
But you know, it kind of makes it more appealing to me to use an Ubuntu or a Mint with a newer

618
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
kernel.

619
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,240
There must be a downside, though.

620
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,200
So if somebody knows linuxunplug.com slash contact, I assume stuff breaks at some point.

621
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,480
You know, like I could see maybe virtualization or container software thinking you have the

622
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
wrong version of the kernel.

623
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,260
I think you just have to try it and find out.

624
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:59,000
So I'd like to know what you think of our growing hypothesis here that it's perhaps

625
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,640
gaming that's driving this change.

626
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:08,400
Like it is so common now for people to start recommending things like Pop or Manjaro, especially

627
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,840
in the YouTube community.

628
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,120
Like we just saw that with the recent Linux challenge.

629
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,360
People just a couple of years ago led with Ubuntu.

630
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,560
Like do you remember however many years ago when Noah and I did the Linux switch challenge?

631
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
How long ago was that?

632
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Was that 2016?

633
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Maybe.

634
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,440
I mean, it was just it was never a debated topic.

635
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,960
The USB thumb drives that we were handing out had Ubuntu on them.

636
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
It wasn't even a debate.

637
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,400
And it made the most sense because it had the largest network effect.

638
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,600
And I still think it makes probably the best new user distro when you consider that.

639
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,520
Because when you are on Windows, you have the whole world of software and everyone else

640
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,720
is using what you're using.

641
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,360
So there's tons of guides and information, but when you switch to Linux, it's a smaller

642
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
circle.

643
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Yeah.

644
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
And you haven't learned the right terms to Google yet.

645
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,000
So you got to hope that, you know, the generic results match and that's Ubuntu.

646
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,960
And Ubuntu is the biggest supported one out there.

647
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,240
And so I still actually think if new users are going to use Linux, I mean, you know,

648
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,140
Pop and Manjaro get really close because they're the same structure and all of that.

649
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:14,200
But it is interesting how, you know, for the existing Linux user anyway, like, I guess

650
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,700
I have to admit that as gaming has so rapidly improved, again, we still have a long way

651
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
to go, of course.

652
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,800
But now that gaming is so viable, I suppose I might consider thinking about that more

653
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
for my desktop install.

654
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,160
Where in the past, you know what I mean, like I might have a dedicated system or I might

655
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,940
just not care about that so much because I would just do casual gaming.

656
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,520
But if it's really easy to do some pretty good gaming, then yeah, right.

657
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,200
Maybe suddenly that's something you're interested in changing.

658
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,040
Well, you and I have been following the kernel development pretty closely for the last year

659
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
and a half.

660
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,600
And the thing is, there's a lot of cool performance improvements landing on Linux kernel right

661
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
now.

662
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,480
There's been some recent major performance work gone into there.

663
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,160
We cover that stuff in LAN and it makes me so stoked to run a newer kernel.

664
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I want that.

665
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
There's a lot of things.

666
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Totally is.

667
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Totally is.

668
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
All right.

669
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
We can cover, we can follow this up in the post show.

670
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,000
So if you got comments, save it for that or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and

671
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
let us know.

672
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You think we're crazy.

673
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You think we're onto something here.

674
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,520
I'd like to hear your opinion on it.

675
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,660
We do have a spot of housekeeping around here.

676
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,800
I want to say, first of all, thank you so much to our members, UnpluggedCore.com or

677
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,360
our network supporters at Jupiter.party.

678
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,120
You get access to the full live stream, like everything.

679
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,460
It's a whole other show in there, plus no like cutting stuff out, no swearing.

680
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,300
It's like raw, man.

681
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,840
Probably shouldn't put it out there, but we do and we make it available for you in a feed.

682
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,600
But if you're, and if you're a network member, you get access to all of the shows ad free

683
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
out there.

684
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,560
Also, I want to say thank you to the people who've been using the new value for value

685
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,600
payments in their podcast app via lightning.

686
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,280
We got helipads set up this week and now we can read messages as they boost in real time.

687
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
It's so cool.

688
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,920
And it makes a little pew pew sound when people boost.

689
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,160
So if you have no idea what I'm talking about, you can go to newpodcastapps.com and go get

690
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
yourself a new podcast app.

691
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,960
But it looks like the most popular one amongst our audience is the fountain podcast app.

692
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,440
Yeah, I'm trying to myself.

693
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,920
And it is a pretty interesting app.

694
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,280
And what's neat about it is they have this little boost mode.

695
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,320
You hit that and you can leave a message and it tells us what episode you're listening

696
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,320
to, which is that's a bit of data we've never gotten before.

697
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Yeah.

698
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Less people self report, right?

699
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
But yeah.

700
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Yeah.

701
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Oh my God.

702
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
That's so cool.

703
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,480
Like it was like all of a sudden we were sitting there and we were working really late.

704
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,800
It was like eight or nine o'clock on a Sunday.

705
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,600
And we had we pulled this thing up and right then somebody sent in a boost.

706
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,240
And it was like all of our moods.

707
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,000
I called Brenton from the garage.

708
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He was working.

709
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He was working on the rack.

710
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,320
I called Brenton.

711
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,640
We all like looked at the boost because the first time we brought a helipad and it changed

712
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
our night.

713
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,920
You know, it's not like it's like it's not a bunch of money, right?

714
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,560
They're just a few sats.

715
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,800
But it's so cool to see those messages coming in real time as people are listening.

716
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Yeah.

717
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
And some of you are so sweet.

718
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,240
Yeah, there was some really nice messages in there, too.

719
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,400
And helipad lets us read them.

720
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
So that's pretty neat.

721
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,160
I think we'll do that on future live streams.

722
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,560
Our community on Matrix has grown like crazy.

723
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,720
Linux Unplugged dot com slash Matrix, if you want to join that, we'd love to have you join

724
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
us over there.

725
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
And we have several rooms.

726
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,540
We have rooms for each of the show.

727
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,520
We have a crypto chat where people are having rational, level headed, honest conversations

728
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,440
about crypto currencies, even during a crash.

729
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,920
And all that's going down at Linux Unplugged dot com slash Matrix.

730
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,480
And you can join us over there.

731
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,920
And I suppose I'll plug the fact that we'd love to have you join our Mumble room because

732
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,000
we got the Luplug.

733
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,480
We've got this year's show that we do live.

734
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,120
We do other events in Mumble.

735
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,460
Details Linux Unplugged dot com slash Mumble.

736
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,440
And you can hang out with us on Tuesdays.

737
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,880
We've been doing a little live stream here and there.

738
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,640
And every now and then we put them out as an extra, too.

739
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,280
Hey, it's just a, you know, a friendly community of nerdy people.

740
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
That's right.

741
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,920
What's not to like?

742
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,760
So the air the airline lost Brent's mailbag.

743
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
You hear about this?

744
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
No.

745
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
Yeah.

746
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Those airlines, you just can't trust them.

747
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,360
Yeah, I guess I still don't really understand why you're putting all of the feedback out

748
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,120
on that thermal printer and carrying it around with you.

749
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,360
We could just save it on security, security, Chris.

750
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Maybe.

751
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
OK, I guess.

752
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,960
Just doesn't seem like a good way to do it, Brent.

753
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,360
You know, I will say I had to start my fire with something and I ran out of fire starters

754
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,040
and you know, just saying.

755
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,440
We do have a pick for you this week, though.

756
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
This is so cool.

757
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,840
Like if it was just one of these, it'd be worth it for the pick segment.

758
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,760
But this is a suite of tools called SSH tools.

759
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,000
Yeah, you heard me.

760
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's right.

761
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,880
And the first one alone, I feel like, is completely pick worthy.

762
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,680
It's called SSH ping and it checks to see if a host is reachable via SSH.

763
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Like are your log in failing?

764
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,200
Is there is it, you know, denying you and is the syntax is exactly what you'd expect.

765
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,520
So SSH ping, then the number of times, so like dash three for three pings and then the

766
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
host.

767
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,320
And then it checks to see if it can get connected on that port and it tells you like the same

768
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,840
kind of output you get from ping.

769
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,360
Yeah, it looks just the same.

770
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,280
And over here, my terminal, it's got some nice colors, too.

771
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
So that's handy.

772
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Oh, really?

773
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Yeah.

774
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
A few other nice tools, though.

775
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
Like I'm just I'm like an SSH fax.

776
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Yes.

777
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,640
And that's just, you know, what's what's the deal with this machine print out a handy little

778
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,720
print out about what the service running, disks available, memory, that kind of thing.

779
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,080
That is my that is my other favorite one.

780
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,200
It's also just a great way to figure out what your machines are advertising via SSH.

781
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
So that one is really cool.

782
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,440
So that one's called SSH dash fax.

783
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,760
And then, of course, there's also SSH host keys, which prints the server host keys in

784
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,120
a couple of different ways to read that.

785
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:43,960
You got SSH key info in here, a bunch of other ones, including SSH force, which enforces

786
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,000
password authentication, even if they do have a key.

787
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I mean, all that stuff.

788
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's really neat.

789
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,520
And they have packages for a bunch of different distros, including 2204 and a bunch of other

790
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
systems.

791
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

792
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,040
Also, it's just bash so you can download it from GitHub if that's your style.

793
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Oh, look at you.

794
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Is that what you did?

795
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I assume.

796
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
Indeed.

797
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
That sounds like US pain.

798
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,240
You maniac.

799
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,160
I have no idea what we're going to talk about next week because I haven't been able to square

800
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:16,320
like how are we going to do a meetup and an episode like, right.

801
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,640
So we're going to figure that out.

802
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,120
I don't know exactly because I think so.

803
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,520
I think we're going to homework now.

804
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
Yeah.

805
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
So that's going to be our that's going to be our job.

806
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,880
But if you can make it, we'd love to see you come hang out with maybe bring a topic as

807
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,880
well as a snack.

808
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,640
That would be pretty great.

809
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,200
But I know it's such a it's such a long shot for people to make it.

810
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,780
But honestly, we just really want to see people.

811
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,080
It's been a while.

812
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,920
That's how long I can make it between road trips and meetups and stuff.

813
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
I've made my.

814
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
The audience is amazing.

815
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
And we miss you.

816
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
That's true.

817
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
That's true.

818
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
All right.

819
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
And we'd love to hear more from you to Linux.

820
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Unplugged dot com slash contact.

821
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
We'll probably have your feedback next week.

822
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,440
You can also join us live.

823
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,040
We do this now on Sundays.

824
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,120
You start around noon Pacific.

825
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
See you next week.

826
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,160
Same bad time, same bad station.

827
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,400
And be sure to catch Linux action news to find out everything that's going on now.

828
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,960
It's released on Thursdays and we're capturing what's going on right there in the week.

829
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
I'm liking it.

830
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,080
Turns out we really nailed the kind of timing as far as the news cycle goes.

831
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
It's been nice.

832
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,800
And we'd love to have you join us.

833
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Linux action news dot com.

834
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,880
We put it out every single week.

835
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,160
Links to what we talked about today at Linux unplugged dot com.

836
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
What else, Wes?

837
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
What else do we got to mention?

838
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Hmm.

839
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Live.

840
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Did that.

841
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Did that.

842
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,160
If it's been a while since you checked out the extras feed, now's the time to catch up.

843
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
No kidding.

844
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,160
That is.

845
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,520
See, the man knows.

846
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
Extras dot show for that.

847
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode and we'll see you right back here

848
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,400
next Sunday.

849
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:21,520
Hey, Brent, could you step over a little closer here?

850
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
We need to.

851
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Yeah, I got to get in the cone.

852
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,600
The cone of silence.

853
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,560
We got a we got a major problem, guys.

854
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Major problem.

855
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,560
I didn't want the audience to hear this.

856
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
There's a leak is there?

857
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
No, no.

858
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,160
That would be a big problem.

859
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,600
But I don't I don't I don't want to tell the audience this, but I don't think the Sunday

860
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,200
crew is as good at making the titles like the Tuesday crew was.

861
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,200
I don't want to throw shade.

862
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,000
I know how they're going to take that.

863
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,240
So I don't know what we should.

864
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,760
We got to come up with a way to inspire them.

865
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,480
Some sort of title contest.

866
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,520
I mean, this title is.

867
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,520
Are you seeing this?

868
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
Yeah.

869
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Anyways, we got a post show to do.

870
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:15,840
The cone of silence.
