1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Okay, all right, so I wanna talk about

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,360
tools that we can't live without.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,220
So today started a very interesting day.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,480
I woke up and the first thing that happened

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,440
was every device in the house is going off with alerts.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,920
And the alert was that my kids are not going to school today

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,200
because they can't in school.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,660
Okay, all right, that's fine.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,840
And then the next set of alerts

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,360
were all of the places that are closed,

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,760
the city offices and stuff like that.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,800
And then the alerts after all of that

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
were in our ticketing system

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,480
where a bunch of businesses were like,

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,320
well, we're not open today.

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,920
This would be a great day to rip out

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,800
key parts of our infrastructure and replace it

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,080
because we're not gonna be using them.

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,920
Of course.

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,040
So yeah, so my day is quickly filling up.

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
And I thought, okay, well, I need to prepare

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,480
for Linux Unplugged today.

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,040
And I need some time to get everything set up in the studio.

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,080
So I'm gonna get in my car,

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,040
I'm gonna go drive to the studio

26
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,540
and I'll take care of that.

27
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,800
Well, I step out of my front door

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,800
and my foot just goes about a foot down.

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,080
And there's like a foot of snow, yeah.

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,040
And so I'm not taking my car.

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,800
I'm gonna go to the Jeep, take the Jeep, go to back out.

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,280
I cannot get out of my driveway

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,340
because the snow plow has come down the street

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,040
and pushed all the snow that's in the street

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,880
into my driveway.

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Nicely building a blockade for you.

37
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,080
Yeah, now I can't get into the driveway at all.

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,040
So I think, all right,

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
so I'm gonna go start the snow blower

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,560
and I will blow out my driveway,

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
then I will get into my car, then I will drive to work

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,320
and then I will fix all the problems

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,200
so that I can then go start Linux Unplugged.

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,720
Snow blower doesn't start.

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,580
Now there's something wrong with the carburetor.

46
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,520
So I'm not gonna work on the carburetor

47
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,200
in 15 degree weather with 40 mile an hour wind

48
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,480
buried in snow, you drop parts, you lose them.

49
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,400
So the only thing I can do

50
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
is I take the snow blower into my kitchen,

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,040
which my wife is thrilled about.

52
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,640
So I'm disassembling this carburetor in my kitchen.

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
I clean the carburetor,

54
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
I get everything put back together

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,840
and I'm not gonna take it outside and test it

56
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,040
only to find out something doesn't work

57
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
and bring it back in, right?

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
Yeah, right, like bundle up just to go outside, test it.

59
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,240
So I put some gas in and I start it up

61
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,060
and it starts right up.

62
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,200
So I did a good job fixing the carburetor

63
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,780
but then it dawns on me that exhaust

64
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,440
is going pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

65
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,680
and just like every puff is just filling the kitchen.

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,480
Well, I don't wanna shut the snow blower off

67
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,440
because I just spent three hours getting it started.

68
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,080
So I take my snow blower running through my house

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,060
and push it out the door, blow out the driveway

70
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,120
and eventually I end up,

71
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,080
a bunch of other bad things happen too.

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
Right, that was obstacle one of many.

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah, that was obstacle one of like 10, right.

74
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,880
But it made me start to think,

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,100
what are tools that we can't live without?

76
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,000
Today for me, it was a snow blower.

77
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 174

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,900
for December 6th, 2016.

79
00:02:49,900 --> 00:03:05,480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

80
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,000
that fought the weather, sacrificed a laptop

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,600
and built a computer all within the last hour

82
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,360
to be here with you today.

83
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,520
My name is Noah and joining me remotely

84
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,560
from Seattle this time is Wes.

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,400
Hey Wes, how are you?

86
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,960
Hey guys.

87
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,120
I'm doing great, it's a pleasure to be with you here.

88
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,720
Thank you for being the host today.

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,760
Okay, I'll be honest with you,

90
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
I appreciate the effort you took to be here

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,680
but let's be honest, I put in more effort to be here today.

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,720
I do think that's fair.

93
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,440
It sounds like you had quite the day, Noah.

94
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,960
I almost died.

95
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,680
Like basically like that followed me.

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
Yeah, that's just almost followed me.

97
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,360
That's bad for the network.

98
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,440
At every turn, it was crazy.

99
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,640
Do you know what I am excited about though, Wes?

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,880
I bet it's our giant show today.

101
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,240
Our giant show that revolves around Linux.

102
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,200
And specifically Fedora, we're gonna be talking with,

103
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,760
we're gonna be talking about Fedora

104
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,480
and some potential changes they're making.

105
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,560
Now, these are speculation.

106
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,940
It's just speculation at this point.

107
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,360
There's no confirmed, there's no confirmation

108
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,220
that any of this is going to happen.

109
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,080
And it is possible that Matt Miller might stop by.

110
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,880
We spoke with him and he thought he might have some time

111
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,640
and so he might be here with us later in the show

112
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
to talk about some of the speculation

113
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,860
and what Fedora is up to.

114
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,480
So, quick recap, I have been a Fedora user

115
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,560
since version Uno, since the very first version of Fedora.

116
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Basically forever.

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,200
Yes, I was using Red Hat back when it was Red Hat

118
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,360
and then they did the split

119
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,200
and they did RHEL, Red Hat Enterprise Linux

120
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,160
and they did Fedora.

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,040
And I was there when that split happened

122
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,380
and I have used every single version of Fedora

123
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,920
from Fedora one on up.

124
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Now, somewhere around Fedora, 2021-ish, somewhere in there,

125
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,040
the direction of my company started to push me

126
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,120
in a direction that required me

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,340
to use a little bit more Ubuntu.

128
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,120
And so, I hate distro hopping inside of my own home.

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,780
I hate having one computer that works one way

130
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,860
and one computer that works the other way

131
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,700
in different software.

132
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,880
It's hard to have that inconsistency

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,200
in your day-to-day life.

134
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,040
It is.

135
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,120
And when you sit down to do something,

136
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
I want things to work the same.

137
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,360
And so, I had kind of moved myself

138
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
a little bit away to Ubuntu

139
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,640
but my main big workhorse downstairs always ran Fedora.

140
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,880
The thing I did most of my work on had always run Fedora.

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,680
And recently, I wiped every computer I owned,

142
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,940
at least that I use personally, and put Arch on them.

143
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,440
You can follow that in the Linux action show.

144
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,840
We talked about it a couple different times.

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,320
Some of the challenges I ran into.

146
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,420
But I still had a Fedora machine

147
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,600
and upgraded that recently to Fedora 25.

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,320
And again, you can check out our review of Fedora 25

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,400
in Linux action show.

150
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,120
But my real reason for going to Arch over Fedora

151
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,520
was the update cycle.

152
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,440
And I got a lot of criticism from that.

153
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,120
A lot of people wrote in, they said,

154
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,800
you're complaining about the Fedora

155
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,240
six-month support cycle, but you went to Arch,

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,800
which literally has like a one-day support.

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,160
I mean, every day there's new updates

158
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
and you have to push them, right?

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,640
So it doesn't seem to be very consistent.

160
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,360
The problem is, and I spoke about this

161
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,720
in our last review of Fedora, I don't trust their updates.

162
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,060
I don't trust updating from one version to the next,

163
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,900
upgrading, I should say.

164
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,920
So for you, it then means a reinstall.

165
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,440
It does, it means a Nuke and pay.

166
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,520
And the obvious problem with doing that

167
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,000
is I don't have time to Nuke and pay my system

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,640
every six months or every year even.

169
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,800
I could do it every five years,

170
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,440
but I'm not willing to do it every year.

171
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,720
In fact, really, to be perfectly honest,

172
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,360
I probably get a new laptop every five years.

173
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,360
So I have always wanted Fedora to go to an LTS-like version

174
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,240
and there hasn't, and at the same time,

175
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,040
there's a lot of people that have been pushing

176
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,040
for the Fedora project to go the rolling style,

177
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,280
which I have questioned because I don't know

178
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,240
where Fedora would fit in then,

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,360
especially when you kind of compare that to Arch, right?

180
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,520
It might change its place

181
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,720
in the Linux distribution ecosystem.

182
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,360
The folks at Red Hat will tell you

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
that Fedora is bleeding edge, and I don't agree.

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,440
I think Fedora is leading edge,

185
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
and I would classify something like Arch

186
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,580
as truly bleeding edge.

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,280
And so to take Fedora to rolling,

188
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,720
I don't know that that makes a lot of sense,

189
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,740
but I know there's a lot of people

190
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,440
that would like to see that project take that route.

191
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Now, Matt Miller wrote a phenomenal post

192
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,380
on a mailing list here.

193
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,720
And basically, he talks about how he's really pushing

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,300
for a change in the release cadence of Fedora.

195
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
And if I'm understanding this right,

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
and I've done a little bit of research,

197
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,560
if I'm understanding this right,

198
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,660
there are two major changes that would be occurring.

199
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,660
The first would be that raw hide

200
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,740
is going to become the gated rolling release,

201
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,020
and the release will deviate,

202
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,980
he says, and the release deviate from it

203
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,500
by stability and life cycle.

204
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,400
This is essentially what SUSE has done

205
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,640
with Tumbleweed and Leap respectively.

206
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,060
So my understanding is they're going to break it off

207
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,060
and have essentially two Fedora versions.

208
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,860
He goes on to write and he says,

209
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,060
what if instead of a two year release cycle,

210
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,060
we updated the core on a cycle aligned with the kernel,

211
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,100
so roughly every three months,

212
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,140
and had just one June release of Fedora workstation

213
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,500
and Fedora server every year,

214
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,660
with an optional one update in November or December.

215
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,940
Fedora would keep its two week updates

216
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,160
as a rolling release.

217
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,720
This seems huge to me.

218
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,540
I'm interested to see what you think, Les.

219
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,740
Yeah, it does sound,

220
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,300
it is a very different model of how to do it.

221
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,460
I do kind of like that cycle aligned with the kernel.

222
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,580
It seems to work well for the kernel community.

223
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,380
Obviously there's a big difference between a distribution

224
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,500
and releasing the kernel,

225
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,660
especially not necessarily the LTS kernel

226
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,760
or anything like that.

227
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,900
But I do appreciate how much the Fedora represents

228
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,980
kind of Linux next on the desktop, in the gnome world,

229
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,440
a lot of things like that.

230
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,740
System tools that they had system D early,

231
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,080
they have Wayland now.

232
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,020
And so it would kind of,

233
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,980
I could see myself doing that.

234
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,260
It's not quite the burden of Arch,

235
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,980
it's not that model,

236
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,740
but it does give you fresh packages, fresh kernels.

237
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,260
It seems like a really good thing to build a workstation

238
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,340
where you're willing to update,

239
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,660
but you want new tools and you want the new hotness.

240
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,140
Right, right, exactly.

241
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,420
And the thing is, and I struggle with this from time to time

242
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,940
because sometimes I struggle to really articulate

243
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,980
why I value this.

244
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,580
But to me, there is an inherent value in having a company

245
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,860
that's backed by a billion dollars or more really.

246
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,740
I think they're approaching 2 billion

247
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,500
or they've made 2 billion,

248
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,260
backing the Linux distribution that you're using.

249
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,660
And if I could go into a client and say, look,

250
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,300
cause I mean, here's the reality.

251
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,940
We can fight about distributions all day long.

252
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,660
Nobody has ever gotten fired for putting RHEL on a server.

253
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,340
They are, in 2016, they are like the IBM of computers.

254
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,140
So 15 years ago, you bought an IBM computer

255
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,300
and you sold somebody IBM computers

256
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,920
and you stuck them in their office.

257
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,460
Nobody ever got fired for doing that.

258
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,940
That was just, that was a very sensible, solid choice.

259
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,500
And RHEL keeps that.

260
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,240
There's an expense associated with it,

261
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,980
but it's a good, solid choice

262
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,560
from a technical perspective.

263
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,500
Now, if I could go into a client and say, look,

264
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,020
you have, you know, whatever, 15, 20, you know,

265
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,460
the University of New York, Dakota, for example,

266
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,000
has a cluster of Red Hat servers, right?

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,520
If I could go in there and say, look,

268
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,340
you guys are running Red Hat on these servers,

269
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,220
the same company will back a distribution

270
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,240
that is designed for the desktop.

271
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,980
One of the things I hear all the time

272
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,100
when we get in, when we have this discussion is,

273
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,860
well, why don't you just use Red Hat on the desktop?

274
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,220
Why don't you just use CentOS on the desktop?

275
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,100
And the reality is, the distribution

276
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,340
is not tailored for desktop use.

277
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,500
It does, it's not easy to install things like VLC.

278
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,040
It's not easy to install things like, you know,

279
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,700
I don't know specifically because I haven't tried,

280
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,460
but I know VLC is a huge pain point,

281
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,460
but it is just not optimized for desktop applications

282
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,020
because it's not designed to be a desktop operating system.

283
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,420
It's designed to be a workstation.

284
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,260
Sure, right.

285
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,540
Yeah, maybe, yeah, work fine,

286
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,320
maybe where you're running, you know, instrumentation

287
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,520
for a scientific tool or machine tool,

288
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,900
but not for something that end users need to use.

289
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,380
They might need to use the tool of the day,

290
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,060
whatever's popular.

291
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,660
You know, calculations, stuff like that,

292
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,380
that workstations will, the workstation will do fine.

293
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,820
Photo editing, video editing,

294
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,580
like installing Lightworks, for example.

295
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,300
We're talking about that in the pre-show, right?

296
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,460
Installing Lightworks on CentOS,

297
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
I will get no help from Red Hat because it's,

298
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,700
they're gonna say that's not what it's for,

299
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,100
and I will get no help from EditShare.

300
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,980
So using the, so we can rule out using Red Hat

301
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,180
on the desktop, except for extremely rare circumstances.

302
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,960
We need a enterprise grade desktop, though,

303
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,860
that we can use, and right now,

304
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,420
I don't feel like we have it.

305
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,700
That should be the promise of Ubuntu,

306
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,140
but every release of Ubuntu seems to be getting worse.

307
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,220
Either they don't move forward at all,

308
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,360
or in the case of 16.04, they break key components

309
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,620
that I need to make the desktop work, i.e. wireless.

310
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,220
I don't have wireless in 16.04,

311
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,100
and that wasn't fixed in 16.10.

312
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,100
So the prospect that Fedora would be moving to a system

313
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,580
in which we would have two versions,

314
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,240
one would be kind of LTS-like,

315
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,980
and the other would be rolling,

316
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,480
seems brilliant for a couple of reasons.

317
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,580
One of the things that originally drew me to Fedora

318
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,420
was that I could find out what was going to happen

319
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,860
on the server on my desktop first,

320
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,100
and play with it, and experience the pain,

321
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,820
and then watch those problems get resolved,

322
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,620
and then when it went into production,

323
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,980
we were all ready for that.

324
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,100
If I could do the same thing,

325
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,140
I could run rolling on my laptop,

326
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,820
but put my clients on the LTS version,

327
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,220
or whatever they call it, that would be huge.

328
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,500
That would be game-changing.

329
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,460
And I'll make a vow right now, Linux Unplugged,

330
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,340
at 4.37 in the afternoon Central Time,

331
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,220
if Red Hat decides to do this,

332
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,700
even if it's a year or two year support.

333
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,720
It'd have to be more than that though,

334
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,760
because I can't reinstall every year.

335
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,460
But if we could get anything above like two years,

336
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,580
I'll switch every computer I own back to Fedora.

337
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,100
100% of them will run Fedora,

338
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,020
and 100% of my servers will continue to run CentOS.

339
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,220
What do you think, Wes?

340
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,480
You know, that does sound interesting.

341
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm also struck by some parallels

342
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,980
in terms of some of the benefits here.

343
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,300
They talk about more time for QA and release engineering.

344
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,740
I know like in the software industry,

345
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,700
we have seen that as well,

346
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,180
a push towards continuous integration,

347
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,020
a push towards continuous delivery,

348
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,100
where you're adding, you have small changes,

349
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,340
but you're iterating quickly,

350
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,860
but when you make those changes,

351
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,700
they're fresh in your mind,

352
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,220
you can go fix them as soon as you notice problems.

353
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,040
So that strikes me as something that may be beneficial.

354
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,860
I don't know what we'll see out of that LTS,

355
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,780
but I could see if they're continuously working,

356
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,620
they're getting better,

357
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,060
and then are able to kind of cherry pick,

358
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,020
all right, here we go,

359
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,860
this is a great stack that we've got ourselves on,

360
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,920
we found ourselves in a really good place,

361
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,260
everything's working well, support this for some time.

362
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,100
It might work better than the release model now,

363
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,580
which it seems like maybe they've struggled with

364
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,260
a little bit, they're not always released,

365
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,100
you know, we've talked a lot about on this network,

366
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,340
a lot about like, you know,

367
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,480
after a couple of weeks or a month,

368
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,660
then yes, it's really solid,

369
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,860
you've got everything that you can use.

370
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,180
If we can get away from that,

371
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,980
it seems like it'd be a good thing.

372
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
I agree.

373
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,740
Mumble Room, what do you guys think?

374
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,200
Well, I mean, it kind of sounds like

375
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,860
the same thing OpenSUSE has been doing for a year.

376
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,700
Yeah, it does.

377
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,100
What do you think about,

378
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,580
so you are or were an OpenSUSE user,

379
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,220
I believe you're using KDE Neon right now, right?

380
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,220
Yeah, I'm using Neon now.

381
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,000
What do you think of the comparison

382
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,780
between the company that backs Suice Linux

383
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,340
and the company that backs Fedora?

384
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,580
How do you draw that parallel and say,

385
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,460
well, or how do you view that and say,

386
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,140
well, I trust this company more than that company,

387
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,060
or I think this company does a better job

388
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,860
at paying attention to the community than that one.

389
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,340
Where do you fall on that?

390
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,460
I think they both are pretty close in community aspects,

391
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,240
and I think they're both fairly large

392
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,740
in the sense of different parts of the world.

393
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,620
Red Hat's more North America,

394
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,240
whereas Europe is more dominated by SUSE.

395
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,020
But the only thing I would say

396
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,440
that makes me slightly hesitant of SUSE versus Red Hat

397
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,720
is that Red Hat is owned by Red Hat,

398
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,460
and SUSE is owned by who knows any of that right now.

399
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,260
It's like Novell purchased them,

400
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,340
and then that was then sold again,

401
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,100
so it's kind of weird that that slight hesitation from that,

402
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,900
but other than that, they're both solid in the same ways.

403
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,940
Except for also, Fedora is not using rail packages.

404
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,200
They even say that they're not compatible with each other.

405
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,220
Oh, yes, right.

406
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,820
OpenSUSE is actually using sleep packages,

407
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,340
so you kind of have the more enterprise workstation

408
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,420
type desktop with the OpenSUSE approach.

409
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,460
I'll be very honest with you.

410
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,540
About the time, and it was around,

411
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,900
I'll tell you exactly when it was too, Fedora 15,

412
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,100
about the time that they started to do this split

413
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,620
where Fedora was no longer really going to be

414
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,740
what the next version of RHEL is going to be,

415
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,920
or you know, well, a couple of versions,

416
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,660
because RHEL, you know, a couple years in between.

417
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,620
About that time that they made that switch

418
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,400
was about the time that Fedora started to become

419
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,260
less appealing to me, and as a system administrator,

420
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,580
that was something I really appreciated,

421
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,380
so I thought that they gave up something huge,

422
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,860
but at the same time, I think that it reflects well

423
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,900
on Red Hat as a company that they are willing

424
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,320
to let the Fedora team, the Fedora project,

425
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,520
be its own project.

426
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,700
It's not just the beta grounds for RHEL.

427
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,060
It is its own distro.

428
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,980
It's its own project, and so I think that reflects well

429
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,780
on them, though from a corporate business,

430
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,420
I need to make money, and this was a tool

431
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,380
that I used to facilitate that.

432
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,380
I was a little unhappy about it.

433
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,080
Do you think that SUSE is becoming any less relevant?

434
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,980
Actually, I think SUSE is becoming more relevant,

435
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,060
specifically for their switch, their infrastructure

436
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,060
of the leap and tumbleweed approach.

437
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,220
Like, before those happened, which has only been a year,

438
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,580
like, they've only had two leap releases,

439
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,340
42.1 and 42.2, and that was only like a month ago

440
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,740
they had the second release.

441
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,820
Actually, less than a month, like three weeks ago.

442
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,240
So they've been becoming much more and more

443
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,260
getting attention and just more relevant in the community

444
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,780
because of this massive change,

445
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,740
because it is revolutionary at the time,

446
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,820
and it's still, it's kind of like getting people

447
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,060
to consider other things, and especially like

448
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,080
their infrastructure of open QA.

449
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,520
Like, there are people from Fedora saying

450
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,140
that it's amazing, and they would love to use it,

451
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,940
but it doesn't work for their stuff, so they don't.

452
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,660
But if like more people hear about the stuff

453
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,680
that OpenSUSE is doing, it's just gonna continue

454
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,580
to improve in their, I guess, market share.

455
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,340
Do you think that those changes that they're making

456
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,140
and the ability to run that rolling

457
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,060
or run more of a stable platform,

458
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,260
do you think that that increases the saleability,

459
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,320
so to speak, to businesses?

460
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,620
Like if you're a new business,

461
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,540
you're a new business, you're starting up,

462
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,380
do you think that gives them a competitive advantage

463
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,300
over other distributions?

464
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,940
Absolutely, well, not only in certain cases,

465
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,940
like as far as like server stuff,

466
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,660
if you're gonna use SLE, that you can use,

467
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,280
you can have that connection between your desktop

468
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,660
and your enterprise, and your servers

469
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,500
and all this other things.

470
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,740
So you can have like your personal desktop,

471
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,020
or you can have a rolling desktop that also uses SLE,

472
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,340
and also some parts that SLE uses parts of Tumbleweed,

473
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,180
things like that.

474
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,840
Like it's a really interesting infrastructure

475
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,680
that they're doing.

476
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,160
The only problem in the OpenSUSE case

477
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,160
is that Leap doesn't have very long support.

478
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,060
Like I think it's a total of 18 months,

479
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,100
which it sounds good, but it means that once a new version

480
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,740
of release, you only have six months to update.

481
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,980
So that's kind of like lackluster,

482
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,420
but overall it's still better than,

483
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,080
you know, it's not five years,

484
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,460
but at least it's almost two years, so.

485
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,820
Would the argument that you could try on the desktop

486
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,860
and run on the server not also stand true

487
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,500
for Fedora workstation and Fedora server,

488
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,380
and Ubuntu desktop and Ubuntu?

489
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,740
If you're using Fedora, yes.

490
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,900
More, Ubuntu's more in line,

491
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,480
because like the server packages

492
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,500
and the desktop packages for Ubuntu

493
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,300
are essentially in the same repo

494
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
and the same compatibility structure,

495
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,860
whereas Fedora, they split stuff off

496
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,740
so that if you're gonna use Fedora server, great,

497
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,820
but if you're gonna use CentOS or Red Hat, not really.

498
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,520
Yeah, yeah, there's definitely a difference.

499
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,140
You know, when we were doing our review

500
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,340
or our How to Pick a Distro,

501
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,060
which is the last episode of Linux Action Show,

502
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,780
Chris and I did, and you know,

503
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,340
I think really that was one of my favorite episodes

504
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,800
I think that we've ever done.

505
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,940
I think that, because both Chris and I come at it

506
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,380
from very different perspectives,

507
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,420
and it was interesting that we both kind of gravitated

508
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,740
and arrived at kind of the same conclusions,

509
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,240
which kind of gives me a big head,

510
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,860
and I say to myself, well, clearly,

511
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,780
I think we're doing something right.

512
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,940
I think we've landed on the right way

513
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,320
because somebody that I very much respect, his opinion,

514
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,440
has arrived at the same conclusion.

515
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,980
And one thing we didn't really get to

516
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,620
was I had divided that post out.

517
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,980
He basically asked, how do you choose a distro?

518
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,380
And I said, well, basically, I would divide that out,

519
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,300
desktop users, server users, power users,

520
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,620
development users, and specialty distro users,

521
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,440
and we focused then on desktop distributions

522
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,300
because that's what the original post was asking.

523
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,780
But you know, I think server, picking a server distro

524
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,580
has an equal amount of questions,

525
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,180
and I think the conversation that Michael and I

526
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,860
are having right now really exemplify that.

527
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,860
I think there's a lot of good reasons to choose RHEL.

528
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,060
I think there's a lot of good reasons to choose CentOS.

529
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,260
I think there's a lot of good reasons to choose SUS.

530
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,100
And one of the arguments that I have made to every client,

531
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,700
and you know, basically, if you ever watch,

532
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
if you ever know somebody that's in the military,

533
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,860
and they were assigned a specific weapon system,

534
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,780
a lot of those guys will go buy similar weapon systems

535
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,840
when they get home to shoot

536
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,040
because they're very comfortable on it,

537
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,700
they were trained on it, and they're very accurate with it,

538
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,260
and this, that, and so forth.

539
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,100
And I've had conversations with them,

540
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,340
and I would say, why would you use that particular rifle

541
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
in this particular scenario?

542
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,020
It doesn't seem like it really fits very well.

543
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,680
And they say, well, I'm very comfortable with it.

544
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,100
And that actually kind of rings true

545
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,780
because I started on Red Hat,

546
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,460
and so I'm just very comfortable with Red Hat.

547
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,040
And so when I go in, anytime I set up a server,

548
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,180
it's just Red Hat.

549
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,900
And one of the things that works so well for me

550
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,020
is being able to go into a client and saying,

551
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,440
hey, listen, I tell you what,

552
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,300
this is a project that you want to do,

553
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,140
and so I'll give you an example.

554
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,940
We were working with the University of North Dakota,

555
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,180
and they wanted to do this chemical calculation server.

556
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,300
So basically, the way it would work

557
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,300
is the students would submit these chemical values,

558
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,020
and the server would do all of the crunching.

559
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,700
Now, they bought like this $28,000.

560
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,140
I mean, it was crazy, just crazy.

561
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,660
Custom build, everything was just amazing.

562
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,900
And they were trying to decide

563
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,020
if they were gonna contract with us

564
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,520
to set this particular server up.

565
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,500
And I said, well, listen, we have a lot of experience,

566
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,580
probably more than anyone else

567
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,780
in the Grand Forks surrounding area,

568
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,580
in setting up Linux and working with Linux,

569
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,940
and I will tell you that not only is this possible,

570
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,140
but we can make this amazing for your students.

571
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,100
We can put it on a public network and give it a public IP,

572
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,060
and your students will be able to access this box from home

573
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,340
and submit their chemical calculations from home

574
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,300
and submit them from anywhere.

575
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,420
And they said, we don't know about that.

576
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,380
Is it secure enough?

577
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,220
Is it really gonna work?

578
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,340
And I said, all right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

579
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,620
I will give you, for the first month,

580
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,580
I will give you a server to use.

581
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,300
And they said, you have a $28,000 server?

582
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,180
And I said, well, not exactly,

583
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,180
but I tell you what I do have.

584
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,620
I have access to some really powerful machines,

585
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,460
and I will give you access to one for free for a month,

586
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,780
and you try it, and if it works, then you call me back,

587
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,880
and I will come set your server up the exact same way.

588
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,580
And they said, oh, okay, that's great.

589
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,940
When can we get that rolling?

590
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,820
Next week, next month?

591
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,140
And I said, no, right now.

592
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,460
I'm gonna do it right now for you.

593
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,940
So I opened my laptop up,

594
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,500
and I went over to digitalocean.com,

595
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,300
and I used the code for DO Unplugged.

596
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,340
And they gave me $10 credit.

597
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,140
Now, I had to buy a pretty beefy rig

598
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,940
because of the sheer amount of bandwidth

599
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,780
that we were gonna use,

600
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,080
and the sheer amount of CPU power that we needed to use

601
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,500
was gonna be incredible.

602
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,180
So I bought a pretty beefy rig.

603
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,420
It didn't really save me a whole lot,

604
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,420
but if you're doing something like a Plex server,

605
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,620
or if you're doing something like a simple FTP server,

606
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,100
or a web server, or maybe you wanna host your own blog.

607
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,800
Or you're connecting to our IRC room,

608
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
and you're using Quasl,

609
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,980
you wanna have a Quasl core up there,

610
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,940
it's perfect for that.

611
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,260
Exactly, as long as you're not using it for production

612
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,420
so it doesn't crash,

613
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,300
you, at Quasl, not Digitalocean,

614
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,160
you would get two months out of that

615
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,580
because you can do it on a $5 rig.

616
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,300
And if, I'll tell you what, let's do this.

617
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,160
Let's sign into my account right now,

618
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,740
and let's see how many rigs I have

619
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,840
and which ones they are.

620
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,840
I would say the majority of my rigs are $5 ones.

621
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,920
And the reason I say that is

622
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,240
because most of the things I do are pretty simplistic.

623
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,080
So let's see here.

624
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,120
Now this is my personal account.

625
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,340
This is not our company, my AltaSpeed account.

626
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,280
So let's see here.

627
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,120
Yeah, we can tell.

628
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,480
So any of these that say 512,

629
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,880
so that's a $5 server, that's a $5 server,

630
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,560
that's a $5 server, that's a $20 one,

631
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,840
that's a $5 server, that's a $20 one,

632
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,020
that's a $20 one.

633
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,640
The amount of work I'm able to get done

634
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,480
with just a $5 rig is incredible.

635
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
So head over to digitalocean.com,

636
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,760
use the code word DOUNPLUGGED and get yourself $10 off.

637
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,000
You have no idea the world that you are entering into

638
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,400
with hosted VPSs.

639
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,000
You've not played with VPSs.

640
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
You are missing out on like a whole spectrum of Linux.

641
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
You think you like distro hopping

642
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,480
and you think it's fun to do it on your desktop,

643
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,600
just wait until you can do that with a click of a button.

644
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,760
And if you use the Yubi keys,

645
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,920
then that's really where the rubber meets the road.

646
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,660
Let me tell you because I literally click on Noah's SSH key

647
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,520
and then all I have to do is type in the SSH command

648
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,840
in my laptop and it prompts me for a pin.

649
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,740
I enter a four digit pin, no emailing me the password,

650
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,000
which you know they CC the NSA on that stuff too, right?

651
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,480
Like anytime a password goes over the internet,

652
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,560
like basically the NSA is grabbing that.

653
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,060
That's terrible, it's terrible.

654
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,960
So use the Yubi key, way better.

655
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,680
I want to talk about something that I came across

656
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,560
that just made me sit back and go, huh.

657
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,840
I, as I said earlier in the show,

658
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,920
I recently switched to Arch.

659
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,920
So you can imagine my reaction when I saw

660
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,160
that RaspArch is going to be a thing.

661
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Arch Linux on the Raspberry Pi 3 and it ships with York,

662
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,560
which is an important distinction.

663
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,960
I'll get to that in a minute.

664
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,120
That's our thing.

665
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,800
If I have a Raspberry Pi,

666
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,480
usually I am putting a Raspberry on it, right?

667
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
That's just kind of what you,

668
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,320
that's kind of like the go-to of the noobs installer

669
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,040
or whatever, as an Arch user,

670
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,120
being able to choose one distribution

671
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,440
and run it on everything,

672
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,200
now that has been extended,

673
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,500
not only just from my servers to my laptops,

674
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,360
now we can go on a Raspberry freaking Pi.

675
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,160
Michael, were you going to say something?

676
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,840
Yeah, alarm is Arch Linux arm, it already exists.

677
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,120
Oh, but was there a Pi image?

678
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,960
Was there? Yeah.

679
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,600
Was it easy? There's been a Pi image

680
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
since the Raspberry Pi had been.

681
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,960
Are you telling me that Arch for the Pi has existed

682
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,560
and I didn't know about it?

683
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,400
Yes.

684
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
Well, that's embarrassing.

685
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
Technically though, it's a separate distro.

686
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,560
It's not actually made by the Arch Linux group,

687
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,640
but it's the Arch Linux,

688
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,920
Arch Linux has an agreement with the Arch Linux arm project

689
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,020
so that it to use the name.

690
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,360
So they are in conjunction,

691
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,760
but they're not officially,

692
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,800
like Arch Linux is not powering it.

693
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,320
So it's more like-

694
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
Let me ask you this.

695
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,840
Let me ask you this.

696
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,720
Did it come with Yortonstone or Packer?

697
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,540
Any of those?

698
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,380
No.

699
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,440
No, it comes with the ability to do those, yes.

700
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,360
Yeah, right, right, right.

701
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,180
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

702
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,680
So when I first started using Arch,

703
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,760
one of my biggest mistakes was I wasn't aware

704
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,440
of some of the package managers that were out there.

705
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,040
So I was downloading these files and extracting the thing

706
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,360
and doing the make and all that stuff, right?

707
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,300
And after use, one of the things I appreciate

708
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,440
about Antragos and one of the reasons I use Antragos

709
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,680
instead of Arch proper is because it handles some

710
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,760
of that stuff for me.

711
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,160
It comes with Yortonstone.

712
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,800
I don't really like Yort, to be honest,

713
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,120
to ask me too many questions,

714
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,000
but I can simply open a terminal type,

715
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,840
yort-tac-s-packer-enter.

716
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,280
And then once I hit yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no,

717
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,040
yes, yes, no, no, yes, no, yes, no, no, yes, yes, no, no.

718
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,860
It's ridiculous.

719
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,760
And they have to bounce between,

720
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
like I wish I could do all of the edits first

721
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
and then do you want to continue last

722
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,480
so I could like get into the habit of pressing no

723
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,120
a certain amount of times and yes, they don't do that.

724
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,640
Once I get Packer installed,

725
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,440
then I can just move on and Yort makes it very easy

726
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,280
to do that.

727
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,040
I think that all Arch systems,

728
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,720
if you're not actually doing Arch from like scratch,

729
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,940
like the way that you're supposed to do Arch,

730
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,880
I think it should include a package manager of some sort.

731
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,240
And particularly on the Raspberry Pi

732
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
where it takes a long time to compile stuff,

733
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,160
I feel like that's a big, big, big advantage

734
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,760
to have just a built-in package manager.

735
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,680
What do you think?

736
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,640
I just checked,

737
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,160
Yort is not available on Arch Linux arm or alarm,

738
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,200
but Packer is.

739
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,600
Oh.

740
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,800
Packers in the official repos?

741
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,040
Yep.

742
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,480
Nice.

743
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
And being completely honest with you,

744
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,080
I'd actually, I would only use,

745
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,600
Yort to me is only useful to get Packer on there.

746
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,720
Packer is really what I want to use.

747
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,560
Now let me-

748
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,720
I just skipped a step.

749
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,640
Let me draw a contrast because I have a feeling

750
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,800
you're going to be on the other side of this,

751
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,320
and I think that's a good thing.

752
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,120
Seuss has also announced that they have images available

753
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,120
for the Raspberry Pi, specifically Seuss Leap.

754
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,440
And when I first saw this, I guess I was honestly,

755
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,240
if I'm being, you know, if I'm being frank,

756
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,440
I was a little confused.

757
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,360
You know, part of it is the, you know,

758
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,680
the article goes on just, it goes in here and it says that

759
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,080
having a stable code base for leap images,

760
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,720
which provides fewer updates than the tumbleweed

761
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,840
for the Raspberry Pi 3 gives people stability

762
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,200
and expands opportunities for those

763
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,040
who are wanting to use the Raspberry Pi

764
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,800
for home automation.

765
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,800
I am wondering how many people are concerned about stability

766
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,800
from a $35 computer.

767
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,560
Am I missing something?

768
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,400
Yeah.

769
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,440
I mean, I guess, I don't know.

770
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,560
I would use Debian if I was caring about stability.

771
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,440
Right.

772
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,760
Well, so that's the, I mean,

773
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,200
so that's a conversation all in itself, right?

774
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,600
We're using Leap, but I just,

775
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,360
I understand the argument for using Seuss on the server.

776
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,800
It wouldn't be necessarily what I would choose to do.

777
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,920
I don't necessarily think it has enough advantages

778
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,360
to pull me off of Red Hat,

779
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,240
but I could definitely see it if Seuss was already in place

780
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
or if you're a business starting up and there's,

781
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,160
you know, you have somebody,

782
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,520
you know, you hired assistant administrator,

783
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,120
maybe he knows Seuss very well,

784
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,040
or maybe Seuss happens to be the predominant server platform

785
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,920
that a lot of your competitors are using.

786
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
And so a lot of the industry software is written

787
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,840
and works very well.

788
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,440
And, you know, there's a number of arguments

789
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,360
where I can make to see how Seuss works in the enterprise.

790
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,600
I am really not getting it.

791
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,040
Why somebody would want to run Seuss on a,

792
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
like what the compelling reason to run Seuss on a Pi

793
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,680
other than, well, because we can,

794
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,840
which is a perfectly valid reason.

795
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,800
I think you answered it earlier when you were talking about,

796
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,520
you know, that analogy of people leaving the military.

797
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,400
There are people who like to use, you know,

798
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,800
Seuss in production.

799
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,640
And so, you know, if you're also starting to do things

800
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,960
like using in Pis to automate around your office

801
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
or in your home, you know,

802
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,120
that's probably what they're most comfortable with.

803
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,000
And then now you have an option.

804
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,840
I think it's also just nice in the,

805
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,960
just the aspect of the Arm, I don't know for you,

806
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,560
but the Arm world still sometimes a little weird for me,

807
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,880
or, you know, it has different paradigms.

808
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,840
There's different things available.

809
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,960
So the more sort of parity between like the X86 world

810
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
and the Arm world where, you know,

811
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,200
I have the tools and distributions I like here.

812
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,960
And I kind of expect, even if that's a wrong expectation,

813
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,640
I expect to be able to use them in the Arm world

814
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
and the Pi world.

815
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,080
And so this kind of just goes a little way towards that.

816
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Hurricane Hernandez, am I pronouncing that right?

817
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,720
Yeah, you got it.

818
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
Okay, so as you guys know,

819
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm one of the main packagers for Envy.

820
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,720
And when I became a developer,

821
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,000
I mean, I started distro hopping

822
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
and somehow ended up on Seuss

823
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
because I just couldn't get packages

824
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,320
that were up to date on Debian or Ubuntu.

825
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,360
Now, when you bring Seuss and Arm,

826
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I think Seuss becomes even more relevant because of OBS.

827
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,600
The power that OBS gives you is to compile the packages

828
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,080
and anything you're working on their system,

829
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,520
which means you're not bogging down your Pi.

830
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,000
Now I understand Arch and I understand Packer.

831
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,080
And if I'm correct, yeah, I mean,

832
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,520
the AUR most of the time,

833
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,480
you're compiling those packages on that Pi.

834
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,600
So that's gonna be taking a hit on your system.

835
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,680
That might take days.

836
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,520
Right, right.

837
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,440
So I think that's when Seuss now becomes even more relevant

838
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,400
is if you're using a low power system

839
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,400
and OBS is there and available for free to every user.

840
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,200
That's slick.

841
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,040
I like it.

842
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,160
That's a good point.

843
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,000
I guess I can see that.

844
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,840
I guess I can see that

845
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,160
from both a comfortability standpoint

846
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,960
and just a drop in desktop,

847
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,120
like everything is just ready to go for you.

848
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,360
So essentially I go to work and I work on Seuss servers

849
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,120
and then I sit down at my Seuss desktop

850
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,920
that's provided me from me by work.

851
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,880
And so when I get home, I can use that same operating system.

852
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,720
I guess that makes sense.

853
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,080
You can also build and do custom builds on OBS.

854
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,320
So you can have a company specific stuff

855
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,320
being built for you or something like that.

856
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,120
Let me twist it a little bit.

857
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,120
So I guess all of those arguments make sense

858
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,720
from a desktop standpoint.

859
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,040
Do we think that those arguments stand true

860
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,120
if we're talking about like a home server?

861
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,320
Is it still important to have all of that familiar?

862
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,160
Because I mean, you have to think about it.

863
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,480
The Raspberry Pi world is kind of its own bubble

864
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,880
inside of the Linux ecosystem.

865
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,960
And so a lot of people that are making something

866
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,320
that works on the Pi,

867
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,040
they typically you would use the distribution

868
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,880
that they're using, right?

869
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
And you're probably not gonna run more than one service

870
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,120
on a Raspberry Pi,

871
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
and one service is right taxing it to be honest.

872
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,120
So if you're using a whatever,

873
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,200
a home automation controller,

874
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,320
would you not be using whatever distro

875
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,520
the home automation controller people are using

876
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,520
so that you kind of stay in sync with them?

877
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,440
Am I off?

878
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,280
I mean, you may want to.

879
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,080
If you're using an appliance, yes.

880
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,080
But I think there's also, that does happen.

881
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,920
And I think you see those in wider distributions,

882
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,760
but it seems like, at least to me,

883
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,720
that the majority of people who pick up one or two Pis,

884
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,080
they're just playing with a couple of things.

885
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,120
They want custom projects.

886
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,520
Maybe you're writing a little homebrewed script

887
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,320
to run something that prints out

888
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
or sends you messages or whatever.

889
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,200
And in that case, you might just want whatever distribution

890
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,800
is easiest for you to run that code on.

891
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,800
And also people say stuff about how the Pi is not as,

892
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,880
like you only can do one thing.

893
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,720
That's not true.

894
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,000
I mean, you can have a sync service activated

895
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,640
and you can have a full desktop with like Raspbian

896
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,960
and you can have a bunch of other stuff working.

897
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,200
I mean, I have a Pi doing that

898
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,400
and it's not even the newest one.

899
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,480
It's like the model B before the B plus came out.

900
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,800
So years ago. Nice.

901
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,800
So, you know, I have a problem with the Raspberry Pi.

902
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,680
I'm not really with the Raspberry Pi,

903
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,800
but what I call the misuse of Raspberry Pis.

904
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,280
You know, I think the Raspberry Pi

905
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,520
is a great educational tool.

906
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,400
And I think it definitely has some production value.

907
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
And I'll give you an example.

908
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,000
We have a client that has a PBX phone system

909
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,440
and there is an RS232 serial output

910
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,440
that basically dumps every console thing that occurs.

911
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,000
So every time somebody places a call or receives a call

912
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,920
that call gets spit out to RS232.

913
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,160
Well, basically the client wanted to log

914
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,080
all of that information.

915
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,240
And so attaching a Pi and, you know,

916
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,200
pulling that serial output

917
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,320
and just dumping it into a text file was trivial.

918
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,600
In those kinds of circumstances,

919
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,920
I think it works really, really great.

920
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,000
But I have some reservations.

921
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,880
A while back at the Linux Action Show

922
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
was featured a Raspberry Pi

923
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,440
that was being used in a medical device, right?

924
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,680
And I think that we have begun to stretch the limits

925
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,120
of what the Raspberry Pi was intended for

926
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,000
and what it is capable of.

927
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,120
And that is an opinion that formed

928
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,480
after having a very deep discussion with Jason,

929
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,080
who is one of the, he's an ArchArm guy.

930
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,040
And he just, he lives, eats and breathes ARM architecture,

931
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,880
loves it to death.

932
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,680
And can tell you anything you want to know

933
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,880
about every device ever made that is ARM.

934
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,040
Guy knows more about ARM devices that people will make.

935
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,200
I mean, he's incredible.

936
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,960
And he was showing me some of the different ARM devices

937
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,720
that are designed for commercial applications

938
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,840
that are designed to be used as embedded servers

939
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,800
and this, that and the other.

940
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,800
And I have noticed, even on a small scale,

941
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,760
that if you have a Raspberry Pi,

942
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,680
it doesn't seem to run for more than a year or so

943
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,360
without running into some sort of problems.

944
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,520
And I'm wondering, you know, Michael specifically,

945
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,920
have you experienced that?

946
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,640
No, not really, no.

947
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,160
So how long has yours been in production?

948
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,720
How long have you been using it?

949
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,600
Off and on, but I don't have them all the time

950
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
because I don't use it.

951
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,160
Like the syncing is all the time.

952
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,880
I've only been doing that for about six months.

953
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,760
But I've been using the same Pi's.

954
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,000
I've had two Pi's and they're both the same version

955
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,280
and they're both very old.

956
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,840
And I've been using them without any kind of problems at all.

957
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,000
But you've reinstalled.

958
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,480
On one of them, yes.

959
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
The other one is still, one of them runs Kodi

960
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,600
and I haven't reinstalled that one.

961
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,360
Oh, that's interesting.

962
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,920
Well, maybe it's time for Noah to update his opinion.

963
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,640
I think maybe, Noah, where you were coming from is,

964
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,880
you know, it's like you can't really do something

965
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,720
where you need throughput.

966
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,160
It doesn't make a good file server.

967
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,960
You wouldn't edit video on it,

968
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,320
but there may be some things where you really just need

969
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,840
the lowest common denominator of Unix system.

970
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,920
I mean, I tried what I thought was a pretty simple thing,

971
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,400
which was I wanted it to run a Quasso server.

972
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,720
Didn't handle that very well.

973
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,480
Then I tried it just as, if anyone's familiar with OpenEMR,

974
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,200
it's not anything, it's not terribly complicated.

975
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,040
It's basically a web server with a database backend.

976
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,400
And it wasn't like it was in production or anything

977
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,220
with a lot of users.

978
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,780
It was just me, me and my wife.

979
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,440
We were both trying and she does billing

980
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,080
for some of the clinics that I do IT support for.

981
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,800
And we tried it between us and it couldn't handle that.

982
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,640
It would crash.

983
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,360
I'd get a year out of it,

984
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,400
but a little bit after that it would crash.

985
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,040
And so it just kind of turned me off from the pies.

986
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
And I was actually voicing that frustration to Jason.

987
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,840
And then that's kind of where

988
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,440
that whole conversation transpired.

989
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,600
But you guys are giving me a new hope.

990
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,960
And I'll tell you kind of what that hope is.

991
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,080
It's that the small arm devices,

992
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,840
you can combine them with other little pieces of hardware

993
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,720
and produce very, very cool things.

994
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,400
So you were talking about a USB serial port.

995
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,360
One of the things I've always thought about doing

996
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
is taking one of those raspberry pies

997
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,640
and combining it with one of those like USB GSM modems,

998
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,040
and then heading over to linux.ting.com.

999
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,120
I can't get over that URL.

1000
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,620
It's such a great URL, linux.ting.com,

1001
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,600
where they'll give me basically

1002
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,440
three months of service for free

1003
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,260
because they're gonna give you 25 bucks.

1004
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,140
And I have so many Ting devices.

1005
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,700
I would load it on here for you,

1006
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,240
but they wouldn't all fit on the screen.

1007
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,000
That's how many Ting devices I have.

1008
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,560
I've got my mother on Ting, I'm on Ting,

1009
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,320
my wife's on Ting, got my dad on Ting.

1010
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,040
And then I have all of these other things.

1011
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,760
I call them auxiliary devices, right?

1012
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,920
Like my laptop has a GSM card in it.

1013
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,900
I would love to put a GSM card

1014
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,320
in one of those little USB modems

1015
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,060
and have a full functioning like all-in-one

1016
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,520
or desktop computer that has its own connection

1017
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,480
to the internet.

1018
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,520
Man, would that be nice to have inside of the shop

1019
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,240
or even here in the studio.

1020
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,560
If I needed to check on something,

1021
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,360
I wanted to check to see if the stream was up.

1022
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,040
Somebody reports an issue says, we can't get the stream.

1023
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Sure be nice to have a secondary internet connection

1024
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,200
just to check that.

1025
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,920
And the thing about Ting is,

1026
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
they only charge you for what you use.

1027
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,440
So if I, I'm not gonna make any calls off my Raspberry Pi,

1028
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,280
I'm not gonna use any voice minutes, so I pay zero.

1029
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,560
I'm not gonna send any text messages.

1030
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,520
The idea that people still send SMS in 2016 is ridiculous.

1031
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,480
Exactly.

1032
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,800
No stickers.

1033
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,440
If you have MMS, which is really kind of a,

1034
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,760
screwed up version of SMS,

1035
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,200
then you could use, you could send pictures.

1036
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,600
There's a stupid character limit, 140 characters.

1037
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,560
Have you guys heard me?

1038
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,040
It's like sending a telegram

1039
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,840
and not the good kind of telegram.

1040
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,200
Have you heard me on any show?

1041
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,440
Do you think I could express any thought at all

1042
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,160
in 140 characters or less?

1043
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,000
It is ridiculous.

1044
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,560
Anyone who knows me knows I'd blab on for hours.

1045
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,560
This episode of Linux Unplugged that you're hearing,

1046
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,880
it probably took Rikai seven hours to cut out

1047
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,280
all of the inconsistent babble

1048
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,200
that occurred throughout the usable bits.

1049
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,120
I can't say anything.

1050
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,880
And so the fact that people still send text messages

1051
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,720
is ridiculous.

1052
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,400
Move on to something like Telegram or Viber,

1053
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,720
whatever you use, but don't use text messages.

1054
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,800
So that's gonna be zero.

1055
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,140
The only thing I'm gonna pay for is the data I use.

1056
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:11,680
And Ting's data rates, they started out crazy good,

1057
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,040
and now they've gotten even better.

1058
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,000
Do you have somebody, one of your friends,

1059
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,280
are they bragging about their Google Fi?

1060
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,520
Well, now Ting has as good, if not better, pricing.

1061
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,120
And let me tell you something,

1062
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,820
you don't have to buy some super special $600 phone

1063
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,700
to use on Ting.

1064
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,780
You can buy any unlocked GSM device.

1065
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,000
Me personally, I bought my last device from Best Buy.

1066
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,920
I walked into Best Buy,

1067
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,060
I went over to their unlocked phone section,

1068
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,840
I picked out a phone, I walked up to the register,

1069
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,360
and I paid for my phone and I walked out,

1070
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,680
and I had an activated phone.

1071
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,640
In fact, the guy at Best Buy actually put my Ting SIM

1072
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,220
into it, and then we had a discussion

1073
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,160
about how great Ting was.

1074
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,760
It was kind of cool.

1075
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,640
You can buy unlocked phones on Amazon,

1076
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,520
you can buy phones on Ting's site.

1077
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Right before Chris took off,

1078
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,080
he was talking about how great it would be

1079
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,160
to buy a phone for your loved one

1080
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,960
or even for yourself for Christmas.

1081
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
Now, I'll tell you something, here's a little,

1082
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,980
here's a pro tip.

1083
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,320
See this, where it says $9 for the SIM?

1084
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,920
That's not what you pay for a SIM.

1085
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,080
If you wait, Ting runs dollar SIM specials.

1086
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,120
Dollar SIMs, you can get a SIM for a dollar.

1087
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,760
So, I ordered 20 of them because why not?

1088
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,940
And now I hand them out to people.

1089
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,160
And I actually mailed one.

1090
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,520
Yeah, and I actually, I handed one out to a viewer.

1091
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,240
So, linux.ting.com, the coolest URL ever.

1092
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,080
And save $25 off your first device or your first,

1093
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,440
I'm gonna say if you're using it as a test phone

1094
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,880
or if you're using it as an auxiliary device,

1095
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,520
you'll get three months out of that, 25 bucks.

1096
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,040
And because it's only $6 per line.

1097
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,360
So, make sure to check them out, and a huge thanks to Ting

1098
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,600
for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

1099
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,480
I hear a lot of talk about mesh networking.

1100
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,980
And I'm really gonna be interested to hear your opinion,

1101
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,360
Wes, because I know that you do

1102
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,160
a lot of system administration.

1103
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,280
What do you think of mesh networking?

1104
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,320
Specifically wireless mesh networking?

1105
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,600
I have yet to actually participate in one,

1106
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,780
but I eye them with much interest.

1107
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,120
I would like to,

1108
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,880
it just seems like a very interesting idea,

1109
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,520
sort of as a people's network, if you will,

1110
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,400
or even just for isolated communities or otherwise.

1111
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,280
And just, it may not always be

1112
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,760
the most efficient design necessarily,

1113
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,560
but having all the nodes be able to talk to each other,

1114
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,240
have this sort of network that you can dynamically

1115
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,760
add things to, build, take away, reshape as you need to,

1116
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
and have connections be resilient.

1117
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,440
It seems like it could have a lot of places,

1118
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,580
especially as we do more like IoT things,

1119
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,600
you have more connected devices all around

1120
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,800
in many different places.

1121
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
I will tell you something, I'm gonna burst anyone's bubble

1122
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,640
that is really excited about mesh networking,

1123
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,360
particularly over wireless, it is not scalable,

1124
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,320
and it is the most inefficient use of bandwidth

1125
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,800
known to man.

1126
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,240
So if you have this dream that someday

1127
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,800
you and your neighbors are gonna each buy a radio,

1128
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,920
and you're all gonna put them in your neighborhood,

1129
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,200
and one guy's gonna pay for the internet connection,

1130
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,360
and he's gonna send it to you,

1131
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,840
and you're gonna send it to the next guy,

1132
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,460
and he's gonna send it to the guy after him,

1133
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,280
and you are living in a pipe dream.

1134
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,920
It is never gonna happen.

1135
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,040
It never works.

1136
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,280
It cannot work.

1137
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,720
It is so inefficient, you can get two or three hops,

1138
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,980
or maybe four, or maybe five, and then it's dead.

1139
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,560
So, I'm just wondering.

1140
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,960
Well, what if the goal isn't perhaps efficiency?

1141
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,240
What if in some use case of any communication,

1142
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,880
or connection, or signaling is better than none?

1143
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,960
I'm gonna say, and William, I'd be interested

1144
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,640
to get your take on this.

1145
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,680
I'm gonna say by the ninth, or 10th hop,

1146
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,320
or 12th hop, somewhere in there,

1147
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,360
I'm gonna guess it's totally unusable.

1148
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,200
Is that fair?

1149
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,480
It's kind of hard to say,

1150
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,840
depending on the latency of all the links.

1151
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,720
I mean, you take many hops through the internet,

1152
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
so it wouldn't be unreasonable

1153
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,080
to do many through the mesh network.

1154
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,160
Yeah, but you're not, maybe 30 hops would be bad.

1155
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,000
Right.

1156
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,580
But yeah, okay, I mean, we can pick a number,

1157
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,040
but you're bottlenecking every step of the way down, right?

1158
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,280
Like, at some point it comes to a grinding halt.

1159
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,840
Oh, absolutely, well, you're adding latency

1160
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,960
every single step of the way down.

1161
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,640
You're adding more potentials for congestion

1162
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,400
and all sorts of stuff, so yes.

1163
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,160
But what I'm saying is, like, the guy at the top,

1164
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,320
if he has, let's say, a 10 meg link,

1165
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,080
and now the guy below him, everyone has a 10 meg link,

1166
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,580
but the guy at the top is funneling

1167
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,500
everyone below him's traffic.

1168
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,280
So, you know, if you're third in line or whatever,

1169
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,120
like, everything that's below you

1170
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,960
is getting passed through your network,

1171
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,800
and ultimately hits your upstream pipe.

1172
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,400
Like, it just, the very concept is impossible.

1173
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,240
It can never work.

1174
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,060
At least.

1175
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,900
But you're talking about, like,

1176
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,600
some kind of centralized architecture, I think,

1177
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,880
where you have a small pipe way upstream

1178
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,320
and you're getting funneled into that,

1179
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,600
but it doesn't necessarily have to work that way.

1180
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,680
Yeah, it could be a mesh network

1181
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,360
where there are many paths through the network

1182
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,620
and based on congestion avoidance algorithms,

1183
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,680
you pick different paths.

1184
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,360
Well, a company claims to have figured this out.

1185
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,460
This article comes from The Wirecutter,

1186
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,920
and basically, this is the best

1187
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,480
Wi-Fi mesh networking kits for most people.

1188
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,520
And they basically went through

1189
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,980
and evaluated a bunch of these kits,

1190
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,120
and they settled on the Netgear Orbi,

1191
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,660
which they say is the best for most people.

1192
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,540
And basically, what it is, is it's a kit

1193
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,200
that you can put access points all over your house

1194
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,040
and have mesh networking.

1195
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,640
So basically, you plug the first one into a router,

1196
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,720
and then you put these little hops all over your house,

1197
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,080
and then you can get the supposed perfect Wi-Fi network.

1198
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,800
Okay, so these are the localized mesh networks,

1199
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,040
like an Eero or the Google, whatever Wi-Fi thing?

1200
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Yeah, I think that's what they're comparing them to.

1201
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,880
Yeah, Eero, yeah, mm-hmm.

1202
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,440
Okay.

1203
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,360
Which, admittedly, will you probably have better success with

1204
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,320
than trying to do like a neighborhood network,

1205
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,160
which is what I hear about.

1206
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,560
Yeah, I was thinking this is way different

1207
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,600
than your larger scale mesh network

1208
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,160
of maybe thousands of nodes,

1209
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,260
where this is only gonna go to like four or five,

1210
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,720
maybe 10. Right, so I think that you'd have,

1211
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,040
I think you'd have better luck.

1212
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,600
Here's the thing.

1213
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,240
Well, these are all pretty low bandwidth nodes.

1214
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,720
This could definitely screw you,

1215
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,680
and depending on what parts of the spectrum they use

1216
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,980
to transmit between each other,

1217
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,200
this could actually be pretty slow.

1218
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,920
Can you dive into that a little bit?

1219
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,280
So I think for the Google Wi-Fi,

1220
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,540
you can actually wire them all up

1221
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,200
like a normal access point system,

1222
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
say like your Unifies or something,

1223
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,520
and then you don't have any of the bandwidth

1224
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,360
sharing problems.

1225
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,280
They're all separate APs,

1226
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,560
and they all connect back over a wired interface.

1227
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,080
That wouldn't be a mesh network, though.

1228
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,680
No, it wouldn't be a mesh network,

1229
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,240
but it would achieve the same purpose,

1230
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,240
which is to cover your whole house in Wi-Fi.

1231
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,080
So that's kind of where I was going with this.

1232
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,500
If we live, at least here in the United States,

1233
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,480
where we have Western construction homes,

1234
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,880
I have yet to be inside of a residential construction

1235
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,560
where I can't get access to the attic.

1236
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,840
Sometimes it means cutting a little hole

1237
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,220
out of the sheet rock, but.

1238
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,080
But you'll just patch that up later, it's fine.

1239
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,200
You could, or you could simply just put a little door on it

1240
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,480
and then you have access to your attic,

1241
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,000
which I don't know why you would not want access

1242
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,440
to your attic.

1243
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,120
It is, Cat 6 is so cheap, and I mean so cheap.

1244
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,060
I mean, we're talking two, three cents a foot, if that.

1245
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,100
Why would you not just run wires in your house?

1246
00:48:59,100 --> 00:48:59,940
Why would you, why would you?

1247
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,480
Because you don't want to tear up your walls

1248
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,520
or your ceilings or whatever.

1249
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,600
It may be easy in some types of construction,

1250
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,400
but in others, and some people just aren't capable

1251
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,280
of dealing with it or don't want to hire a contractor

1252
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,120
or whatnot.

1253
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,960
Or they value their time.

1254
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,640
It makes it easier to just take all these nodes,

1255
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,480
throw them next to random power outlets

1256
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,100
and kind of spread them throughout your house,

1257
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,560
and then have them all automatically connect to each other

1258
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,760
and go back to one central point.

1259
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,600
It doesn't make it easier.

1260
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,480
You know, it's the wireless range extender all over again,

1261
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,280
but they're more easy to manage set up.

1262
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,020
So you don't have a separate router

1263
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,200
from a separate wireless range extender.

1264
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,040
It's all the same device,

1265
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,400
and it just configures itself for you.

1266
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,160
How'd those range extenders work out?

1267
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,280
They were terrible.

1268
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,560
But that's not to say with five gigahertz band

1269
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,900
and everything, it couldn't be better today

1270
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,240
because you have a lot more wireless channels to deal with.

1271
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,040
And as long as you place them somewhat close to each other,

1272
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,480
you do potentially have more bandwidth too.

1273
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,760
And your far away nodes may only need, you know,

1274
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,080
like 20 megabit.

1275
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,340
You're not trying to do like gigabit rate file transfers

1276
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,520
across all your mesh network.

1277
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,520
You're just trying to like access Facebook in these cases.

1278
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,560
Definitely targeting a very simple user.

1279
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,440
If you're hooking up internet of things,

1280
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,640
I'm guessing that might be useful to have something

1281
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,360
that's not the best for bandwidth,

1282
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,520
but you know, that'll cover your millions of devices.

1283
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,680
And to address everyone in the chat,

1284
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,760
yes, wifi kind of sucks and wired is better,

1285
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,560
but sometimes, and depending on your technical capability,

1286
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,400
you don't have a choice.

1287
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,720
Yeah, and sometimes one is good enough

1288
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,640
and you don't really, you know, diminishing returns

1289
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,080
would get you to wired and you really don't need it.

1290
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,340
Yep.

1291
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,180
I'm gonna go ahead.

1292
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,160
Especially if you're just using Facebook.

1293
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,420
We can, I guess we can, what's the old saying?

1294
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,620
We can agree to disagree.

1295
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:45,420
I don't think there is a time when I could look somebody

1296
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,360
in the face and tell them, you know, I mean,

1297
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,400
if you're looking at what, like what we charge

1298
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,640
through structured wiring, I bet we could easily do,

1299
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,800
you know, an average 2,500 square foot house,

1300
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,240
I would say 200 bucks, 250 bucks to drop some,

1301
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,200
to put in some, put in some structured wiring

1302
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,240
and put in some access points.

1303
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,480
I just, I'm not seeing it.

1304
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,640
I'm really not seeing the, the,

1305
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,800
That's your cost.

1306
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,640
I mean, Yeah, exactly.

1307
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,340
You're gonna be paying a contractor thousands of dollars

1308
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,180
just to get in there and do that.

1309
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,840
No, no, no, come on now.

1310
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,880
A licensed contract?

1311
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,760
I just, I mean, I pay electrician to come in

1312
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,840
and run service.

1313
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,160
They're gonna charge me, not for the materials

1314
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,120
but for the time.

1315
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,200
Right, but that's different.

1316
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,160
That's different though.

1317
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,680
You need a licensed electrician when you're working

1318
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,220
with 110, this is low voltage.

1319
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,600
There is no, there's basically, other than you can't share,

1320
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,420
so electrical wiring has to be strapped every two feet

1321
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,440
or three feet or whatever it is, right?

1322
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,400
And you can't share a strap with low voltage.

1323
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,560
But aside from that, there really isn't a lot of regulation

1324
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,480
on where you can throw low voltage wire.

1325
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,440
I mean, you can go up in an attic

1326
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,600
and throw it around if you want.

1327
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,400
Well, but you're gonna have to pay more for plenum wire,

1328
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,960
technically, to be within code.

1329
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,840
There are a lot of places that make it easy to run

1330
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,080
if you're not actually.

1331
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,360
Yeah, if you're not strapping.

1332
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,200
Yeah.

1333
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,960
Well, I mean, you can buy plastic straps too.

1334
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,040
I did the janky thing.

1335
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,880
I bought really cheap Cat 6

1336
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,200
and I ran it through plenum space through air ducts

1337
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,920
and I don't care, but I'm gonna have to rip that out

1338
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,360
at some point if we sell the house.

1339
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,720
Right, right, yeah.

1340
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,960
So, I mean, I don't know where you live

1341
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,720
that you think it would be thousands of dollars

1342
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,800
to have somebody come put some low voltage wiring in,

1343
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,240
but I gotta tell you, I mean, I know a lot of people

1344
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,640
in the industry and people that do this all over the country

1345
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,200
and I think $500, especially,

1346
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,360
depending on how big the house is,

1347
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,160
I mean, really, I could cover a 2,500 square foot house

1348
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,160
with one, two, maybe at the most three access points.

1349
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,280
And so, three runs of wire and then down into a basement

1350
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,560
or out into a garage or something like that

1351
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,200
into a punch panel, I'm not seeing the return on investment

1352
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,800
for what you're gonna pay for this system

1353
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,520
and for what you're gonna get out of it

1354
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,280
versus hiring a professional to come and drop some wire in

1355
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,320
and then you put your access points.

1356
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,400
And the great thing about putting wire in

1357
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,400
is you can go and upgrade the access points

1358
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,160
and you got an all new system.

1359
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,520
You know, when it goes from 802.11n to G,

1360
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,160
or sorry, other way, G to N and then to AC,

1361
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,200
I just replace the access points and I'm good to go.

1362
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,640
I don't know, I guess it works for some people

1363
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,000
and if you're looking for a cheap solution

1364
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,720
that doesn't require much, I guess,

1365
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,080
maybe that's the way to go.

1366
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:26,080
So, anyway, I don't know, it might work for some people.

1367
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:30,480
I am not into, there is a line, I will admit,

1368
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,720
where, I'll give you a great example.

1369
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,320
There are times when I'm willing to take less

1370
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,600
because overall, sometimes less is more.

1371
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,600
And a great example of that is when I am going to do my,

1372
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,040
when I'm trying to keep up to date

1373
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,520
with things that are happening in the field.

1374
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,680
It's very difficult for me sometimes

1375
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,720
to stay current on some of the things

1376
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,600
that are happening in the field

1377
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,640
because we don't use everything, right?

1378
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,160
You know, I work with some technologies and not others.

1379
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,240
How do you stay current with that stuff?

1380
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,320
How do you stay up to date?

1381
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,320
And typically what I used to do was take a week off of work

1382
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,600
and drive to Minneapolis,

1383
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,880
which is the closest place to me,

1384
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:22,880
and enroll in a basically one week training session.

1385
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,320
And what I'm doing nowadays

1386
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,560
is heading over to Linux Academy.

1387
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,280
And basically what Linux Academy is,

1388
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,400
unlike this mesh network stuff,

1389
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,640
Linux Academy actually provides the same quality

1390
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,080
of education that I would get

1391
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,240
if I was at a training session.

1392
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,240
And I know this because I have done

1393
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,680
the in-classroom training,

1394
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,240
and I have done remote training.

1395
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,600
I have done all of it.

1396
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:53,600
And I paid $2,600 for an instructor

1397
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,480
to sit and teach a class remotely.

1398
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,640
I took it remotely.

1399
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,680
And I remember you couldn't attend the class.

1400
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,560
The instructor was, he was doing it basically in his house,

1401
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,240
but he didn't invest in a good quality microphone.

1402
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,960
And so it basically started like this

1403
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,640
the entire time he was talking.

1404
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,280
Well, that's just great.

1405
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,200
It was terrible.

1406
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,920
Like, I could listen to that for hours.

1407
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,480
As a person, the speakers that are in my basement

1408
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,960
that I listen to my music on

1409
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,560
are Sunfire CRM2 ribbon speakers.

1410
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,040
I mean, they're $1,800 per cabinet,

1411
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,680
and they sound incredible, right?

1412
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,440
So as a person who can appreciate that kind of quality,

1413
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,480
I'm not, I don't demand like a perfect system,

1414
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,480
but oh my God, dude, go to OfficeMax

1415
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,840
and spend $35 on a Logitech headset

1416
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,440
and you would sound better.

1417
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,880
And it was so distracting.

1418
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,600
I had a very difficult time comprehending the material.

1419
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,920
Well, Linux Academy is,

1420
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,520
these instructors are true professionals.

1421
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,600
These are the people that they live, eat, and breathe Linux,

1422
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,760
and better yet, they live, eat, and breathe teaching.

1423
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,280
And if you use our website, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

1424
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,640
they're gonna make it even better

1425
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,440
because they're gonna make it cheaper.

1426
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,440
So what, I guess what I'm trying to say is

1427
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,440
this is your opportunity to get the same quality

1428
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,720
for a fraction of the price.

1429
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,640
Instead of spending two or $3,000,

1430
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,360
you can spend 20 or $30,

1431
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,920
and you'll come home with the exact same thing

1432
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,960
because you'll get the same skills.

1433
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,840
Learning is really what you put into it,

1434
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,080
not necessarily what you're pulling out.

1435
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,120
And so, you know, I always say,

1436
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,200
knowledge is the one thing people can't take away from you.

1437
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,840
It doesn't, people can put you in prison,

1438
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,800
people can take away your money,

1439
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,120
they can take away your possessions.

1440
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,920
Something that you learn is something you have

1441
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,360
for the rest of your life.

1442
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,000
So add something, you know, this Christmas season,

1443
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,360
maybe you can buy it for somebody else too.

1444
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,680
That would be a nice thought.

1445
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,880
Paying it forward, you know,

1446
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,520
somebody that wants to make a career transition,

1447
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,720
maybe buy them a, maybe buy them a membership

1448
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,560
to Linux Academy.

1449
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,400
That's a great idea.

1450
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,680
Yeah, I thought so.

1451
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,800
Would you appreciate that?

1452
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,120
Heck yes.

1453
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,040
Everyone would.

1454
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,280
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1455
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,680
So one of the tools I wanted to talk about

1456
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,000
that I don't think gets nearly enough attention

1457
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,400
for the amount of money that it has made me

1458
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,000
and the amount of hassle that it saved me is Clonezilla.

1459
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,360
Oh man, I totally agree with that.

1460
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,520
Right?

1461
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,560
I tell you what, I bet you, just right on the spot,

1462
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,760
Wes, tell me the last time you used Clonezilla.

1463
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,440
That'd be like two weeks ago, I think.

1464
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,680
I don't know, it seems like at least

1465
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,960
I can't go with like six months without using Clonezilla

1466
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,400
or thinking that I could use Clonezilla

1467
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,520
or wanting to use Clonezilla

1468
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,240
and being upset that I don't have it on me.

1469
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,080
I will also just say Clonezilla is just,

1470
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,720
anytime you have an Andrew Gross Live CD or anything else,

1471
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,880
Pac-Man does ask Clonezilla, it's there,

1472
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,040
you have wifi, you have Clonezilla,

1473
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,880
mount, you know, SSHFS something

1474
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,200
and then you can just take a Clonezilla of anything.

1475
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,360
Anytime I get a new computer, I get a new upgrade,

1476
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,160
anything, just bam, take an image of it,

1477
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,840
store it away somewhere, delete it in the year

1478
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,680
if you don't need it.

1479
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,200
You know you always can go right back to where you were.

1480
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,840
So we actually have a small USB hard drive

1481
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,280
that is in a bag we call the imaging bag

1482
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,760
and we take, we have computers that go in

1483
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,520
at client locations and we,

1484
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,960
the first time we set up that computer,

1485
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,720
we take an image of it and so when clients buy,

1486
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,520
when they buy computers after that,

1487
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,340
instead of having to install and set that up

1488
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,320
every single time, we just take that client's image

1489
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,480
and dump it onto their computers.

1490
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,560
Then when they upgrade and we go to,

1491
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,240
you know like we had a client that went from 12,

1492
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,120
they just upgraded from 12.04 to 16.04,

1493
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,240
then we make a new image and then we roll that image out

1494
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,900
and it's been absolutely incredible.

1495
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,180
It's a tool that I couldn't live without

1496
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:42,680
and I would pay thousands of dollars,

1497
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,840
if that's what it costed, to keep using it

1498
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,680
because I need it.

1499
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,680
The good news is it is the most advanced

1500
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,200
open source disk-cloning utility

1501
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,640
and it doesn't cost anything.

1502
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,240
This article is saying that it's the first release,

1503
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:04,040
it's the first release to use the kernel from Linux 4.8,

1504
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,960
specifically 4.8.7.

1505
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,840
We don't talk enough about Clonezilla

1506
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,280
and what it does and I'm interested,

1507
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,120
is anyone in the mumble room using Clonezilla

1508
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,720
for something incredible or just to save their bacon?

1509
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,440
I don't know, man.

1510
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,560
I would at least like to use it in the future.

1511
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,640
I'm really against cloning disks in most cases,

1512
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,000
unless the disk is absolutely failing me or something

1513
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and I want to recover data from it.

1514
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,840
Why is that?

1515
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,280
I think rebuilding, whenever you have

1516
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,080
some kind of catastrophic failure

1517
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,600
or you're setting up a new system,

1518
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,040
I think rebuilding is just more worthwhile

1519
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,320
to give you a fresh file system and everything.

1520
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,040
I think I do agree in many cases,

1521
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,120
but a NixOS user would say that, I think.

1522
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,520
But there are a lot of cases,

1523
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,440
and I do really appreciate that Clonezilla

1524
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,240
has fancy features so that it at least does take

1525
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,920
like, it won't copy blank space.

1526
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:05,560
It's not quite as good as having configuration management

1527
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,000
or an OS where you can really rebuild things very cleanly,

1528
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,800
but it's a much better middle ground

1529
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,200
than just DDing things.

1530
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,920
So I appreciate that a lot

1531
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,280
and it makes it a lot easier to work with.

1532
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,600
What's the disadvantage of using Clonezilla, William?

1533
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,640
If you have, let's say, 50 clients

1534
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,600
and all of those workstations

1535
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,520
are essentially set up identical,

1536
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,640
where is the advantage in building each one

1537
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,080
of those from scratch?

1538
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,560
Or even when one fails, building it back from scratch?

1539
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,920
I guess I'm just not seeing it.

1540
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:43,920
It seems to me that when you wanna deploy something

1541
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,200
at scale, I mean, yes, you can use things like Puppet

1542
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,960
to individually configure those systems,

1543
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,680
but a lot of times, that much intervention is not needed.

1544
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,880
And I gotta tell you, as a person who has managed Puppet

1545
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,720
numerous times for numerous different clients

1546
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,480
on numerous different occasions,

1547
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,360
there's a lot of work in setting Puppet up.

1548
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,000
It's one of those things I really dread doing.

1549
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,360
I think only second to Pixie servers.

1550
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,360
I hate setting up Pixie servers.

1551
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,360
That's a shame, I really like setting up Pixie servers.

1552
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,440
I like Pixie.

1553
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,720
I mean, I don't love it, but I appreciate it.

1554
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,680
I feel like I haven't had much trouble with it.

1555
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,200
I guess I like what Pixie does,

1556
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,120
but the actual act of setting up the Pixie server,

1557
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,880
do you not run into a bazillion problems

1558
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,040
that you have to troubleshoot along the way?

1559
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,080
Yeah, there are, and particular firmware implementations

1560
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,920
and those kinds of things.

1561
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,920
I mean, it is at that bottom end of the stack

1562
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,000
that's always kind of troublesome, right?

1563
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,080
That just makes my stomach turn just thinking about it.

1564
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,080
I do think you do have a point.

1565
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,800
I mean, there's, it depends on what your environment is.

1566
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,560
It depends on where, what your bottlenecks are.

1567
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,400
So I do think there's probably also a middle ground here

1568
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,760
of like, can you make yourself,

1569
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,320
you shouldn't just like make a crude image,

1570
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,200
not clean it up, not set in place,

1571
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,040
first run scripts or other things.

1572
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,920
So I think there is a middle ground

1573
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,720
between like just a simple copy of an image

1574
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,640
versus like something that you've set up a nice copy

1575
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,480
that's ready to go.

1576
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,920
It boots up, enters a network, configures itself.

1577
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,680
Maybe you don't need full configuration management

1578
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,760
like Puppet or Chef or Ansible.

1579
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,560
Maybe you do, but there's like, you can have something,

1580
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,960
some stage in the standard image stage

1581
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,360
and some in the configuration management

1582
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,240
and maybe you just need the standard image.

1583
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,200
Yeah, I don't know if I could go back.

1584
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,560
And again, when I compare the two, I'm like, man,

1585
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:23,360
Puppet would sure be overkill in a lot of situations,

1586
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:26,120
most situations really, where we have a large deployment

1587
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,200
because you're not making a lot of changes system-wide.

1588
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,760
Per class, per host.

1589
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,480
Yeah, right, right.

1590
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,920
We know with the exceptions of updates

1591
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,000
and software management, and even those,

1592
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,920
a lot of times if you're making a lot of changes

1593
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,000
to software management,

1594
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,640
it's because of different roles in the business.

1595
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,160
You have the graphic designers

1596
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,320
and they needed a different version of this

1597
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,160
or they needed a different program installed or something.

1598
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,760
And it's something I wouldn't really want to manage

1599
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,660
at the level because I'm not making those changes

1600
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,120
to every single machine.

1601
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,300
Right, one use case I've had a little closer to home

1602
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,080
is as Linux users, well, I think the network,

1603
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,200
we do espouse trying to buy from Linux first to vendors,

1604
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,400
but a lot of people end up, certainly I have as well,

1605
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,760
ended up buying a machine that ran Windows

1606
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,720
or maybe you bought a Mac.

1607
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,600
And I've used Clonezilla several times

1608
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,000
to just take a factory image right there.

1609
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,800
If I need to send it in for warranty or something,

1610
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,040
I can just apply that

1611
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,480
and know that they're not going to futz with me about,

1612
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,520
oh, you break your machine.

1613
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,020
We're not going to pay for this.

1614
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:20,800
Right, you know what I've done the last couple of times?

1615
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,080
I just DD the drive and I send it back to them

1616
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,720
and then when they ask what they say anything,

1617
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,440
I'm like, listen, you can go and put whatever you want

1618
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,680
on there, but I'm not sending, my excuse is,

1619
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,720
I'm just not sending you a laptop with my data on it.

1620
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,800
So I'm wiping the drive before I send it in.

1621
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,120
And if you need to install something to test,

1622
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,440
then you're welcome to do that.

1623
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,780
Most of those guys have, you know,

1624
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,800
drives anyway that they use for troubleshooting

1625
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,120
and actually use user, because they don't have passwords.

1626
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,480
Right, yeah, it's a liability nightmare.

1627
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,520
I knew, I know back in, you know, a while back,

1628
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,340
I don't do this anymore,

1629
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,760
but I used to keep a Clonezilla image of my laptop.

1630
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,480
So if my laptop ever crashed, I could restore

1631
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,360
a already configured and set up version of my laptop.

1632
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,200
Anyone doing something like that?

1633
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,960
I would like to, but I just don't know how to just yet.

1634
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,080
I'd say that sounds like a good idea, Noah.

1635
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,920
Uh-huh.

1636
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,520
Yeah, and I would probably do it like maybe

1637
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,580
at least every couple months or so.

1638
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,680
Gotta be honest with you, as far as how to do it,

1639
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,440
it's literally as simple as downloading the ISO,

1640
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,600
booting off of it, and it asks you questions

1641
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,760
and you answer them.

1642
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,300
They have a super slick system going.

1643
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,480
You know, it says, do you want to start Clonezilla?

1644
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,400
Yes, what image, what drive do you want to image?

1645
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,240
This one?

1646
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,160
Which one do you want? Yeah, I love it.

1647
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,480
And it'll give you the command too,

1648
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,120
so if later you want to make this like something

1649
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,760
you do on a cron job or, you know,

1650
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,360
set up in an automated way somehow,

1651
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,160
they give you like a one line command that you can do

1652
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,520
that'll just do exactly what you,

1653
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,200
the backup that you just performed, which is great.

1654
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,480
Oh wow, that's awesome.

1655
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,200
I met, actually, I had the privilege

1656
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,600
at last year's Linux Fest Northwest.

1657
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,920
There were a couple Clonezilla guys right by

1658
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,240
the Jupiter Broadcasting booth,

1659
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,880
so I spent a little while talking to them

1660
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,000
and I have to say they were very nice to talk to.

1661
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,120
They were excited about the project

1662
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,600
and they were surprisingly humble

1663
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,480
for the cool software they've created.

1664
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,940
Shoot, man, that's really disappointing.

1665
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,160
I would have loved to meet those guys.

1666
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,000
Well, maybe they'll be back.

1667
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,140
We'll just have to hope.

1668
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,080
Maybe.

1669
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,240
Anyone else have any other closing thoughts

1670
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,800
about Clonezilla or other useful Linux tools

1671
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,920
that don't get enough attention?

1672
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,760
All right.

1673
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,580
ProSync.

1674
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,720
Yeah, right, ProSync.

1675
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,120
All can sit.

1676
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,400
Yeah, all right, guys, well, thank you so much

1677
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,960
to the Mumba Room for being here.

1678
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,440
We really appreciate having you taking time out of your day.

1679
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,800
Thank you very much, Wes, for joining me remotely.

1680
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,880
My pleasure.

1681
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,400
A huge thank you to Michael Tunnell,

1682
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,680
our producer for this show,

1683
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,880
Rekai, our hardworking video editor

1684
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,480
who makes everything sound and look amazing,

1685
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,880
and of course, the entire team at Jupiter Broadcasting

1686
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,900
for making this show possible.

1687
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,920
You can find out more at jupitabroadcasting.com.

1688
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,960
Check me out on Sundays,

1689
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,580
Linux Action Show, where Chris and I host,

1690
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,280
and we'll be back here next Tuesday

1691
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,320
with the same show next week.

1692
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,160
Bye.

1693
01:05:52,160 --> 01:06:18,660
Okay, bye.

1694
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:38,800
I sit down at my desk and I'm going through links that Wes provided things

1695
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,480
that we're gonna talk about today and I came across this link which was an

1696
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:48,960
article from System76 talking about how they are working with Canonical to

1697
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:56,400
improve high DPI support in Linux now for those of you who don't know high DPI

1698
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:05,120
support in Ubuntu specifically has been kind of a disaster and a lot of laptops

1699
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,880
now are shipping with high-resolution display 1080 is the minimum I will

1700
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:16,280
purchase agreed agreed Wes how do you handle working with lower resolution

1701
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,760
because I know your XPS that's a 1366 yes unfortunately that's the only one

1702
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,000
left in my entire life thankfully how do you how do you work around that you know

1703
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,880
I usually end up using a tiling window manager or something with easy control

1704
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:35,840
so I can rapidly shift between things and then I'm most places that I end up

1705
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,960
going you know if I'm not at a coffee shop or here at the studio I have an

1706
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,480
external monitor configured and so at that point it's not such a big deal hmm

1707
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:47,800
yes that makes sense but I mean I would never buy one now it's frustrating even

1708
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,360
today that like how in 2016 does the laptop market still have those

1709
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,920
resolutions offered because it's really I mean it was fine for what it is it's

1710
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,580
better than no monitor but it is just the worst well I think part of it is

1711
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:06,360
cost right I think a part of it is just that they the manufacturers are you know

1712
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,080
they can get a three two hundred dollar laptop about three hundred dollar laptop

1713
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:13,120
if they're not putting in a terribly expensive display and and that works for

1714
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:18,840
the you know guy or woman that is sitting at home browsing Facebook and

1715
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,440
checking their email doesn't really matter for you know pixel density isn't

1716
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,440
a big deal it is a big deal for people like you and I though that work in the

1717
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,280
field and need to be able to scale three or four different windows at one time

1718
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,480
right yeah exactly right you need to be able to have a lot on your screen at

1719
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,840
once you're doing many things at once you know you're professional so 4k has

1720
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:41,000
been a great promise and system 76 has been kind of on the leading edge I don't

1721
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,360
know of a whole lot of other laptops that are shipping with 4k displays you

1722
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:48,080
know like there's the you know the Google pixel shipped to the high

1723
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,960
resolution display when the the XPS does but for the most part you know the the

1724
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:59,000
you're lucky to get a 1080p display most of my 1366 and the problem is if you get

1725
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,080
a 4k display and I have a 4k display on my on my oryx is or no I don't know I

1726
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:10,720
don't I have the 1080 version but if you have a 4k display the problem is it the

1727
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:15,600
Ubuntu looks terrible all of the buttons are tiny and you can't see them even you

1728
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,320
even if you fix even if you go through like there's a recommended you know like

1729
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,680
kind of tutorial steps that you go through to kind of fix some of the

1730
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:29,280
issues and one of that would be like dragging the the the slider scale and it

1731
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,760
increases the windows but that doesn't fix everything so for example Firefox it

1732
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:36,200
doesn't fix the buttons in Firefox and stuff so that's still huge so then you

1733
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,840
have to go to about about colon config and you have to scale Firefox individually

1734
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,760
and just it's it's a very hacked together solution and so it's something

1735
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,240
that's needed some attention for a long time I'm interested this is anyone in

1736
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,560
the mumble room any of you guys using 4k displays and what's your experience been

1737
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:56,240
like under Linux specifically Ubuntu if you've tried it I'm not currently using

1738
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:00,880
4k I'm still stuck on 1080p but I am shopping for monitors but I don't feel

1739
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:12,920
4k has or I need more better GPU for 4k okay so you need a better video card but

1740
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:17,600
you would go to 4k oh I thought I totally would but I'm so kind of waiting

1741
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:23,480
for the technology to get up higher for the Hertz for the gaming side because I

1742
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,320
hate having monitors that only do one thing I need I need I need color

1743
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,440
reproduction I need performance I need reliability all that kind of things and

1744
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,000
I hate spending money on just one thing that I'm going to have to replace a year

1745
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:44,200
or two later to get just the same thing but better quality so yeah so kind of

1746
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,960
waiting for 4k to get up there and then display poor and HDMI and all that fun

1747
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,480
stuff right right yeah I think that makes a lot of sense anyone else using 4k I

1748
01:10:54,480 --> 01:11:00,960
have to have a laptop that is around 13 inches that's 4k and I have a 27 inch

1749
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,040
HP IPS 4k display now which laptop is that your is that your thing pad yeah no

1750
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:09,480
it's an Asus oh I see okay yeah yeah right no the thing that's actually just

1751
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,800
1080p which yeah and I actually like that more to some extent because scale

1752
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,120
isn't an issue for me sure but the 4k at 27 inches is really nice and even though

1753
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,320
I do have to scale some things up you get much more clarity and screen

1754
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,080
realistic at the larger display size yeah the screen real estate seems seems

1755
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,920
legitimate at a 27 inch I wonder that's not much more expensive if you don't

1756
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:36,320
want to go like 144 Hertz or something and you're just sticking at 60 Hertz 4k

1757
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,800
is not terribly priced and these are really nice monitors nice stands well

1758
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:47,320
built you agree that do you agree that fit 4k on anything under 15 inches is is

1759
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:53,640
a poor resolution to screen size ratio it's a little ridiculous I don't think

1760
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,360
it's necessary I think 1440p around that size is fine and even then you're still

1761
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:05,200
scaling stuff up we'll see how has 4k worked under Linux for you 4k has been

1762
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:09,680
fine but I mostly run xman ads so I kind of customize everything myself and a lot

1763
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,880
of what I do is in the terminal and scaling that up is trivial it's it's

1764
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,800
basically just increasing the font size right sure and the browser has add-ons

1765
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,600
and things to deal with high DPI I mostly use Chrome and Firefox so okay

1766
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,360
not a big deal so you're so basically your approach is handle every

1767
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,960
application individually pretty much mostly because xman ad doesn't give you

1768
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,720
anything to deal with it in some unified way yeah sure you could change GTK in a

1769
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,120
unified way and QT in a unified way individually but I don't really use that

1770
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,840
many applications and I can deal with the ones that aren't scaled correctly

1771
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,240
you have a well-defined set that you have yeah I have a pretty small limited set

1772
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,880
of applications and even like Gimp and stuff has been fine though I'm probably

1773
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:53,280
pushing the envelope here a little bit but have you tried Ubuntu by chance

1774
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:58,720
nope I basically only run NixOS and my fork of it so that's what I don't really

1775
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,360
know okay that's fair that's what I'm doing all 1080p and that's on 1404 and

1776
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:08,560
it's fine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah today I mean it 1080 even on a I've used

1777
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,000
I mean our ThinkPads you have the same we do we have the same both of us have

1778
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,040
the same laptop at 12.5 inch laptop I find 1080p to be perfectly workable oh

1779
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:22,120
yeah anyone else have experience preferably preferably experience with

1780
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:29,920
Ubuntu on 4k or is that it well long story short I I am happy to see that

1781
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,280
somebody is working on this problem because I think in the near future this

1782
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,360
is going to be very important I think all desktop computers are basically

1783
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,600
going to be I think you know obviously 4k is gonna become the next go-to

1784
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,920
standard it's certainly going to become the next go-to standard in video

1785
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:48,760
production yep and so this is going to be a very important problem that we need

1786
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:55,080
to tackle and so it's very nice and reassuring to see that you know both

1787
01:13:55,080 --> 01:14:01,080
system 76 and canonical are aware of this problem and working on it and I

1788
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,720
and I guess it's kind of just like a thank you to all of the people that work

1789
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:10,160
so hard and put a lot of effort in to make sure that we have the tools that we

1790
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:14,720
need I wish I would have had the tools that I needed this morning to make my

1791
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:19,360
day go well at least I know that down the road when 4k becomes a standard and

1792
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,440
it's just something that we go to and expect it I know it'll be there thanks

1793
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:35,880
to a hard work at system 76 and canonical
