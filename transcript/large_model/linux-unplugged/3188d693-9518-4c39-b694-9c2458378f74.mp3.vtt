00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 26 for February 4th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.320
You're listening to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's green with

00:40.320 --> 00:45.400
Hulk rage! My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there Matt, I'm gonna tell you right now,

00:45.400 --> 00:49.760
we might get into it if we have time later in this episode, but I'm considering banning

00:49.760 --> 00:54.800
Fronix from all Jupiter broadcasting productions from here on out. Wow, yeah, I'd love to hear

00:54.800 --> 00:59.360
more about that. Well, you know, it's not his fault. I mean, I actually respect Michael quite

00:59.360 --> 01:03.200
a bit. We've had him on the Linux Action Show. I've got a link to it in the show notes. I respect

01:03.200 --> 01:07.640
somebody who works hard and, you know, he has a trade that he puts a lot of energy into and,

01:07.640 --> 01:11.320
of course, maybe he's spread a little bit thin and, you know, he's created a respectable property

01:11.320 --> 01:15.680
there. But at the same time, at the same time, I get so mad when we make mistakes in the Linux

01:15.680 --> 01:20.480
Action Show, especially in the news segment. The Linux Action Show has the privilege, because it's

01:20.480 --> 01:25.120
coming on, what, its eighth year? It has the privilege of being one of the sources of record

01:25.120 --> 01:29.600
for Linux. Now, it's not the only source, but it's definitely one of the most like time capsule

01:29.600 --> 01:33.640
like sources for Linux history, because you can go back now eight years into Linux history and

01:33.640 --> 01:38.000
hear about issues at the time that they were happening, you know, the drama, the things that

01:38.000 --> 01:41.200
needed to happen and all of that. And it's sort of like reliving that experience. And it's a great

01:41.200 --> 01:45.840
way to sort of get a Linux history lesson. That's why it really bugs me when we get the news wrong,

01:45.840 --> 01:49.800
because that's a big part of that. Oh, I would think so. Yeah, well, so a mistake slipped into

01:49.800 --> 01:54.480
this week's episode of the Linux Action Show, and it's been it's been bugging me since Sunday.

01:54.480 --> 02:00.960
I know it's Tuesday afternoon here. And I want to talk about that in a little bit, what happened.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.280
And and also I want to give a little bit of history on how important news accuracy is to

02:05.280 --> 02:09.920
me on the Linux Action Show and about some of the actual fundamental changes we had made behind the

02:09.920 --> 02:14.440
scenes of the show over the years to try to improve that because it's so important. And,

02:14.440 --> 02:19.320
you know, this mistake happens still. And I want to try to kind of address why and kind of come

02:19.320 --> 02:22.520
clean a little bit, because that's absolutely just as much my responsibility. It's not really

02:22.520 --> 02:27.000
Veronica's fault. But we're not going to talk about that just yet. Not just yet. No, we have

02:27.000 --> 02:32.120
some feedback to get to. And we also have a guest who's going to join us in a little bit. His name's

02:32.120 --> 02:38.000
Martin and he works with the Mate project. He does also the Arch packaging of the Mate desktop

02:38.000 --> 02:43.160
and is a project advocate. And we're going to chat with him a little bit because we also featured the

02:43.160 --> 02:48.520
new Mate desktop live CD that's based on Arch on the Linux Action Show on Sunday. And he's the

02:48.520 --> 02:52.500
creator of that live CD. So he'll be coming on the show in a little bit. But first, I want to

02:52.500 --> 02:56.840
do some follow up. I wanted to do some corrections before we get to all of that, because there was a

02:56.840 --> 03:02.280
point that I failed to mention on the Linux Action Show this last Sunday when I was talking about

03:02.280 --> 03:07.960
the Qbox I4 Pro. And I mentioned that it has a gigabit ethernet adapter on it, which is

03:08.200 --> 03:13.800
technically true. It does have a gigabit ethernet adapter. But in terms of actual bandwidth, and

03:13.800 --> 03:21.200
thanks to omak777 in the subreddit for cluing me in on this, you can't actually achieve a full

03:21.200 --> 03:29.080
gigabit. You're limited to 470 megabit actual transfer rate due to just bus limitations in that

03:29.080 --> 03:34.920
system, right? And it's pretty much true for all ARM real gigabit. You know, you got to have a

03:34.920 --> 03:42.120
super fast PCI Express bus, I guess. I mean, it seems to be a limitation in the speed of the ARM

03:42.120 --> 03:46.560
system. And it seems to be affecting all ARM chips, which makes sense. I mean, gigabit is pretty

03:46.560 --> 03:50.200
fast. And I didn't actually ever stress test it because I was using it as a desktop. But I thought,

03:50.200 --> 03:55.000
you know, it has that ESATA multiplexer port. I thought to make a great file server. Yeah, 470

03:55.000 --> 03:58.160
megabits isn't too bad, though. So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're basically

03:58.160 --> 04:02.480
saying that the actual, you know, the ethernet port itself technically could in different

04:02.480 --> 04:07.480
circumstances, different bus and whatnot actually support the gigabit. But because of bus

04:07.480 --> 04:11.600
restrictions, that's no longer that's not actually possible. Yeah, it's one of those things where it

04:11.600 --> 04:18.960
says gigabit on the box, not quite gigabit, you know, gotcha, gotcha. These some of these these

04:18.960 --> 04:22.240
ARM systems do have some limitations. But I think it's important to know if you're considering using

04:22.240 --> 04:25.680
it as a home file server, which you make pretty good and make a pretty good home file server. It's

04:25.680 --> 04:30.560
only used like a watt when it's idle. That's I love that aspect of it. Oh, yeah. The port really

04:30.560 --> 04:35.600
made it makes for a good cheap portable computer for someone that might want one and might not

04:35.600 --> 04:40.040
otherwise be able to afford one. Yeah, we're you know, it's funny, too, because just my last thoughts

04:40.040 --> 04:45.880
on it was when I was looking at this thing, it's one hundred and twenty five dollars. And I also

04:45.880 --> 04:50.720
have the OUYA. Do you remember the OUYA? It was like this Android based console and it was kick

04:50.720 --> 04:57.640
started and it got a ton of money and it shipped last year, mid year. It's bigger than this QBox is.

04:57.640 --> 05:01.840
I think it's what is it, ninety nine dollars? So it's technically it's twenty five dollars cheaper.

05:01.840 --> 05:06.920
It's so much slower and it's so much more limited. And it shows I mean, I really think you look at

05:06.920 --> 05:10.880
that and you see how the OUYA is kind of doomed because it's already the OUYA looks old in

05:10.880 --> 05:17.400
comparison to this QBox. And that's just, you know. So I guess in reality, I mean, with both of

05:17.400 --> 05:22.360
these side by side, despite the fact that the OUYA is a reasonably new device, it's already dated

05:22.360 --> 05:26.320
just based on things like I think these armchairs. Remember back in the day when it seemed like as

05:26.320 --> 05:30.320
soon as you got a new Intel processor on the market, the next one was already out and they

05:30.320 --> 05:35.840
just got from like, you know, 80 megahertz to 90 megahertz and then boom, all of a sudden we're

05:35.840 --> 05:41.720
120 megahertz and 133 megahertz and boom, we're at 160. Now we're 220, you know, just 400 and

05:41.720 --> 05:47.680
420 and 440. And it just seems like ARM is doing that right now, where it's just rapidly increasing

05:47.680 --> 05:52.400
just at a crazy pace. Well, it almost creates a perpetual buyer's remorse to where you really

05:52.400 --> 05:56.480
can't win. I mean, you try and buy these things and it's like, OK, I'm all set. Oh, wait a minute.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.280
Now it's faster. Darn it. You know, and I went ahead and invested that money. So it does kind

06:00.280 --> 06:05.080
of create a perpetual buyer's remorse, I think, over time. But I think maybe it'll start kind of

06:05.080 --> 06:08.440
coming in its own and settle down a little bit. But it does seem like they're just going at such

06:08.440 --> 06:13.480
a rapid pace. It's impossible to win. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why, you know, you know what? You

06:13.480 --> 06:16.880
know what? The speaking of mobile devices and rapid pace, this is why I have Ting's. This is

06:16.880 --> 06:21.360
a great, this is probably a great time to mention Ting. Ting is a sponsor of this week's podcast.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.760
And Ting is mobile that makes sense. They're my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service

06:25.760 --> 06:31.920
provider. And Ting has no contracts and no early termination fees. But they just turned two. Ting's

06:31.920 --> 06:38.320
birthday was earlier this week. It was Monday and yesterday. And to celebrate, they're giving you a

06:38.320 --> 06:43.560
gift. This applies to all existing Ting customers and all new Ting customers. And you can find more

06:43.560 --> 06:48.320
details over at Ting.com slash blog. First go to Linux.Ting.com to get started. That way we get

06:48.320 --> 06:52.600
credit for your visit. But when you go over to the Ting blog, you'll find out they just slashed

06:52.600 --> 06:59.120
their data pricing in a massive way. They've done a huge reduction on prices. This is a great time

06:59.120 --> 07:03.760
to go back over to Linux.Ting.com and try out their savings calculator. Because the data plans

07:03.760 --> 07:11.480
just got a lot better. This is a perfect example of why it's so rewarding, even a year into it now,

07:11.480 --> 07:16.600
to be a Ting customer for me. So I know a little bit, I won't share too much, but I actually know

07:16.600 --> 07:21.600
a little bit of the behind the scenes details on how this worked out. Ting has had a very successful

07:21.600 --> 07:28.000
two years. And as such, they were able to renegotiate with Sprint. Ting is an MVNO of the

07:28.000 --> 07:30.840
Sprint network. So if you've got good Sprint coverage, you're going to get great Ting service.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.200
And so they renegotiated with Sprint and said, okay, well we're making you a lot more money now,

07:35.200 --> 07:40.200
so what can we do? And they got this drop on the data rates. And Ting looked at that and they said,

07:40.200 --> 07:46.760
we could just not say a word and take all of this as profits and we would be making even more money

07:46.760 --> 07:51.240
than we're making now. Or we could continue to make the revenue and profits that we're making

07:51.240 --> 07:55.880
right now and just immediately pass that savings on to our customers. And that's what they've done.

07:55.880 --> 07:59.680
They just moved that savings that they got when they renegotiated the contract and they're giving

07:59.680 --> 08:03.080
to their customers. And what's so awesome about it, because Ting has no contracts,

08:03.080 --> 08:07.520
you immediately get those new rates. You don't have to call up and sign up for another two year

08:07.520 --> 08:12.200
plan. You don't have to get a new different type of plan and lose your unlimited whatever. No,

08:12.200 --> 08:16.040
you just get it because it's just the next billing cycle. That's at the next rate now.

08:16.040 --> 08:20.120
If you go sign up for Ting right now, that's what you get. Ting is paid for what you use.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.760
It's $6 for a flat rate. That's it. $6 a month and you just pay on top of that. Every single

08:25.760 --> 08:31.120
plan includes hotspot, tethering, voicemail, caller ID, video messaging. It's awesome.

08:31.120 --> 08:35.520
And it really does make sense. When you start to think about it, it's definitely a different way

08:35.520 --> 08:38.800
to do it than the rest of the cell companies, but it is the way that makes the most sense.

08:38.800 --> 08:43.400
It really is mobile that makes sense. And on top of that, Ting has an incredible customer service.

08:43.400 --> 08:53.160
You call them any time of day over at 1-855-846-4389. That's Ting FTW. 1-855-TINGFTW and a real

08:53.160 --> 08:56.440
person will answer the phone and handle your problem right there. You're not going to get

08:56.440 --> 08:59.200
transferred. You're not going to get moved around. You're not going to have to go to the next tier.

08:59.200 --> 09:04.280
Everybody who answers the phone is the top tier. And then they get your problem resolved. They'll

09:04.280 --> 09:07.800
call you back if they need to. They're really great. And I think you'll be impressed. And on

09:07.800 --> 09:12.000
top of that, if you're a do-it-yourselfer, the Ting dashboard is incredible. Go over to

09:12.000 --> 09:16.200
linux.ting.com and scroll down on that page and check out that dashboard. That is not a

09:16.200 --> 09:19.680
fake picture. That's really what it looks like and it is completely functional. I've

09:19.680 --> 09:22.760
been able to do everything I've needed to do over the entire year through that dashboard.

09:22.760 --> 09:26.680
Go check it out. Now is a better time than ever to rerun through their calculator,

09:26.680 --> 09:32.120
linux.ting.com to support this show and save yourself some money. I pay 30 bucks a month for

09:32.120 --> 09:37.200
my Ting line. I'm using it in ways like a mofo. I use it all the time and it's like 30 bucks. And

09:37.200 --> 09:42.000
I got hotspot. I got tethering. It's great. So go to linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting

09:42.000 --> 09:47.200
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged and their support of the Jupiter Broadcasting Network. Boy, I'll

09:47.200 --> 09:52.200
tell you, between the panel and those new rates, it's just full of win. Really, it is so awesome.

09:52.200 --> 09:56.040
And it really underscores how cool they are as a company. They're like, you know, we're just going

09:56.040 --> 10:00.240
to pass that right along. And they still got the ETF relief program and all of that. It's really

10:00.240 --> 10:05.040
cool. Good. Mad respect to them. I think that's so awesome. So I want to pull in a guest who's

10:05.040 --> 10:09.520
joined us in our mumble room this week. His name is Martin. Of course, he's going by Wimpy in our,

10:09.520 --> 10:14.600
I don't know what that means, but he's going by Wimpy in our mumble room and he works with

10:14.600 --> 10:22.600
the Mate Project. And Wimpy, sorry, Martin, welcome to the show. Thank you. So can I, let's

10:22.600 --> 10:26.280
start with where we were just, what we were just talking about on last on Sunday, and then we'll

10:26.280 --> 10:30.920
just kind of go from there. So you've been working on this Mate Live CD and the reason that this

10:30.920 --> 10:35.000
isn't the first Mate Live CD I've ever seen, but what caught my attention is I think it's the first

10:35.000 --> 10:46.920
one based on Arch. So Wimpy, why Arch? Well, I'm an Arch trusted user. So I do the Mate, I'm going

10:46.920 --> 10:53.280
to get in so much trouble. I do the packaging on Arch Linux for Mate desktop. So when the idea was

10:53.280 --> 10:58.320
circulated among the team about making a live CD, it was natural for me to base it on Arch.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.040
And how was that experience? Did you find there were shortcomings? Cause you know,

11:02.040 --> 11:07.680
I think of things like Fedora spins and the openSUSE build service and even Ubuntu,

11:07.680 --> 11:13.600
they all sort of have facilities built into them to make it easier to generate a live CD work. Arch,

11:13.600 --> 11:18.360
what are you doing all that from scratch? How does that work? Well, surprisingly Arch also

11:18.360 --> 11:26.880
has a facility built in. You can Pacman install Arch ISO, which is a suite of scripts. And from

11:26.880 --> 11:31.920
there, there's a base template that if you just then run the build command once you've copied the

11:31.920 --> 11:39.280
the configuration will make you the Arch live CD that you can download off the Arch Linux website

11:39.280 --> 11:44.400
every month and use as the install media. So you can start with that. And from there you can

11:44.400 --> 11:49.720
customize the packages that are built in and a whole raft of other things. I'd never done it

11:49.720 --> 11:53.680
before and it was really straightforward. Oh, very cool. That's good to know. I'll have to

11:53.680 --> 11:59.760
look into that. So you are a Mate, I'm going to have a hard time. I'm going to try it though.

11:59.760 --> 12:06.280
You're a Mate advocate. Why, why the Mate desktop environment? I mean, it seems to me that it,

12:06.280 --> 12:10.960
it's sort of, it's sort of seen an increase in popularity. I know we're seeing a lot more

12:10.960 --> 12:15.960
distributions included. Is, is it sort of, is it getting a lot of momentum behind it and why did

12:15.960 --> 12:21.240
you choose to become an advocate? Right? Well, yes, it is, it is gaining in popularity. I think

12:21.240 --> 12:26.160
we've, there's been a lot of effort in the team to push all the packages into some of the larger

12:26.160 --> 12:31.520
distributions, such as Arch Linux and more recently Debian, and that's now circulating

12:31.520 --> 12:37.560
down to Ubuntu. And we're certainly seeing it trending up on the Debian package install

12:37.560 --> 12:43.840
statistics. And the reason I got involved with it is I had been using Name Three for about 18

12:43.840 --> 12:50.320
months or so, and I was reasonably happy with it. And I'd installed it on my wife's laptop some

12:50.320 --> 12:57.040
years ago. She'd since got a smartphone and was pretty much using that for everything and time

12:57.040 --> 13:02.440
goes by. And then one evening she decides she wants to organize some photos and she sits down

13:02.440 --> 13:06.000
in front of this Name Three thing that she really didn't pay attention to when I was showing her how

13:06.000 --> 13:12.200
to use it a year or so earlier and was hugely frustrated with it and almost hurled it at me.

13:12.200 --> 13:19.600
So it was marriage, marriage protection. The spousal approval factor was low is what you're

13:19.600 --> 13:27.560
saying. Okay. Yeah. So I very quickly yanked Name Three off that machine. I put the Mate desktop on

13:27.560 --> 13:32.920
and that restored an environment that she was familiar with because she's been using Ubuntu

13:32.920 --> 13:38.600
for many years previous and was familiar with the Name Two setup there. So that's where I got

13:38.600 --> 13:46.000
started. And when I had installed Mate, I noticed that it was working okay, but there was some bits

13:46.000 --> 13:51.440
missing and there were some bits that were broken. So I just decided to get stuck in and I started

13:51.440 --> 13:56.640
submitting pull requests to the project to fix up some of the packaging. I wonder, it seems like

13:56.640 --> 14:04.680
potentially as the XP era comes to a close, if maybe more conventional, these types of standard

14:04.680 --> 14:10.840
paradigm desktops will see a big boost just because of people looking for something other

14:10.840 --> 14:15.360
to move to. Have you seen some of that? When you're doing outreach, who are you outreaching to?

14:15.360 --> 14:20.760
Well, that's a new thing for me. It's something I've decided to start doing for the project this

14:20.760 --> 14:27.800
year. So this is the first time I've sort of done a proper promotion to talk about the project and

14:27.800 --> 14:35.520
try and make people more aware of its existence. But certainly within my family and circle of

14:35.520 --> 14:43.680
friends who I've helped move to Linux, they have been more comfortable with Mate because most of

14:43.680 --> 14:51.960
them are moving from Windows XP machines. And a couple of clicks change the menu layout, move the

14:51.960 --> 14:57.040
bar to the bottom of the screen and it's much like Windows XP with the start button and a familiar

14:57.040 --> 15:02.080
looking programs menu. So it's been very familiar to them. And once they've got Thunderbird and

15:02.080 --> 15:08.520
Firefox installed, they're away. I want to do, if you'd let me shift gears a little bit to Arch,

15:08.520 --> 15:15.160
you mentioned you're an Arch trusted user and I realized that there's a lot of people who probably

15:15.160 --> 15:19.440
have heard that term but have no idea what it means. So what is an Arch trusted user and how

15:19.440 --> 15:26.520
did you become one? I became one through the work I'd done with the Mate desktop. So I'd done all

15:26.520 --> 15:32.680
this packaging and I was maintaining an unofficial repository for the Mate desktop project. And then

15:32.680 --> 15:40.240
I took over all of the Mate packages in the AUR because they were very old, had been put there by

15:40.240 --> 15:46.360
the original Mate project creator some years previous and brought them all up to scratch.

15:46.360 --> 15:52.560
And I was actually contacted by another Arch Linux trusted user who agreed to sponsor my

15:52.560 --> 15:58.160
application to join the team because I wanted to get Mate into the Arch Linux official repositories.

15:58.160 --> 16:04.320
So yeah, there's a process that you have to go through there. There's a peer review assessment

16:04.320 --> 16:10.560
and voting to actually vote you in onto the team and you sort of have to prove your worth and how

16:10.560 --> 16:15.520
you're going to improve the team. The main responsibilities of Arch Linux trusted users,

16:15.520 --> 16:21.880
they are the moderators if you like of the AUR. So there's the mailing list where people can say,

16:21.880 --> 16:26.880
can you merge these packages? Can you delete these old ones? Can you rename these? If anyone

16:26.880 --> 16:31.680
needs any help with package creation or wants their packages checking over, that's something

16:31.680 --> 16:37.120
that the trusted users do. The trusted users can then pull packages that they're interested in or

16:37.120 --> 16:43.000
that they see in the AUR that have got good adoption. So plenty of votes and something

16:43.000 --> 16:48.520
that can be redistributed. We'll then choose to adopt that package and pull it into the community

16:48.520 --> 16:55.720
repository and then maintain it as part as an official package. And then some of the TUs have

16:55.720 --> 17:00.760
other responsibilities within the team. So there'll be forum moderators, people that are working on

17:00.760 --> 17:05.240
backend infrastructure and things like that. Well, Arch and Matei seem like actually a pretty

17:05.240 --> 17:10.200
good combination because you could have a pretty tight lightweight system on there. So that's why

17:10.200 --> 17:15.480
I was drawn to that live CD and obviously I just had a pretty strong interest in Arch these days.

17:15.480 --> 17:19.920
But is there anything else, Martin, you want to touch on with the Matei desktop or Arch before

17:19.920 --> 17:25.480
we jump to our next topic? If you don't mind, I mean, one of the things I worked on was I did

17:25.480 --> 17:31.120
the initial porting to get Matei working on ARMv6 hard float and ARMv7 hard float.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.920
Well, you know, I was just using that this last week. That's awesome. Tell me about that.

17:34.920 --> 17:42.880
Well, curiously, that Qbox that you've got, I've got the previous generation, the Qbox Pro. So in

17:42.880 --> 17:51.040
air quotes, I created a cluster at home of two Raspberry Pis and two Qbox Pros to actually do

17:51.040 --> 17:57.120
the package building for the ARM ports. And the reason I did that is I had this aspiration to get

17:57.120 --> 18:01.360
it into the official repositories. And I knew if it hit the official repositories, it would

18:01.360 --> 18:07.120
automatically percolate into the build surface for the Arch Linux ARM project. And I wanted them

18:07.120 --> 18:13.200
just to flow straight in without any problem. So I was building the packages in the unofficial

18:13.200 --> 18:22.960
repositories for four architectures for x86-64 and the two arms. So yeah, I've got some of those

18:22.960 --> 18:27.120
Qbox or the older generation of the Qboxes, but it's hilarious. It takes about 50 minutes to build

18:27.120 --> 18:34.160
the whole Matei package tree for Matei 1.6 on a relatively modern PC. And it takes about 28 hours

18:34.160 --> 18:37.040
to build it on two ARM boxes. Wow.

18:37.040 --> 18:43.680
Well, I can't tell you how happy I was when I was sitting, I had LXDE was what I started with,

18:43.680 --> 18:47.760
and I thought, okay, LXDE is fine, but I really would like to have, like, I was trying to think

18:47.760 --> 18:52.400
if I was going to actually use this as a workstation to do like server work and stuff

18:52.400 --> 18:58.080
like that, I would probably want more than LXDE, that's just me. And it went off, I was sitting

18:58.080 --> 19:02.640
there and I couldn't really decide what to go with. And it was like a light bulb. I just knew

19:02.640 --> 19:08.160
all of a sudden, you know what, I got to go with Mate or Matei because it's going to be lightweight

19:08.160 --> 19:12.720
and I didn't know if it was going to be available for ARM. So I just, I went to the command line,

19:12.720 --> 19:17.120
did a pacman-s and I said, mate, and I think that's all I did. And before I hit enter,

19:17.120 --> 19:20.880
I went and did a Google search or to the over the arch Wiki and made sure I did like the right

19:20.880 --> 19:26.080
package and hit enter and boom, everything was there. And I got a full desktop and I really made

19:26.080 --> 19:31.040
that Qbox go from, you know, this is something that's really limited to, okay, now I could have

19:31.040 --> 19:37.120
a full desktop experience. And I think it's perfect for that kind of device. It really is.

19:37.120 --> 19:42.320
And something that I'm working on, the next little project I'm working on is an image for

19:42.320 --> 19:49.600
the Raspberry Pi, which will be Arch Linux with the Mate desktop installed, but with a series of

19:49.600 --> 19:56.320
tweaks so that it really flies. In fact, I think you had one of those laptop devices in a previous

19:56.320 --> 20:01.040
show. I've got one of those sat in front of me here with two, I've got two of those and two

20:01.040 --> 20:08.480
Raspberry Pis and I've started working on this. So soon enough there'll be a Mate image you can

20:08.480 --> 20:15.200
download with it all set up, ready to go with Arch Linux. Wow. Well, so Q5 Sis, who owns that

20:15.200 --> 20:20.720
laptop I was using, wants me to ask you if you know anything about Mate and their plans with

20:20.720 --> 20:27.360
Wayland. Have you heard anything about that? Yeah, I have. So, Mate 1.8 currently on the

20:27.360 --> 20:37.920
roadmap is to support Wayland and the precursor to that is to provide GTK 3 support. The work on GTK

20:37.920 --> 20:45.600
3 support is largely complete, but there are some Mate 1.7 development table releases. I've got an

20:45.600 --> 20:50.080
unofficial repository for Arch Linux users where you can go and install it and try it out. Although

20:50.080 --> 20:58.080
my build is currently still GTK 2, but I've got a GTK 3 version that I run locally. So that GTK 3

20:58.080 --> 21:03.840
work is there as the precursor and then the Wayland support will follow. Interesting. So I

21:03.840 --> 21:08.960
got to ask the obligatory, any discussions around Mir? Is there anything changed there?

21:10.000 --> 21:15.760
As far as I know, it's not planned to be supported. Well, I'm glad to hear that you guys,

21:15.760 --> 21:21.360
I think the compatibility or is that the right term? You're not switching to GTK 3,

21:21.360 --> 21:28.000
but you're supporting GTK 3. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. So we're retaining the GTK 2 support

21:28.000 --> 21:34.000
and adding GTK 3 support. So at build time, you can choose which toolkit you want to build against.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.840
That's cool. And this is so, for example, the Raspberry Pi at the moment, there's not a decent

21:39.840 --> 21:45.280
accelerated driver that's available. I think that's going to come in due course. So it would

21:45.280 --> 21:49.840
make sense to continue to build the packages for the Raspberry Pi against GTK 2 and keep it that

21:49.840 --> 21:56.640
little bit lighter. But then for the desktops, then maybe GTK 3 would make more sense. And what

21:56.640 --> 22:01.920
I'm wrestling with at the moment is do I really want to support both toolkits? And I think the

22:01.920 --> 22:05.600
answer is I'm going to have to, but that's going to effectively double the number of packages.

22:05.600 --> 22:12.080
Yeah, yeah. But that seems like to me, that seems, I know what that is. That means more overhead,

22:12.080 --> 22:16.720
but gosh, that's a great combination. If you can have GTK 2 and GTK 3 playing together,

22:17.760 --> 22:27.120
everybody's happy, it seems like. And although the GTK 3 toolkit support is not in MATE 1.6,

22:28.000 --> 22:34.000
GTK 3 applications will integrate seamlessly with MATE even though the desktop is GTK 2. So all of

22:34.800 --> 22:41.200
the theming and everything is transparent. So for example, if you run network managers in the live

22:41.200 --> 22:46.480
CD, for example, you won't notice that that's any different from any of the GTK 2 applications.

22:47.280 --> 22:52.240
That's really great. That's really great. Gosh, sounds like people have a misconception about the

22:52.240 --> 22:55.840
MATE project being old fashioned and out of date, but it sounds like you guys are right there on

22:55.840 --> 23:00.320
the cutting edge and some exciting stuff coming. In some respects, I mean, yes, that is one of

23:00.320 --> 23:05.440
the myths that I'd like to bust about MATE. It is seen as that everything got forked and

23:05.440 --> 23:12.720
it was a great big dirty hack that sat on top of the forked project. But in recent years,

23:12.720 --> 23:18.800
our lead developer, Stefano, he's really put a lot of effort into turning it into a proper project.

23:19.360 --> 23:24.480
So there is a roadmap. I mean, a lot of the obsolete libraries from the GNOME 2 days have been

23:25.280 --> 23:30.000
either replaced with the modern alternatives or just thrown out altogether. So that's one of the

23:30.000 --> 23:36.640
reasons why MATE is lighter than GNOME 2 used to be. But Gconf has been replaced with Dconf and

23:36.640 --> 23:41.840
Gsettings. And there's a whole raft of other changes like that. And then that will continue to

23:42.400 --> 23:47.520
be the case going into the future. So we're trying to align more with the GNOME libraries

23:47.520 --> 23:52.800
that provide the functionality that we need whilst preserving the MATE desktop and its

23:52.800 --> 23:59.040
traditional desktop metaphors. Well, Wimpy, aka Martin, thank you very much for joining us today.

23:59.040 --> 24:03.120
And I'd love to have you stick around for the rest of the show and jump in and comment with

24:03.120 --> 24:08.400
the rest of us as we go forward. And please feel free to stop by any time. I love getting

24:08.400 --> 24:12.320
perspective from people who work with the projects and also people who work with Arch Linux. I'm a

24:12.320 --> 24:16.800
huge Arch fan. So thanks very much for joining us. You're welcome. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely.

24:16.800 --> 24:21.040
Good stuff. Yeah. Hope we'll see you some more. All right, Matt. Well, before we go to the topic

24:21.040 --> 24:25.840
of the little snafu that got me all in all grage this week. Oh, man, I got to tell you,

24:25.840 --> 24:29.280
I'm actually glad we're doing this on a Tuesday because I was really flared up about this Monday

24:29.280 --> 24:34.720
and I probably said some things I shouldn't have in Coda Radio this week. But I've had some time

24:34.720 --> 24:38.960
to think about it and, you know, accept some of the responsibility. So I'm going to talk about

24:38.960 --> 24:43.520
that. But first, I want to thank our second sponsor this week. And that is DigitalOcean.

24:43.520 --> 24:47.760
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting, and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy

24:47.760 --> 24:52.160
way to spin up a cloud server. Now, Matt, you know, I've been on here bragging about my 47 seconds,

24:52.160 --> 24:56.960
right? Oh, yes, you have. Yeah. Well, so, of course, of course, you know, you leave it up to

24:56.960 --> 25:03.600
our audience. Mark writes into the show. He says, I beat the champ. I spun up a DigitalOcean cloud

25:03.600 --> 25:11.040
server in 40 seconds. Oh, 40 seconds. Yeah. And he actually this is you knew I wouldn't believe it

25:11.040 --> 25:16.320
because I had 47 seconds as the and DigitalOcean says you can do it. Users can do it in 55 seconds.

25:16.320 --> 25:21.360
Right. And I always got it down to 47. I was feeling pretty good. Mark clocks in here at 40

25:21.360 --> 25:25.520
seconds. And he even included a tiny can't really see it. Sorry. Actually, I was trying to get a

25:25.520 --> 25:30.640
shot of it for you guys. But he included a tiny screenshot. He got it in 40 seconds, his DigitalOcean

25:30.640 --> 25:34.480
droplets. So let me tell you a little bit about DigitalOcean. You can create a cloud server in

25:34.480 --> 25:39.680
55 seconds. If you're like myself, 47 is my record. See if you can beat Mark at 40 seconds. I don't

25:39.680 --> 25:44.160
think it can be done. See if you can beat him. Mark can create cloud server in 40 seconds. Pricing

25:44.160 --> 25:51.680
plans start at $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte

25:51.680 --> 25:56.640
of transfer. Now, this SSD actually makes a difference. I've had a DigitalOcean droplet

25:56.640 --> 26:00.720
running Arch Linux. Yes, I've got a server in Arch Linux. And yes, it's been fine. It's actually

26:00.720 --> 26:04.480
been great because I've been keeping real close to the updates to BitTorrent Sync because this

26:04.480 --> 26:09.120
is a BitTorrent Sync server. Now, Mark said what he's doing, he said, hey, I know you enjoy hearing

26:09.120 --> 26:13.680
about what people do with their DigitalOcean VPS is this particular one is used to host

26:13.680 --> 26:18.000
a Starbound server, which Starbound is just exploding on Steam right now. It's like the number

26:18.000 --> 26:22.480
one Linux game on Steam and it's cray-cray. I should talk about it at some point, but I know

26:22.480 --> 26:26.400
how much you guys hate it when I talk about games, but it's really good if you want to check it out.

26:26.400 --> 26:30.240
So he's running a Starbound server on there. I've heard from people who are running YASI search

26:30.240 --> 26:35.120
engines up there. BitTorrent Sync is great. Michael Dominic from Coda Radio uses it to

26:35.120 --> 26:38.880
work with his clients. He'll either use it for temporary backend hosting or he'll actually set

26:38.880 --> 26:43.120
them up a server over there because what's great about DigitalOcean is it's fixed pricing. So you

26:43.120 --> 26:47.200
know exactly what you're going to spend and clients love that. It also makes it really easy

26:47.200 --> 26:51.600
for budgeting of projects and things like that or just I know every month I can pay in five dollars.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.560
You know, we have people in the audience now that have web mail up there and they just know it's

26:54.560 --> 26:59.120
five dollars for my mail service. That's perfectly reasonable to have full access. And of course,

26:59.120 --> 27:04.880
DigitalOcean has a super great control panel that lets you image it and set up backups and deploy.

27:04.880 --> 27:08.640
You can configure a machine and save that and deploy it later. They also have data center

27:08.640 --> 27:12.560
locations in New York, San Francisco, and Amsterdam. So go check them out. Go see that

27:12.560 --> 27:17.600
intuitive control panel and you can also replicate it with the API if you want for your own tools.

27:17.600 --> 27:22.080
And DigitalOcean also has a vast collection of tutorials in their community section on their site

27:22.080 --> 27:26.320
and users can submit articles to the community and they get paid 50 dollars per published piece.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.840
But here's the deal. Here's where we're going to get you a little something something because

27:29.840 --> 27:33.680
you're a Linux Unplugged listener and we love you. We're doing this for you. So go take advantage

27:33.680 --> 27:38.720
of this because why wouldn't you? It's cray cray. If you use the promo code Linux Unplugged February,

27:38.720 --> 27:41.920
let them know that you appreciate they're still here. They've been here for a few months. Go use

27:41.920 --> 27:46.160
this promo code Linux Unplugged February to say thank you for continuing to come back for another

27:46.160 --> 27:49.760
month of Linux Unplugged. We appreciate you supporting Jupiter Broadcasting and Linux Unplugged

27:49.760 --> 27:53.840
Show and plus that's going to get you a ten dollar credit. That'll let you try out that five dollar

27:53.840 --> 27:58.320
machine for two months for free. You're going to get root access. You can run Ubuntu, Fedora,

27:58.320 --> 28:03.200
CentOS, Arch Linux, Debian, whatever you want son. Go do it and see what I've been talking about.

28:03.200 --> 28:08.160
This is a great thing to learn and experiment on or use in production and it's super fast with

28:08.160 --> 28:12.800
those SSDs and their tier one bandwidth. So thank you to DigitalOcean for supporting Linux Unplugged

28:12.800 --> 28:17.120
and Jupiter Broadcasting and thank you to everyone in our audience who uses that promo code Linux

28:17.120 --> 28:22.560
Unplugged February to get a ten dollar credit. You can also click the link in our show notes

28:22.560 --> 28:27.680
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean. Boy 40 seconds that's just wild isn't it?

28:29.040 --> 28:32.480
I mean like I wonder if he had to like create a few of them because you can make them real quick

28:32.480 --> 28:36.000
right? So right I wonder if he like ran through it a few times and then timed it and then just

28:36.000 --> 28:40.640
sent me his best one. Do you think he had a Rocky montage happening while he was doing this?

28:41.840 --> 28:45.680
Totally motivated and I like that. That's what I'll try. Maybe that's how I'll beat him.

28:46.800 --> 28:55.440
Okay so on on Sunday I was filling out the news and we had this KDE story about designers coming

28:55.440 --> 29:01.040
over to the KDE project to help spiffify up the next version of the plasma desktop and I thought

29:01.040 --> 29:06.240
okay this is good but this isn't this it's really early days on this story so it's not

29:06.880 --> 29:12.240
it's not a full story in itself I need a little something else to go with this story to kind of

29:12.880 --> 29:17.840
let's spend a minute this qualifies it to be in the news segment right that kind of thing so when

29:17.840 --> 29:22.880
I found this article and I was not thinking clearly and I fully admit that I was sort of

29:22.880 --> 29:26.880
just looking for something to round out the overall story and so I kind of cheated and just

29:26.880 --> 29:32.240
when I saw the headline I grabbed it and it's it was an article ran on Ferronix KDE Plasma next

29:32.240 --> 29:37.200
gets a release date and in here it talks about the plan to do a feature freeze in March which

29:37.200 --> 29:41.040
we talked about in the show beta in April and then the final version comes out in June will

29:41.040 --> 29:48.480
be called 2014.6 should it actually ship now nowhere nowhere in here does it say this was

29:48.480 --> 29:53.760
a proposal and I didn't report it as such because I didn't realize that and that was my bad because

29:53.760 --> 30:00.480
I made it sound like that's an actual planned commitment on the KDE projects point and I have

30:00.480 --> 30:04.000
a lot of respect for the KWIN developer Martin I'm not even gonna try to get Martin's last name

30:04.000 --> 30:07.600
because I know I gotta get I just gotta convince him to come on the show so he can pronounce it

30:07.600 --> 30:13.200
for me but you know there's some developers I follow in the open source community and Martin's

30:13.200 --> 30:17.280
one of the ones that I hold the highest regard as far as his talents and his insights and so

30:17.280 --> 30:21.920
I felt pretty bad when he went to G plus and he said reasons why sometimes hate the openness of

30:21.920 --> 30:26.480
free software we are not able to discuss anything without the media reporting about it on the same

30:26.480 --> 30:33.680
day sigh dear free software media you can leave the internal discussions as internal till there

30:33.680 --> 30:38.880
is a public statement thank you and so what he's saying there is so that pharaonic's post was a

30:38.880 --> 30:44.800
post from the mailing list on on you know whatever mailing list it was on uh and that was where the

30:44.800 --> 30:48.480
discussion was having on the plasma devel mailing list that's where the discussion was having

30:48.480 --> 30:54.000
taking place and it was being discussed as a hypothetical proposal it got ran as the as

30:54.000 --> 30:59.280
kde's plasma next gets a release date and then I grabbed it to round out a story and so you can

30:59.280 --> 31:04.800
see how we just sort of perpetuated this mistake that sort of all of a sudden commits the kde

31:04.800 --> 31:08.640
project to a timeline that they never actually agreed to and we're just discussing in their

31:08.640 --> 31:14.400
mailing list you know I can see yeah and I'm looking at this as a writer definitely I'm fine

31:14.400 --> 31:18.640
with the title but I think it needed to be in big bold print within the article that this was a

31:18.640 --> 31:22.000
proposal that's where I see the big that's why I think I think I would have the biggest issue with

31:22.000 --> 31:27.280
it is that this needs to be very clear I get the attention grabbing title that's fine whatever but

31:27.280 --> 31:32.000
be clear in the article and I didn't get that just when I was reading that um it definitely felt like

31:32.000 --> 31:36.480
that that should have been made much more clear and you know I mixed feelings on the list though

31:36.480 --> 31:41.280
honestly if it's on a public list you know as long as it's made clear and that part wasn't done in

31:41.280 --> 31:45.840
this case but as long as it's made clear I don't see that as a big problem as long as it's really

31:45.840 --> 31:50.880
really really really clear yeah I think it's I think it comes down to um my mistake was in not

31:50.880 --> 31:55.920
going to the mailing list itself and reading it and the reason why is because I get so sick and

31:55.920 --> 32:00.240
tired of reading mailing lists because from an outside perspective uh you know I'll give you an

32:00.240 --> 32:05.600
example so we had another story this Sunday on the Linux action show about OpenSUSE uh getting some

32:05.600 --> 32:11.520
changes at OpenSUSE where uh folks from SUSE proper would not be working on OpenSUSE for the release

32:11.520 --> 32:16.560
they'd be working on the ancillary services around OpenSUSE I first found out about that by following

32:16.560 --> 32:23.680
the mailing list but I was so confused on what I saw that I wasn't going to run the story because

32:25.040 --> 32:29.760
it it seemed to be saying that people from SUSE wouldn't be working on OpenSUSE anymore and to me

32:29.760 --> 32:34.720
that was like no way am I reading this right because first of all English isn't the primary

32:34.720 --> 32:39.520
language in some of these mailing lists uh there's assumed cultural references and you know assumed

32:39.520 --> 32:43.360
knowledge that people have to other people on the mailing list that is really hard to follow

32:43.360 --> 32:47.840
sometimes these conversations are 30 emails deep sometimes they're not and so it's these it's one

32:47.840 --> 32:53.200
of these things where I a lot of times I've sat on a story from a mailing list but one of my one

32:53.200 --> 32:59.120
of my sort of self checks is if I see another publication like LWN or Ferronix run the story

32:59.120 --> 33:03.520
then it kind of confirms what I found and I usually will then go with it and in this case

33:03.520 --> 33:11.520
with the OpenSUSE thing not only did LWN confirm it but I even before LWN had a story up oh no it

33:11.520 --> 33:15.760
was after LWN had a story up I reached out to an old friend of the show who now works at SUSE

33:15.760 --> 33:20.640
proper I don't know if he's made that public yet and I had a 45 minute conversation with him to

33:20.640 --> 33:26.240
try to really try to figure out am I really reading what I'm seeing now that resulted in

33:26.240 --> 33:30.880
five minutes of coverage in the Linux action show but I probably spent two hours on that story to

33:30.880 --> 33:36.240
verify it just because it seems so massive now I can't do that for every story and in this case

33:36.240 --> 33:39.920
I was being lazy and I could have gone into the KD emailing list and saw that they were

33:39.920 --> 33:45.680
saying proposal but I just went with the Ferronix headline that was my mistake but it seems like

33:45.680 --> 33:50.640
I think potentially what bothers me about this Ferronix mistake here is I actually think he

33:50.640 --> 33:54.560
probably wasn't even aware it was a proposal either got sent to him and he ran with it like

33:54.560 --> 33:59.360
somebody posted in the forum and then he republished it or he grabbed it and he was working quick and

33:59.360 --> 34:03.440
he didn't read it all the way and he made the mistake and that perpetuated the mistake now I

34:03.440 --> 34:08.800
also perpetuated it so it's my fault too well I think also that another differentiator is essentially

34:08.800 --> 34:16.160
at its essence it's essentially a blog versus a major publication like you know a mag and like

34:16.160 --> 34:19.920
an online magazine or something like that so like the CNETs of the world while I gripe you know I

34:19.920 --> 34:24.960
gripe at various publications online usually there's multi-tiered editing that happens and

34:24.960 --> 34:29.760
fact-checking that happens in a written format and so when we read something on these sites

34:29.760 --> 34:36.080
we trust that that information is in fact actual and Ferronix has been we you know would assume

34:36.080 --> 34:41.040
had that same level of clarity but in this case we were kind of let down it feels like

34:41.040 --> 34:45.280
I feel like okay so again I want to give you guys so this really bothers me when we make these

34:45.280 --> 34:50.960
mistakes in the show because I so I don't remember what it was exactly but this whole problem of

34:50.960 --> 34:55.280
somebody reading something on a mailing list and then it getting reported as news isn't unique to

34:55.280 --> 35:00.400
the KDE project like I remember this happened to Arch I was reminded recently that the announcement

35:00.400 --> 35:04.720
when they were just discussing Arch switching to systemd people grabbed that and ran with it as

35:04.720 --> 35:09.360
Arch is officially switching before it was actually officially switching so it happens

35:09.360 --> 35:12.960
all the time and so originally I was trying to think well how can we improve that process

35:13.920 --> 35:19.200
and I think you know when the first so the last time the show had a kind of a I can't even remember

35:19.200 --> 35:23.520
what the gaff was but there was a we covered something wrong in the show and that was the

35:23.520 --> 35:29.200
inspiration for the creation of the Linux action show subreddit the idea was is I don't want I

35:29.200 --> 35:34.320
don't want if we're gonna have the podcast of record for Linux I don't want to have I want

35:34.320 --> 35:37.760
to minimize mistakes as much as possible because every time there's a mistake it really it really

35:37.760 --> 35:42.800
eats at me and so at least in the news and so I thought okay I could drop the news because I'd

35:42.800 --> 35:47.200
rather not do the news well and I don't think you need to drop it I and not to cut you off here but

35:47.200 --> 35:51.920
I want to point out that if I had a dollar for every time I misquoted or got something wrong

35:51.920 --> 35:56.560
that's what corrections are and that's what this show is it allows for a correction and that's

35:56.560 --> 35:59.520
that's allowed so I thought okay dropping the news that's going too far but I just want to

35:59.520 --> 36:02.960
show you I want I'm trying to illustrate my commitment to trying to get this right is I

36:02.960 --> 36:07.200
would rather not do it at all than make the mistake so okay that was the inspiration for

36:07.200 --> 36:11.680
the subreddit was here's what we'll do we'll assemble an army of informed Linux enthusiasts

36:11.680 --> 36:16.080
and the crowd knowledge will sift through all of the news and I won't let a story and in fact I

36:16.080 --> 36:20.240
even think I said this on air I won't let a story into the show until it's been vetted by the

36:20.240 --> 36:28.960
community however that was a good theory but the problem is is I think first of all Linux news is

36:28.960 --> 36:33.840
sort of going through a slow period right now so it requires a lot more digging so hence the going

36:33.840 --> 36:40.000
to the mailing list right and so you can't you can't expect the burden of a loose group of

36:40.000 --> 36:44.400
community enthusiasts to actually do all that digging and try to do original reporting and

36:44.400 --> 36:49.760
submit it to a Linux action show subreddit so I take that burden on because it Linux action show

36:49.760 --> 36:53.520
happens every single Sunday and the one thing I can count on is that I will get something in

36:53.520 --> 36:57.520
place for it so I take that on and I do the digging so sometimes I fall short a little bit

36:57.520 --> 37:02.000
and what happens is is if I do digging outside the subreddit which I always am doing because

37:02.000 --> 37:05.680
I'm always trying to one up the subreddit too and try to find something they didn't find

37:05.680 --> 37:09.760
it means it never makes it never gets vetted through the show because it doesn't go through

37:09.760 --> 37:13.600
that process and so I'm either left with not covering stories that don't go through the

37:13.600 --> 37:18.640
subreddit which doesn't seem very likely or trying to come up with another way to sort of improve the

37:18.640 --> 37:23.840
quality of news and and I'm kind of I'm kind of wondering I kind of want to open this discussion

37:23.840 --> 37:28.640
up to the mumble room and of course to you too and and see what people think of our ideas on ways

37:28.640 --> 37:34.880
we could improve the news and one idea I had I'll tell you my idea up front was maybe we we drop the

37:34.880 --> 37:40.000
amount of news we cover and focus on a couple of stories and maybe one of the one or two or three

37:40.000 --> 37:43.920
of the stories maybe it's four stories I don't know what that mix is but one of them we try to

37:43.920 --> 37:49.520
get an interview on with the person who's making the story now the problem with this is is this

37:49.520 --> 37:55.040
would actually just require like somebody from the community become a producer for that and they

37:55.040 --> 37:59.280
track down the story then track down the person and line up the timings that way we can chat with

37:59.280 --> 38:04.400
them because I just that's not something I have time to do I it is it's more work than it sounds

38:04.400 --> 38:08.480
it sounds like it's not a lot of work it's it's probably four four to six hours of work oh it's

38:08.480 --> 38:12.320
tough I mean you're calling Google you're calling LinkedIn you're calling pretty much any place you

38:12.320 --> 38:15.360
can think of to hopefully find an email address and then there's a few tricks that most people

38:15.360 --> 38:19.360
don't know and then there's then there's the 30 email back and forth lining up and answering all

38:19.360 --> 38:24.960
of the questions I mean it is this massive process that it takes a ton of time so but I feel like if

38:24.960 --> 38:31.280
if the show's going on eight years and I feel like we could take it up a notch by sort of

38:31.280 --> 38:36.640
having the newsmakers come on and make the news right there and say I I think if if we established

38:36.640 --> 38:40.320
you know the linux action show news segment you're going to hear from some of the newsmakers every

38:40.320 --> 38:46.800
episode I think that would be a huge uh upgrade for this news segment and I think also it would

38:46.800 --> 38:50.160
sort of establish like people eventually would figure out hey we're about to have an announcement

38:50.160 --> 38:54.240
let's schedule something with last uh so I don't know what do you guys think yeah go ahead I think

38:54.240 --> 38:58.800
what you said is what I've managed to gather is most of your common mistakes seem to be coming

38:58.800 --> 39:05.680
from generally one news source and that's for onyx oh yeah I mean there is that I mean that's like

39:05.680 --> 39:09.280
you know I mean like but at the same time everybody was claiming he was wrong about steam

39:09.280 --> 39:13.760
and then it turns out he was right about steam wait isn't this what um unplugged is for though

39:13.760 --> 39:19.120
so like you can get feedback from them like news segments so like you can correct yourself

39:19.120 --> 39:26.400
on unplugged if you need to yeah we do perfect yeah but there's a mistake later and it's fine

39:26.400 --> 39:31.360
in my eyes you can't really expect everyone to listen to two podcasts though no baby but you

39:31.360 --> 39:35.840
can't expect someone to go back to an old article either that I published or someone else publishes

39:35.840 --> 39:39.680
and say oh wow I was completely wrong they've already read it they've moved on you know so

39:39.680 --> 39:44.080
all you can do is put your retraction out there and let the chips fall maybe what you have to do

39:44.080 --> 39:48.800
is have your new studio troll do the research for you well see here's the other thing too is

39:48.800 --> 39:52.400
I think what I'm trying to address this is a problem and this is actually when I scratched

39:52.400 --> 39:57.040
down my thoughts on this what I actually titled this as is fixing linux news because what what

39:57.040 --> 40:02.240
we've talked about on this show uh it was episode 11 of linux unplugged we titled it bankrupt linux

40:02.240 --> 40:07.840
news because it is there is just not a lot of good linux there's some there is some and I

40:07.840 --> 40:12.720
want to give them credit but there's not enough and I thought maybe we can improve the quality

40:12.720 --> 40:18.400
of news coverage in last and at the same time improve the overall state of linux news coverage

40:18.400 --> 40:24.800
like like actually become a new source and in that sense that's why because we have this access to

40:24.800 --> 40:28.480
communities we have these we have these personalities and these developers that we

40:28.480 --> 40:33.920
can reach out to I think we have an opportunity to have instead of getting misquoted blogs

40:33.920 --> 40:37.520
and and and reddit posts from see the problem is this is not a problem that's going to go away

40:37.520 --> 40:40.880
because you got reddit you got twitter you got google plus people are going to be grabbing stuff

40:40.880 --> 40:45.200
and misreporting stuff constantly ferronics made the mistake today but all it takes is some

40:46.000 --> 40:50.320
reddit enthusiasts to post it and it could become it could quickly become the top vote on r slash

40:50.320 --> 40:55.280
linux and be completely inaccurate right so there's it's not just ferronics it's a larger

40:55.280 --> 41:01.040
problem that I think I'm trying to solve here I'd say just it would require some more research

41:01.040 --> 41:06.240
before it even makes it into the show and ultimately if you do want to bring somebody

41:06.240 --> 41:11.200
in for an interview make that for the main section of the show not necessarily the news section

41:11.200 --> 41:14.880
I think I'm thinking the interview would be like two minutes long so you bring somebody on you say

41:14.880 --> 41:20.320
okay so uh we saw there's a new version of uh this that shipped today can you tell us a little bit

41:20.320 --> 41:25.440
about it boom boom super quick then we move on and we do a couple other news stories and I like a

41:25.440 --> 41:29.600
pundit yeah they come in they well they just they just tell us what they're up to or the other thing

41:29.600 --> 41:33.840
we could do is in lieu of getting the person that actually is behind the story maybe we could get

41:33.840 --> 41:37.360
the person who broke the story and ask them some of the and clarify some of the questions right

41:37.360 --> 41:42.480
there and get it on the record that's a really good idea but I think as long as you can catch

41:42.480 --> 41:47.280
it ahead of time like if you find it and you can catch it as long as you just put it like a little

41:47.280 --> 41:52.320
thing in his show notes and a little comment on a youtube channel I think you're fine I mean

41:52.320 --> 41:56.720
everybody's human like people make mistakes as long as you actually like catch a mistake and

41:57.280 --> 42:04.240
own up to it I think you're fine so uh q5 sis pointed out in the chat room that uh he he said

42:04.240 --> 42:10.880
that maybe um since feronix is being filled is getting more and more ads maybe it was a clickbait

42:10.880 --> 42:16.400
type title and regardless of whether or not that's true maybe something uh maybe the same

42:16.400 --> 42:23.280
philosophy that you applied to unfilter with um you know that news should be without sponsors

42:23.280 --> 42:30.320
maybe that needs to be applied to linux news as well um no the the easiest fix in my opinion is

42:30.320 --> 42:36.160
to basically subdomain this out on news have it have it you know have the news story posted

42:36.160 --> 42:41.360
always have two separate unrelated citations as to where it came from maybe it's a mailing list

42:41.360 --> 42:46.240
and an actual statement or blog post from that developer or whatever it may be and then it can

42:46.240 --> 42:52.480
actually and if you can't obtain two then it is then flagged as uh speculative not news you know

42:52.480 --> 42:58.400
so that way you know if we're gonna have pundits we're gonna have to have this fox news or cnn

42:58.400 --> 43:03.920
sound effects i don't think pundits is the right descriptor i would be more like

43:03.920 --> 43:06.400
even more like the developers know what they're talking about

43:06.400 --> 43:11.440
first we need a situation around colonic yeah you know and the thing is is the more i think

43:11.440 --> 43:16.320
about it i mean it's really it it's it's almost infeasible production wise on a weekly schedule

43:16.320 --> 43:20.080
like that but it would really have to i would be something i'd be willing to take on if we

43:20.080 --> 43:24.720
had somebody in the community who who wanted to sort of step up and be that coordinator sort of

43:24.720 --> 43:27.840
be that production person like he's definitely willing to do that he's actually mentioned he's

43:27.840 --> 43:31.200
trying to get in wanted to comment on this but uh he did indicate in the chat room that he would

43:31.200 --> 43:35.760
be interested in taking on that role if that was something you wanted to do oh well all right well

43:35.760 --> 43:39.520
i'll talk to him more often because that yeah i'm definitely i'm definitely down for that if

43:39.520 --> 43:43.840
you want to oh well you know make headway in that direction yeah okay yeah let's talk more because

43:43.840 --> 43:48.640
uh i mean i'm not i don't want to convert every last new segment into an interview segment but

43:48.640 --> 43:54.400
i feel like if if nothing else i want to i want to maybe yeah if the big stuff and we can get

43:54.400 --> 43:58.240
stuff in there and if we can just i just want to try to get as accurate as possible because it

43:58.240 --> 44:02.240
really bothers me when we get the stories wrong so you and i will chat more and maybe we can work

44:02.240 --> 44:07.200
something out there i gotta i gotta ask are we gonna have a situation room because we really need

44:07.200 --> 44:11.200
to have a situation right and i don't want a wall of that's what i've been saying this whole time

44:11.200 --> 44:16.240
you get like three screens all over the place i mean all right all right here you go here you go

44:16.240 --> 44:32.000
this is cnn's wolf blitzer and you're in the situation room uh matt i'm reporting live on

44:32.000 --> 44:36.480
the scene from the mailing list right now i can tell you i've reviewed the thread i've actually

44:36.480 --> 44:44.720
read every single email and i can confirm these dates are simply proposals situation situation

44:44.720 --> 44:47.760
thanks chris now we're all gonna get flagged on youtube oh that was hysterical

44:48.800 --> 44:53.360
or we could do like fox news and have those oversized monitors of death you know i got that

44:53.360 --> 44:58.160
too chris i've got the uh wall of screens already taken care of yeah you do that's right you are in

44:58.160 --> 45:05.760
the situation room you got like uh yeah you got uh shep and uh wolf beat well um so speaking of uh

45:06.400 --> 45:12.640
last sunday um i was wondering about something back to the uh desktop app you picked the uh

45:12.640 --> 45:19.600
live streamer um i actually found something really cool this weekend uh it's called youtube viewer

45:19.600 --> 45:26.560
it's actually a command line tool to view youtube in your terminal so it's youtube uh viewer yes

45:26.560 --> 45:31.360
it's youtube in a terminal and that sounds like it's gonna that's a pretty generic search but

45:31.360 --> 45:35.600
actually i found it right here it's on github all right is the video then ascii i mean how's that

45:35.600 --> 45:41.760
work no you like you load youtube viewer in a terminal and pops up you can log in like you can

45:41.760 --> 45:47.360
see all your subscriptions and it'll give a video and it'll just have a number beside the video so

45:47.360 --> 45:53.920
you press one and then a video and it'll play it through in player does it does it use like a vlc

45:53.920 --> 46:02.000
as the as like the back end you can use the vlc as in player or employer i think so uh and you

46:02.000 --> 46:06.400
just what you just just put the command in the command line and then uh you just put the youtube

46:06.400 --> 46:11.120
url in there and then bob's your uncle no you don't need a url like you search for the video

46:11.120 --> 46:15.840
and then youtube viewer you know like display them and you just hit the number next to the video and

46:15.840 --> 46:22.000
it'll play it oh and you can actually select the uh video quality too i feel like that's that is for

46:22.000 --> 46:28.400
720p like dash 10 for 1080 that's really cool i just put a i put a link in the show notes and

46:28.400 --> 46:31.920
in the chat room so you guys yeah i just want to get that out real quick before we get out there

46:32.720 --> 46:38.320
that is cool and there's also an app called youtube dl to uh right download from the

46:38.320 --> 46:42.560
terminal that's a gooey one though or is that coming it's not gooey no it's a terminal

46:43.360 --> 46:47.760
yeah there's another one it's a gooey but this one's a terminal one so um i want to talk a little

46:47.760 --> 46:52.320
bit about my news process and uh because i do i i think maybe the there might be the wrong

46:52.320 --> 46:56.800
assumption that way there's not a lot of research done in them now so right now uh first of all i

46:56.800 --> 47:01.040
think one way we could address this problem is i'd like to call on a new focus in the linux action

47:01.040 --> 47:06.720
show subreddit on news correlation i'm not saying off topic i'm not saying all the other discussions

47:06.720 --> 47:11.120
aren't fine but please just want to remind everybody if you see a story uh let's post it

47:11.120 --> 47:13.920
there because i've been noticing some stories that i'm tracking that are not showing up in

47:13.920 --> 47:17.280
the subreddit which is normally it used to be the subreddit was like the best place to get the latest

47:17.280 --> 47:22.160
breaking stuff so i just kind of want to maybe refocus on news there too and i also along with

47:22.160 --> 47:26.800
that it's equally important that people vote up and down the stories they think should be in the

47:26.800 --> 47:32.000
show and if you know something's wrong please say so in the comments or if you have an alternative

47:32.000 --> 47:36.160
take or if you have some additional thoughts please engage in the comments all of the stuff

47:36.160 --> 47:39.360
all the other community stuff that happens there right now is awesome i love that subreddit it's

47:39.360 --> 47:43.040
funny because i was starting to say you know we created it because of a mistake and it was just

47:43.040 --> 47:48.560
going to be a news vetting tool for the show and it has developed into this vibrant awesome community

47:48.560 --> 47:53.200
that is really you know one of the driving forces behind the show and so i don't want to break what

47:53.200 --> 47:59.040
it's doing but i also want to call for a focus on um using it really as a tool for content that

47:59.040 --> 48:03.360
should be in the show and vetting out the stuff that's crap well here's an option like you said

48:03.360 --> 48:08.640
earlier that you try to compete with the subreddit about breaking news and stuff and instead of doing

48:08.640 --> 48:12.560
that you could post the articles on it and say this is a potential for a news yeah i've been

48:12.560 --> 48:15.840
doing that now but you know what the problem is is like if you got i want to every now and then

48:15.840 --> 48:19.440
have a few surprises in the news segments that way if somebody goes to that subreddit several

48:19.440 --> 48:24.240
times a day they can turn on last and still maybe hear a story they didn't see in the subreddit i

48:24.240 --> 48:29.600
don't always get there but hey chris i wasn't necessarily saying you weren't doing the research

48:29.600 --> 48:34.720
it's just you are very busy with all these shows going on and you know maybe having somebody like

48:34.720 --> 48:39.200
rick i help you out would be a huge benefit yeah i think i i am going to try to build out a little

48:39.200 --> 48:42.560
team there because there's other you know then that could benefit the other shows too you know

48:42.560 --> 48:50.800
it's not just last i um not to bash it or anything but i don't use like stuff like ours technica or

48:50.800 --> 49:00.480
or gizmodo or stuff like that i usually try to find the primary source because i feel like that

49:00.480 --> 49:08.320
sometimes when you have things like ours technica or gizmodo or or kodoku or or whatever website that

49:08.320 --> 49:16.800
is i i feel that it's sometimes opinionated right and and i'm very factual so i i like to get

49:16.800 --> 49:21.200
just straight to the facts and i don't want to hear about oh well you know it could be used for

49:21.200 --> 49:29.360
this feature i i can kind of discern that for myself but for the most part i use primary resources

49:29.360 --> 49:33.360
if i could build on that i think some of the biggest offenders in the linux world would be

49:33.360 --> 49:40.000
like ferronics or omg ubuntu yes definitely definitely the sites like that do kind of have

49:40.000 --> 49:47.040
the advantage that a they give new users easy to digest information and they also aggregate uh

49:47.040 --> 49:51.920
stories so that a new user who wants linux news wouldn't necessarily have to go find the mailing

49:51.920 --> 49:59.360
list or something like that that's true i just feel that sometimes when we reach out into those

49:59.360 --> 50:05.040
type of sources that it sometimes is a little bit too opinionated to one side than it is to the other

50:05.040 --> 50:13.680
i just don't like the idea of sorry sorry i don't like the idea of putting ferronics in the same

50:13.680 --> 50:19.680
area as like network world because i mean if you really want bad coverage anything from zdnet i mean

50:19.680 --> 50:23.600
well this is the problem you guys is everywhere it's bad coverage it really is pretty bad there's

50:23.600 --> 50:28.800
there's there's a handful of legitimate community-based or or even business-based

50:28.800 --> 50:33.600
outlets that get it right but they're in the minority yeah and i'm just to pipe in on this

50:33.600 --> 50:38.160
a little bit just to give you guys some perspective the bigger the company the worse it is honestly

50:38.160 --> 50:43.200
i'm gonna i'm gonna be real blunt with you and then it just it's just the way it is now if it's

50:43.200 --> 50:47.440
technical information only it's not so bad but if you're trying to actually your job is to grab

50:47.440 --> 50:52.800
eyeballs that's what your job is um be factual if you can but by all means come heaven or hell get

50:52.800 --> 50:58.000
good eyeballs that's really what that's why i love the linux action show because of not only

50:58.000 --> 51:05.040
your commitment but the community's commitment to accuracy right yep yeah i realize this i realize

51:05.040 --> 51:11.360
this probably isn't possible but i think it'd be great if we could get like a uh jupiter news.com

51:11.360 --> 51:17.120
and have a like the community write pieces that's interesting just tell me you wanted to before i

51:17.120 --> 51:24.000
go too far from ours technica you wanted to make a defense there right well yeah oh well yeah there

51:24.000 --> 51:30.320
are technica it depends it depends if how long the article is when i really love their coverage of

51:30.320 --> 51:40.160
like uh geohots and the whole sony hack and the whole doxxing of of um ah that one security

51:40.160 --> 51:44.960
researcher by anonymous that was those were great articles yeah i think so i don't think it's a

51:44.960 --> 51:48.800
black and white thing like i think pharaonix does some good work too with benchmarking and they do

51:48.800 --> 51:52.240
some good work with the steam coverage that they have there so i don't think it's all black and

51:52.240 --> 52:00.000
white most of it's bad on pharaonix if it's like gossipy type stuff but like if it's benchmarked

52:00.000 --> 52:04.480
and things like that that's where pharaonix has its place i think i think when it comes to site

52:04.480 --> 52:09.440
select pharaonix a lot of what i see is the writers are typically people who use windows or os 10

52:10.160 --> 52:15.520
they give linux a try and give it a review based on okay they're giving an ubuntu try for a week

52:15.520 --> 52:20.400
or something a lot of times and also a lot of times when something usually when something

52:20.400 --> 52:24.880
inaccurate happens a lot of times you're looking at a slow news week and so they're combing through

52:24.880 --> 52:29.520
mailing lists looking for any hint of something that can maybe tweak into something that's not or

52:29.520 --> 52:33.600
exaggerated a little bit i mean it's a problem that that really happens but when you have really

52:33.600 --> 52:37.920
good coverage that's not a reflection of how awesome that site is that's a reflection of

52:37.920 --> 52:42.640
really awesome news being there available that week all right wizard wizard jed there has uh

52:42.640 --> 52:47.680
one last remark on pharaonix and i think we'll close the book on pharaon okay yeah i just wanted

52:47.680 --> 52:54.160
to say uh for even pharaonix even for benchmarking you've really got to take a good look at it uh

52:54.160 --> 52:58.880
he's gotten better with time but if you look at any of his old stuff i think he's been learning

52:58.880 --> 53:02.960
with time that you know to get closer and closer and to use the same hardware with everything but

53:03.520 --> 53:07.600
if you go back he'll go and you'll you'll use the same processor and say yeah this is the exact same

53:07.600 --> 53:12.800
bench but he's using it on a board that has a lower lower bus speed than the other one so it's

53:12.800 --> 53:19.440
never going to be the same uh never going to be the same uh benchmark at all but he puts his

53:19.440 --> 53:23.440
hardware in an advantage one of the things he's testing already has an advantage versus the other

53:23.440 --> 53:29.840
thing but he did that for a couple of things like even file system tests and stuff i uh i think i'll

53:29.840 --> 53:34.480
shift gears i think you know i'll wrap up the news discussion with just sort of this comment is i

53:34.480 --> 53:39.600
think i'm thinking more about this stuff too as we reach episode 300 uh so it's my commitment to

53:39.600 --> 53:44.240
martin and the kd project and all of the listeners of the show and that you know i at post 300 i

53:44.240 --> 53:49.840
really want to improve our quality of news and i i want it to be as reliable as any news outlet for

53:49.840 --> 53:56.720
linux it's last isn't about breaking news it's about analyzing the news of the events and and

53:56.720 --> 54:02.640
and commenting on that development for that week and it's sort of every week we're taking a slice

54:02.640 --> 54:06.080
of what happened in the linux and open source world and analyzing it and trying to pull out

54:06.080 --> 54:10.000
the most important things that happened that week so if you if you only listen to one thing i want

54:10.000 --> 54:13.200
the linux action show to be the thing you can listen to and know that you're getting the best

54:13.200 --> 54:18.560
stories of the week and my goal isn't to sort of try to change that model it's just to improve it

54:18.560 --> 54:23.280
and say you know if we can go directly to a source in some cases and just get them on the show and

54:23.280 --> 54:26.880
get it right out of them and quickly as we're doing some or other coverage i think that'd be

54:26.880 --> 54:31.760
a good improvement to the show and i don't know if that's the end goal because that is it is a lot

54:31.760 --> 54:37.200
of work but we'll see post 300 i'd like to see if we can't get there um and uh we'll at least try

54:37.200 --> 54:41.840
to make improvements where we can yeah go ahead i'd like to just uh just say one more thing

54:41.840 --> 54:47.440
regarding last um the great thing about linux action show is even if it's a slow news week

54:47.440 --> 54:52.560
the other main section of the show can really provide something to give that show some um

54:52.560 --> 54:57.520
compared to the news section sure yeah yeah oh yeah that's that's i mean that's what we always

54:57.520 --> 55:00.800
try to make sure that we know last even if you don't like the main topic there's going to be news

55:00.800 --> 55:04.480
and feedback and pics and if you like the main topic and it's a bet it's a win-win etc there's

55:04.480 --> 55:09.040
always something there for everybody uh but why don't we i got an email from uh from somebody

55:09.040 --> 55:13.760
named cash i love that name nice and uh this is an argument that i think i've heard kicked around

55:13.760 --> 55:18.320
i've even considered myself he says hey guys i'm a big fan of linux action show and linux unplugged

55:18.320 --> 55:23.600
it's a great video podcast i have a question though do we really want linux to be a mainstream

55:23.600 --> 55:29.440
os for example imagine everybody in this world able to drive a ferrari or some kind of rare car

55:29.440 --> 55:34.880
it doesn't feel special anymore once again do we really really want linux to be a mainstream us

55:34.880 --> 55:39.360
thanks you guys and keep up the good work cash in malaysia that's an excellent point i mean i think

55:39.360 --> 55:44.800
for myself personally i'm okay with i want everybody in my circle of influence to enjoy it

55:46.000 --> 55:49.840
you know if that makes sense if you say they were a bunch of hipsters now

55:51.680 --> 55:54.880
you know that's kind of where i so here i come down on two minds of this i'm with matt at the

55:54.880 --> 55:59.920
same time i'm like hey as long as it makes me happy and makes anybody that i get to use it or

55:59.920 --> 56:04.240
wants to use it happy that's all it really needs to do and it's up to everybody else to figure it

56:04.240 --> 56:10.080
out on their own and then at the same time i don't know i think maybe it's it's it's maybe

56:10.080 --> 56:15.520
a little bit of that richard stallman in me get it out of here but i i wonder if if if we don't

56:15.520 --> 56:19.760
sort of owe it to try to make this free and open platform available to everyone who doesn't want

56:19.760 --> 56:24.400
to be restricted by the computer systems that are really just designed to monetize them and lock

56:24.400 --> 56:28.880
them down and keep them locked into ecosystems see linux sort of provides this general computing

56:28.880 --> 56:35.520
platform that frees people from the corporatization of computing and in some ways it almost feels like

56:35.520 --> 56:38.880
a duty to make that available to everybody else but the other way i'm like it doesn't mean we

56:38.880 --> 56:44.400
need to sacrifice making an awesome desktop i don't know what do you guys think i i disagree

56:44.400 --> 56:49.440
with the fact that it shouldn't be mainstream i personally would love to see more stuff like

56:49.440 --> 56:54.240
netflix be easily available on linux just to be able to like click and watch without having to use

56:54.240 --> 56:59.520
something like pipeline and have to worry about some bug and wine preventing me to be able to

56:59.520 --> 57:05.840
watch it or some graphics drivers you know getting better see even if the linux does go mainstream

57:05.840 --> 57:10.560
you can still be a hipster if you use awesome or x9 that's true well so i mean like i think wizard

57:10.560 --> 57:14.560
jet here brings up a good point i mean he thinks we've gotten as far as we have because we haven't

57:14.560 --> 57:20.800
been limited just to geeks go ahead wizard yeah uh we we we've always taken in input from everyone

57:20.800 --> 57:26.400
else because linux only exists because the community has made it exist you know just the

57:26.400 --> 57:31.680
kernel doesn't make all of linux just just the new user land doesn't make just all of linux

57:31.680 --> 57:35.680
it's because we've all gotten together and made certain parts and because everyone's had input

57:35.680 --> 57:39.840
we've made what we have today and it's only through going and you know having more people

57:39.840 --> 57:45.760
in there we that i can only see benefits of having you know the clinics get better i know this is

57:45.760 --> 57:51.360
going to make a lot of people form at the mouth but i think canonicals efforts in the past what

57:51.360 --> 57:58.320
is it uh 13 i mean no i mean eight nine years that they have done to bring ubuntu to it used

57:58.320 --> 58:05.120
to be linux for human beings but now it's i guess mainstream that has helped bring linux so far to

58:05.120 --> 58:11.840
where it is now i think that's what linspire attempted to do and wasn't able to do successfully

58:11.840 --> 58:16.080
but they learned from their mistakes and built up built upon it yeah yeah i i agree they've

58:16.080 --> 58:19.520
helped a lot with uh getting a lot more people to try it and you just look at the adoption you've

58:19.520 --> 58:24.320
seen in business too that that's that's not quite fair to all the other projects that you know

58:24.320 --> 58:28.400
wouldn't be able to exist if it wasn't for them too so it's it there's a lot of there's a lot of

58:28.400 --> 58:33.040
love to go around but i think i agree in the end bringing more and more people in all the time

58:33.040 --> 58:39.040
improves the linux to look at look at it in a different way uh linux has seen such an we're

58:39.040 --> 58:45.920
going to cover a story on sunday that i've already been researching uh that about uh where the code

58:45.920 --> 58:51.040
growth is in linux over 2013 and uh the linux foundation put out their analysis you guys

58:51.040 --> 59:00.000
probably all saw the link now and uh it it to me is so it so underscores how bringing in arm and

59:00.000 --> 59:05.200
going to mobile even though like we see a lot of companies like google and android and samsung sort

59:05.200 --> 59:09.520
of using linux for all these different things it actually has brought so much to linux itself so

59:09.520 --> 59:13.920
many new features so many new improvements have come from that work and continue to come from

59:13.920 --> 59:18.960
that work efficiencies too and that's by bringing in a new class of people and a new class of

59:18.960 --> 59:23.600
hardware partners because it's not just users it's not just desktop users it's developers it's

59:23.600 --> 59:27.520
hardware manufacturers it's business interests and we've brought them in and because of that

59:27.520 --> 59:32.000
we've gotten better we've gotten stronger and i would argue that you know we we used to bang on

59:32.000 --> 59:36.560
tevo for the tevo ization of linux but i don't think it's harmed linux one little tiny teensy bit

59:39.280 --> 59:44.960
here's my only fear and the you can call me richard stallman for all you care but

59:46.480 --> 59:53.520
but um i just don't want to see that we have a whole bunch of developers developed to a point

59:53.520 --> 01:00:00.560
where a lot of the linux kernel or a lot of the linux stuff that's in there is closed off from

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:07.920
people so like only the development comes from the developer teams i i would prefer to see kind

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:13.520
of like a symbiotic relationship between the developers and the open community just a little

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:19.680
bit because say like you know like how we have adobe killing us on flash so we have to figure

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:26.560
out ways of working around with flash a little bit more it it would probably be more beneficial

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:32.480
if yes i do think that we need more people but we also want to have people that would be willing to

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:38.960
contribute to the community not just not just in a software fashion but also in a communication

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.680
fashion i don't even necessarily think they have to directly contribute but i mean if somebody

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.920
you know is helping support them or if it's a support team that may run into these issues

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.000
the more people using it the more issues that get highlighted and fixed i think wimpy fills

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
this role really well right now with the mate project where he's uh you know he's here he's

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.680
advocating made he's very informed about he's communicating with the developers he's working

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:05.280
with a large distribution uh it's it's it's exactly what a lot of these projects need and

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.960
so i think he's a great example i'm another reason i'm glad he could join us this week

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.240
uh well there you go cash there's the uh there's the community's uh the virtual lugs thoughts on

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:19.280
linux staying mainstream it sounds like for the good of linux we have to continue to grow we must

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.480
assimilate all as the borg would say uh all right matt well i think we'll wrap it up right there at

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.280
that point um i'm not gonna say what we're gonna talk about on sunday i'm just not gonna do that

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280
anymore because every time i commit something comes up and we have something else but i will

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:39.760
say there is a possibility according to the forecast that we'll have snow so if matt ends

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.000
up skyping in on sunday that you can assume we got a good uh snow dumping here in washington

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.240
yeah and i and because of where i live i live i live in a valley but i also live in the highlands

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:51.680

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.320
and i live on a nice hill yeah you do oh oh that's right oh god i just remembered that yeah i'll

01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:00.480
probably but depending on what it looks like i'll either uh i may be skyping in we'll find out there's

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.240
