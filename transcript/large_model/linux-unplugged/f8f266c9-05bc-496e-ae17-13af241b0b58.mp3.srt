1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Bad news Wes. I know you were really looking forward to this as a space enthusiast

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,820
I know you're really looking forward to this, but Pepsi is dropping its plans to use an orbital billboard

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,520
Powered by Linux no more Pepsi in the sky

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,520
That was the plan the publication futurism reported on April 13th at Pepsi Co's Russian subsidiary

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,080
Was working with a startup there called star rocket to advertise an energy drink called adrenaline rush

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,720
Using satellites the whole idea is it goes up, and it makes like a billboard in the sky

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,400
So you just look up and there's this annoying advert in the sky filled with cola ads. What could be better?

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,520
Spokesperson though for Pepsi Co Russia said that the company had agreed to partner with star rocket on the campaign

9
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:52,640
They said orbital billboards are the revolution on the market of communications a revolution on the market

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,880
There is some confusion though because Pepsi Co in the u.s.. They did confirm that this happened

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,680
But they're basically saying this was a one-time exploratory event. We're not really we're not really doing it

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,320
Actually star rocket was founded only a year ago and has not deployed any satellites as yet

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,560
So some industry experts are a little skeptical like today

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,840
Do they actually have the expertise and even the funding to do it there?

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,840
They're working to get 25 million in a funding round, but haven't haven't got it yet

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,840
What do you think Wes gonna invest?

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,600
No cold 25 mil so the other part that's important here is actually in the US federal law prohibits what they call

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,920
obtrusive space

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,000
Advertising right although it's just a technicality like they can't approve the launch in the US at a federal level

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,440
But you could just launch it from say Russia and then park it over us guys sure good

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,680
Yeah, and so the the satellites involved in this tech we covered inside bite years ago, and they do actually run Linux

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,240
I mean, why else would you want to run it in space? I do not like the direction of this

23
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,800
We got to act fast. We got to be one of the first obviously

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,180
You know how big we are about advertising these days here on the podcast Jupiter broadcasting

25
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,040
I mean that that fits in space way better than an energy drink

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
This is Linux unplugged episode

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,240
298 for April 23rd

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:18,240
2019

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,720
Well, hello there and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, mr.

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,600
Payne good to see you. It is the calm before the storm right now, man

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,800
I can't I'm having a hard time even conceptualizing the next couple of days

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,660
I know we got to do this show kind of quick today because if we're not careful Alan Jude's gonna show up in studio

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,240
He's gonna crash our so show with me flashing everything with free BSD. I know it's gonna just ruin it

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,080
So we got it

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,400
We got to hurry up because the crowd for Linux fest Northwest is assembling right now Alan Jude's one of the first in but then many

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,600
Many more and that is the crazy Linux fest Northwest just after this show pretty much people start arriving like during the show

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,640
That's crazy. This is our last moment of peace Wes

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,680
Haha, well before we go any further, let's bring in that mumble room time appropriate greetings virtual log. Hello guys

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:19,440
Hello, hello Brent. Hello code. Mr. Badger mini Mac the geek tweets this geek tweets and turf is in there and of course

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,040
Coming in on the studio line. We have cheese and L. Hello you two. Hey, hey

41
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,280
So glad to have everybody here today and our inner during our last moments of sanity

42
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,780
I thought let's let's ask about something. I think many of you forgotten about I sure have did you? Oh, yeah

43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,160
The story is like all right, but it's totally slipped my radar. Okay cheese. I'm gonna put you on the spot right now

44
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,240
Can you tell me what the Atari VCS is?

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes, it's

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,820
Linux based console damn to

47
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Some classic games and I think they also

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,800
Don't they have a couple of the devs from some of the original Atari games working for them as well. Yeah

49
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,680
Yeah, I was hoping I was hoping to prove a point

50
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,400
I mean, I think a lot of people that had kind of forgotten about this story

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,080
And of course, I'm a backer not because I really think it's gonna be great

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
But just because I kind of wanted to see if they'd get there

53
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,720
I wanted to have a stake in the game to be honest with you

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,760
But it's not looking great. Like we don't have a lot of results. Yeah a little bit of a reality check

55
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,000
There's no prototype. There's no Ubuntu based operating system prototype

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,460
And there's not even a convincing demo of any of the games which will run on it

57
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:30,800
Yeah

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,240
The thing that kind of made news this week and Joey over at OMG Ubuntu caught it the estimated shipping date on their Indiegogo

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,960
Campaign page has been revised from July of 2019

60
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Which is not too far away

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,800
To now December of 2019. Mmm a little bit further away just a bit

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,320
I mean you want the extra polish so that you can make a prototype, right? But that hardware is so pretty

63
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,920
I hope it ships just because I can buy one secondhand. Yeah, it would look nice on the shelf for sure

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,280
Yeah, I would I mean it would and that's why it's like if they get it, right

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,080
I'd really love to see Linux be used for something like that

66
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,540
So I had to throw in but we'll see well speaking of companies that have received their funding via crowdfunding and other mechanisms

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,280
purism

68
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,980
Kind of been wondering what is the state of the Liebman fives application stack? Oh, yeah, and how are they getting a lot of those applications?

69
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,740
We got a little peek behind the curtain this week when Christopher Davis blogged about a new contract

70
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:33,720
He's under to create a fractional scaling UI application for a matrix chat client. Is that right?

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,940
Yeah, it's his existing application that is pretty neat

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,280
and he writes over the past year or so I've been a regular contributor to fractal a

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,280
matrix chat client for gnome

74
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,400
My contributions have allowed me to take on a bigger role in the gnome community including maintainership of a few apps

75
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,080
I'm pleased to announce that over the next week. I'll be working to make fractals UI adaptive for the Liebman fives launch

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,880
There's a whole mix of terminology, which I'm kind of machine up here. So fractal is the applications name

77
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
which is a matrix chat client and

78
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,680
He is making it an adaptive UI

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,800
Which is something that these gnome apps are doing where you can rescale them down from a desktop application to a phone sized application

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,720
Much like the convergence apps were on you don't call it convergence. No, it's not it's it's adaptive

81
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,080
And it's really kind of a neat trick

82
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,080
He has videos embedded in his blog where it really is coming down pretty nice and it looks pretty sharp. Yeah, absolutely

83
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,280
He also writes he's just he's just really excited that purism accepted this and he's gonna get to work on it and someday

84
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,520
Hopefully soon actually run fractal on his phone and we might get you to so this is I think the real story and and I

85
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,480
Think this is actually one of the more positive things

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,320
I've seen about the Liebman fives development is they are paying the existing maintainer of this application

87
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
To make it compatible for their platform

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:50,800
Yeah

89
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,160
Really working with some of the existing community and people that they want to bring into the community and something tells me this is probably

90
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Not the only case

91
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Now if that's how they're gonna get some of these apps onto the phone, I got nothing wrong. I see nothing wrong with I got

92
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
no problem that is

93
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,240
That's great. That's taking some of the crowdfunding money and some of the money that they've they've earned from selling their laptops and

94
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,880
Redirecting that into the hands of current existing open source developers now

95
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,200
This Christopher Davis character is gonna be able to maintain the other applications, too

96
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,440
That aren't even related to this just because it's a viable thing for him now. Yeah, this is interesting

97
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,520
Well, it's early days of trying to build in this way and in other communities. We probably wouldn't get to see any of this

98
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,560
Yeah, it's nice to see a little peek behind the curtain

99
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:39,200
And I haven't seen purism make a big stink about it. They haven't been really clear that they're doing this

100
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,060
I think it's been implied, but I don't think they've been super clear. So it's neat to see this

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,600
Okay, so there's there's some interesting news now. Let's talk about something. That's a little kind of sad these things happen

102
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:55,680
It could result in a black hole ripping through our universe simply because

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,360
Now the large hydrogen collider is going to be running an unsupported version of Linux

104
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,000
I mean, there's a possible negative side to this but scientific Linux is

105
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,600
Coming to an end. There'll be security maintenance, I believe

106
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
67 right

107
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,960
But as a distribution they're wrapping up scientific Linux which for those of you that don't know is it's essentially like a cent OS

108
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,440
It's a it's a remix of upstream rail with the branding removed focused for the scientific community

109
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,560
Yeah, you know, I haven't I don't use scientific links really but from my read on this

110
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,400
It seemed like it kind of arose from a darker time early on maybe in the early

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,200
2000s where like before before redhead had bought

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,240
You know merged with sent us and all of that stuff and where like Linux wasn't quite as dominant even in the sciences

113
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,200
And so it was it was hard to assemble a distribution something that had all the right tools

114
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,720
And as anyone doing like machine learning type applications, some of those science frameworks are just ugly to compile and get going

115
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,960
So I think for a long time scientific Linux could fit in that niche and just provide a standard baseline

116
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,360
Especially if you're doing stuff like what Fermilab was doing high-energy physics

117
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,240
Possibly one nice way to view this story is just that you know software availability is better these days

118
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,160
So they can just run on the latest cent OS

119
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,400
I think that's what it is

120
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,480
And that is what they're going to do is they're just gonna migrate to sent us and I think it is exactly that the software

121
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,200
Availability is there now. They don't have to have a boutique specialized distro that requires maintenance flat pack install black hole beautiful

122
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
thing for real

123
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,760
No, I thought it was an app that'd be good

124
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,160
I'd be really good like just just large the whole large hydrogen collider tool set just one flat pack away

125
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,320
My point was that their tool sets and tool chains now are available. Yeah other ways. Yep

126
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
So hopefully some of the effort they've been just you know

127
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,800
It takes a lot to just maintain the distribution even when it's you know, based on open-source centos red hat packages

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,440
Hopefully that can just go into improving all the other applications people are using in science. I think so

129
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,120
You got to be easy on me Alex. I'm my mind is a blur from this whole Linux fest stuff

130
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,540
I was telling Brent earlier today. He's like Brent says how are you doing? And I said well

131
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,320
I don't really know anymore because I've entered the blur phase. I know this happens every year

132
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,200
There's a blur phase where it becomes such a storm of things that are happening concurrently

133
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,840
You can't hold them all in your head

134
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,040
No

135
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,240
just sort of cascade in there they're in there for a minute and then they run away and something else replaces I actually kind of

136
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,040
I kind of collapse a little bit and I like I become less confident. I become less capable

137
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,760
I can do less things like I can only do one or two things and

138
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,200
I really really lose sense of how we're doing but going into the blur zone before it really hit

139
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,280
I knew we were positioned pretty well like we we've been planning for a while. This is the most organized we've ever been

140
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,800
Yeah, right. So I feel felt feel like we were pretty good. But now I've I've lost all perspective

141
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,240
I think that the it is it's very true by far the most organized we've ever been but the flip side of that is we're

142
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,000
Also doing the most we've ever done. Yeah, like way more than the most we've ever done. We've got a booth

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,080
We've got a we've got a dedicated room where people are giving talks both days. We've got tons of new swag

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,340
We've got the new logo rollouts. We've got the largest crew we've ever had there

145
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,180
We got people we got multiple people flying in from out of country

146
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,840
Which is coordinating several different flights and runs to the airport. It's a hell of a thing. It's a hell of a thing

147
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,160
Cheese and L are gonna be here pretty soon. Oh, that's exciting. It is exciting

148
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm looking forward to all that new swag that cheese has been working on. Mmm. Yeah. Oh, yeah

149
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,160
Yeah, the shirts just arrived the shirts just arrived. Nice. So I just had to bring them all

150
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,320
Did you see them stacked outside the studio boxes? Yeah, I'm glad they weren't dropped on us by a drone

151
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,240
Yeah, they were like 30 pounds each I think

152
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,080
I was looking at the tracking. L, what day do you get in? I get in tomorrow. Oh, wow. Is it bad you didn't know?

153
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,460
No, I'm just losing track of everything. I just everybody gets in a different day. So I just asked repeatedly. It's my approach

154
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,600
Need little nametags. Yeah, my name is L and I get on on Wednesday

155
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,900
I wonder if she'll I wonder if Alan will be so Alan's gonna be in studio tomorrow recording BSD now

156
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,880
That should be interesting L shows up and we're doing BSD now

157
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,800
Well, let's update everybody on the Debian project leader election. Remember we first covered like nobody really stepped up

158
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,560
Well that problem was solved

159
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,640
And now we have ourselves a new winner and it looks like

160
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,880
Well, it looks like if if any kind of process to get like this is gonna be run by geeks. They have charts

161
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,400
They have flow diagram like a directed graph of explaining how this all works

162
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,240
Statistics and formulas everywhere. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty impressive

163
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,920
So our our new Debian is it DPL the Debian project leader is

164
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,840
Done. Hold on here. Hold on now. Come on now. We got to do this, right? You ready Wes?

165
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,400
Ladies and gentlemen, the new leader of the Debian project is

166
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,760
Sam Hartman

167
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,120
Congratulations him. It's kind of anticlimactic there, isn't it?

168
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
There you go. There you go. Give them that and a little applause

169
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,600
Welcome Sam Sam joined Debian back in 2000 and has been around for a long time

170
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,880
He says when I'm not working on Debian or my day job

171
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,240
I'm writing reading or learning to sale or just trying to live life to its fullest over the past year

172
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,680
I've been learning how to DJ that ended up starting with my writing of my own DJ software because

173
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,560
What's out there is too visual for a blind DJ to use easily?

174
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,840
Interesting. It's not packaged for Debian yet because I need to get one patch upstream and write enough

175
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,320
Documentation that someone would have a chance to actually use it

176
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,120
Like that you can tell he's um intimately familiar with getting things going and packaged in Debian

177
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,280
He also writes that one of my key goals as Debian project lead

178
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,580
We'll be to make sure Debian is a community where we can be heard and where we have the opportunity to reach

179
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,680
Understanding regardless of whether our ideas are chosen

180
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:43,440
I will do this by personally participating in such mediation and recruiting others to these mediation efforts

181
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:51,200
Eventually, I hope many of us will get better at seeking to understand and avoiding escalating discussions on our own

182
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
You know on that same vein he's writing here

183
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,000
Which I thought was interesting because well, there's been a bit of the hubbub about it and we covered it

184
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,800
Mm-hmm. We've lost a number of developers because they were frustrated with our tools and processes

185
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,000
One of the common complaints I've heard is that the wide variety of Debian workflows

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,400
Just gets in the way when you want to contribute to a large number of packages

187
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:17,360
I know that for myself and I find that our processes make it difficult enough for me to go fix an RC bug in a

188
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,080
Package that I don't maintain that I'm just less likely to do so. Yeah

189
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,520
Yeah, I'm glad he's all I'm glad he's aware of the situation there

190
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:24,960
Yeah

191
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,480
I mean it seems like he's got a decent read here on on what the Debian community has been talking about and that's a good

192
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,280
Thing for a new lead and and part of his platform post here

193
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,280
He wraps it up with I hope to find ways to reduce the stigma associated with bringing important issues to a wider audience

194
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,080
I think it will always be the case that overriding a specific decision will come with a high price

195
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,840
however

196
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,440
Often when we do face a controversial decision

197
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,180
We realize that there are broader policy questions that could be answered that would inform future decisions

198
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,440
Once we get some distance from the original decision. I think answering these policy questions can be valuable

199
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Sometimes it will be useful to answer policy questions in a form broader than a group making the original decision

200
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,000
Broadening the form like this should not be seen as a lack of trust in any of our teams or decision makers instead

201
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,080
It is working together in a broad community. I like those words

202
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,680
Yeah

203
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,280
I think this is a good reminder to and perhaps why no one initially volunteered that first round in some ways

204
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,680
This is something about thankless business position, right?

205
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,880
I mean, it's a large complicated open source project a lot of people with opinions and here you are trying to herd them all together

206
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,720
I think it's gonna be a little different though than it has in the past because classically when you ask

207
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,560
Well, what does the Debian project leader do a lot of times? Oh, he travels around goes to conferences represents the project

208
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,800
But he writes here in his platform. He's not gonna do as much of that

209
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:48,200
He might try to outsource some of that to the community and he's gonna be participating directly in conversations

210
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,960
I'm curious to see where Sam takes this or mr

211
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Harmon takes this the new Debian project leader

212
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,040
So welcome and we have links in the show notes to more information about the vote anything in the data

213
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,200
You thought was worth calling out. No, not really just that I like it

214
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,880
I think it's all pretty well presented and interesting and I kind of want to spend more time digging into just how it all

215
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,160
Works, you know, I have thought about doing like a week on Debian

216
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,560
I'm wondering I'm wondering might keep an eye on things

217
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,160
Might might consider that idea right now. I'm right now. I'm uh, I've got a new thing. I'm into

218
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,400
Oh, it's ridiculous. I can't help myself. I feel like I'm slipping into old habits with distro hopping again

219
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,120
I don't know what happened to me. I thought I'd finally fix this issue and yet here I am

220
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
We'll talk about that in a moment. But first

221
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,680
How about a little housekeeping? Oh, yeah, there's so many things to talk about so we're gonna go them go through them in

222
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
a bit of a chronological order

223
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,760
First off being this Friday this Friday on the live stream

224
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,720
We'll have a very special Friday stream because we'll have a bunch of folks in studio

225
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,320
It'll be in here fighting for mic time hanging out with us and chatting on the live stream. I

226
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Something special we're doing for a little while

227
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,600
May or may not stick around after Linux fest. So come join us

228
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,760

231
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,360
No, physically, I mean, I'm gonna be in Seattle on Friday. So it'll be at the studio. Yeah, come to the studio on Friday

232
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,760
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that'd be awesome. Yes slip in get on the stream a little bit

233
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,720
This should be a hell of a stream. It'll be quite the mic rotation important question

234
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,680
Will there be any smoked meats smoking those meats? Well, we may have to we may have at this point. Yeah

235
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,200
Yeah, yeah, we should probably Mike makes you hungry. There's gonna be a house full man

236
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,600
It's gonna be a house full of people

237
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,840
Yeah, it is it is Friday is gonna be crazy because then after that we head up to Linux fest

272
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,940
All right that way by the way that track there that we're laying down Joe Rez original no way really

273
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,460
Yeah, I was really enjoying it. If he doesn't want people to know that you can cut that out

274
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,420
It's all on you Joe

275
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,980
All right. So I got a confession to make

276
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,260
I've been a real jackass. I I

277
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,900
This year has been a rough one for me

278
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,060
I've had a lot of I've had a lot of eat my hat moments on the show this year

279
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,140
And this is just another one of them, but I got to be honest. I got to come clean

280
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,180
Man I fucking love XFCE I

281
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,060
Love it

282
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,420
Love it. I am I I love it so much

283
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,540
Have you ever experienced something where you're so happy and excited about it?

284
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,780
Like when you go to bed like your mind is just racing you're so excited like you're just thinking about all the possibilities

285
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,020
That was me with like a hard high school crush on XFCE right now straight up straight up XFCE

286
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,100
Are you kidding me?

287
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:21,860
I'm not kidding and I I have been the biggest naysayer because I have this whole been there done that mentality with

288
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:29,020
with XFCE and the whole like Windows 2000 kind of desktop paradigm and you moved on you were in the new world of the

289
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,020
Linux desktop. Yeah, and

290
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,660
You know XFC was for Luddites and guys like Joe Joe is listening to this, you know

291
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,540
Oh, he already knows he already knows

292
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,780
You know

293
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,940
I really started it really started when I went back to gnome shell on 1904 and the performance was a lot better

294
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:54,640
But I was still having issues with my two vertical ASUS 27 inch monitors and my built-in laptop screen

295
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,280
I was trying to find a window windowing environment a desktop environment that

296
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,440
Would work properly with my screens and plasma got pretty close, but it had issues sometimes

297
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,800
Gnome could get one screen but not both screens working and I came across XFCE just in you know

298
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,160
Cuz Joe kept you know, just in the back of my mind, you know kept telling me try it. Try it. Try it. Try it and

299
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,160
I decided to give it a go

300
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,820
It was like getting a brand new computer where it was like taking your own machine that you've had for a long time taking out

301
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,320
a spinning rest drive and putting like an MV and MV and Ian and MV me in and

302
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,480
Or an SSD and and then in doing a fresh install on that SSD and just getting incredible performance

303
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,920
Literally felt like that

304
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,700
And what I did is I I've I've taken I started with taking a couple of my 1804 installs that are running

305
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,880
Kubuntu

306
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,920
And plasma desktop, right? You just switch those over and just install those into desktop meta package

307
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,600
So it was the same install and yet I noticed

308
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
significant application load time differences

309
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,620
Windows would move around the screen faster the whole like using the Firefox and Chrome felt

310
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,140
Significantly faster and I'm not alone Jason Evangelo from choose Linux the writer over at Forbes

311
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:16,140
He's he just please he just posted an article on the 17th. He and I same trajectory recently

312
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,260
Completely completely just connected the common. There is a common factor. Yeah, and

313
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:27,120
Jason writes. I can't believe I'm writing this Linux article about loving the XFCE desktop environment

314
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,600
And he writes in here every time I looked at screenshots of the XFCE

315
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,560
Even from the official website. It reminded me of something from the days of Windows 2000 gray and blue

316
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,200
Uninteresting which I agree like the project does not put their best foot forward

317
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,320
You know, if you just install the stock stuff, it's pretty dated. It does it does

318
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,600
He says he says when he uses XFCE and drags windows across the screen

319
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,920
It feels like you're using a monitor with AMD FreeSync like it feels like you're using a hundred and twenty Hertz monitor

320
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,600
I

321
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,200
Have I have like grabbed a tab off of Chrome and gone to take it to my third monitor and I have the tab is ripped

322
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,560
Off and moved across the screen so fast that I thought I must have missed grabbed and just grabbed the title bar of the entire

323
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Browser it moved it is it is

324
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,640
Voraciously fast. It is addictingly fast. It is a

325
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,760
Different computer now and so I thought okay

326
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,540
well if this if this is what it feels like when I load sort of a and a good implementation but not with the

327
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,400
Lot of the the youtubers consider peak XFCE if you look around on YouTube

328
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,760
Everybody says it's man jero

329
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,800
You got to use man jero XFCE edition. If you look at Linus link tech tips there in their recent video

330
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:41,040
They're using man jero for their virtualized Mac machine when you look at the latest video from Wendell

331
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,360
He's talking about Linux gaming man jero

332
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,640
Everybody it's man jero and pop OS right now is what everybody loves in the gaming space and I thought okay

333
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,320
Well, let's give since I since I'm not interested in gnome shell pop OS is fine, but I'm not interested in gnome show

334
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,880
Let's give man jero a kill

335
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,480
so I downloaded man jero XFCE edition and it was

336
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Exactly what I expected in that the installer was a bit of a hot mess crashed on me once really see I was gonna say

337
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,440
I was really impressed with the installer and had a great time not bad. It couldn't partition my disk

338
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,080
So I did love the partitioner and I loved because I was installing it in a weird West way

339
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,840
Uh-huh that let me just easily skip installing a bootloader at all

340
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,380
I thought it was a dream one of the best Linux installation experiences

341
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,960
I've had in a while

342
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,980
So I didn't mind the look of the installer or the functionality of the installer

343
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,320
but I had two issues number one is

344
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,160
I think this is and maybe remember one cause number two when I was doing the disk partitioning

345
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
I decided you know what? I want to hibernate

346
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,520
I'm gonna go ahead and have a swap file when I chose swap file the installer crashed just completely dumped out on me

347
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,580
and then after that it couldn't partition the disk and I think because maybe the partition table was thus in use by the

348
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,940
Kernel at that point and so I had to use the command-line installer to go wipe out the partitions

349
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,680
Reboot and then I could use the installer and after that point it was fine

350
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,640
but you're right it is otherwise a good set of features and

351
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Once it loads up the XFCE desktop is nice

352
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,680
It's got a bar at the bottom really good set of the themes nice launcher. Everything's really clean

353
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,120
Yeah, I don't think it's be the style

354
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,440
I would I would settle on or keep for my own personal aesthetic choice, but it felt very consistent even just from the start

355
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
They say it's a lightweight desktop

356
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,520
And it is it is remarkably lightweight. And here's what here's what I realized it isn't I ended up

357
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
enjoying my stay with mangero, but I just went back to

358
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,280
my

359
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,820
1804 installs with this Ubuntu desktop because

360
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,020
XFCE is XFCE and it's in a way because it's not like gnome shell where

361
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,360
Fedora has a slightly different implementation than Ubuntu does and they have slightly different patch set all these vendor patch sets

362
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,760
But it's very current right and it's like you got to get the latest version of

363
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,400
Fedora or listen to Linux podcast to find out that there's these new changes you might be missing right

364
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,360
But if you get 1804 or 1904 or you get mangero or you use straight arch or whatever

365
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,880
You're kind of just getting the same XFCE that's available for all of them

366
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,960
And what's what I think makes XFCE a better desktop environment for me possibly than plasma

367
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,280
Although plasma still has been great. I'm curious about this because I mean we're running here. It's been fun. It's powerful

368
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,740
Yeah, what I think I prefer about XFCE is they're trying to solve a smaller problem domain

369
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,940
There's they're not trying to make this entire comprehensive

370
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,020
Platform they are making a desktop environment

371
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:40,540
That is a minimal implementation and the end result is less things break things are faster cleaner

372
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:48,940
Simpler and more straightforward for the user and I can I can I can conceptualize how the XFCE desktop is put together

373
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,060
I can't really fully wrap my head around though

374
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:58,580
I spent I'm sure if I spent more time, but I don't really fully understand all of the components the way the KIO slaves

375
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,300
Were whatever if they're even there anymore like I don't know how any of that works really in plasma

376
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,420
but with XFCE I can clearly conceptualize how this works and

377
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,740
I still get to ride the wave of modern GTK apps that are sort of the peak

378
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,100
I think of UI design and features that are shipping for gnome shell and

379
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,980
They still look great at home on my XFCE desktop

380
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,140
Have you not found any compromises because knowing you I mean you also spend some time on other platforms

381
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,940
Let's say that that are known to look nice and be visually polished

382
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,740
And I think you're hitting on something with with plasma and gnome. They're like our there are flagships, right?

383
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,340
There aren't there are philosophies that we're projecting about how Linux can do desktops

384
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,580
I mean there are many of them, but they are the prominent one, right?

385
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:44,220
And because of that they've you know, they've tried to make themselves look nice. Do you yes

386
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,460
I like I get that you want things to be snappy

387
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,940
But how many times you're really opening an app, you know, like I start my computer

388
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,140
I launch Chrome and a few electron apps. That's it. I don't think about it

389
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,020
so the electron apps I noticed the least difference, but I

390
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:04,660
Feel consistently like all of the native applications like Chrome and Firefox and the terminal and the file manager. Holy crap the file manager are

391
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:13,260
Consistently faster like them somehow I the menus open faster the web pages render faster the applications

392
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:19,780
Launch faster they show up on screen faster. I don't know why maybe maybe because they're not going through some sort of 3d rendering pipeline

393
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,260
I don't know what it is in the way

394
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:27,620
but so the the the end result is the consistent use of the desktop even once things are loaded still feels faster and

395
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,500
More memories left over for my other things that I want to do. So there's those things but I have had to make

396
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,960
modifications to make the sucker work for me

397
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,740
Number one thing I had to do is I went and got you launcher

398
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,860
Which I think is a very good launcher. If you guys are looking for a nice desktop launcher, check out you launcher

399
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:52,540
By default control space just brings up a little prompt and you can you can type in

400
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:59,380
Terminal commands directories or just the name of applications hit enter and they launch. It's got some nice auto film reminds me a lot of spotlight

401
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:06,700
Yes, or Alfred. Yeah, Alfred or gnome do it's a more modern version of gnome do those things quick silver is another one

402
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:13,380
I was a little disappointed just running it on plasma and I kind of still like the built-in plasma launcher more

403
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,340
I did a better job of finding the right things that I wanted krunner is better in plasma

404
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,860
but but you launchers nice. Yeah, you launchers great on XFC super quick and

405
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,140
Really easy to get installed. So I once I got a launcher

406
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,420
I like the whisker menu, but I needed a quicker launcher that just was a keystroke away

407
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,420
I had to make that fix

408
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:38,220
Another way to make XFC II a little more pleasing to me visually was I installed the arc theme and I use the art

409
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:44,100
I think it just looks great. It just it I I should have brought it down here for you

410
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,340
It looks just I think it looks just as good as the dome shell Wow

411
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,220
I mean it and I've got a nice transparent panel launcher that I think looks really good

412
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,740
I've got all the applets that I want right there in the thing. It's

413
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,140
It's just like yes, I was like I do really like some of the XFCE suite of applications

414
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,340
Do you like you mentioned like thunder? Great. Yeah, great XFCE terminal mouse pads good. Yeah

415
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:13,420
So I installed the arc dark theme and then I installed the system 76 pop icons. So I'm using pop icons

416
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,420
Which give it a modern?

417
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,220
Trendy look would you say they make it pop? They can make it pop

418
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,240
So and there's you know system 76 makes the pop theme available for free up on their github

419
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,440
So you can just go grab it. So I got that and then then it was sort of like the edge case stuff

420
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,540
And I think maybe this is because I didn't install

421
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,740
Like zubuntu from the ISO. I just did the zubuntu meta package

422
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,780
Yeah, so it's still technically a kaboom to install too. So I got plasma on there still so I could always bail

423
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:47,740
But what I'm wondering is maybe I didn't get like my notification stuff set up right for the XFCE desktop

424
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,100
I started having this issue where slack would lock up and

425
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:57,360
And then I just essentially would get bored and kill the process and relaunch slack and the respond to the message

426
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,740
Yeah, then a few more a few minutes later would lock up again

427
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,380
And I'm like looking around trying to figure out what's going on

428
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:06,180
I did have my machine rendering on a massive project which I'll talk about here in a minute

429
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,860
But I thought maybe that was the cause of it. Maybe I was just running out of resources, right?

430
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,180
I got a ton of RAM. I got a ton of disk. That's not it

431
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,420
Now my desktop doesn't use any memory. So it wasn't that and

432
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:20,080
It just kept happening for a day. And so this morning I'm looking around I'm looking around. I'm like, you know what it is

433
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,180
It's every time I get a message and a notification

434
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,940
Comes up would come up my application freezes

435
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,640
When I discovered is there wasn't a notification demon running in the background of my XFCE desktop

436
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,580
That was taking these notifications from applications and for whatever reason electron apps just respond by locking up because you know garbage

437
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,440
So I installed dunst d-u-n-s-t. It's a lightweight

438
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,320
Notification Damon which works with most desktop environments. It's very customizable. It's not dependent on any particular tool kit

439
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,300
It takes very little memory and it just now receives

440
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,740
I think it's a debus client or something receives those messages and displays them and now my slack client doesn't lock up

441
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,340
So I saw that problem and it makes me think you're already learning about some of the pieces of the modern death

442
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:08,300
Yeah, which is good, but I'm curious too. I think we experienced this yesterday troubleshooting a totally different Linux related thing

443
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,360
The flip side of that is it kind of just didn't work right like you had to dive in in plasma

444
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,720
Probably wouldn't been a problem. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't I've never had that issue

445
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:22,480
And I'm you know if I'd be surprised if I run into more things like that. It's possible

446
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,320
I suppose yeah

447
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,720
I guess that is that's the point right is is how many one or two for an experienced Linux user who wants a

448
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,000
Optimized desktop not a big deal. I'm also I'm

449
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,400
Unfortunately

450
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:40,160
Not getting a perfect hit rate on my monitor still so all the monitors light up, which is great

451
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,640
but

452
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,540
Sometimes it like reverses the primary and like it makes

453
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:50,640
They like I have two verticals and now what I've done is I have two vertical 27s the Asus 27 monitors

454
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,740
Which are 2k monitors?

455
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,400
They're just I think one of the best desktop monitors for Linux because it's that sweet spot of a nice wide

456
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,320
High resolution screen, but it's not high DPI. Okay, right?

457
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,080
Yep, and then I so then I bought a third one and I put that right smack dab in the middle

458
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,760
So now I've got three 27 inch Asus monitors to a vertical. It's great. It's really great

459
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,760
But sometimes it moves my desktop around to like the vertical screen and so everything sideways

460
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,240
And so I don't know if it's the order in which I have them plugged into the video card to the display ports or what?

461
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:25,440
So anybody in the audience has had that issue where you you wake your XFCE desktop up from sleep and all of the monitors

462
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,980
Have rejumbled themselves like back in the day

463
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,880
I would just go like write a custom XOR config and I think that would solve it

464
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,120
But now I don't even have an XOR file. So I

465
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,360
Had that I had some daisy chain displays for all it also had three screens

466
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:44,000
Mine was the reverse right to regular and then one rotated and I was always using a R&R. Okay. Yeah

467
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,880
And I'll just generate you some X render sort of commands save a little script. You can make it launch that start

468
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,280
So sometimes it would you know, just have that as I log in it just sets it. Yeah, that's a great idea

469
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,840
Yeah, great great tip Wes. I use it all the time a decent workaround at least

470
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,360
Okay, you throw a link to that in the show notes, you know the cheese

471
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:10,040
You're also a man Jaro user and you run an XFCE, right? Yep, and on a lot of other distros

472
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,800
Actually, I've had to use the X R&R

473
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,840
For it's a Dell and spirit on I think it's like a 3000 series a little 11.6 inch two-in-one

474
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,800
But yeah, because the screen would be rotated because it's a touchscreen as well

475
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,460
So the screen would be rotated on a lot of distros out of the box

476
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:35,680
Ah, so but no, I mean man Jaro dude out of the box X XFC has worked no problems

477
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:42,180
You know if I flip if I flip it into tablet mode keyboard, you know is disconnected

478
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,740
Everything works fine there. So I haven't had any problems with it. Obviously not the best

479
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
touch interface, but

480
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,000
You could get some work done with it for sure

481
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,880
What do you think about those tools that manager makes available like the the tool to install different drivers?

482
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,420
Like it's easy to switch between Intel drivers Nvidia drivers or bumblebee. Like have you played around some of that stuff?

483
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,380
Yeah a little bit. I've also played with

484
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,220
Just messing around with Steam because it comes right all out of the box

485
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:16,080
And so if you're doing that and you're you know working with a little machine like this with integrated graphics

486
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,920
I mean it works flawlessly man. I was able to jump on and pull down

487
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,940
I think it was faster than light and play a little bit of that

488
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,600
No problem was impressed with how different it had been ages since I'd used manager because mostly I just you know

489
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,880
Regular arch gap and how different it feels from regular arch. Yes feels almost like a real stable

490
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,440
It's on this row and the weird part of us just having 1904 out

491
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,800
That that was a newer kernel than what I got when I installed one jar. So it's just like a what's happening here?

492
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,200
Yeah, that is impressive how different it feels, you know, the ISO has all the stuff

493
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,280
It just dumps it right on the disk and it's still like it's still doing those sort of like gray zone thing like you can just

494
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,680
Choose the non-free driver right there at boot and just start right out of the box with the non-free stuff

495
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,880
No problem have at it Haas. They are clearly thinking about you know, it's a it's a cohesive experience

496
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,920
And it's the distro of choice in all of these new

497
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,960
Linux gaming videos from Linus tech tips and

498
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,680
What's the other one Wendell? Yeah them and pop OS

499
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,320
It's like these these two distros are standing out in the gaming community

500
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,600
Solace almost had that really it was for a hot minute

501
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,800
But they it kind of proved it out and then you know, these other ones came along and executed it

502
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,640
Yeah, well, and I'll agree with Wes in that it

503
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,560
Definitely feels it feels more stable

504
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,440
of an arch just based distribution

505
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,160
I don't know

506
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,240
I mean, I've had no problems with any updates breaking anything having to go back and tinker with anything just out of the box

507
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,000
Everything's worked

508
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,600
And and you know, I get the latest and greatest for the most part

509
00:37:52,760 --> 00:38:00,280
to you know, which which isn't really a big deal as far as graphics drivers go for this machine with integrated graphics, but

510
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,120
For for those desktop rigs out there running it. I think they'd find benefit

511
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:10,760
At just the pace at which it's updated. I will say it was really nice to be an arch again for a bit

512
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
I still on the ThinkPad. I left it on

513
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,720
I think I'm gonna run it on the ThinkPad for a while. I just haven't Pac-man right at your fingertips

514
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,200
So fast good. It's so good. It's so good all my other rigs

515
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm gonna keep on Ubuntu 1804 and just put Zubuntu desktop packages on them because it's

516
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,700
They're all working fine. Like 1804 is proving out to me to be a really good solid super solid LTS

517
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,220
Mm-hmm, like getting it's getting that machine up there reset up on Zubuntu and going to get some of these things

518
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,380
You know, it's the software is everybody makes a package for it

519
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:45,060
Everybody there's a package always available and especially when you're on the 1804 LTS

520
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,700
Yeah, it's a PPA or even just an in GitHub right like the build depths. Well, they're the Debian packages

521
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:53,180
So that 1804 build is is really quite appealing

522
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,860
I've just switched my main server from Debian over to Ubuntu 1804

523
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,660
Simply because it has ZFS compiled in hmm

524
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,500
It's it's better than that DKMS stuff and I'm having a the gnome UI

525
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,560
I can just remote in and use is it's actually kind of nice sometimes

526
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,860
Yeah, so guys aren't ever supposed to admit that though

527
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,580
Yeah, don't worry nobody will hear you

528
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,100
You know

529
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,560
So now that now that Joe has gotten me and now that Joe has gotten Jason

530
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,280
The next target on his list is gonna be L. Oh, you know it. Yeah. Oh, what's your current Linux desktop setup?

531
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,400
I was sitting here thinking that exact same thing

532
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,040
I'm like, I'm gonna blame Joe for this, but I'm running pop OS right now, and I don't want to leave

533
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,360
Oh, that's right. In fact, you have the successful upgrade to 1904 last week. Yeah, everything went so smooth

534
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,800
I haven't had an issue with anything including all of the tools that we use like everything has just worked

535
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,640
Mmm, that is a heart. Well, then I'd say stick with it. I I'd say stick with it

536
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,080
If I was gonna I think right now I would like to try out if a gnome shell if I was gonna try out a gnome

537
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:04,000
Shell implementation. I think it would probably be pop now. That'd be my next hop. I'd recommend it

538
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,100
I give you three months though before Joe wins you over he got to me eventually. You'll get bored of stability, too

539
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,920
Who wants that I hate to say it but I think he's right

540
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,240
The way you talk about XFCE it sounds almost like a window manager without a desktop environment

541
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,520
But that could be the next logical step. It really does get out of the way. So it's once it's up and going

542
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,280
What's great about it is like Thunar for example is it's everything I love about Nautilus

543
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:40,120
But faster and for me in my personal experience, it's network browsing works better

544
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,200
So I was like just randomly decided, you know, I need to go back to my old laptop

545
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,760
It's like just randomly decided, you know, I need to grab a file off of the computer down in the studio

546
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,440
Go to the network section boom easy all listed right there. Would you want to SFTP in?

547
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,760
Do you want a Samba in do you what do you want? Have at it? It also doesn't change its UI much nice CP though

548
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
No, no, definitely not

549
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,480
Don't get me going on that. Don't get me going people miss the reference. Go listen to Linux action news

550
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,080
Episode 102. I think I was judging a book by its cover for a really long time now. Keep in mind

551
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:16,160
I had been an XFCE user for many years back in the past because it was great for Linux terminals over project

552
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,720
But I kind of looked at it from that same vantage point from many years ago

553
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,280
I think the math in my head was the project moves slow the screenshots look like ass

554
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,080
Ergo, I mean, I know I've been there done that. I don't need to revisit, you know, but I was wrong

555
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,720
I just think it's a matter of time Chris before you're back home

556
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
with name

557
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:43,400
Do you ever try out some of the the i3s and the sways and the the window managers that don't have a full

558
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,400
Desktop environment and that might be where I go next I suppose

559
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,560
Because I've been doing kind of the same thing with that for a long time

560
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,520
The only reason why I really haven't made that like a jump to like a week in i3 is

561
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:03,160
I have been using a window desktop environment since the 80s. I've used different

562
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,200
Graphical desktop environments that had multiple windows. And so I I grew up

563
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,440
Like I instinctively when I sit down at a computer I arrange my windows in a stack

564
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,160
I enjoy it and I mentally lay them out very visually the way I the way I the way I'm working and so

565
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,320
For me being able to do that is is an efficiency booster and I feel like I would lose that if I went to something

566
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,040
That arranged my windows for me, but I'd be willing to give it a go for a little while

567
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,240
I tried out i3 for about two weeks six months ago and

568
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,600
it required quite an investment of having a cheat sheet open next to me the whole time and

569
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,200
it's an investment to learn all those commands and stuff, but

570
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
It's fast, you know

571
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,280
Like XFC's fastness

572
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,160
i3 is probably up there with it and you might find that you once you've adopted the paradigm and depending it might not be

573
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,200
I three might be a you know, a different tiling window manager that it gives you that control

574
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,900
More so than other desktop because you know, they they acknowledge that people are picky about where their windows go

575
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,760
It's for people who like to mess with computers

576
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:17,120
Very nice, sir. And there are also static window managers that give you even more control. Okay. All right. All right

577
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,080
I mean you guys you guys gotta let me hang out for a little bit. I could give me whiplash

578
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,880
I'm moving around so much. I I think

579
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,340
what what something about it is touching a

580
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,640
Like a

581
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:39,440
what what I felt like I unlocked was this sense of relief that I'm gonna be able to just use my computer to work now and

582
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,400
That was so exciting to me like this, I'm not gonna have to screw with this now

583
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,360
I'm just gonna use my computer to work and the fact that XFC you move so slow to me is

584
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,240
Is kind of a nice thing because now I've got kind of a moving fluid base with frequently updated apps

585
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,760
And then a desktop environment that takes quite a few years to really progress in any way

586
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,380
That's gonna alter the way I work. So devil's advocate moment

587
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,120
I've heard you make this pitch

588
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,080
Numerous times over the years

589
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:17,200
What happened to the iPad Pro or is this just augmenting it? I feel like the iPad pros role is more like communications

590
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,760
I really am NOT crazy satisfied with

591
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,880
Mail applications on Linux because we at Linux Academy use the Google Mail Suite the Google App Suite

592
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,200
And I'm not a big fan of using Thunderbird or Kmail or mail spring for any of that kind of stuff

593
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,320
I've tried them all and so what I'm doing right now is I pretty much do

594
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,680
The majority of like the zoom calls and

595
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:50,240
Slack meetings and emails on the iPad and the reason why is because I batch those things at certain times of the day when I'm

596
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,000
Not on air anyways

597
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,200
And then I use the desktop for like real work. That is like my more productive work

598
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,920
I do have some of those applications like I have zoom installed on the desktop and I have slack installed on the desktop

599
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,620
But that's like supplemental so that way if I need to open up a link or something on the desktop. I've got it

600
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,180
And the mail is really the weakest spot in my opinion

601
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:16,340
Because when you have the Google app integration you you really want something that works tightly with calendar invites and can look people up

602
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,660
in the directory and

603
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,060
It works well with doc links and stuff like that

604
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,460
And that's where a lot of the desktop Linux application applications fall down

605
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,700
And so I've either used wave box, which is an application that lets you have a bunch of different cloud accounts in one app

606
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:36,420
Wimpy's talked about that before or I will use nata fire and I'll just natify Google Calendar and

607
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,260
Google Mail

608
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,060
For Linux Academy, and then I just have those as essentially desktop applications

609
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,860
And it works, you know

610
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,220
And the nice thing is both those apps work really well in a vertical layout so I can put them on

611
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:55,380
My vertical monitor and then pretty easily see all the information. I need when you're talking about XFC

612
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,380
I would also say that

613
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:02,900
One of the good things about it is that it like you said earlier it gets out of your way

614
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:08,900
so whenever you do want to add these other bits and pieces from the Linux ecosystem like a

615
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,660
new launcher a new dock

616
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,940
All the all of it seems to play nice together. Like you never really have an issue where just

617
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,580
the theming is extremely broken on this one thing or

618
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:31,740
That something won't play nice with XFC and that's I'd say that's one of the best advantages of using XFC

619
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:37,060
Yeah, and to that point I was able to load up quake and I'm able to use the tilde key

620
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,860
Which is my preferred key to to summon the quake terminal

621
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,920
because nothing else is using that on XFC and control space is available for you launcher because

622
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,360
Nothing else is using that on XFC because there's a again

623
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,540
I think this is what's key about it is they're trying to solve a more limited set of problems

624
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:57,060
it's a it's a smaller problem domain that XFC is trying to solve and

625
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:03,220
And therefore what they've limited themselves to they can do really well. It's just simple and consistent. Yeah

626
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,060
It's nice and it's exactly what I want

627
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:12,900
and I think I'm gonna hang out here for a while and watch where gnome goes because there's the the development rate on gnome is just

628
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:19,820
It's incredibly impressive and see where plasma shell goes because I think it's got some of the best technology out there in a desktop

629
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,420
Honestly, you do seem a little refreshed though because I mean we have to talk about those things

630
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,880
It's part of what we do here on the show in the network, right?

631
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,680
But you you're off you're off the hype train you get to like just take a little break. You're not on the roller coaster

632
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,440
You're watching it. I'm an observer of the two desktop environments now remove myself

633
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,480
Like if they don't do something right or you know, we had this problem the other day here in the studio

634
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,440
It's not a big deal

635
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:47,400
But we had this problem the other day where for whatever reason plasma shell was using like 700 megs of RAM when you combine like

636
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,800
All the different components. It was nearly a gig of RAM and we've got a rig here. That's got 64 gigs of RAM in it

637
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,760
64 gigs of RAM and we had to reboot our OBS machine before Coder radio because

638
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,500
100% of the RAM had been used up with the machine just sitting here

639
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,280
That was less than ideal 64 gigs 100% used up

640
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,220
So we had to reboot and you know, we can we can see like actually we're starting to have an issue, too

641
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,320
We've already had 59 X runs. I bet you if I were to look at the memory usage

642
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,080
It's starting to creep up right now. It's not too bad. It's not too bad

643
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,040
Let's see

644
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,100
You know, okay, we're using four gigs right now. That's not too bad. It's a little much but it's not bad and

645
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:33,620
I guess I'm I'm I'm discovering as we've as we've learned really really how to work with the Linux audio stack

646
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,500
As we've really learned like there's a couple of things that are a little odd about it that we have to compensate for

647
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,420
some applications still use also and

648
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:48,160
Then the also software will talk to the sound card and the stuff that's using pulse audio will be completely unaware of the changes

649
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:54,580
the sound card is made say say you go from 48 Hertz to 44 Hertz or from 44 to 48 if you don't tell the

650
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,580
Pulse applications that you've made that change

651
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,780
They sound like Barry White or like a chipmunk depending on which direction it's gone

652
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,060
And then we do too and we have no way of knowing because we haven't changed anything

653
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,340
It's just there's two different audio stacks and one of them has talked to the card and hasn't told the other stack because they're completely unaware

654
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:16,940
Interpreting the same data stream differently and that just happens and it happens to us frequently

655
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,580
It was happening to us very often. It was a ritual we'd go through on the live stream

656
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:26,820
and there's other strange things like when the system boots up it enumerates the sound cards and

657
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:32,220
It assigns them sort of at the order that they were enumerated to the operating system by the motherboard

658
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,440
Not by like a physical ID of the card

659
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,120
So for some strange reason

660
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:43,060
The motherboard which can happen were to enumerate the sound card devices in a different order

661
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:48,780
Maybe they're USB devices that boot up in a different order for some reason one day or that whatever even if they're PCI devices

662
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:55,740
they will get different IDs in the also level in the pulse audio level because it then inherits what also set and

663
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:01,140
So you can actually have sound cards that are your in-and-out sound cards on a machine change

664
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:07,600
day to day when you reboot the system because they will get different IDs in the system because they assign ID at the time the

665
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,920
Motherboard enumerates them instead of like reading a device ID and saying okay, this is sound card one

666
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,920
This is sound card two and it'll always shall be

667
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,780
Doesn't do that. It just takes whatever the motherboard gives it. Okay, it's a sign now. Let's go

668
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,860
Good to go and these are crazy weird things that when you add an additional

669
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:29,700
Complicated desktop environment on top of it like plasma that also has its own audio stack phonon

670
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,540
Which is then sitting on top of pulse which is then sitting on top of also which is then sitting on top of the driver

671
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,540
stack which is then sitting on top of the hardware and

672
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,880
And so with something like XFCE you essentially remove one of those layers

673
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:43,660
You just have a simpler setup and I mean

674
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,700
I think it's kind of just a turning the question on its head right it some people you might need a fuller richer desktop

675
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:55,820
I think some of this exploration is just deciding like do I need those features and are they worth worth the cost because eventually if they

676
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,740
Aren't working you're gonna have to debug them. There you go

677
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,740
So I only have one last issue that I haven't solved yet that I would love to get the audience's help with

678
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:05,340
It's a real it's a real humdinger speaking audio

679
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:11,540
Everything plays audio just fine except for Firefox. I've got no audio in Firefox

680
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,780
Don't know what it is. It's the strangest thing if VLC Chrome

681
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:21,980
MPV audio is just fine. It's just in your zip on to install. Yeah coupon to turn

682
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:30,020
Yeah, thanks. Otherwise working great, but no audio which in some respects is actually nice. Yeah, that's your silent breath

683
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,760
Yeah, it is. It's like I never have to write that silence

684
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,600
But

685
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,280
Other times like I click a link and they're like, oh, yeah, right now

686
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,360
I got good now I got a copy the link go open up Chrome and listen to it

687
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,960
I don't know what the hell that's about speaking of audio issues, but I'm sure I'll solve it eventually

688
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,280
And if anybody knows let me know at Chris la s. Alright, so before we go

689
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,160
Man, that's a lot. I just dropped on you guys. I'd really like to know what you think

690
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,440
I know I feel like I'm hopping again. I feel like I'm distro hopping again, but this one I'm pretty excited about

691
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,520
I'm really still happy like these machines here in the studio

692
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,480
I don't really see us going off of plasma anytime soon. It works fine

693
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,640
I think we would switch out to XFCE if we had a reason to touch these machines and do a bunch of other stuff, right?

694
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:18,780
So maybe next LTS will reconsider maybe or if we decide like, you know, we're gonna like I don't know spend some time like

695
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,760
Restandardizing or if we were making some other large change

696
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,520
I might consider because it's such an easy transition to go to XFCE

697
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,600
but otherwise all the systems here in the studio, which is a good number of systems right now are all still running plasma shell and

698
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,680
It's it's great. So I

699
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:40,400
They're all getting pretty good. You know L's happy with pop OS and gnome shell plasma shell works great here. There's tons of great

700
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,960
It's just XFCE is better than I was giving it credit and I feel like if you have been in my camp at all

701
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,120
It's worth giving it a go if you want to see a pretty solid implementation man. Jero does have it

702
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,920
I don't know if you need to run man. Jero though to run XFCE, but it's not a bad place to visit

703
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,080
Might give you a template something to something to base your own. Yeah. Yeah and show you you know

704
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,240
a more modern interpretation of a classic desktop paradigm and

705
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,640
Yeah, I'm just really happy with it so far. I'm gonna stick with it for a bit. All right

706
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,960
Pick times West pick times

707
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,840
I have a disclaimer to make with this pick and I hate to even I hate to even have to have a pick where I

708
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,840
Feel like I need to make a disclaimer

709
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,320
But you could use this I suppose for

710
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,560
nefarious purposes

711
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,560
So don't well, I am a long time like since since

712
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:35,280
Since forever audible subscriber. I really enjoy listening to audiobooks, especially when I'm driving, you know

713
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,280
I do a lot of road trips and so audiobooks are great

714
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,920
Hadeah my wife and I we share audiobooks

715
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,920
we just love it just my preferred way to consume lots of information when traveling and

716
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,120
It's a nice way to supplement since I don't get to read as much as I'd like

717
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,580
I and I I tend to find certain stories even work better in audio

718
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,520
But the biggest problem with audible books is they're in a proprietary

719
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:05,240
DRM that is not playable on Linux or other free software devices. That's where open audible comes in. Oh

720
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,480
Open audible org now. I am a longtime subscriber

721
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:17,160
I own all these books and I will continue to be a subscriber. I'm just going to back up my collection with this legitimately

722
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:22,680
I know people say that as a euphemism for stealing, but I am honestly using this as a backup. I'm backing them up to my

723
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,920
Server and then just have I will have an awful something offline media

724
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,080
So what open audible does and it is a clunky Java application

725
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,840
I will warn you but god bless it if it isn't performing the Lord's work here

726
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:40,880
It will download view and convert to mp3s. It will manage all of your audible.com content with their desktop front-end application

727
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:47,400
It's kind of weird the way it works because you launch the application assuming you've got JVM running

728
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
they're set up and

729
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,720
You then go to the menu to browse audible and you log into audible through their like Java

730
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,560
Browser implementation thing and then you sit there and tab through your audible library pages

731
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,560
Which I have like 17

732
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,120
And if you try to like set the sorting to 50 at a time

733
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:13,160
It'll lock the application up eventually on about page 8 and then you got to start all over again

734
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,080
So you got to keep it at the 20 and then you go through it page by page and as you go through it

735
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,460
The application is basically ingesting the HTML. I ran it. I ran it from the terminal so I could actually watch

736
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,360
It's just taking in the HTML stripping out the links and it is building your library locally in the application

737
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,880
Once you've done this you can export the list

738
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,920
So you don't ever have to do that again and as long as you properly exit the application

739
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,780
It will save the list if the application crashes. It'll lose everything. It's added. So

740
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,840
Avoid crashing as you can tell I had to crash a few times and by default

741
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,360
When you click a title in there and you can also just by default tell to download everything it will download and then convert

742
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,760
The entire audiobook to a high-quality mp3

743
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,280
See that seems nice, right? Then you have that file you can take it with you

744
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:03,360
Wherever you are plays on all your normal devices. Yeah, and that's it. That's pretty much it in a nutshell

745
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,160
You can there's other various things you can do with it

746
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,360
but for me

747
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:12,720
It was just a way to get all of my audible books that I've never been able to access on my Linux desktop and I have

748
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,400
Many occasions where I've been listening to an audiobook on the road and I get back to my desk and I just want to finish

749
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,600
It up and I can't play it on my nice desktop speakers

750
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,520
So hopefully this is all yeah, this is interesting

751
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,160
I've kind of stayed away from audible just out of some of those very same concerns

752
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,800
So I might I might have to reconsider now things have come and gone in the past

753
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,720
So grab it while you can and again

754
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,520
Please don't use this to like throw it up on a torrent side or something like that

755
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,120
I I debated not even including this in the show

756
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:44,320
But I decided since I know as a longtime desktop Linux user

757
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,560
this is something I've struggled with for years and

758
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:52,640
It was only made a bit better because they have a decent mobile app and that's where I do the majority of my listening

759
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,240
But in the back of my mind have always wanted my own copy somewhere on a file system and so and I wanted to play

760
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,680
Them on my own desktop. Mm-hmm, and I actually first started audible. I

761
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,460
Got my audible subscription then I canceled it and in there

762
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:11,480
I told them this because they don't support Linux and then when they released the mobile app even like the very early betas for Android

763
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,240
I signed back up and I've been a user ever since so this is really nice to find

764
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,080
I I my library is like 70 gigs of mp3 Wow

765
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,280
It's a lot of books. It's a lot of books

766
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,040
So I'll be I'll be tossing those on the old free NAS and then Wes found what looks like a really nice web UI

767
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,160
For setting up wire guard VPNs a wire guard VPN GUI a West. Mmm. Yes, indeed

768
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,640
I like the name too. Yeah over from the people at portal cloud. Looks like they run their own sort of VPS hosting

769
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,520
Company and if you just want to you know, you're confused about wire guard or you just want to give it a shot

770
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:55,120
The configs on the command line are admirably simple and easy to understand it as you've seen Chris

771
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,700
But you know, that's not always enough especially as you're scaling, you know, maybe maybe you're supporting a small company

772
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,860
You've got 30 different people that you're all you know trying to manage their stuff now

773
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:09,460
I haven't used subspace yet. Although I do have it running. I just haven't integrated it into my system. So bear that in mind

774
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,840
subspace

775
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,580
It's nice to see this stuff taking off though because these are exactly the kind of supporting applications

776
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:20,120
We need if we really want to see why our guard be as successful as I think we all hope it will be

777
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:20,520
Yeah

778
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:27,000
And this gives you a simple web UI that almost reminds me of the early UI of bit torrent sync where you go in you add

779
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,640
A device right it does and you see all the different devices there

780
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,600
you can delete and revoke their keys or you can create another one and like this would be perfect for the

781
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,560
Wire guard machine that we have here in the studio to just to add a few of the staff's

782
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,760
Yes

783
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:48,480
Mm-hmm. And the way it works is it's a Docker image that assumes you have wire guard set up and running locally

784
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,880
They also walk you through if you want to toss this on a VPS like a like a digital ocean droplet to you know

785
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,320
Get a white your own custom wire. The nice thing is it's it should be really easy to test out

786
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,560
Yeah, that's true

787
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,920
Or you just throw if you have a wire guard set up on your own local machine and then you can deploy the Docker image

788
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,440
And you're off to the races. It's pretty nice looking. I

789
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,700
I really think we'll probably get the set up here pretty soon subspace

790
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:17,120
Which is also just a great name for something like this and more power to wire guard

791
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,880
Yeah, you know it also was neat about it

792
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:26,020
Does hey it has integration with using let's encrypt right out of the box because of course it does so portal dot cloud is the company

793
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,020
Huh? This is this like another

794
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,420
Commercial wire guard hosted solution. No, I think they do

795
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:40,940
Next generation open source hosting yeah look at that hmm add great open source cloud applications to your account in seconds I

796
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:49,600
See yeah, they've got a couple other available open source apps like they got a simple blogging platform web analytics server stuff like that

797
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,940
So I haven't tried any of these before but an interesting development

798
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,580
I gotta say they look you know what guys if you listen get in touch

799
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:02,340
They are they're really stressing data portability they free software is like bullet point number two on their site here

800
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,820
That's not bad. That is not bad. I love to see that kind of stuff anyways

801
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,940
But that's neither here nor there if you want to check out subspace

802
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,000
We'll have a link in the show notes

803
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,720
And you can go deploy your own wire guard gooey and get people added to your wire guard instance nice and easy-sneasy

804
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,660
Get to it all right there you have it now. Oh

805
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:26,340
Man, oh Alan Jude's gonna be here any minute now. Oh my goodness better prepare ourselves. Oh geez all right

806
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,340
We better get out of here

807
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:33,820
Linux fest is nigh if you're gonna be there come say hi meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that event and future events

808
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:39,540
Love to see you there join us live next Tuesday for this show and join us live this Friday

809
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,320
If you're listening the week this came out for a hell of a live stream

810
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,740
Love to see you there anything else we need to plug um you know if you're gonna go over to our Jupiter broadcasting meet up

811
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:50,220
Meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting you should also stay tuned

812
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:54,660
Oh, I know L has been so hard at work with all kinds of exciting study groups

813
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,540
Yeah, command-line threat hunting very soon definitely do that all right see you back here

814
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,660
Yeah

815
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,180
Our next study group

816
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:40,580
Command-line threat hunting how to figure out if your box has been owned on the command line

817
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:46,540
How great is Tony right? Oh? He's amazing we have we've had we've had a little sneak peek at the material

818
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,900
Let's just say and we we know it's gonna be really good

819
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:51,740
I'm excited to get to watch the whole finished thing

820
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,340
Mm-hmm yeah, we got a little interview for Tony to run on the show here a little bit, too, so

821
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:58,900
Yeah, it's gonna be good all right

822
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:04,300
So guess what we have a couple of bits of housekeeping to get out of here in the post show to all right

823
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:05,560
You want to hear okay number one?

824
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:11,660
We got to get the title so JB titles calm everybody go boat and then number two something major happened this weekend

825
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,660
This is a historic event

826
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:19,900
Probably up there with Skynet as of this weekend April 2019

827
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,300
The cheese cloud has gone online

828
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:32,740
Yes, yes, so mr.. Bacon has set himself up a next cloud instance come here over here the cone of science

829
01:02:33,380 --> 01:02:37,220
We don't want to share any details that might get your box bone, so just between you and me

830
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,740
Would you do did you do this on a droplet you do this?

831
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,620
root password, please

832
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:50,740
Mmm, it was a snap setting it up on oh, but on okay, but come on you see what I do

833
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:56,060
But I want to know setting it up the box is it a is it a droplet is it a physical machine is it a is

834
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:59,480
It a raspberry pie. What are we working with here? It is it is a droplet

835
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:02,740
I just went that route region for years and

836
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,700
Jeez, I don't know everything

837
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:13,180
NYC okay all right, so it's an East Coaster I catch yeah, well I've got I've got I've got a couple of droplets

838
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,500
You know because they're just so ridiculously simple to 1804

839
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,220
Fedora ok 1804 base

840
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,620
1804 base

841
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,700
Basically just installed it with the snap

842
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,240
Setup was ridiculously simple

843
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:35,100
Went through set up with what is it next next cloud dot HTTPS? Oh? Yeah, so you got a cert on there

844
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,780
Yes, or something like that, so you know just pull down this your automate your let's encrypt cert and everything so it works

845
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,780
flawlessly out of the box

846
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:49,820
I've got one of the lower end droplets, so I'm running like one one CPU two gigs of RAM

847
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:55,020
And just like 60 gigs of storage one of the things. I haven't quite figured out yet

848
01:03:55,620 --> 01:04:01,380
Well, I just haven't really dove into it, but is relocating some of that into block storage

849
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,060
Which one of the things that I've learned about?

850
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:09,180
Specifically digital ocean I'm sure a lot of the others are the same

851
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,660
that you can only move that block storage within that Center, so

852
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:19,700
Basically I if since I do have a server that's in LA and I do have one that's in NYC

853
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:26,980
Then I could not move that block storage between those two this geek tweets has been using you're still on 1604

854
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:31,580
Did I know that yeah? I've been running the next cloud snap on 1604

855
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,660
Yeah, now, and it's it's you know. It's been absolutely rock-stable

856
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:39,700
It's on a VM at home back in the UK and used it all over the place

857
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:45,100
I've got two or three Android phones backing up photos to it in real time, and it's been absolutely flawless

858
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:51,460
How do you handle your your storage is it hosted on the same local machine, or do you yeah?

859
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:58,540
It's just one big virtual disk. I probably should sort out gotcha Brent's got a pretty clever title x-ray Fox trot

860
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:03,500
Charlie echo for the spelling out of excess that that's I like that's pretty deep Brent

861
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,780
I'm impressed I had to look it up

862
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,700
Board of stability damn it Joe blame Joe those are good, too

863
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:18,020
Blame Joe's pretty good, so I think it's between Brent and blame Joe right now, which is Wes's suggestion

864
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,540
JB titles calm not a lot of boats today not a lot of boats

865
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,860
Come on guys go boat go boat blame Joe is pretty good, but would people get it

866
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,500
No, I mean it wouldn't tell you what at all the episode was about

867
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:35,180
But it would be a slight callback to a tiny bit in the episode it is so his fault
