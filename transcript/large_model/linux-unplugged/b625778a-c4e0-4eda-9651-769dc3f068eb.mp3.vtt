WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Grab your pitchforks.

00:01.000 --> 00:06.120
YouTube pages load five times slower in Firefox and Edge

00:06.120 --> 00:07.320
than they do in Chrome.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.400
Say it ain't so.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.680
It is so, Wes.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.200
It is so.

00:10.200 --> 00:13.580
You see, YouTube's got this Polymer redesign,

00:13.580 --> 00:16.880
which relies on deprecated shadow DOM API

00:16.880 --> 00:20.280
controls that are only implemented in Chrome.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.000
So I was like, OK, what is this really about?

00:22.000 --> 00:22.840
I started looking into this.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.700
First of all, my first reaction was,

00:24.700 --> 00:26.520
this really reminds me of the stuff

00:26.520 --> 00:30.720
that Microsoft used to do back in IE's heyday,

00:30.720 --> 00:32.840
where they would design stuff to work better in IE

00:32.840 --> 00:34.000
than anything else.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.360
Oh, it's an open standard.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.040
It just happens to be an open standard

00:37.040 --> 00:39.400
that we were behind that we wanted to implement,

00:39.400 --> 00:40.680
and so we implemented it first.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.920
Hey, my whole life is an active X app, OK, Chris?

00:42.920 --> 00:44.240
Yeah, jeez.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.280
The good old days, Wes, the good old days.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.800
So it definitely reminded me of that.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.920
But there is a little gold at the end of this rainbow.

00:50.920 --> 00:51.680
Check this out.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.520
I came across a Firefox add-on called YouTube Classic.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.680
You got to go get this if you use Firefox.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.380
It makes YouTube like it was a couple of years

01:01.380 --> 01:04.640
ago, where everything just loads and none of the UI elements

01:04.640 --> 01:07.100
are hidden, and you don't have to wait for comments

01:07.100 --> 01:08.000
to load dynamically.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.800
They just instantly pop in like text.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.440
Wait, is it like a site that's whole purpose is serving videos

01:12.440 --> 01:13.520
and you get right to that?

01:13.520 --> 01:14.760
Yeah, it's weird.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.880
Suspicious.

01:15.880 --> 01:22.480
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 259 for July 24, 2018.

01:22.480 --> 01:35.920
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk

01:35.920 --> 01:38.720
show that's reconnecting with friends and back in Washington.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.480
My name is Chris.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.280
My name is Wes.

01:40.280 --> 01:40.880
Hello, Wes.

01:40.880 --> 01:41.640
Hello, sir.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.360
And back in action, missing from last week, it's Brent.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.160
Hello, Brent.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.040
Hello, everyone.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.280
Hello, sir.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.360
We have a fine show assembled here.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.080
We have some community news, a couple of stories

01:52.080 --> 01:53.080
I'm really excited about.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.760
Plus, and I told you so, I can't help myself.

01:55.760 --> 01:57.280
And big news for those of us that

01:57.280 --> 02:00.080
may be considering Chromebooks running Linux apps,

02:00.080 --> 02:01.720
then we'll get into the Ubuntu corner.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.400
Our friends over at Canonical have

02:03.400 --> 02:05.160
been doing quite a bit of work.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.260
And then we've got a batch of apps and tips

02:08.260 --> 02:10.440
that we think will help quite a bit.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.040
And then later on in the show, there

02:12.040 --> 02:14.780
is a couple of things in the news this week.

02:14.780 --> 02:18.120
Slackware's founder is struggling,

02:18.120 --> 02:20.760
and I really mean that, especially in light

02:20.760 --> 02:21.920
after the Slackware birthday.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.280
He's struggling to be sustainable.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.240
We'll also talk about a developer who

02:26.240 --> 02:28.600
attempted to release software for Linux

02:28.600 --> 02:32.420
but met a lot of harsh criticism because it was closed source.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.800
And then we'll talk about a commercial piece of software

02:34.800 --> 02:37.120
that's coming to Linux that could represent

02:37.120 --> 02:41.400
a fundamental game changer for how an entire industry perceives

02:41.400 --> 02:42.440
Linux.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.560
But I'm a little worried that the rabid user

02:46.560 --> 02:50.680
base of certain types of software

02:50.680 --> 02:51.760
will scare them all away.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.840
So we'll get into all of that and much, much more.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.760
But before we go any further, before we even

02:55.760 --> 02:57.440
get into that community news, we've

02:57.440 --> 02:59.880
got to bring in that virtual lug time-appropriate greetings

02:59.880 --> 03:00.640
mumble room.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.140
Hello.

03:01.140 --> 03:01.640
Howdy, howdy.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.360
Heidi.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.720
Hello, guys.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.920
So good to hear all of you.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.060
Such wonderful voices.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.760
Hello, especially a special hello

03:08.760 --> 03:10.520
to one Mr. Martin Wimpress.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.160
Hello, Wimpy.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.480
Good to have you back, sir.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.120
Good evening.

03:13.120 --> 03:13.840
How are you doing?

03:13.840 --> 03:16.880
So have you been out traveling and shaking hands?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.380
What have you been doing since you've

03:18.380 --> 03:19.760
been on the show last?

03:19.760 --> 03:20.640
Yeah, all of that.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.040
So yeah, I was out last week.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.560
I was in Montreal last week.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.840
And other than that, work has just been keeping me

03:26.840 --> 03:28.840
extraordinarily busy recently.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.040
Montreal, you say?

03:30.040 --> 03:34.160
Yeah, it was a mid-cycle product strategy sprint.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.840
More and more of these sprints, all about the sprints

03:36.840 --> 03:38.360
these days over at the canonical.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.040
Yeah, this was a purely internal one.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.720
So probably about 100 or so people there.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.400
So this is looking at the progress towards 1810,

03:47.400 --> 03:51.840
and also to some extent, 1804.1, making sure everything's

03:51.840 --> 03:54.760
on track, doing a bit of course correcting here and there.

03:54.760 --> 03:55.240
Yeah.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.160
You know, that sort of thing.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.560
So yeah, so it's all looking good and rosy right now.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.800
Yeah, really good.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.520
And boy, you say about 100 of you.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.640
That's no small endeavor.

04:03.640 --> 04:04.920
That is quite the thing.

04:04.920 --> 04:07.660
So well, I'm glad this is our first show

04:07.660 --> 04:09.080
since you've been back, I believe.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.080
So I'm glad you could make it.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.840
It's good to have you here.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.000
We have had ourselves a big week since we last got here.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.920
I'm back in Washington now.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.760
And I've been going over some of the stuff.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.480
And I want to start with something fun.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.980
I want to start with something that I've

04:23.980 --> 04:26.560
had just this huge amount of respect for recently,

04:26.560 --> 04:27.720
and that is React OS.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.800
When I gave it a go for Linux Action News,

04:29.800 --> 04:33.560
I came away just feeling like it was peak Windows.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.320
Like they had managed to just nail that Windows experience

04:37.320 --> 04:42.160
that was somewhere between Windows 98 and Windows 2000,

04:42.160 --> 04:44.720
like in a mix of the best of.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.480
And I was just damned impressed with how fast it was

04:47.480 --> 04:48.800
and how far they'd come.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.760
And I knew the project had one major milestone.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.840
And I don't even think I can fully appreciate

04:54.840 --> 04:56.460
why this is a major milestone, but they've

04:56.460 --> 04:59.080
been talking about what they call self-hosting, where you

04:59.080 --> 05:03.080
can build React OS on React OS.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.800
That to them has been a major milestone.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.000
It's understandable, I suppose.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.800
I think especially in the programmer community,

05:07.800 --> 05:09.960
that's sort of a, it can be a benchmark oftentimes.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.040
The thing you've worked so hard to build

05:12.040 --> 05:15.640
is generalized enough to build the complex system that you

05:15.640 --> 05:16.440
just made, right?

05:16.440 --> 05:19.000
So you can be like, look, we're totally dog food now.

05:19.000 --> 05:19.940
We built this OS.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.600
We can build our OS on our OS.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.680
It's all one platform.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.520
Yeah, and as they point out in the React OS blog,

05:26.520 --> 05:30.160
they say the ability to build React OS on React OS, known

05:30.160 --> 05:31.920
as self-hosting, has often been touted

05:31.920 --> 05:34.980
as sort of a milestone in an OS's maturity.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.920
But the details are far more nuanced.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.720
Compiling any large code base, whether it

05:39.720 --> 05:42.820
be an operating system or even a web browser,

05:42.820 --> 05:46.320
stresses the system in a lot of ways, one of the biggest

05:46.320 --> 05:49.160
being memory usage and storage I.O.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.680
Code being compiled needs to be loaded from storage

05:51.680 --> 05:54.360
into memory, and more memory is required

05:54.360 --> 05:56.800
to hold all of the compiled objects

05:56.800 --> 05:58.080
as they're linked together.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.560
Scheduling is also, to a certain extent, stressed,

06:01.560 --> 06:04.160
as most modern build systems will

06:04.160 --> 06:07.400
attempt to spawn multiple compilation processes to speed

06:07.400 --> 06:09.080
up the process.

06:09.080 --> 06:13.220
All right, so you could see how just building a complex project

06:13.220 --> 06:14.920
in a way is a milestone, the fact

06:14.920 --> 06:16.160
that the OS can survive that.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.800
Yeah, very much so.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.560
And in the spirit of open source,

06:19.560 --> 06:22.720
it was FreeBSD's implementation of Qsort

06:22.720 --> 06:25.480
that actually helped the main developer, Pierre,

06:25.480 --> 06:28.200
bridge some of the last pieces needed to achieve this.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.600
Oh, interesting.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.040
That was FreeBSD developers.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.080
There's always helping someone somewhere.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.720
There's also just like shell improvements and new features

06:36.720 --> 06:39.600
coming to ReactOS, like several quality of life improvements,

06:39.600 --> 06:43.480
the ability to extract archives and whatnot all baked in,

06:43.480 --> 06:45.040
and a new milestone.

06:45.040 --> 06:49.080
Compatibility for Windows in ReactOS

06:49.080 --> 06:52.200
is reliant on something called the shim engine.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.160
That allows the loading of slightly different versions

06:55.160 --> 06:58.080
of libraries and APIs, depending on what the application expects

06:58.080 --> 06:59.560
from Windows.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.880
ReactOS is much the same in this release,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.240
but they added the ability for ReactOS

07:04.240 --> 07:07.960
to present itself as Windows 8.1 now.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.400
And so applications looking for that version of the APIs

07:10.400 --> 07:11.720
will now get back Win 8.1.

07:11.720 --> 07:12.800
Impressive.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.600
That's got to cover a lot of applications, I would think.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.200
Really, really, really nice.

07:17.200 --> 07:22.080
I'm just watching this with awe.

07:22.080 --> 07:24.520
Like, it's bizarro Windows in a reality

07:24.520 --> 07:26.440
where Windows became a community project,

07:26.440 --> 07:29.600
and they focused on making a fantastic development

07:29.600 --> 07:31.360
workstation, and they didn't really

07:31.360 --> 07:33.840
care so much about chasing convergence

07:33.840 --> 07:35.360
or all of the other things that like.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.160
You haven't even said the word enterprise.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.360
Like, what's happening here?

07:38.360 --> 07:39.320
I know, right?

07:39.320 --> 07:41.720
It does seem like this would make a great Enterprise OS,

07:41.720 --> 07:42.200
though.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.160
Just say it once.

07:43.160 --> 07:43.880
One day.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.480
It is fun to separate the old specter of Microsoft

07:47.480 --> 07:50.720
and then just the actual UI and experience of using Windows.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.040
Because I feel like we've twisted them in our souls,

07:53.040 --> 07:55.240
and there's obviously a lot of complicated feelings,

07:55.240 --> 07:58.280
but using the old Windows UI is just fine

07:58.280 --> 08:00.080
if you're just trying to get some work done,

08:00.080 --> 08:01.520
and you're already familiar with it.

08:01.520 --> 08:02.040
I agree.

08:02.040 --> 08:05.840
And you know, maybe one day when Microsoft moves on,

08:05.840 --> 08:08.920
it will be React OS that we go to for that compatibility

08:08.920 --> 08:10.840
shim on Linux or something.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.040
Could happen, Wes.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.000
React OS might end up being like, you know,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.440
future Chris and Wes's version of wine.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.840
What you're calling it here, it's a Chris prediction.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.080
Guys, do we have a sense of what the React OS developers are

08:24.080 --> 08:25.760
hoping React OS will be?

08:25.760 --> 08:28.080
It's essentially a Windows replacement

08:28.080 --> 08:30.640
with full Windows application compatibility.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.880
And they're doing it in a way that's so bottom up

08:32.880 --> 08:35.320
that they just might get there eventually by the time

08:35.320 --> 08:37.200
Microsoft gives up on Windows.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.760
But do you think that makes it still

08:38.760 --> 08:41.520
a goal worth pursuing, Brent?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.080
Well, that's kind of what my question was leading to.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.720
If, let's say, in five years they

08:45.720 --> 08:49.240
get to a really usable system, then what?

08:49.240 --> 08:52.600
And so for me, I would say not really,

08:52.600 --> 08:55.000
because I've done the work to get away from that.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.520
But I wonder what the usage case they're chasing.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.320
I think it's a worthwhile endeavor.

08:59.320 --> 09:00.440
Why do you say that?

09:00.440 --> 09:03.400
Well, we see lots of these proprietary systems

09:03.400 --> 09:05.840
fall by the wayside eventually.

09:05.840 --> 09:10.360
And maybe Windows will fall out of favor completely

09:10.360 --> 09:13.440
at one point, and it will become a relic, a thing of the past.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.600
And perhaps React OS will be a means

09:15.600 --> 09:20.840
to preserve that vast catalog of Windows software.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.520
Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.720
It's also just impressive that it's

09:23.720 --> 09:25.280
been going for like 20 years.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.000
And so even if it's not worthwhile or not,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.120
it's clearly providing value to the people working on it.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.160
Has it really?

09:30.160 --> 09:31.040
Yes.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.120
1998 was the initial release.

09:33.120 --> 09:33.880
Isn't that wild?

09:33.880 --> 09:36.200
I had no idea.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.400
I mean, I know I've heard about it for years,

09:38.400 --> 09:40.240
but I've only started taking it seriously in the last six

09:40.240 --> 09:40.800
months or so.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.360
It's just impressive.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.400
There must have been a lot of days in there

09:42.400 --> 09:44.840
that it didn't work so well as what we see today, right?

09:44.840 --> 09:46.520
And still they went on.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.920
Is it just me, or did they sort of hit a tipping point

09:48.920 --> 09:50.080
in the last couple of years?

09:50.080 --> 09:53.400
Because it used to be sort of a bit of a joke, a bit of a meme.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.880
But in the last couple of years, progress

09:55.880 --> 09:57.800
has been rapid and significant.

09:57.800 --> 09:58.280
Yeah.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.720
It looks like there's been some Google Summer of Code

10:00.720 --> 10:01.840
joining in there too.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.480
So maybe that may have played a role,

10:03.480 --> 10:05.440
got some more people interested in the project.

10:05.440 --> 10:05.960
Yeah.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.720
It does have a way of doing that.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.960
And it helps that they've reached some major milestones

10:09.960 --> 10:10.440
recently.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.600
They've been doing that now for a couple of releases.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.320
And I think that helps too, is people, oh, wow,

10:14.320 --> 10:15.600
they're really making progress here.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.840
And when you start to see progress,

10:16.840 --> 10:18.960
you start to take it much more seriously, I think.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.440
All right.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.160
Speaking of taking things more seriously,

10:21.160 --> 10:24.120
I'm starting to take elementary OS's App Center

10:24.120 --> 10:25.380
pretty seriously.

10:25.380 --> 10:28.280
They hit two major milestones recently.

10:28.280 --> 10:32.640
Number one is 100 native apps for elementary OS.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.400
Oh, boy.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.320
That's a great milestone.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.520
That's a big number, yeah.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.920
And then Cassidy James is blogging over

10:37.920 --> 10:40.120
on their Medium blog about the ability

10:40.120 --> 10:43.240
now to share App Center links directly.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.320
And they're going to give out, think about that

10:45.320 --> 10:46.200
from a blogging standpoint.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.160
You want to give out a link to an application

10:48.160 --> 10:49.920
that you want to cover.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.480
And now you can link directly to it.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.040
One of them is Dippy, which I played with just recently,

10:54.040 --> 10:55.600
is a DPI calculator.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.720
So you can go in there and say, this is my resolution.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.360
I got a desktop.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.160
I got a laptop.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.440
This is what I'm looking for.

11:00.440 --> 11:01.880
What should I have all my settings at?

11:01.880 --> 11:05.120
It's just a nice little DPI calculator.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.760
So some good progress over there.

11:06.760 --> 11:11.200
And I don't know if we have any metrics really to say,

11:11.200 --> 11:14.240
oh, this has been a success, or, oh, this isn't a success.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.760
But 100 is a great milestone.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.480
Now let's see how many of those make it to the next release.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.780
I'd love to see that keep going.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.480
Yeah, I'm curious about what role

11:22.480 --> 11:26.240
in the broader ecosystem of various open source

11:26.240 --> 11:28.160
or proprietary app stores will this play?

11:28.160 --> 11:30.400
And will elementary as an ecosystem play?

11:34.680 --> 11:35.880
OK.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.120
What the hell is going on with SteamOS?

11:38.120 --> 11:39.080
Is that still a thing?

11:39.080 --> 11:43.440
Yeah, only it's kind of just pod fading in a way.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.320
It's distro fading.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.800
It's based on the previous release,

11:47.800 --> 11:54.200
Debbie and Jesse, which reached end of life on June 17.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.160
And that's kind of concerning.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.680
But they have put out some updates.

11:58.680 --> 12:02.840
Steam 2.154 came out, which contains

12:02.840 --> 12:07.600
updates that are really just kind of minor bug fixes.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.120
They're nothing major.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.360
All the standard security patches, et cetera,

12:11.360 --> 12:13.120
that roll with a big distro like that.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.160
It's possible that they're working on a stretch version

12:16.160 --> 12:18.240
right now with a new graphic stack and a new kernel.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.160
But SteamOS has developed into, at least

12:22.160 --> 12:24.640
from the perspective of the Linux community,

12:24.640 --> 12:28.360
a bit of an underwhelmer.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.000
I'm trying to be nice about it.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.800
So it does sound like from the release notes

12:31.800 --> 12:34.680
that they've recently updated their build infrastructure.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.080
And this update was intentionally

12:36.080 --> 12:37.720
kept small in order to test the waters

12:37.720 --> 12:40.440
before more kernel and graphics drivers changes.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.880
But on what schedule?

12:41.880 --> 12:44.320
Is that going to be that gets released

12:44.320 --> 12:47.480
after the next version of Debian is already gone?

12:47.480 --> 12:48.000
Yeah.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.800
I think it's dead for me, SteamOS.

12:51.800 --> 12:57.120
I just saw a video that Linus Tech Tips did with Wendell.

12:57.120 --> 13:01.400
And he's touting all the benefits of the VFIO GPU

13:01.400 --> 13:02.760
pass-through stuff.

13:02.760 --> 13:07.560
And that, for me, shows that SteamOS is dying.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.240
Because if someone like Linus is going

13:09.240 --> 13:12.200
to approach a topic like GPU pass-through,

13:12.200 --> 13:14.280
it shows that people do want to play games on Linux,

13:14.280 --> 13:17.520
but they're going to run a Windows VM with KVM

13:17.520 --> 13:19.720
and then pass the graphics card through and just do it

13:19.720 --> 13:20.240
that way.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.160
Because it's so easy now to do that.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.120
I disagree.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.640
So I don't think that was how Linus was

13:25.640 --> 13:27.480
wanting to run his games at all.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.040
I think what happened there is Wendell

13:30.040 --> 13:34.120
came on, who knows his stuff, and instead

13:34.120 --> 13:39.240
of demonstrating how a Linux user would run games natively

13:39.240 --> 13:43.720
on Linux, was actually showcasing what he knew

13:43.720 --> 13:47.600
and getting bogged down in installing additional PPAs

13:47.600 --> 13:50.800
for drivers in order to make the Windows version of Wine

13:50.800 --> 13:54.960
Run in order to run Windows versions of games

13:54.960 --> 13:57.320
in the Windows version of Steam on Linux.

13:57.320 --> 14:00.160
And I just felt that it really didn't hit the mark.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.000
I don't think it did anyone any favors in terms

14:03.000 --> 14:04.840
of actually bringing them over to Linux

14:04.840 --> 14:06.720
as a serious gaming platform, because it

14:06.720 --> 14:08.080
looked like a massive hack.

14:08.080 --> 14:08.640
Thank you.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.320
Thank you.

14:09.320 --> 14:11.280
I have a lot of respect for Wendell,

14:11.280 --> 14:14.440
and I also have a lot of respect for Linus.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.480
As do I.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.960
They've done a lot of good work.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.960
But that was a hot mess.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.800
And I think it was a combination of the editing folks

14:22.800 --> 14:26.040
and Linus didn't know what was important and what wasn't.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.240
And Wendell wanted to showcase several things, how

14:28.240 --> 14:31.440
you could translate now to Vulkan, DirectX calls

14:31.440 --> 14:31.960
to Vulkan.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.200
So there's new layers of compatibility

14:34.200 --> 14:35.920
coming to Windows gaming on Linux.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.120
He specifically wanted to demonstrate which are three,

14:38.120 --> 14:39.840
because Linus asked for that.

14:39.840 --> 14:42.200
There was a lot of things happening in that video,

14:42.200 --> 14:44.080
but it didn't really do a good job

14:44.080 --> 14:47.240
of showing native Linux gaming, which

14:47.240 --> 14:50.480
is quite strong on a lot of systems right now.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.520
And I think they did miss the mark.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.000
And it did kind of make me go, OK, we have a lot of things

14:56.000 --> 14:57.240
going right now.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.120
We do have virtualization pass-through,

14:59.120 --> 15:02.040
which is a great, great option for a lot of folks.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.440
We're starting to build the ability now

15:04.440 --> 15:08.800
to have DirectX calls get converted to Vulkan calls,

15:08.800 --> 15:11.400
which is going to just bring wine to the next level.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.560
The video demonstrated those things.

15:13.560 --> 15:16.320
But I felt like it was, as an ambassador video

15:16.320 --> 15:19.040
from the Linux community to Windows gamers,

15:19.040 --> 15:21.800
I felt like it underdelivered in a lot of ways.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.360
Yeah.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.720
Now, what's happened is that on Twitter,

15:24.720 --> 15:28.120
there's been a little get together of Linux gamers

15:28.120 --> 15:30.220
and people interested in Linux gaming.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.840
And there's an effort to crowdsource five seconds

15:34.840 --> 15:39.280
of 1080p video for every Linux native game, which

15:39.280 --> 15:43.160
is going to be stitched together in a showcase in response

15:43.160 --> 15:44.520
to that video.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.720
So yeah, I'll dig you out a link you

15:47.720 --> 15:49.040
can include in the show notes.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.200
Because if anyone wants to get involved,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.740
they've got a big spreadsheet of who's

15:53.740 --> 15:56.680
doing the clip for each of the games.

15:56.680 --> 15:57.680
That's a great idea.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.160
But I wonder how long that's going to be.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.400
How many games are there?

16:00.400 --> 16:01.720
It's hundreds of games already.

16:01.720 --> 16:05.880
It's going to take a while just to stitch it all together.

16:05.880 --> 16:06.500
Love it.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.640
Well, while we're talking about games,

16:08.640 --> 16:12.960
we've been discussing Linux apps coming to Chromebooks.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.280
Pretty big deal.

16:14.280 --> 16:18.960
And it looks like they're also working towards GPU acceleration

16:18.960 --> 16:20.840
on these Chromebooks that are running Linux apps.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.400
For Linux apps?

16:21.400 --> 16:22.520
Yeah, for the Linux apps.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.760
Through the Chromebook GPU layer?

16:24.760 --> 16:27.840
Yeah, so it's part of the Vert.io subsystem for,

16:27.840 --> 16:30.480
and specifically, the Vert GPU subsystem.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.440
So yeah, it is part of the same system.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.120
It's using some of that same plumbing

16:34.120 --> 16:37.320
that we just talked about in the Linux Tech Tips video.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.720
Yeah, really, really interesting.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.960
Because not only does that give you certain games,

16:41.960 --> 16:44.380
but that's going to give you certain applications that just

16:44.380 --> 16:47.600
work better with 3D acceleration.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.200
And it also means that this is going

16:51.200 --> 16:52.960
to take this Chrome Linux app support

16:52.960 --> 16:56.840
and make it full-fledged, like a lot less limitations here.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.000
And this should be landing, some of this,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.440
beginning in Chrome OS 69.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.440
And then the idea would be to focus

17:05.440 --> 17:09.680
on getting all of the key functionality into Chrome OS 70.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.760
This feels like that could now be a serious developer

17:12.760 --> 17:15.440
workstation, almost, for the enterprise,

17:15.440 --> 17:17.680
because they have all the management stuff for Chrome OS,

17:17.680 --> 17:20.080
or just for your kid that you want to play with Linux,

17:20.080 --> 17:22.120
but also don't have to deal with having to re-image his machine

17:22.120 --> 17:22.680
all the time.

17:22.680 --> 17:26.200
Yeah, it does feel a bit like traveling to the moon

17:26.200 --> 17:29.200
and back to run a Linux app on a Linux box.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.440
You know what I mean?

17:30.440 --> 17:32.200
There's a few layers of indirection here.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.880
You could also just install the GTK libraries

17:34.880 --> 17:37.080
and just run the damn application.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.440
I mean, that would be an option.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.760
And it's not, you know what?

17:39.760 --> 17:42.560
I'm just going to tell you, it's not going to break the system.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.080
But is it Googs approved?

17:44.080 --> 17:46.080
No, because it's not in a container, Wes.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.480
It's not in a contained environment.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.800
So exactly.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.760
It's good to have the physical bell sometimes.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.880
So anyways, I think this is, I mean,

17:55.880 --> 17:59.880
I just, I dream of a day when I jump on a plane

17:59.880 --> 18:03.120
and all I have to bring with me is a Chromebook.

18:03.120 --> 18:08.040
Because I just, I love the idea of something like 13 inches,

18:08.040 --> 18:11.560
a couple hundred bucks, it could get destroyed, it could get lost.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.040
But at the same time, I could run QO notes.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.160
I could maybe even run a few games.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.800
Like, a Chromebook's all fine and dandy.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.000
I want QO notes.

18:20.000 --> 18:20.760
I want that now.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.840
Right, you've spent a long time developing

18:22.840 --> 18:25.040
specific Linux-based workflows, and you can just

18:25.040 --> 18:26.200
patch that right on top?

18:26.200 --> 18:26.760
Right.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.840
Or imagine if I could run Reaper on a Chromebook.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.880
There is some serious possibilities there.

18:31.880 --> 18:36.600
And as hardware gets faster and that price point gets lower,

18:36.600 --> 18:39.440
it might not be totally feasible today.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.960
But it is actually possible that in a few years

18:42.960 --> 18:46.400
we could have four-core and six-core Chromebooks.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.440
And I mean, half of what it's optimized for

18:49.440 --> 18:52.120
is browsing the web, which with all of our electron apps

18:52.120 --> 18:54.600
and other things is basically all I'm doing besides the terminal

18:54.600 --> 18:55.080
anyway.

18:55.080 --> 18:55.800
I know.

18:55.800 --> 18:56.880
Yeah.

18:56.880 --> 19:01.320
Yeah, it is going to be the year of the Linux desktop.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.440
And the thing is, they have a ton of time

19:03.440 --> 19:07.600
to work this out to sort of shave off the rough edges over time

19:07.600 --> 19:11.480
and then just really wait Microsoft and Apple out.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.240
Like, imagine if Apple switched to ARM,

19:14.240 --> 19:17.040
and Microsoft moves more and more to the cloud

19:17.040 --> 19:19.800
and to Azure-based revenue and pulls back more and more

19:19.800 --> 19:21.520
on Windows over time.

19:21.520 --> 19:24.880
And Apple keeps missing the boat on Macs.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.040
These vendors are just distracted.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.040
Microsoft's going to be more and more distracted

19:29.040 --> 19:31.200
by devices and Azure and services.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.920
And Apple is and has been distracted for a long time

19:33.920 --> 19:36.080
now by iOS.

19:36.080 --> 19:40.680
So Google is kind of nailing this at the right moment.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.140
I'm not saying they're going to have

19:42.140 --> 19:43.960
some sort of huge tide of adoption here,

19:43.960 --> 19:46.000
but they're nailing this at just the right moment.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.320
It's funny, too, because kind of quietly, you know,

19:48.320 --> 19:51.280
it's not a big, necessarily huge branding, marketing push.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.760
It's just rolling out and work is being done.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.040
And yet, it might have some actual impacts.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.480
Yeah.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.160
We'll see.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.440
I'm pretty excited by it.

20:00.440 --> 20:03.040
Anybody out there going to get a Chromebook and try this?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.240
Anybody going to actually put their money down and buy

20:05.240 --> 20:06.760
one of these suckers?

20:06.760 --> 20:07.600
No.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.160
No.

20:08.160 --> 20:08.680
No.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.480
No.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.160
No.

20:10.160 --> 20:10.720
Hmm.

20:10.720 --> 20:11.800
I might.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.920
I might, but not.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.960
Fake computer.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.140
Noah's already bought one.

20:15.140 --> 20:15.880
Well, of course he has.

20:15.880 --> 20:16.640
Noah is already.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.160
We're talking Noah.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.600
He already got one.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.640
And I'm not even sure if he's got the right model or not,

20:21.640 --> 20:22.200
but he just got one.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.040
It does seem like if you had a really nice Linux gaming

20:25.040 --> 20:28.320
desktop setup that that could be the perfect little cheapo

20:28.320 --> 20:30.800
satellite that you replace every couple of years.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.680
Yeah.

20:31.680 --> 20:32.480
I know.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.960
Is that the draw, or is it a cost thing?

20:34.960 --> 20:37.480
Well, actually, I use a Chromebook that's

20:37.480 --> 20:40.280
provided by my IT department.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.760
Well, we got those devices because it's

20:42.760 --> 20:46.760
tough to go into our ticketing system with a mobile device.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.800
And that, and also, it's another way

20:49.800 --> 20:53.760
to easily type emails and respond to clients easier

20:53.760 --> 20:54.880
than on a mobile device.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.400
And it's pretty reliable when it comes to Wi-Fi connectivity.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.600
It's one of the cheapo acers.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.880
It does support the Play Store, too.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.720
But I'm not sure if it supports the Linux apps yet.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.320
I could definitely see it as, like, I'm

21:07.320 --> 21:08.680
going to go do some emails.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.600
I'm going to just do some basic web browsing.

21:10.600 --> 21:13.200
And I've got hardware on either end of where I'm traveling.

21:13.200 --> 21:13.800
I could really.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.040
Like, I have a machine at home, and I

21:15.040 --> 21:16.480
have a machine in the studio.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.160
And I see it less, maybe, for people like us,

21:19.160 --> 21:21.240
as well as people casually interested in Linux,

21:21.240 --> 21:22.840
or maybe people who are professionally

21:22.840 --> 21:24.600
using Linux as developers or other things,

21:24.600 --> 21:27.000
but don't have very much interest in managing

21:27.000 --> 21:28.520
a whole Linux operating system.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.440
Yeah, well, yeah, there's probably a lot of.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.120
You know what?

21:31.120 --> 21:33.640
You know what the reality is we should just acknowledge here?

21:33.640 --> 21:36.240
So that way we just, it's the elf in the room.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.960
There are millions of more people

21:37.960 --> 21:40.460
that fit that description than the people that are interested

21:40.460 --> 21:41.680
in managing a Linux box.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.120
There are millions of more people, right?

21:44.120 --> 21:46.120
So let's be real about what the market is here.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.240
My wife wanted a laptop two or three years ago,

21:48.240 --> 21:51.160
and I got her a ThinkPad for 150 pounds.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.760
It was, at that point, two years old.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.120
And if cost is your main argument,

21:56.120 --> 21:59.600
then I think the used laptop market is perfectly

21:59.600 --> 22:02.320
serviceable for Linux.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.160
But then if we are talking about this mythical new Linux

22:06.160 --> 22:11.640
user who comes out of the swamp and wants to use a new box,

22:11.640 --> 22:13.120
maybe a Chromebook's a good shout.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.160
But I don't see too many of those, to be fair.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.040
So that new user, there's been, I

22:18.040 --> 22:19.540
don't know if you've seen these, there's

22:19.540 --> 22:22.000
been a couple of articles in Forbes this week.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.420
Yeah, I casually, via Twitter, invited him on the show,

22:25.420 --> 22:27.840
and I haven't heard back.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.920
So I'll give you some background on that.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.280
So first of all, these articles were really good timing,

22:32.280 --> 22:37.360
because the first one came out about two minutes

22:37.360 --> 22:39.940
before I was about to give a presentation last week

22:39.940 --> 22:41.280
in Montreal.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.480
And it perfectly summarized everything

22:43.480 --> 22:46.700
I was talking about, how the 1804 releases joined up

22:46.700 --> 22:48.440
all of these things we were working towards.

22:48.440 --> 22:50.600
And this is an operating system we can be proud of.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.120
And people are using it and finding the software

22:53.120 --> 22:53.740
that they want.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.880
And this article said all of those things.

22:55.880 --> 23:01.440
So I was able to flash it up as the concluding point.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.140
The author of that article has said

23:03.140 --> 23:07.920
that these two posts he's done about switching from Windows

23:07.920 --> 23:11.600
to Ubuntu have been 10 times more successful than anything

23:11.600 --> 23:14.400
he's written previously, which is why he's

23:14.400 --> 23:16.400
going to continue the series.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.200
And he's actually reached out to us at work

23:19.200 --> 23:23.440
and asked us to help with the next installment, which

23:23.440 --> 23:25.520
is a throwback to our earlier conversation

23:25.520 --> 23:26.640
about gaming on Linux.

23:26.640 --> 23:30.280
This is the thing that he's going to be looking into next.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.040
Ah-ha.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.000
I'd love to know how sticky that switch is

23:34.000 --> 23:35.880
for a lot of those new Windows users.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.720
Because I know, personally, a few years ago,

23:37.720 --> 23:41.080
I switched probably several times a year.

23:41.080 --> 23:43.400
And then, oh, there isn't this one thing.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.440
So I went back to Windows.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.720
I'd love to know how sticky Linux is for these guys.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.880
I think what's changed, at least from talking to him,

23:49.880 --> 23:53.480
is that he first of all installed Linux Mint.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.120
And that didn't stick.

23:55.120 --> 23:58.320
And then he installed Ubuntu 1804.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.160
And I think the main reason why it stuck

24:00.160 --> 24:03.200
was because the first run wizard gives you

24:03.200 --> 24:06.140
this flash up of, here's some interesting software

24:06.140 --> 24:07.640
you can install.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.520
And that included all of the things

24:09.520 --> 24:10.920
that he wanted to install.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.320
He wanted to install Telegram and Spotify and Skype

24:14.320 --> 24:17.480
and all of that stuff that's presented there.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.160
And I think that was like a tipping point of, ah,

24:20.160 --> 24:22.720
here's all of the things that I need.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.600
And that encouraged him to then stick with it for a bit longer

24:25.600 --> 24:27.640
and explore a bit more deeply.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.600
It really does make a difference.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.220
It seems to us technical users like such a small thing.

24:34.220 --> 24:35.480
It almost seems irrelevant.

24:35.480 --> 24:38.840
But it makes all of the difference to users

24:38.840 --> 24:41.200
that are coming to the platform for the first time.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.800
And there is real value in brand recognition.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.760
There's real value in seeing brands

24:46.760 --> 24:48.720
that you recognize on that Linux desktop.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.040
Oftentimes, that's all you have.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.920
It's like sort of a proxy for trust and for reliability

24:52.920 --> 24:55.000
and just like, can I get my work done?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.800
So what else can you tell me about that?

24:57.800 --> 24:59.680
Because it sounds like you know more about the story.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.880
Well, I know what the next, well,

25:00.880 --> 25:03.040
I was saying the next piece is going to be on gaming.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.760
But looking at the comments on Twitter

25:04.760 --> 25:06.560
and the comments on the articles,

25:06.560 --> 25:09.200
there seems to be not, I mean,

25:09.200 --> 25:11.720
there's only hundreds of thousands of views

25:11.720 --> 25:13.260
on the article itself.

25:13.260 --> 25:14.940
But there seems to be a lot of people

25:14.940 --> 25:18.280
who have been thinking about making the switch

25:18.280 --> 25:20.860
and needed some sort of confirmation

25:20.860 --> 25:22.480
in like the mainstream media

25:22.480 --> 25:25.120
because they don't follow our communities

25:25.120 --> 25:27.800
in these corners of the internet where we live.

25:27.800 --> 25:30.680
And it's given them confidence to go out and try.

25:30.680 --> 25:34.280
And what's been really good to see, uncharacteristically,

25:34.280 --> 25:37.220
is other people out there who are running Linux

25:37.220 --> 25:39.300
of one flavor or another and saying,

25:39.300 --> 25:41.320
yeah, there's lots of good reasons to switch.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.780
You know, here's this software

25:43.780 --> 25:46.640
that could fill this particular need for you.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.040
So it's been quite a positive thing

25:49.040 --> 25:51.760
and uncharacteristically so considering

25:51.760 --> 25:55.560
what we normally see when you get these articles

25:55.560 --> 25:58.280
about switching to Linux and then it's a big bun fight

25:58.280 --> 26:01.080
about you're using the wrong Linux and all the rest of it.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.480
What do you suppose is different now?

26:03.480 --> 26:04.480
Why is that?

26:04.480 --> 26:08.240
Why has that not been, oh, you should have tried Arch.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.120
Oh, you should have tried OpenSUSE.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.280
Why has it instead been, because you're right.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.900
I've been following the discussion as well

26:13.900 --> 26:16.200
because I wanted to ask him about it

26:16.200 --> 26:17.480
if he came on the show.

26:17.480 --> 26:21.240
And it has been a lot of more like, can I help you?

26:21.240 --> 26:23.840
Can I, is there anything I can do for you?

26:23.840 --> 26:25.680
Do you have any questions?

26:25.680 --> 26:26.840
What do you think's changed?

26:26.840 --> 26:27.680
What's shifted?

26:27.680 --> 26:29.720
I don't think anything's changed.

26:29.720 --> 26:30.560
I disagree.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.540
See, I think it's the switch to GNOME.

26:32.540 --> 26:35.640
I think Ubuntu switching to GNOME and then working upstream

26:35.640 --> 26:39.000
and being at Guadec and all of those things,

26:39.000 --> 26:43.920
I feel like have maybe changed the response possibly.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.440
I think a lot of people are exposed to a lot more Linux

26:46.440 --> 26:48.560
at work now than they ever were before

26:48.560 --> 26:50.480
with the rise of AWS.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.200
You end up with a lot more people doing quote unquote DevOps

26:54.200 --> 26:56.800
that was traditionally the sysadmins domain

26:56.800 --> 26:58.520
and they never touched infrastructure.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.000
And I think that's made quite a big difference.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.080
With regards to GNOME and the reception that Ubuntu

27:04.080 --> 27:06.120
is getting these days, I think it's two things.

27:06.120 --> 27:09.920
Yes, I think to some extent it's returning to GNOME,

27:09.920 --> 27:12.000
doing that in the right way,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.240
contributing upstream very visibly.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.260
I think all of the publicity and the blog posts

27:17.260 --> 27:19.780
that were done through that 1710 cycle

27:19.780 --> 27:22.360
to sort of chronicle that laid things out.

27:22.360 --> 27:26.240
And I think there's a return to involving the community

27:26.240 --> 27:28.960
with the new community theme that's in development

27:28.960 --> 27:32.600
and will feature in 1810, which has now got its name.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.960
But I think what was different with what I saw

27:34.960 --> 27:36.280
with the commentary here,

27:36.280 --> 27:40.960
it wasn't posted in the usual places the Linux community,

27:40.960 --> 27:42.500
whatever that is, hang out.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.120
It wasn't in our Linux.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.140
It was in the comments of Forbes

27:47.140 --> 27:50.800
and the comments of the tweets from the journalist

27:50.800 --> 27:53.480
where our usual community don't hang out.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.780
And I think maybe the response was more positive

27:56.780 --> 27:59.680
because the people that were following on there

27:59.680 --> 28:01.480
who had some experience with Linux

28:01.480 --> 28:04.200
are maybe a little bit more pragmatic and level-headed

28:04.200 --> 28:08.760
and not so sort of bipolar in terms of which distribution

28:08.760 --> 28:11.760
that they would insist you have to use.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.200
Right, so the areas in which it was spread

28:15.200 --> 28:19.100
and talked about, the usual grouches didn't organize.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.940
Yeah, that's my feeling at least anyway.

28:21.940 --> 28:23.420
Yeah, I mean, I think there is,

28:23.420 --> 28:24.720
especially as enthusiast people

28:24.720 --> 28:27.640
who put a lot of identity into our use and love

28:27.640 --> 28:29.480
of this operating system,

28:29.480 --> 28:30.840
it's very different than just sort of the thing you're like,

28:30.840 --> 28:32.240
oh, some casual news about how maybe

28:32.240 --> 28:33.480
that makes my life easier

28:33.480 --> 28:35.540
or a plus one for that thing I like.

28:35.540 --> 28:40.280
Yeah, and I would actually add to that a bit.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.420
And Brent, I think you could probably echo the sentiment

28:43.420 --> 28:44.600
a degree as well.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.600
And that is when you wanna just try switching

28:47.600 --> 28:49.320
over your workflow to Linux

28:49.320 --> 28:53.060
and the first bits of feedback you start to get are,

28:53.060 --> 28:55.120
oh, you're dumb, you chose the wrong distribution.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.240
That's a big turnoff.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.120
That's a big, that's like this big,

28:59.120 --> 29:01.440
like almost judgment that gets passed on you right away.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.440
And it comes across feeling sort of like

29:04.440 --> 29:05.960
you just get shut down in this

29:05.960 --> 29:07.960
what was otherwise an exciting adventure.

29:07.960 --> 29:12.960
And that kind of feedback isn't exclusive to user adoption.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.920
Again, I think it was this week or last week,

29:17.920 --> 29:22.660
Herey posted a blog about their experience

29:22.660 --> 29:27.340
bringing a proprietary application to Linux.

29:27.340 --> 29:30.760
And they touch on this that they went to seek out

29:30.760 --> 29:34.420
the Linux community and where they started their journey

29:34.420 --> 29:36.080
was on our Linux.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.360
And based on the feedback they got there,

29:38.360 --> 29:43.360
they dropped their plans to have a Linux client.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.640
Herey, by the way, is an email client

29:46.640 --> 29:51.440
specifically targeted at Exchange and Office 365.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.000
And it's multi-platform, but they wanted to do Linux

29:54.000 --> 29:55.840
and they were really dissuaded from doing so

29:55.840 --> 29:58.840
because of the reception that they got there.

29:58.840 --> 30:02.520
And then as it happens, Alan Popey

30:02.520 --> 30:06.600
actually saw their application randomly some weeks later

30:06.600 --> 30:08.560
and contacted them and worked with them

30:08.560 --> 30:12.000
and helped bring Herey to the Snap store.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.760
And this blog post then talks about

30:13.760 --> 30:15.440
how this turned around their perception

30:15.440 --> 30:17.200
about dealing with the Linux community

30:17.200 --> 30:20.080
because they were dealing with a different Linux community

30:20.080 --> 30:22.160
once they came into that platform

30:22.160 --> 30:24.640
and they were welcomed and they were encouraged.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.920
And then their blog post is very even-handed.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.460
I think it points out some of the drawbacks

30:30.460 --> 30:33.600
of targeting Linux and some of the plus points

30:33.600 --> 30:35.680
and some of the plus points are actually

30:35.680 --> 30:38.680
Linux users are specifically helpful

30:38.680 --> 30:41.500
in debugging and raising issues

30:41.500 --> 30:44.680
and giving you technical insight into your application.

30:44.680 --> 30:48.760
But Herey have gone from being turned off to a year later,

30:48.760 --> 30:52.640
they're now making 25% of their revenue off the Snap.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.360
Yeah, so I wanna talk about that

30:54.360 --> 30:58.460
because I think that is a really interesting story.

30:58.460 --> 31:02.260
And I think it's also fascinating in the context

31:02.260 --> 31:03.960
of Reaper just coming out for Linux,

31:03.960 --> 31:06.240
which is the editing software we use

31:06.240 --> 31:09.080
to produce our shows and record right now this show

31:09.080 --> 31:12.960
and also the dictator,

31:12.960 --> 31:15.440
benevolent dictator for life of Slackware

31:15.440 --> 31:17.960
coming out today saying I'm completely broke

31:17.960 --> 31:20.600
and I've been getting scammed by the Slackware store.

31:20.600 --> 31:23.400
I feel like all of that is,

31:23.400 --> 31:24.520
I think that's what we should move to.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.380
So before we switch to that,

31:26.380 --> 31:28.320
so Wimpy, that was the tease.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.280
Brent, I wanted to,

31:29.280 --> 31:30.440
I know you were gonna say something there.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.680
I wanted to come back to you for a moment.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.440
Just wrapping this, putting a button on this conversation

31:35.440 --> 31:36.520
just so we can move on and talk

31:36.520 --> 31:38.960
what Wimpy just shifted to.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.960
Is there really, is there a big turnoff

31:41.960 --> 31:43.120
if you were switching over to Linux

31:43.120 --> 31:45.160
and people come at you and say it's the wrong distro

31:45.160 --> 31:48.360
or could you just talk to that for a moment?

31:48.360 --> 31:51.480
Yeah, I feel, so I've helped several users

31:51.480 --> 31:54.640
move over as a professional service, I'll cut it.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.720
But what I've noticed is that

31:57.720 --> 32:00.180
it's hard enough to get someone to think about

32:00.180 --> 32:01.880
changing their entire workflow.

32:02.780 --> 32:06.040
And so to get that sort of discouragement

32:06.040 --> 32:08.560
of someone saying, oh, you did it all wrong

32:08.560 --> 32:12.340
or whoever helped you suggested the wrong thing

32:12.340 --> 32:13.320
is a real turn down.

32:13.320 --> 32:16.480
But what I like hearing here is that

32:18.480 --> 32:20.760
when there is a suggestion that

32:21.840 --> 32:25.160
any distribution is better than what you had before,

32:25.160 --> 32:26.840
then I think that's really the direction

32:26.840 --> 32:29.720
that we should be applauding people who are new users

32:29.720 --> 32:32.760
and to encourage them to really explore

32:32.760 --> 32:34.160
instead of being discouraged, right?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.160
We shouldn't be saying, oh, why'd you do it that way?

32:36.160 --> 32:37.520
You should have done it this way.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.920
Instead, the conversation be,

32:38.920 --> 32:41.780
oh, hey, you should try this one too, right?

32:41.780 --> 32:43.360
You're striking out from Windows

32:43.360 --> 32:45.320
or you're striking out from the Mac, congratulations.

32:45.320 --> 32:48.120
Exactly, yeah, I couldn't agree more with that.

32:48.120 --> 32:51.500
When we were doing Foss Talk Live a couple of months ago,

32:51.500 --> 32:54.560
one of the segments in the late night Linux live podcast

32:54.560 --> 32:57.100
was what do you wish would change

32:57.100 --> 32:59.260
in the next five years in Linux?

32:59.260 --> 33:02.140
And Will Cook made the point that he just wished

33:02.140 --> 33:04.060
everyone could just get along.

33:04.060 --> 33:06.200
We all believe in the same thing.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.180
We've all got a slightly different thing

33:08.180 --> 33:09.020
that we believe in,

33:09.020 --> 33:11.500
but when people come to the thing that we believe in,

33:11.500 --> 33:13.840
we should welcome them and we shouldn't fight.

33:13.840 --> 33:16.680
And I nearly stood up and applauded when he said this

33:16.680 --> 33:20.600
because I felt so strongly that he was correct about this.

33:20.600 --> 33:24.240
And I really wish we would see this sort of mentality change,

33:24.240 --> 33:26.960
this fighting, this infighting,

33:28.640 --> 33:33.120
people adopting party lines, factions,

33:33.120 --> 33:36.960
within the community and slagging each other off

33:36.960 --> 33:39.320
is just really tired and frustrating.

33:39.320 --> 33:43.680
Yeah, and I think we've probably talked it

33:43.680 --> 33:46.080
as much as we can on this show in the past.

33:46.080 --> 33:46.960
This is an area, though,

33:46.960 --> 33:50.680
that both Wimpy and I care a lot about, and if you do too,

33:50.680 --> 33:52.440
I would encourage you to check the back catalog.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.240
I'll just really quickly say every week

33:55.240 --> 33:58.740
I hear a story or two from somebody who's burned out

33:58.740 --> 34:00.020
just because of that issue,

34:00.020 --> 34:01.360
and they don't wanna make a big deal about it.

34:01.360 --> 34:04.720
Not everybody wants to burn down the web with a blog post.

34:04.720 --> 34:07.920
They just kind of quietly go off into the sunset.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.800
And it's like we should come up with,

34:10.800 --> 34:11.920
maybe if we came up with a term

34:11.920 --> 34:13.960
and we had a website and a logo,

34:13.960 --> 34:17.640
then maybe it would get more attention then.

34:17.640 --> 34:19.400
All right, so Wimpy really just,

34:19.400 --> 34:22.060
he just cracked that can of worms right the heck open

34:22.060 --> 34:23.760
just a moment ago.

34:23.760 --> 34:28.160
Mentioned, if you've heard about Hiri, H-I-R-I,

34:28.160 --> 34:30.600
it is a really fancy-looking,

34:30.600 --> 34:33.480
super well-designed email client

34:33.480 --> 34:34.920
that we haven't talked a lot about.

34:34.920 --> 34:36.320
In fact, if you read the blog post,

34:36.320 --> 34:38.780
podcasters have outright refused to talk about it.

34:38.780 --> 34:40.480
Joe, Joe Resington.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.280
Podcasters have outright refused to talk about it.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.280
So let's talk about what they're claiming

34:46.280 --> 34:48.040
about some of the difficulties they've had

34:48.040 --> 34:49.920
about moving a commercial product over to Linux.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.400
And then I wanna conclude it all

34:52.400 --> 34:55.760
by discussing why I think Reaper coming to Linux

34:55.760 --> 34:56.620
is a massive deal,

34:56.620 --> 35:00.620
even though Ardour is out there and open source.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.880
And the shitstorm I'm getting just for saying that already,

35:03.880 --> 35:05.900
which is amazing, I wanna talk about all of that.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.000
Plus we'll end it all on a few ways for you

35:08.000 --> 35:10.940
to examine the performance of your Linux box,

35:11.860 --> 35:14.780
look at perhaps the PSI of your system,

35:14.780 --> 35:16.440
if Facebook has their way,

35:16.440 --> 35:19.040
and then a tool that will give you

35:19.040 --> 35:20.760
essentially a quick snapshot

35:20.760 --> 35:22.520
of all the essential information you need

35:22.520 --> 35:25.820
on the command line about your GNU slash Linux box,

35:25.820 --> 35:28.680
and yes, that situation going over at Slackware.

35:28.680 --> 35:30.800
So let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean

35:30.800 --> 35:32.520
for making this episode possible.

35:32.520 --> 35:36.120
Do.co, oh, slash unplugged.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.600
So you got to go to the do, to the dot co,

35:38.600 --> 35:40.080
to the slash unplugged,

35:40.080 --> 35:43.240
so that way you can get the $100 credit over at DigitalOcean.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.040
And you know they're not gonna offer this forever,

35:45.040 --> 35:46.400
so go take advantage of this

35:46.400 --> 35:49.280
while you're hearing these words of wisdom

35:49.280 --> 35:52.080
come from my mouth hole into your ear holes.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.640
Do it right now, do.co slash unplugged,

35:54.640 --> 35:57.160
you get a $100 credit for 60 days

35:57.160 --> 35:59.480
when you sign up with a new account over at DigitalOcean,

35:59.480 --> 36:02.520
now they have industry leading price and performance,

36:02.520 --> 36:03.960
I don't say that lightly.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.760
My favorite system, the three cents an hour rig is amazing,

36:06.760 --> 36:09.880
and they have systems that go up to nearly 200 gigs of RAM.

36:09.880 --> 36:11.080
What? I know.

36:11.080 --> 36:14.760
80 gigs of SSD, three terabytes of transfer,

36:14.760 --> 36:17.320
two beautiful CPUs,

36:17.320 --> 36:20.560
four gigabytes of the random access memory,

36:20.560 --> 36:22.640
and I get that all for three cents an hour.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.680
You can get one that's $5 a month,

36:24.680 --> 36:26.240
that's $10 for every two months,

36:26.240 --> 36:27.480
you can imagine how far you can get though

36:27.480 --> 36:29.040
with a $100 credit.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.360
They also have flexible droplets

36:30.360 --> 36:32.040
where you can mix and match the resources

36:32.040 --> 36:33.720
depending on what your application needs,

36:33.720 --> 36:35.640
and you can deploy the entire application.

36:35.640 --> 36:39.260
So you want GitLab, we actually are doing that right now.

36:40.240 --> 36:45.240
As we record, there is someone mysterious in the background

36:46.080 --> 36:48.000
who has been on the show before in the Mumble Room,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.280
but is not here today, and may be here next week,

36:50.280 --> 36:53.080
who is deploying GitLab on a DigitalOcean droplet

36:53.080 --> 36:56.760
to manage some projects for us over here

36:56.760 --> 36:57.600
at Jupiter Broadcasting.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.000
What? Wow.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.440
Yeah, and it's just one of those nice things

37:00.440 --> 37:01.960
where because we have a team account,

37:01.960 --> 37:04.000
he has access to my resources,

37:04.000 --> 37:05.520
so he can deploy it under my account,

37:05.520 --> 37:08.120
so ultimately I have total control over it all,

37:08.120 --> 37:10.720
but I can have someone in the community work with me.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.440
And I just love the flexibility that DigitalOcean brings,

37:13.440 --> 37:15.120
and the interface is super easy to use,

37:15.120 --> 37:17.640
so managing DNS or SSH keys is easy,

37:17.640 --> 37:19.940
and they have lots of documentation as well.

37:19.940 --> 37:24.520
So go to do.co slash unplugged to get a $100 credit.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.400
That's, you know, I mean $100.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.000
Oh man, I can think of all the fun ways

37:29.000 --> 37:29.840
I could burn through that credit.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.840
I mean, even on a Seattle budget, $100 is not bad.

37:32.840 --> 37:33.680
You know what I'm saying?

37:33.680 --> 37:35.480
That's some pretty good spending money.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.480
Speaking of Seattle budgets, Ting.

37:37.480 --> 37:40.720
Let's go over to linux.ting.com right now.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.920
linux.ting.com, it's smarter than unlimited.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.440
If you use less, you just fricking pay less.

37:45.440 --> 37:46.920
Here is the best part about it.

37:46.920 --> 37:51.200
It's just $6 a month for your phone, plus what you use.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.480
So if you're texting the ladies or the guys a lot,

37:55.480 --> 37:57.160
you're gonna pay a little more for texts,

37:57.160 --> 37:59.840
but if you don't text the ladies or the guys a lot,

37:59.840 --> 38:01.680
then you won't pay anything for texts.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.240
If you use a lot of data, you'll pay for data that month.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.160
So like last month, I used more data.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.840
I'll pay that month, but for the other 11 months of the year,

38:08.840 --> 38:11.200
I pay a lot less because I'm always on wifi.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.680
I also do not use the phone.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.000
I've got Slack, I've got Telegram,

38:16.000 --> 38:18.560
I've got Skype, I've got FaceTime.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.320
Why would I actually make an actual phone call?

38:20.320 --> 38:24.760
In fact, little fun Ting fact for you.

38:24.760 --> 38:28.960
I spent the last collectively two months in Texas

38:28.960 --> 38:33.200
and never made a single phone call.

38:33.200 --> 38:35.600
Spent a lot of time on the FaceTime

38:35.600 --> 38:36.960
with my internet phone from Apple.

38:36.960 --> 38:38.000
I'm so fancy you.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.440
Using the FaceTime audio,

38:39.440 --> 38:41.800
and then you add that with some earbuds and stuff,

38:41.800 --> 38:43.080
it is a great way to go.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.720
And never, never used a minute.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.720
I mean, what do you wanna be on that publicly switched

38:47.720 --> 38:48.600
telephone network for?

38:48.600 --> 38:51.160
Anyway, that's last century technology.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.600
Please Wes, so beyond that, please.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.160
I want my voice in packets.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.720
And that's why I love Ting.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.560
So when I'm on wifi, I just use wifi.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.840
And if I need the cellular network is like a data backup,

39:01.840 --> 39:02.680
I've always got it.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.320
They've got nationwide coverage.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.280
Ting has you covered from coast to coast,

39:06.280 --> 39:08.680
and they have CDMA and GSM.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.520
They have both of them.

39:09.520 --> 39:11.680
Whatever you want on the multiple of the frequencies.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.800
And here's the best part.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.800
The contracts, they don't got them.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.560
No early termination fees,

39:16.560 --> 39:18.520
no quote unquote service agreements.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.680
You just pay for what you use,

39:19.680 --> 39:20.960
and when you're done, you can stop.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.200
You can do it all through the website,

39:22.200 --> 39:23.960
or you can talk to one of their really great

39:23.960 --> 39:25.240
customer service reps.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.160
So go check it out.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.040
Just go to linux.ting.com.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.880
That'll take $25 off a phone if you wanna grab one

39:30.880 --> 39:32.040
from the Tings.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.800
And if you bring one, and like I said,

39:33.800 --> 39:36.240
they got the GSM and they got the CDMAs,

39:36.240 --> 39:39.480
then you could just get $25 in service credits.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.960
And Wes is gonna sit here and tell you

39:40.960 --> 39:42.760
that's gonna probably pay for more than your first month.

39:42.760 --> 39:43.600
Right, Wes?

39:43.600 --> 39:44.440
I would be very surprised.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.800
Or you have a lot of friends,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.160
and hey, that's not a bad problem.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.000
Yeah.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.240
You know what, you're right.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.600
Oh, so what you're saying is the reason why my Ting bill

39:53.600 --> 39:55.080
is so low is because I don't have any friends.

39:55.080 --> 39:57.160
I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't make that connection,

39:57.160 --> 39:58.640
but yes.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.600
You know what, you might be right, actually.

40:00.600 --> 40:04.320
You know what, plus I talk to them all over Telegram, right?

40:04.320 --> 40:05.840
It's all those gifts you send, buddy.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.880
It is, right?

40:06.880 --> 40:09.600
Anyways, go check them out, linux.ting.com,

40:09.600 --> 40:13.040
and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring

40:13.040 --> 40:14.680
the Unplugged program, linux.ting.com.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.120
First sponsor, first sponsor of the show right there.

40:17.120 --> 40:17.960
Deserve it.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.160
I gotta also say a big thank you to Linux Academy,

40:20.160 --> 40:23.000
number two sponsor of the show, boom, right in there.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.920
Hot after Ting was Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.760
That's where you go to sign up and support the show

40:29.760 --> 40:32.520
and get a free seven-day trial of a platform that

40:32.520 --> 40:34.000
is growing like crazy.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.840
They just had a live stream today

40:35.840 --> 40:38.680
where they announced the essentials of AWS Lambda,

40:38.680 --> 40:39.480
which is awesome.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.520
They completely rebuilt their Lambda courseware.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.520
Nice.

40:42.520 --> 40:45.560
AWS Security Essentials was also announced.

40:45.560 --> 40:46.280
That's important.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.480
Last week, Red Hat Enterprise Security Essentials

40:49.480 --> 40:51.920
and a bunch of container management courseware,

40:51.920 --> 40:53.960
as well as Salt and OpenStack has been announced.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.720
They are rolling out more than 150 bits

40:56.720 --> 40:58.560
of new content, courseware challenges,

40:58.560 --> 41:00.440
and more at Linux Academy.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.240
And you can try it out at linuxacademy.com slash

41:03.240 --> 41:04.080
Unplugged.

41:04.080 --> 41:05.840
They have so much in the works.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.200
I just got a taste of some of it.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.280
And I gotta tell you, there's never

41:09.280 --> 41:13.920
been a better time to subscribe, because they are super fired

41:13.920 --> 41:17.720
up about creating new content as accurately

41:17.720 --> 41:19.180
and as fast as possible.

41:19.180 --> 41:22.280
And they are building a team around checking things,

41:22.280 --> 41:24.360
making sure things stay up to date,

41:24.360 --> 41:26.960
and that the best people are on those topics.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.680
Your subscription will be worth it.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.880
Go to linuxacademy.com slash Unplugged

41:30.880 --> 41:32.800
to learn more about anything that runs Linux

41:32.800 --> 41:34.800
or that Linux runs on top of.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.640
And why not go check out their YouTube channel?

41:37.640 --> 41:39.940
Not only did they just recently announce some new Google

41:39.940 --> 41:42.200
platform courseware and some really good stuff,

41:42.200 --> 41:44.620
including you get some videos of some of the different people

41:44.620 --> 41:46.920
behind the scenes, but their live streams,

41:46.920 --> 41:48.540
which I've been on for a couple of them

41:48.540 --> 41:52.280
and the one they had today, are all over on the linuxacademy.com

41:52.280 --> 41:53.280
YouTube channel.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.480
So you can see everything they've announced recently.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.280
You can see my live stream appearances,

41:57.280 --> 42:00.680
including me eating a cupcake that had gold dust on it

42:00.680 --> 42:03.800
that then got in my beard, which stayed in my beard

42:03.800 --> 42:05.240
for the rest of the live stream.

42:05.240 --> 42:07.440
And that's why, even after 13 years of broadcasting

42:07.440 --> 42:08.880
on the internet, I haven't learned

42:08.880 --> 42:11.040
to not eat gold cupcakes on a live stream.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.800
You can see that as well.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.360
That's a thing that happened.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.440
linuxacademy.com slash Unplugged.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.160
But it was delicious frosting.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.360
And nobody else was eating it.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.880
It was like a poppy seed.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.040
Oh, I love poppy seeds.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.720
Yeah, it was like a poppy seed batter

42:23.720 --> 42:25.720
that they had for the cupcakes.

42:25.720 --> 42:27.760
This is a fancy cupcake also, so I

42:27.760 --> 42:30.800
think you can be forgiven for indulging just a little.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.800
That's how they celebrate OpenStack's birthday.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.000
They know what they're doing.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.200
Yeah, they're fans over there.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.560
linuxacademy.com slash Unplugged.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.400
OK, so let's talk about a couple of tools you can use.

42:40.400 --> 42:43.040
And then we'll cover those later.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.320
We'll cover those later.

42:44.320 --> 42:44.880
Screw it.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.040
Let's get into the topic.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.920
Let's talk about Heri and that email client.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.620
We were going to talk about the tools,

42:49.620 --> 42:51.200
but I just want to move right to this.

42:51.200 --> 42:54.080
This has been something that got me personally fired up

42:54.080 --> 42:57.960
because they took a shot at Linux podcasters,

42:57.960 --> 43:00.680
and they called our Linux part of the Linux community.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.600
And those two things make me very, very, very angry.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.440
And I don't know what to do for these guys

43:05.440 --> 43:06.960
because they did their best.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.000
You know, they reached out to Canonical.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.160
They worked on making a Snap package.

43:11.160 --> 43:14.880
And you can't expect them to spend 15 years in the community

43:14.880 --> 43:19.240
and learn every esoteric aspect of our tribe

43:19.240 --> 43:20.920
before they try to launch a product.

43:20.920 --> 43:23.300
So I don't have any good advice for them,

43:23.300 --> 43:25.900
but there are several things in this post that

43:25.900 --> 43:28.080
really piss me the hell off.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.880
And I feel like they are representative

43:31.880 --> 43:35.800
of a much, much, much larger problem that

43:35.800 --> 43:39.960
is becoming worse than ever, than I have ever witnessed.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.320
I've been using Linux since the 90s as an end user,

43:42.320 --> 43:44.960
and I have never seen this headwind

43:44.960 --> 43:46.420
against commercial software.

43:46.420 --> 43:47.680
So I want to cover all of that.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.480
Let's start, though, with how they tried to interact.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.360
Six months before they went to market with their Linux app,

43:53.360 --> 43:56.000
they went to what they considered

43:56.000 --> 44:00.800
to be the Linux community, reddit.com slash r slash

44:00.800 --> 44:01.500
Linux.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.600
And they wanted to see if people there would

44:03.600 --> 44:06.040
pay for a proprietary product.

44:06.040 --> 44:10.340
That's kind of like going to a free water bar

44:10.340 --> 44:12.480
and trying to sell bottled water.

44:12.480 --> 44:15.160
I mean, like, I don't know how else to, like,

44:15.160 --> 44:17.360
and I don't blame them, because where else do you go?

44:17.360 --> 44:18.980
You're like, oh, I want to find the community for that.

44:18.980 --> 44:20.180
Well, there's probably a subreddit,

44:20.180 --> 44:21.440
and sure enough, there is.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.400
Yeah, where else do you, like, there's nowhere else

44:23.400 --> 44:26.320
you can go where you can start, like, anyone can just

44:26.320 --> 44:28.800
start a thread asking a question and then get engaged.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.920
Like, you go to reddit.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.900
Like, there's no other option.

44:31.900 --> 44:34.000
And the problem is every single person over there

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
is a son of a bitch.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
All of them.

44:37.000 --> 44:37.920
I'm one of them.

44:37.920 --> 44:38.480
I'm a son of a bitch.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.360
I was going to say, yeah, I'm over that.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.320
I mean, accurate enough.

44:41.320 --> 44:45.320
Yeah, I mean, our Linux is a, we've

44:45.320 --> 44:48.600
also just sort of tracked these things over the years

44:48.600 --> 44:50.840
at Jupyter Broadcasting, because we have Telegram.

44:50.840 --> 44:51.680
We have email.

44:51.680 --> 44:52.960
We have YouTube comments.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.620
We used to have website comments.

44:54.620 --> 44:56.240
We have Reddit comments.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.040
We have tweets.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.320
We have Facebook comments.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.920
And so we really kind of watch all of this stuff

45:00.920 --> 45:02.800
across all of these different platforms that

45:02.800 --> 45:04.560
allow for audience engagement and feedback,

45:04.560 --> 45:08.180
Instagram, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

45:08.180 --> 45:12.760
And there is a really, really, really close parallel

45:12.760 --> 45:15.040
to YouTube comments and Reddit comments.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.680
Same topics, same people they reference, same everything.

45:18.680 --> 45:23.760
The vernacular, the grammar, all of it, it's the same crowd.

45:23.760 --> 45:26.940
It is the same people that are commenting on our Linux

45:26.940 --> 45:28.240
are a lot of them, not all of them.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.740
I'm not trying to, I shouldn't paint in such broad strokes.

45:30.740 --> 45:35.120
But many of them are also on YouTube making comments.

45:35.120 --> 45:36.920
Like, there's a lot of similarities there.

45:36.920 --> 45:40.000
I've been doing this for a really long time.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.300
I watch all of the comments.

45:41.300 --> 45:43.920
And then we also track some of them in spreadsheets

45:43.920 --> 45:46.900
to try to get idea of general audience feedback.

45:46.900 --> 45:51.480
And it has gotten to the point where Angela

45:51.480 --> 45:52.680
can read a comment to me.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.680
And I can say, that's a Reddit comment.

45:54.680 --> 45:55.720
That's a YouTube comment.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.420
That's a tweet.

45:56.420 --> 45:57.440
That's an email.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.140
Before she's even told me the source,

45:59.140 --> 46:01.560
I can tell you where that came from because

46:01.560 --> 46:04.160
of the type of commentary we get in the different sources.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.040
This was super, super, super, super obvious to me

46:07.040 --> 46:08.720
as we were wrapping up Linux Action Show.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.280
In fact, it was a point of discussion

46:10.280 --> 46:12.440
that we made just because it was an interesting data point.

46:12.440 --> 46:13.960
And it's something we've followed

46:13.960 --> 46:16.840
since the last 10 episodes of Last or So.

46:16.840 --> 46:21.080
We have followed it in a very close way.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.400
And I can tell you that the kind of commentary

46:23.400 --> 46:26.980
you get out of our Linux is some of the most hostile, least

46:26.980 --> 46:29.560
informed, bigoted type of commentary

46:29.560 --> 46:31.760
that you will get in the Linux community.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.680
A small percentage of it is well-informed, well-intentioned,

46:34.680 --> 46:39.440
and the other percentage is toxic.

46:39.440 --> 46:43.960
And so that right there is, I think, a huge issue

46:43.960 --> 46:47.320
because our Linux is going to be representative

46:47.320 --> 46:49.680
of the community to so many people that

46:49.680 --> 46:51.880
are investigating the Linux, quote unquote,

46:51.880 --> 46:53.480
market for the first time.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.440
I mean, you're absolutely right.

46:55.440 --> 46:58.280
And it's hard, too, because I think many of the reasons

46:58.280 --> 46:59.820
that Reddit is a powerful platform,

46:59.820 --> 47:01.660
it can also be kind of a dangerous platform.

47:01.660 --> 47:04.020
And there's so many of us that just love Linux

47:04.020 --> 47:05.680
and just are just trying to get things done and go

47:05.680 --> 47:06.400
about our lives.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.040
And I certainly go over there, but I

47:08.040 --> 47:09.080
don't spend a lot of time there.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.040
You know, I might see what people

47:10.040 --> 47:11.680
are talking about, pop in a few threads here or there.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.440
But if you're completely outside the bubble.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.120
Oh, yeah.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.000
I mean, you have no way to know.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.040
Where else do you go?

47:17.040 --> 47:19.640
And it's hard because you don't know about all the best blogs

47:19.640 --> 47:23.160
or the Google Plus pages.

47:23.160 --> 47:26.080
It's a hard community to key into, and then especially hard,

47:26.080 --> 47:28.240
I think, for the product area they're targeting

47:28.240 --> 47:30.680
because, again, it's kind of the theme of this whole show,

47:30.680 --> 47:32.980
the casual Linux user who doesn't love it enough

47:32.980 --> 47:35.400
that they want to go spend all their free time at home

47:35.400 --> 47:37.600
on the Linux subreddit, but would

47:37.600 --> 47:41.720
love to have this exchange client for their work email.

47:41.720 --> 47:42.640
Yes, exactly.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.280
And so as Wimpy implied a little earlier,

47:45.280 --> 47:47.900
they got a pretty negative response

47:47.900 --> 47:50.720
when they went to rLinux asking about the interest in this.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.920
They cite a couple of examples here in their blog post.

47:53.920 --> 47:57.120
One is, quote, this is going to be a very hard sell being

47:57.120 --> 47:59.900
a proprietary-based source system to Linux users.

47:59.900 --> 48:03.000
Many use Linux because they have bought

48:03.000 --> 48:06.120
into the idea of open source, but good luck with it anyways.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.760
And then another user writes, if it

48:07.760 --> 48:09.200
were free and open source software,

48:09.200 --> 48:12.920
I would have downloaded and compiled it 20 minutes ago.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.840
So they say after reading these comments,

48:14.840 --> 48:18.360
they, quote, promptly shelved their Linux ambitions.

48:18.360 --> 48:20.320
But the guys at Canonical were persuasive.

48:20.320 --> 48:21.480
They had a vision.

48:21.480 --> 48:24.040
They wanted to bring Ubuntu to the widest possible audience.

48:24.040 --> 48:27.560
To do this, they needed to attract more software to the OS.

48:27.560 --> 48:30.320
More than that, the software should be easy to find,

48:30.320 --> 48:31.800
update, and install.

48:31.800 --> 48:34.420
They created Snaps, a software deployment and package

48:34.420 --> 48:35.840
management system.

48:35.840 --> 48:39.200
The results would be available on the Ubuntu Software Center,

48:39.200 --> 48:41.120
amongst other places, which is essentially

48:41.120 --> 48:42.440
like an app store for Linux.

48:42.440 --> 48:45.200
We bit the bullet and spent some time creating the Snap.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.320
The opportunity to reach a new market and scale

48:47.320 --> 48:49.000
was too good to miss.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.760
By far, most of our Linux downloads

48:50.760 --> 48:51.840
now come through Snaps.

48:51.840 --> 48:54.880
Although tracking exactly where those Snap installs are coming

48:54.880 --> 48:56.760
from isn't possible at the moment,

48:56.760 --> 48:58.440
Snaps available are online, and they're

48:58.440 --> 48:59.920
available for other distros.

48:59.920 --> 49:02.200
But success in any app store is contingent

49:02.200 --> 49:04.840
on the amount of exposure you get on the front page

49:04.840 --> 49:06.500
in editorial areas.

49:06.500 --> 49:08.740
But financially speaking, I do believe

49:08.740 --> 49:11.360
you can make a living out of selling software to Linux users

49:11.360 --> 49:12.080
alone.

49:12.080 --> 49:14.920
But we couldn't rely on just Linux users right now.

49:14.920 --> 49:16.920
I'd say it nearly pays for itself,

49:16.920 --> 49:18.780
and the numbers are gradually increasing.

49:18.780 --> 49:23.720
But the main challenges remain getting the word out.

49:23.720 --> 49:27.320
Unfortunately, the fundamentalist FOSS mentality

49:27.320 --> 49:30.400
we encountered on Reddit is still alive and well.

49:30.400 --> 49:33.080
Some Linux blogs and podcasts simply

49:33.080 --> 49:35.320
won't give us the time of day.

49:35.320 --> 49:38.140
If Linux as a platform is going to succeed,

49:38.140 --> 49:40.640
Linux users should think about the riches

49:40.640 --> 49:46.000
of the entire ecosystem rather than to seek to limit it.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.440
There's just a lot in there.

49:47.440 --> 49:49.160
There is just a ton of that.

49:49.160 --> 49:50.660
I mean, so much of it, I think, also

49:50.660 --> 49:52.080
comes down to how we represent ourselves

49:52.080 --> 49:55.000
or how disparate parts of the community self-organize.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.720
Because proprietary software used

49:57.720 --> 49:59.320
to be, for a long time, the norm.

49:59.320 --> 50:01.380
And in many ways, open source, free software

50:01.380 --> 50:03.920
was a reactionary movement against that.

50:03.920 --> 50:05.620
And so I think it is legitimate that there

50:05.620 --> 50:07.120
can be sub-communities that say, no, I

50:07.120 --> 50:08.960
want to build a life for myself on this stuff.

50:08.960 --> 50:10.420
And frankly, I'm just not interested

50:10.420 --> 50:11.880
in your proprietary product.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.320
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't

50:13.320 --> 50:15.240
be able to do that as part of the community.

50:15.240 --> 50:16.740
And then how do you identify that?

50:16.740 --> 50:18.280
How do you know who you're talking to?

50:18.280 --> 50:20.400
I guess I feel like I wish he knew he could come on this show.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.720
We have an open mumble room.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.080
He could come in here, and they could tell us

50:23.080 --> 50:24.960
about this cool application they're building.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.240
They didn't have to ask for permission.

50:26.240 --> 50:28.280
They could just be here and telling us about it.

50:28.280 --> 50:30.880
And they say that the podcaster has turned them down.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.040
That's not true.

50:32.040 --> 50:34.920
I mean, maybe some podcasts did, but other podcasts

50:34.920 --> 50:37.200
would be interested in what you're doing.

50:37.200 --> 50:39.600
There's different markets.

50:39.600 --> 50:42.000
I think you and I both have a realistic look at it.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.500
There's people out there that are trying

50:43.500 --> 50:47.360
to use Linux in environments that have been traditionally

50:47.360 --> 50:48.960
Microsoft-centric.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.020
Very much so, yeah.

50:50.020 --> 50:51.120
That was me early on.

50:51.120 --> 50:55.800
If it wasn't for Crossover Office and Xandros

50:55.800 --> 50:58.920
and later on Evolution with its Exchange Connector,

50:58.920 --> 51:00.800
I wouldn't have been able to switch to Linux

51:00.800 --> 51:02.280
in the workplace.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.520
And now when there's applications like Heri here,

51:04.520 --> 51:09.120
H-I-R-I, that support Exchange, well, that's

51:09.120 --> 51:11.680
a question we get every single week,

51:11.680 --> 51:14.240
is how do I use Exchange under Linux?

51:14.240 --> 51:17.760
So I would have been very happy to talk to this person,

51:17.760 --> 51:20.440
but they don't know when they're outside the community,

51:20.440 --> 51:22.880
when they're outside our bubble, when they're outside our echo

51:22.880 --> 51:26.200
chamber, like Wimpy was talking about with the Forbes editor.

51:26.200 --> 51:27.400
They just don't simply know.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.760
So what can we do here, Wimpy?

51:29.760 --> 51:32.280
I think the first point that we start with

51:32.280 --> 51:36.320
is where do people go and find the Linux community?

51:36.320 --> 51:41.800
There's no one place to go and visit and be part of it

51:41.800 --> 51:43.960
and sound it out.

51:43.960 --> 51:48.160
Our Linux is just one of the many online communities

51:48.160 --> 51:50.400
for Linux.

51:50.400 --> 51:54.880
So yeah, that's a tricky one, because we've

51:54.880 --> 51:58.400
got like 900 distros out there now,

51:58.400 --> 52:00.480
so it's quite a fragmented space.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.440
Yeah, otherwise it seems like the problem's

52:02.440 --> 52:05.120
going to get solved at the other end by business interest, which

52:05.120 --> 52:07.000
in some cases like this, canonical,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.440
getting them to use snaps, I think is a good thing.

52:09.440 --> 52:11.480
But that's going to be the other driver in this.

52:11.480 --> 52:14.020
And I don't know if that's what the community wants necessarily

52:14.020 --> 52:15.640
for everything.

52:15.640 --> 52:16.800
What do you mean?

52:16.800 --> 52:19.720
Well, if we don't have an organized spot

52:19.720 --> 52:22.280
for outside people to find that is truly

52:22.280 --> 52:25.080
representative of the community and different resources,

52:25.080 --> 52:27.320
then it's going to be left up to businesses

52:27.320 --> 52:29.800
to solve that problem, where they can fund somebody

52:29.800 --> 52:32.680
like yourself to reach out and convince them to package

52:32.680 --> 52:33.960
this thing up in a snap.

52:33.960 --> 52:36.600
And while that's certainly a decent effort,

52:36.600 --> 52:39.360
canonical can't solve this problem all on their own.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.720
We need something that is more than that.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.240
Yeah, I agree.

52:43.240 --> 52:47.680
You know, this is a real thorny problem, right?

52:47.680 --> 52:51.920
So you only have to look at how distributions are maintained

52:51.920 --> 52:53.560
and how many hundreds of people are

52:53.560 --> 52:55.600
responsible for managing the archives

52:55.600 --> 52:57.660
behind those distributions.

52:57.660 --> 53:00.560
In order to scale the distributions up,

53:00.560 --> 53:03.080
the distribution repositories up to encompass

53:03.080 --> 53:05.480
all of the software that's available,

53:05.480 --> 53:09.280
you would need an order of magnitude more people

53:09.280 --> 53:11.480
packaging up that software.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.800
And clearly, this doesn't work.

53:13.800 --> 53:17.760
So when you look at the likes of the iOS store and the Android

53:17.760 --> 53:20.160
store, there's millions of applications there,

53:20.160 --> 53:21.760
and the model is simple.

53:21.760 --> 53:25.320
The developer or the vendor publishes their application

53:25.320 --> 53:27.360
directly to the users.

53:27.360 --> 53:28.560
That scales.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.520
And so this is the model that we need

53:30.520 --> 53:36.760
to pursue in order to give Linux as a whole a better footprint

53:36.760 --> 53:38.240
in the desktop market.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.640
Because there is more software out there

53:40.640 --> 53:42.680
than the free and open source software

53:42.680 --> 53:44.960
that we have in our distribution archives.

53:44.960 --> 53:48.760
There's also tons more free and open source software out there

53:48.760 --> 53:51.480
that is not in our archives.

53:51.480 --> 53:54.920
And we need to find a way to get that software to users.

53:54.920 --> 53:58.440
And finding more archive admins is not the way to do it.

53:58.440 --> 54:00.840
Yeah, in a way, that's a pretty good response

54:00.840 --> 54:04.480
to recent criticism that that model has

54:04.480 --> 54:06.680
led to malware or cryptoware.

54:06.680 --> 54:09.000
Because I agree, making software more available

54:09.000 --> 54:10.800
is the ultimate end goal there.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.320
Yeah, and that's a compromise that you have to make.

54:13.320 --> 54:16.200
And we have to improve the safeguards

54:16.200 --> 54:19.240
that we put in place to detect that stuff automatically,

54:19.240 --> 54:23.400
just in the same way Apple and Google and Microsoft

54:23.400 --> 54:25.080
do in their stores.

54:25.080 --> 54:31.600
So they say the takeaway is it's not so easy, in their case,

54:31.600 --> 54:33.280
to sell to an open source platform.

54:33.280 --> 54:35.880
Because what everybody has told them in feedback

54:35.880 --> 54:37.920
is, well, just open source it.

54:37.920 --> 54:42.080
And that is so easy for us to say.

54:42.080 --> 54:44.560
But they point out, we have professional VCs

54:44.560 --> 54:45.680
that have funded this.

54:45.680 --> 54:47.440
And they want us to hold on and own

54:47.440 --> 54:49.680
our intellectual property here.

54:49.680 --> 54:52.160
And there's really no wiggle room.

54:52.160 --> 54:55.520
Plus, the support model won't pay for the whole thing.

54:55.520 --> 54:58.560
And that's a real problem that a lot of developers face.

54:58.560 --> 54:59.960
A lot of shops face that.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.880
When Linux users tell vendors that nobody's

55:03.880 --> 55:06.400
interested in proprietary software,

55:06.400 --> 55:08.760
they are blissfully ignoring the fact

55:08.760 --> 55:12.120
there are 700,000 Linux users on Steam.

55:12.120 --> 55:15.040
So that percentage of the Linux user base

55:15.040 --> 55:17.320
is quite happy to buy proprietary software,

55:17.320 --> 55:19.280
no problem whatsoever.

55:19.280 --> 55:20.720
And there are other examples.

55:20.720 --> 55:24.400
If you're paying for any of these web services,

55:24.400 --> 55:27.040
nine times out of 10, you're buying into proprietary systems.

55:27.040 --> 55:30.760
So I just don't believe that people aren't prepared

55:30.760 --> 55:33.360
to buy proprietary software.

55:33.360 --> 55:40.520
I do believe that there is a section of our community who

55:40.520 --> 55:46.000
are absolutely committed to the notion of free and open

55:46.000 --> 55:46.560
software.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.960
And that's all that they will use.

55:48.960 --> 55:51.520
And there are good reasons why they believe that

55:51.520 --> 55:54.640
and why that's the way they want to use their computing

55:54.640 --> 55:55.320
environment.

55:55.320 --> 55:57.360
And that's brilliant.

55:57.360 --> 56:00.360
Those people are well-supported and have got

56:00.360 --> 56:02.320
plenty of software available.

56:02.320 --> 56:05.080
But that doesn't mean to say that for the rest of us who've

56:05.080 --> 56:07.800
got a more pragmatic outlook shouldn't have access

56:07.800 --> 56:09.800
to proprietary software on Linux.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.280
I wonder, too, if maybe we should pivot this discussion

56:12.280 --> 56:14.320
or just think about it like if they had gone out

56:14.320 --> 56:18.200
to survey all of the Outlook users or Exchange users

56:18.200 --> 56:20.840
and said, how many of you would be interested in this software

56:20.840 --> 56:21.560
running on Linux?

56:21.560 --> 56:22.520
How much different would that be?

56:22.520 --> 56:24.400
Because like, that's a great question.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.760
Or gamers, if you were like, hey, how many of you

56:26.760 --> 56:29.480
would use a Linux system if you had the ability

56:29.480 --> 56:31.480
to do so with our Steam client?

56:31.480 --> 56:33.320
But that's just harder to do, right?

56:33.320 --> 56:34.240
And you think about it.

56:34.240 --> 56:36.880
I think we often think about it in the reverse.

56:36.880 --> 56:41.960
So listening to this week's LAN when you brought up Reaper,

56:41.960 --> 56:44.920
Joe just shut the conversation down.

56:44.920 --> 56:45.640
It's proprietary.

56:45.640 --> 56:47.280
No, not talking about it.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.240
And sometimes I think that can be just as harmful

56:50.240 --> 56:55.840
to the discussion as things like on our Linux being toxic.

56:55.840 --> 56:58.520
Because if, for example, this company

56:58.520 --> 57:01.280
was listening to that podcast, they go, oh, well,

57:01.280 --> 57:04.400
I'm going to have 50% of my users that think this is great.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.720
I mean, maybe that's an unfair brush.

57:06.720 --> 57:09.480
But maybe you get my point.

57:09.480 --> 57:13.760
And hopefully, I think the thing about the Linux community

57:13.760 --> 57:16.840
for me is that it is made up of lots of different individuals.

57:16.840 --> 57:19.680
You have some freedom-respecting,

57:19.680 --> 57:25.060
stalemate types who are, to the core, free and open

57:25.060 --> 57:26.360
is the only way to go.

57:26.360 --> 57:30.000
And then you have people like me who

57:30.000 --> 57:32.600
I am essentially a pragmatist at heart.

57:32.600 --> 57:35.480
And if I see something like Hiri come up

57:35.480 --> 57:38.960
and it solves a genuine problem that I'm having,

57:38.960 --> 57:42.360
I'm going to think long and hard about whether I run

57:42.360 --> 57:43.820
a proprietary piece of software.

57:43.820 --> 57:46.740
But at the end of the day, if that's the only option

57:46.740 --> 57:48.360
and it adds a feature to Linux that's

57:48.360 --> 57:50.400
going to mean that more people can use Linux,

57:50.400 --> 57:53.640
I think, on balance, that's probably a good thing.

57:53.640 --> 57:54.320
I agree.

57:54.320 --> 57:59.720
And my understanding is that's the vast majority

57:59.720 --> 58:01.840
of the audience's belief.

58:01.840 --> 58:07.560
But there is a portion that do have strong moral beliefs

58:07.560 --> 58:09.800
around using only free software.

58:09.800 --> 58:14.440
And I feel like the news that Reaper is coming to Linux

58:14.440 --> 58:18.240
officially is an effing game changer.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.440
And I've been trying not to talk about this

58:20.440 --> 58:22.280
because it hasn't officially been available.

58:22.280 --> 58:24.200
It's been on a website where you're not

58:24.200 --> 58:26.560
allowed to share the link and all of that kind of stuff.

58:26.560 --> 58:28.840
But since the beginning of 2018, we've

58:28.840 --> 58:31.680
been recording every single damn show at Jupiter Broadcasting

58:31.680 --> 58:32.680
in Reaper.

58:32.680 --> 58:35.220
And Noah was doing it before that as sort of like my test

58:35.220 --> 58:36.160
guy.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.640
He was my canary in the coal mine to see how it worked.

58:38.640 --> 58:41.240
And so when Reaper was officially announced,

58:41.240 --> 58:46.740
I am elated because it now makes Linux the best podcasting

58:46.740 --> 58:47.820
platform.

58:47.820 --> 58:50.020
It is the best platform to record podcasts.

58:50.020 --> 58:53.800
And that industry is exploding right now.

58:53.800 --> 58:56.200
The podcast industry, and that is now an industry,

58:56.200 --> 58:58.520
is blowing up in a way that scares the shit out of me,

58:58.520 --> 58:59.640
to be honest with you.

58:59.640 --> 59:01.120
But there is more and more people

59:01.120 --> 59:02.720
looking to produce podcasts.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.640
And the fact that you can now say

59:04.640 --> 59:06.820
there is an entire workflow that is Linux-based that

59:06.820 --> 59:10.380
is superior to the commercial offerings, including Macs.

59:10.380 --> 59:13.040
So extrapolate that argument to photography.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.720
I know we've got Brent here as well.

59:15.720 --> 59:19.180
I use Lightroom very heavily for all of my photography stuff.

59:19.180 --> 59:22.240
I would absolutely love Lightroom

59:22.240 --> 59:23.680
to run natively on Linux.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.160
I know it's a proprietary thing, and I

59:25.160 --> 59:26.360
know you have to pay for it.

59:26.360 --> 59:29.360
But the fact that a commercial-grade piece of software

59:29.360 --> 59:33.600
would run on Linux would just be life-changing.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.480
It is important, and we don't all

59:35.480 --> 59:38.120
get to live in the world of where, in many cases, yes.

59:38.120 --> 59:39.540
And for many people, it does work.

59:39.540 --> 59:41.240
And we spend most of the time on the show

59:41.240 --> 59:43.580
celebrating the fact that open source and free software is

59:43.580 --> 59:45.640
just so fricking awesome.

59:45.640 --> 59:48.120
But there are times and places where you need other things.

59:48.120 --> 59:50.180
And while we can all say, how do we

59:50.180 --> 59:51.640
help open source grow in this area?

59:51.640 --> 59:53.220
Does it make sense for open source

59:53.220 --> 59:54.520
to have a replacement there?

59:54.520 --> 59:56.480
A lot of times, for people who are just trying

59:56.480 --> 59:58.000
to start their journey, they just

59:58.000 --> 59:59.800
need to have it happen so that they

59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.380
can continue to explore things while still getting stuff done.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:02.880
Absolutely.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.640
There's only so many hours in a day.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.160
Unfortunately, yes.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.260
And I think one thing that we should keep in mind

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:12.280
is that choice is really what we should value.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.400
We should have open source choices.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.280
For instance, your Lightroom alternative is darktable,

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.800
and that's come a long way in the last few years.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.920
It's what I use for 80% of my professional photography.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.560
But you should have the choice to continue using Lightroom

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.440
on Linux if you want to.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.480
Maybe that's a workflow that works better for you.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.840
Maybe it's something you're used to,

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.180
and you just don't have the time or energy at the moment

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:37.080
to learn another piece of software.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.160
But we should be celebrating the fact that we have choices,

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.960
not that we only have free and open source software choices.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960
Absolutely agree, 100%.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.600
Yeah, we don't want to live in a little sandbox where we only

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.840
have our open source or free software apps that

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:54.080
don't feel that little competitive pressure to have

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.960
to compete on the same platform with other commercial software.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.440
I think it's a balance.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440
It's a balance, really.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.440
It's a balance between what is free and what is closed.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.880
And I think if you have too much in either direction,

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.840
well, I'd say you can't have really too much free,

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.720
but you can have too much in the closed direction.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.560
And so it's a balance.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.080
And in a way, when you have a free base operating

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.320
system and a free kernel, and all the libraries are free

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.760
and the UI is free and the applications on top

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.720
are free and you're running one or two commercial applications,

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.840
one or two commercial or proprietary applications,

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.560
I think that's not a bad balance.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.080
And I think that we as a community

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.440
have to be more accepting of that idea.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.440
The idea is to strive for as much free and open software

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.120
as possible.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.040
But we shouldn't completely shut down

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.960
anyone who wants to have something commercial.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.280
And I have gotten tweets and telegrams

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.040
since Sunday when we released Linux Action News.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.080
People are shaming me for using Reaper when Ardour

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.760
is out there and available.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:50.800
And I respect Ardour.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.040
I think it's a great project.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.840
And I've actually donated money to Ardour

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.160
before, even though I don't use it.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.040
I just prefer to use Reaper for the type of workflow

01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.800
that we have.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.480
And I just thought, people don't know

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.400
what it takes to record 32 tracks of audio in real time

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.720
to multiple different rate arrays and to a NAS.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.200
So how dare they judge what software

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.520
I choose to use to accomplish that task?

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.200
But yet still, I have received quite a bit of criticism

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.720
in the last three days because I'm

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.560
using Reaper instead of Ardour.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.960
And here, I'm just happy that we're

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.960
producing all of this in a high-quality way on Linux.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.120
You go back, I don't know, was it three years ago

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.960
when LAS was video?

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:35.720
And how much of that workflow was done?

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:39.280
You had Wirecast going in a Mac and all the rest of it.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.160
And you think, well, where you are now

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.480
running one proprietary application on Linux

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.800
is much better than running your entire workflow

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.680
through a Mac, surely, isn't it?

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.400
Yeah, and I kind of have been trying

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:58.320
to get to a spot where I'm not judgmental what anyone uses.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.840
There was people that I've met recently

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:03.400
that I thought were just super, super hardcore Linux

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.760
developers that are on a MacBook.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:07.520
And I had to really kind of sit with that for a minute.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.080
I know that seems like a weird thing,

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.680
but I had to sit with that for a minute.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.440
And I had to be mindful about not judging them

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.320
for using a MacBook.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.000
I thought you were this big Linux person.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.960
I thought, like, I know somebody who

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:25.520
is a massive, massive Linux personality on YouTube

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.320
who I've recently discovered has been using Windows for a year

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:35.640
plus and is still purporting to be a Linux person on YouTube.

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:37.240
You're talking about Noah, right?

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.600
Yeah, that'll be the day.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.800
If there is one person you can guarantee

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.200
will never be that person, it is Noah.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:45.720
It's a lie.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:47.960
And that will never be a problem with Noah.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.360
And I also had to sit with that for a little bit.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.320
And it's like, it doesn't change.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.000
I guess what I'm trying to say is I have to leave room for that.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.840
I have to leave room for that because there

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.200
is space for open source and free software

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.580
on all of the platforms now.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.920
And I have to leave room for some people

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.840
to have a more closed down, locked down, proprietary,

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.600
spying operating system at the base level

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.720
and using free software at the top level,

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.200
just like we should make room for having a free operating

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.840
system at the base level and a privacy respecting

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.720
kernel at the base level and a free and open source

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.480
backed community operating system and desktop.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:28.960
But maybe we use a couple of proprietary applications

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.240
at the top level.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.200
Who's to say one's better than the other?

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.160
And that's something I have to remind myself

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.600
because I have been the guy that has come on this show

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.360
and been like, yeah, Wes, I saw 15 MacBooks

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.680
and I saw six Lenovo's at this conference,

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.040
or I saw 35 MacBooks.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:45.920
You sure have.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.560
I have.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.320
That has been me for a long time.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.360
And that is a form of judgment that I have passed on people.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.600
And who the hell am I?

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.680
I mean, I think I can go both ways a little bit maybe.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.760
And I think it's a big difference between someone

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.520
who really supports and values Linux and maybe a Mac just

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.560
works, or maybe they got it free from their employer

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.000
and just makes financial sense.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.040
Or there's like 1,000 reasons.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.480
But in not all cases is that a detriment

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.040
to the free or open source community.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.760
It can be, right?

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.000
If we still lived in the old days of a pervasive like,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.440
you can't do that on Linux and you'll never

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.480
do it on the next world.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.960
But we're slowly not there.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.320
And so we need to win on our merits.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.880
In the case of Chris's example, they're

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.680
saying that there's a high profile Linux developers

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:31.600
or high profile Linux YouTubers using Macs.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.600
One is a Mac, one's a Windows guy, so it's both.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:40.120
But they are still forwarding the open agenda, are they not?

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.840
And that's got to be more valuable than having them,

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.320
I don't want to say restricted, or have a workflow that

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.400
is less productive for them.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.360
I don't know if I agree that the answer is yes, actually.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.560
I would actually like to open that up to the audience

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.080
a bit and get their take, linuxunplug.com slash

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:58.200
contact.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.800
I mean, I feel like if it came out

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.640
that I had been using Windows all this time,

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.840
wouldn't you feel like I was a fraud?

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.240
Is that part of the question that you're asking, though?

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.560
Yes, because you specifically got on about Linux so much

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.800
and your workflows.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.480
Yeah, I know.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:16.960
Yeah.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.120
But if you just never talk about the topic of production,

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.840
if you had a better produced podcast that

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.880
could reach more ears highlighting

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.760
the values of Linux, which is a worse podcast.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.480
Yeah, that was our argument for doing LAS

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.920
and having it edited on a Mac.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.520
That was the argument that we used for a long time.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.520
But the thing that Noah and I just

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.600
kept going back and forth on, and we kind of just,

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.180
you know, there's just no way around it,

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:39.640
is how can you legitimately be a proponent of something

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.320
that you can't use yourself?

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.560
Alex's point is it's more about spreading the message.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.560
So take the guy that runs the Linux Foundation.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.840
He was recently seen using a Mac.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.000
But he's doing good work with the Linux Foundation

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.360
in some cases.

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.880
Which one is more important to you?

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.000
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.320
I'd love to know, actually.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.160
Just one more point.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:00.660
Yeah.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.360
Don't forget there's lots of different types of Linux.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.680
There is desktop Linux and server Linux and IoT Linux.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.960
And so to be a Linux user, you don't necessarily

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.880
have to be glued to a desktop the whole time.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.200
There's also, like, you can prefer something

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.880
and not also be arguing that the other system can't do it,

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.360
right?

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.040
Like, I might just like a Mac workflow,

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.280
even if Windows or Linux can do the same thing.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.320
I had lunch with a couple of Azure guys from Linux Academy

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.440
who live, eat, and breed Linux from their Windows boxes.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.080
And it was a real, it was a thing.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.320
Like, it just took me a bit like, really?

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.040
Really?

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:41.920
OK.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.520
But you know what?

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:44.840
That's their workflow.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.160
And they make their living on Linux.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.920
And they live, eat, and breed Linux.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.680
And they connect from their Windows boxes.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.560
And I was just, I sat there and I go, you know,

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.680
that's probably happening a lot more than I realized.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.720
So who am I to judge?

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.640
Because it works for them.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.960
And so I am concerned a bit about this strong headwind

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.840
that is building more than I've ever witnessed.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.600
Like, in the past, people just would

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.120
have been happy that we're making content under Linux

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:11.460
and that we're able to do it at a certain quality level.

01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.840
But now it's not good enough.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.360
Now every single application, every single application,

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:19.920
every library, everything in the entire pipeline

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:22.000
needs to be free software.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.600
And it's not always possible.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.960
Because if you think about it, you

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.400
can't even really boot your system without a couple of blobs.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.640
So where do we draw the line?

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.800
And that chorus, as Linux has grown

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.560
and as people have gotten more and more into the free software

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.240
message and started to grok why it's important,

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.000
more and more people have become radicalized and advocates,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.020
which is understandable.

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.440
Because when you really understand

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.360
the importance of free software, you kind of

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.360
do get sort of passionate about it.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.800
And that passion is turning away people

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.200
that could be making tools that enable

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.380
Linux to be approachable by even more people.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:09.640
And that crowd is now dominating areas that, quote, unquote,

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.960
represent the Linux community.

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.000
I have two podcasts, Linux Action News and Linux Unplugged.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.360
Those two podcasts know, I mean, I'm not sure about Ubuntu

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.440
podcasts, I think they do quite well.

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.520
They are one of, and maybe each one of them,

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.180
maybe the largest Linux podcasts,

01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:32.080
if not some of the largest Linux podcasts in the world.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.200
Nobody approached me about a commercial piece of software

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200
that we could talk about.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.080
Nobody approached me.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.320
So how do you define what represents the Linux community?

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.520
I would argue that it's each to our own,

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.560
to which area we look, which lens we use to look in

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.880
on the Linux community.

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:50.960
And that's a problem, too.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.920
Because when you don't have one company representing you,

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.440
when you don't have a Steve Jobs,

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.480
when you don't have a Mark Zuckerberg,

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.360
when you don't have somebody like an Elon Musk who

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.480
can be your front man, who can be your singular point of focus,

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.840
you end up trying to go to the different, quote, unquote,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.800
communities.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.720
And what you get are a bunch of shitheads.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.220
And that's what our Linux is, and that's

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.080
what a lot of the Linux community is.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.540
I say that as one of them.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:20.440
And completely, as somebody who's there every single day,

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.560
I am absolutely one of those sons of bitches.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.480
And it turns away people.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.320
And I know that because I've been doing this for a long time,

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.520
and I get emails all the time telling me that.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.920
And it's super frustrating to read those emails,

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.920
and I never have a good answer for them.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.920
And they're not wrong.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.680
And at the same time, we also have

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.960
to balance that with advocating free software.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.760
We can't just sit on our hands and not advocate free software

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.640
and not encourage people to try to open source their software.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.660
Because my god, if we did that, where the hell would we be?

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.600
So it's not a simple problem to solve.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.920
So you know I have a penchant for containers.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.160
I've long made the argument that they were the reason that I

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.040
ended up finally understanding Linux,

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.920
because I didn't have to go on the forums

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:09.600
and admit that I didn't know how to do apt-get install basic

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:10.360
thing.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.800
I just ran this magic black box, and this container just

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.720
ran Plex.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.200
It ran all sorts of other stuff.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.760
And it reduced that barrier to entry.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.360
So I think anything we can do to make it easier for people

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.440
to join the community, whether that's packaging software

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.840
with snaps, Docker containers, whatever,

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.660
proprietary companies that it's in their commercial interest

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.920
to make it as easy as possible, as demonstrated with Hiri

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.920
going through the snap process, I

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.600
think anything we can do as a community to encourage

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:49.600
new people, more people to contribute and be

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.040
part of this community, the better.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.800
And if we can get away from the cesspit of YouTube comments

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.240
and Reddit comments as well, then it's so much the better.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.840
Because I don't think anybody really likes them.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.800
Isn't it interesting, I feel like free software

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.640
would be better off if Reddit and YouTube were to go away.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.680
And that is a sad state of affairs,

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.600
because that's not going to happen.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.240
Me, myself, I'm still what I consider myself a noob.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:24.600
I'm actually still going through this journey

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:30.440
of trying to discover gaming on Linux.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.520
And through that, the Telegram channels

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:36.440
and all that sort of community shows

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:40.880
the positive side of what people on Linux

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:46.720
are willing to discuss in terms of solutions to problems,

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.680
as well as directing new users, such as myself, who still

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:57.240
dual boot, who are still trying to get through this market

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.400
of applications, regardless of proprietary or commercial

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.880
or free and open source.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:08.280
I do see there is a positive side to versus that yang

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.440
that you mentioned about Reddit and YouTube.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.760
I think also to that point, it's unfortunate it also

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.400
is one of the interfaces where occasionally,

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.880
like in this instance, the wider world sort of stumbles

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.000
on to our little community in ways that are not good,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.720
and maybe ways that we talk about less that are good.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.720
Or at least it becomes a mixing ground,

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.560
and that's probably a lot of work

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.280
and a lot of misconceptions get generated.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.080
But maybe some other things happen too.

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.120
All right, well, I'm going to sort of wrap this up

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.400
by asking Brent if perhaps maybe this solution isn't

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.880
worrying about it from a general user standpoint,

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.800
but the niches, niching down.

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:46.440
Like people that are coming to solve a specific problem,

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:50.160
photography, gaming, data science, web development,

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.860
that's where we need to focus our efforts.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.640
And those particular communities might

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:57.600
be where people end up actually finding themselves.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.640
What are your thoughts around that, Brent?

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.520
Perhaps this overall problem is too big to solve,

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.680
and we need to solve it by breaking this up a bit

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:08.080
and figuring out what people need to do on their Linux boxes.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.520
In some way, I probably represent the non-developer,

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:15.600
non-sysadmin user here in some ways.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:21.160
And so I got introduced to Linux just to get stuff done,

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.920
but get stuff done in a way that felt a bit more secure

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.600
and a bit more empowering for me.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.920
So I think a lot of users might have that same approach

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.240
to coming to Linux.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.320
And so you mentioned maybe there should

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:41.680
be these sub-communities in photography, or in design,

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.880
or in engineering, or those different vocations.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.580
And wouldn't it be great if those niche communities

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:54.800
existed because Linux was spread a little bit everywhere?

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.460
When I go to any photography, anything,

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:02.600
there is absolutely no one talking about Linux

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.360
as far as the professional networks that I'm part of.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.400
I'm kind of the black sheep there.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.080
I know there's a lot of Linux advocates

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:12.680
who play with photography and get a lot done that way,

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.480
but coming at it from the other angle doesn't always happen.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.080
So I think in a way, if we can spread the word starting

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.840
at those vocations and those careers and coming back,

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:27.600
that might be a new interesting approach instead of having

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.360
them come to the Linux community, which is,

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.480
as we're seeing, a little bit of a mess.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:35.760
Yeah, it would really be solving it one workflow at a time

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:36.320
in a way.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.880
And I think I could see that working.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.080
It would take a long time, but open source

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.200
is pretty good about sticking at it over the long haul.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:50.200
I think we could probably find some professionals or advocates

01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.800
in each of those fields easily.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.760
And we just need to lean on them a little bit.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.480
Yeah, that's an interesting idea.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:57.640
Worth exploring perhaps some more.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.800
Also, I have a link in the show notes about the situation

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.240
over at Slack where I encourage you

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.120
to go check that out because it's an area I think that

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.320
really could use some love.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.120
And if you have ideas on how we could help,

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:12.240
I would love to hear at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.240
I was thinking about running a GoFundMe campaign or something

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:19.760
for the Slackware developer, but I don't know.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.560
I don't know if that should be coming from us.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.560
I don't know if that should be coming from the community.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.320
I would happily dedicate some of Jupyter Broadcasting's time

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.040
to help manage something like that.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.840
If you have ideas on how a show like ours

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.720
could help in a situation like Slackware, please let us know.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.600
And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.680
please go check the show notes and read up on it.

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.520
And then send me your thoughts, serious thoughts only, please,

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.320
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.520
I'd like to make a difference in situations like Slackware.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.560
We have a project that's been around forever

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.920
that's working on their best release of all time.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.760
And their core developer is suffering

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.840
with holes in his house and driving around

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.360
in a car on a spare tire because I absolutely

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.680
know exactly how that feels.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.600
And I would love to help make a difference in somebody's life

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.400
if you have ideas and thoughts on that.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.960
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.320
If you want to get more on Westpane, where should they go?

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.160
Ooh, go check out TechSnap, TechSnap.Systems,

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.440
or I'm over at at Westpane.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:15.120
Boom.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.960
Mr. Brent, why don't you give a plug of skis

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.760
for your social media profile or somewhere

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.440
where people can get more of you during the week?

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:20.840
Sure, yeah.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.400
There's a little bit on Twitter, so at Brent Jervow,

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:28.240
just spell that out, B-R-E-N-T-G-E-R-V-A-I-S.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.440
And then before we go, we have to plug

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.160
the excellent and always competitive Ubuntu podcast.

01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.840
And Mr. Wimpy, I have to ask you, sir,

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.320
is there anything else we should mention or give a little plug

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.640
ski here before we run?

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.880
I've got a plug for some proprietary software.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.680
Let's have it, baby.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.200
I love it.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.720
OK, go ahead.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.440
Well, might as well stay on topic, eh?

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:54.800
Yeah.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:00.040
So a while ago, Popey snapped the Minecraft launcher.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.560
That's the Java, the old Java UI.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.360
And this week, we've released into the store,

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.600
Minecraft is now using the new launcher that they

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.240
released a few days ago.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.520
Yeah, I saw that.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.440
Very excited.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.080
As a parent who is installing that for his kids,

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:16.760
very excited.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.920
Couldn't be easier.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.760
That's awesome.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.680
All right, very good.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.720
Well, thank you very much.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.800
Yes, go check out the Ubuntu podcast,

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.920
and go check out more Westpain over at TechSnap.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.400
And if you heard us making vague inferences to Joe,

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.120
you can go get more Joe over at LateNightLinux.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.160
And he joins me on Linux Action News every single Sunday

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.560
over at linuxactionnews.com.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.000
And you're welcome to check that out.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.880
Hey, why don't you join us live on Tuesdays?

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.200
We do this show at around 2, it really

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.880
kind of starts around 1.30 Pacific over at jblive.tv,

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.800
jupitabroadcasting.com, slash calendars,

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.040
where we have that converted.

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.000
And you come hang out with us.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.080
You get a bunch of pre-show, you get some post-show,

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.520
and then you get the Ask Noah show.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.640
It's a whole lot of show.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.340
Thanks so much for joining us, and we'll

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.880
see you right back here, not now, next Tuesday!

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:27.320
Now, you're watching Hertzinated Live's live audience

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:41.080
You know, one thing we didn't get to mention in the show, but is absolutely awesome, is

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:46.600
that PowerShell was launched as a Snap this week. That is so cool.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:52.720
Yeah, so PowerShell was something that I worked on. That originated in the Snap community

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:57.760
as it happened. So Chris, you'll remember when you're in Seattle, you met Dan, he was

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:03.420
there from the community and he created the initial PowerShell Snap and at that event

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:09.680
in Seattle, handed it over to Microsoft in person. And then since then it's been in legal

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.720
review and then released just this, just this week, this week, last week, back into last

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:15.720
week.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.280
They really do take this quite seriously, don't they?

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280
Yeah. Impressive.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.640
Yeah. I mean, that was months and months and months ago.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:25.520
Yeah. We're finding this. So we were just talking about all these companies doing proprietary

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:30.520
software. This is actually PowerShell's actually open source software, but they've spent five

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:34.520
months doing the legal review to make sure that all of the libraries that they're now

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:40.720
distributing in the Snap, all of that licensing and copyright is all above board. They're

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:45.800
very thorough on this, the experience we've had dealing with all of these, all of these

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:51.240
organizations, proprietary or open, when they publish their snaps from sort of big vendors,

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.000
they take that stuff very seriously.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.480
Yeah. As they probably should. And I would imagine it's going to be a process for quite

01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.360
a while and then they'll, you know, it'll probably get a little bit smoother. You know,

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.240
they'll round out the rough edges as time goes on and it'll get faster and faster.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:17.040
Yeah, let's hope so.
